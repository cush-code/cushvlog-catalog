I love you and I see this will end and I see it depends. I'm finally cutting through this age of love haze of love for days and days of love stick shifts and safety belts. Bucket seats have all got to go when we're driving in the car. It makes my baby seem so far. I need you here with me not way over in a bucket seat. I need you to be here with me not way over in a bucket seat when we're driving in my malibu. It's easy to get right next to you. I see baby scoot over please and then she's right there next to me. I need you here with me not way over in a bucket seat. I need you to be here with me not way over in a bucket seat. Ah howdy folks oh baby little cake for you today. Slice of cake little slab the old cake I can't. I can't tonight. I love it good band my my favorite guys so today.

Let's just start off by saying obviously hands off. Cuba come on not even a contest this is one of the easiest tests that there could be this is like a basic. This is like the ideological equivalent of the questions. They ask you to make sure you haven't had a concussion that is the level of difficulty. That cuba is especially this context where you are seeing some sort of demonstrations in cuba. The basis of which we have no idea. The pro come from that are even in the words of the running dog capitalist press issues of scarcity of vaccines and and food and supplies. The thing you're supposed to put post on. Instagram is cuba. We are being starved and the answer to the the remainder of that sentence is we are being starved by the united states of america. Like all of these most keening issues that are supposed to be generating.

This demonstration are against not the cuban regime but the actual cause of the direct cause this is not one where you get to act like oh. We're gonna throw some fairy dust in the air and say oh you can't accuse the cia of everything oh you know just because somebody's part of the global you know economy that uses the us dollar and you know their their Their ability to actually exercise democratic governments is compromised. That's that's too abstract. You can blame anything that way. This is a direct economic intervention something that is an act of war in the form of the embargo which means no trade between cuba and its largest natural trading partner but also no trade with any company that wants to trade in the united states that is suffocating and even in those conditions. Even in those conditions.

Cuba is able to maintain a a basic level of social provision that is light years away from what is experienced by other countries in the region that are governed by our allies and that are democratic and part of the system and obeying the rule of law and having multiple parties and all that. And cuba is able to do that even though being strangled have been for 60 years and this is not even something that has to be adjudicated in the the cumbersome mechanisms of of congress. This is something that a president could unilaterally change. Obama was to his credit moving in that direction of course. You could argue that obama's move towards cuba was like his move towards iran. It was an attempt by a strain within the capitalist ruling elite to prolong american power by the application of the market. Like we have these places these nodes of resistance. They can be undermined by integration and that's what they tried to do and that was what the the lifting of sanctions in under obama was about doing. It was about introducing capitalism into cuba as a plague bacillus but it had a narrow short-term effect of actually helping cuba you know breathe a little bit.

But this could be something that could be removed. This this stranglehold could be removed and then the starvation and the privation that is generating this discontent would actually be addressed. It would actually be addressed of course the deal that the united states is making is look. We will stop strangling you and allow you to get access to all. These nice vaccines and all this nice trade but only if you overthrow a revolutionary government and replace it with the capitalist algorithm unless you pull out the software and replace it with the market. That is the deal that's always been the deal that was the deal under obama.

It was like lure moore flies with honey type situation but the same goal to destroy any organized social opposition that has the ability to express himself itself in something as you know meaningful as a state and cuba has punched so far above its weight internationally cuba cuban foreign policy and cuban yes cuban foreign policy is more responsible directly responsible for the end of apartheid in south africa and the end of of like late colonialism. You know the last vestiges of it. Like from the portuguese. Was the direct result of an independent castro foreign policy of military aid to marxist revolutionary formations specifically in angola where where russia where um where the angolan marxists fought with the the regular cuban military and some russian advisers a months-long standing battle with the the puppet angolan rebels and the south african military which until that point had been undefeated in conflicts with with native african military. Units of any kind and they fought him to a sand still and it was sort of the end of the line and it was when the smarter boars started to realize that they needed to negotiate an exit from the thing and that was because castro pushed back and was able to organize a military force that was literally fighting an ideological war. It was not participating in a resource grasp on behalf of imperialism that part of power cannot allow to be persist persist and right now there's. It's more soft power thanks to the cuban investment in medica medicine and medical knowledge in the form of doctors who they send all over the world which is a source of revenue for the state and also is a soft power projection.

No good they gotta go and the difference between trump and obama on it is a difference of tactics. It's a difference of what can we what policy do. We pursue and biden looks like he's going to just take the easy road out and keep the brick on the accelerator because hey maybe this is maybe. Maybe coronavirus is the last straw because they've been holding it together. God love them but it's been in the face of real difficulty and persis sustained economic. Pain at the heart of the system like poverty that has not been eradicated and that undermines the regime it has to. It makes it more brittle and less democratic by definition but that still means that it is a progressive force in the world that has to be totally defended because if we did take our boot off of the neck cuba would boot off the neck if we stopped doing undeclared warfare on cuba and since that's the only course of action that matters is get rid of the sanctions. The only thing that's in the american power to do and the imperative morally because it's the actual direct cause of the suffering like if you want to be a bleeding heart and say the thing that matters is what will stop suffering then. The answer is simple this ending. The sanctions will stop the suffering because that's the direct cause it's like once again.

This is an easy test to pass. It is the lowest difficulty level and yet people are cuban government. You don't need to know anything and by the way you can't know anything what are you you're looking through the picture of some people marching somewhere and you think you know where it is. We are way past wag the dog territory. This is a totally synthetic reality. You're viewing through the yourself over by deciding that you have to have a morally correct. Interpretation of the cuban government is because you are too agitated on the on the question of politics and two in need to justify yourself because you're disengaged because you're not doing politics in your life. You're doing it in this fantasy firmament and that means you have to convince yourself that it matters what your opinion is of the cuban government. It does not matter in any sense anyone's opinion. Their discreet opinion on cuba is it does not there's nothing you can do with that information that can mean anything anywhere. Meanwhile there are things you might be able to do about the embargo like organize around it politically turn it into an issue that you connect to other issues to build inner solidarity and notions of like You know actions on behalf of wait.

The way that like the scottish dock workers wouldn't unload they wouldn't unload chilean wine after pinochet over through allende. There's something you can do even if it is like you know liberal ngoist um activism. You could still maybe get something done because this is an option. This is just the us doing what it's doing because nothing is stopping it you could change the equation for power to be like alright fine. Let them up we know during obama that there was a crack a crack.

There give you know just give them some room to breathe yes of course. Now they're going to have to deal with the fact that with that will definitely come an increased marketization of their economy but maybe the cuban state by persisting for all. Those years is going to be able to actually manage it and not be overwhelmed by it. The way that say that the chinese state was we don't know but we have to see and if we want to see we can do one thing like I said and the embargo having opinions about the the The objective merit of the cuban government. Whether it needs reforms or not is is an opinion that will do you no good in a literal sense.

There's nothing for you to do with that opinion except have it and then bat it around like a kitten in an enclosure trying to keep themselves from going insane with boredom. And that is why this is the kind of question that captivates certain people on here why they decide that it becomes a litmus test and the hill they're going to die on. I'm not going to name names because I don't want to give fuel to these malign actors. But it's because for these people for a certain number of people who comprise the online left and its media sphere and the the specific audience that they appeal to you're not talking about some generalized group. A cross section you're not generalizing about a cross section of people online expressing leftist opinions who might do something about them if they thought there was something they could do. This is a subsection of people and I would define this group of people. The people who obsess about stuff like how how much I should condemn this regime are people who are coming to left politics as it is merging with culture from the culture side of the equation from the culture end. I think that the the ques the the culture of the online left which has now become inextricably linked to popular culture to the mainstream.

Conception of popular culture is creating the what we think of. As the online left that what is expressed in its media so some of them the ones who make the most the most like salient media creations like the people who do podcasts the people who post the most. The people who post other people read the most motivated. Those people are coming at this fusion of culture and politics from politics. They are thinking of themselves as political subjects who also engage in popular culture and popular media mainstream style and are pumping their investment. Their their investing their time spent in popular culture with their politics because they're feeling an excess of political feeling and they feel like they should be doing something politically because of how much they're agitated by the state of things and how much they want to change things and so they put that when they when they write about popular culture and then when they write popular culture by becoming the people who staff shows and write scripts that get made into movies and the people who make the conversation of the day and form what is like the correct opinions to have are doing so out of this agitation. This political agitation that is driving them to make their consumption and production of culture more politically mo defined and this is as the The rituals of politics become entirely spectacle-based. So everybody is just doing this as a spectacle. We are all fully invested in this thing called politics as at a level of spectacle. So the people who are making the left are being agitated to politics to culture from politics but a summit big chunk of the people who make up the audience for this stuff and now the producers of it. They aren't coming at it. From that perspective are people who would otherwise be either a political or right wing who are fully invested in popular culture and the consumption of it as part of their identity. The way that these politics people think of themselves as political these people think of themselves as consumers of this palette of this culture. Like the the the the busy bees people. Like me we are coming at culture from politics as stymied political subjects.

These people who watch some of this stuff and are now making it come at this convergence. As people who want to consume culture they want to watch marvel movies. They want to play video games. They want to watch this and when they want us feel like they're smart they want to watch prestige tv shows they want to live in the clubhouse. They don't want to grow up. They want to be toys r us kids because of course who wouldn't. It is a in my opinion and more rational in many ways decision to be like that than to fantasize that you have some sort of political subjectivity and then try to act from it through your cultural consumption. But what the the problem with being that is that you're being led into politics. You are forced to become a political subject because the people around you consuming and making polit. Culture are more and more obsessed with politics and you have to fit in that somewhere now that is where you get the entire social base of like the disaggregated downwardly mobile white male internet user. That's where you get the right wing ones. People who just want to do pop they just want to consume culture as identity. They don't care about politics but eventually they have to and that becomes that reactionary process becomes. The formation of this defined alternative to a counterculture defied by this new mainstream of culture but not everybody is going to be relate to that rejection. They're going to accept it. It's either because they're white males who have been acculturated to have certain values or because they're not white males and therefore they're alienated from that and therefore they find something comforting in the validation of an increasingly accepting and multicultural mainstream. They find it more they find it more enticing than alienating whereas the future gripers find it more alienating than enticing and then there are the white males within it who are able to say well. I'm one of the good ones. So I get to be in the good part with the good people and those people who are coming at that from culture.

They don't want politics to mean anything. They want to turn politics into another thing that they consume as a spectator. Like the video games they play like the movies they watch like and that argue about hey. I want to be on the internet always all the time arguing about something. I would rather it be video games and movies. But since it has to be politics then I'm going to pick a side and and I'm going to watch it try to own somebody else and that is where the debate culture of online leftism comes from is we need a spectacle to make out of this because that's all we really care about but because they're consumers of left content because they have to be if they want to be on the right side of it if they want to be enjoyers of the mainstream because they want to see the big stuff. They want to enjoy earnestly the major productions. The huge capital infused spectacles the high calorie high density of nutrient that makes up their cultural diet like blockbuster movies and entertainment. They want to be able to agree with it and root for it and love it not define themselves by how much they hate it and so that means they always have to find a way whereby the the more and more imposed political correctness. They have to find more and more ways to keep it interesting for themselves because they don't really care they're not anxious the way that the producers of this stuff are they just want to party they just want to grill they want to watch their stories and if their stories have to be politics they wanted to be a guy who looks like them.

Telling them that all they have to do is root for the democratic party and then spend their times deciding to have what the right opinions are on things which is just like watching a tv show and then commenting with other people and deciding how good it is or not which is everything else that is their political their cultural consumption and what is they it is what they want out of their cultural consumption and they're going to turn politics into that production. Because they want it. They will create a market for it and someone will fill that gap and now that gap is being filled and so when something happens like demonstrations in cuba you get to have a week-long argument about how and much you should support the cuban government what the exact balance of opinions you should have how much because you're imagining that you're in an argument with somebody and that there is some sort of judge there to tell you who's right or wrong and that you're going to get a good grade and a shiny apple you're going to be rewarded by your super ego. You're going to get a little boost from your superego for denying yourself and that really is determining. I think the that's determined like this new fascinating online culture around debate and around hypothetical situations and and these free-floating questions of like responsibility that have nothing to do with anyone's lived experience that can't relate to anyone's lived experience that are designed to keep you occupied about something else because you're not actually a politically engaged subject. You just think you are you are still a full consumer and what you're consuming is a debate that is the same as your shows and is the same as your video games and the existence of this. These people you they're just the mirror image of people who have turned online politics into a place for them to exercise their guilt that's the other side of the coin.

These are the producers because they're the more anxious the more politically identified ones but they're still operating out of a desire to consume a spectacle and gain enjoyment of it from one end or the other of either indulgence or the pleasure of self-denial neo-puritan or I guess high anglican like the the earthy land the earthy sensual rule of the feudal landowner or the flesh-scouring puritan abstainiousness of the of the capitalist of the of the urban bourgeois in his counting house reading his bible over and over again trying to convince himself that god is real by scaring himself because he's been disconnected from any felt conception of of faith. I would say that with the amish lack to truly be like a effective like counterweight like like a behavioral norm to adopt is that you you need. It needs to be more frankly evangelical in the sense that it needs to be. It needs to be a recruiting faith it can't be a sort of a turned inward thing because that's just neo4j ism. That's just you're back to the overnight model and like that's. It's it's it can't sustain itself oh I didn't want to forget. I'm glad. I almost forgot this so we're going to start black jacket on wednesday first three chapters of black jacob. The first three chapters of black jacobin will be discussed on wednesday. Three chapters one through three of blackjack not very long if it moves. It's very very very easy to read book.

It's absolutely the sentences just pull you in with that. But it's suffice to say that the fact that this this online leftism that people are part of is fully invested with the the logic of the logic of capitalism and like at a base level every incentive of everyone participating in what we think of as the online left is doing so is being being pushed along by being motivated by by capitalist imperatives not because anyone is choosing that but because that's the only those are the only signals that get priced that get noticed like if it's if if the extent of our political subjectivity is engaging in a public conversation in a social media space where we are the product being made where we are both the performer of culture and the producer and consumer of it. At the same time oh boy. I completely lost my train of thought but that's fine it happens. Sometimes somebody can remind me what I was saying that'd be helpful but I don't know all right. That's that um that we are coming to to do this job of consuming and producing our our personalities online because and the only way we can succeed at it is to is to try to make it entertaining keeping our eyes on it like we're building our political identity to the degree that we're spending time on this app on these apps listening to these things having these conversations like we're building a thing out of our desire but not our desire to do our desire to avoid doing and that's not our fault because everything is hopeless.

Everything truly is in an objective sense hopeless but we are still here and still have to live and within capitalist structures. Counter counter hegemonic concentrations emerge they really do but we're not there yet. I think the bernie campaign proved that conclusively we have not given birth to the structures that can generate their own incentives that are outside of the capitalist selfish one because right. Now. That is what we're all operating out of and everybody to some extent is trying to be at a certain level like what the most indulgent debate guys want people to be which is fully invested in politics as a place to gain emotional catharsis through identity formation and the way that you lose yourself in a narrative. The way that you get to the same way you get to pretend to be one of the avengers and invest yourself in in the in the story arc of captain america you get to invest yourself in the battles between the. Different youtubers and they're different and and every time they come together to fight. It's like the third act of a marvel movie and then and in that realm where you are don't have any emotional connection to to these concepts where you don't have any commitment to them beyond them as a spectacle.

 you all questions become academic because all you're doing is is picking who is who is right by who is smartest just imposing a a ideological meritocracy. I am not conservative because I'm smarter than them and here's the proof that I'm able to out argue them. Even though these arguments aren't purely meaningless rituals where you just pick a you p you you pick a side and invest yourself in it with the surety of of like belief but obscured by your conf your absolute faith in empirical reality and of course.

This is where I have to once again come back to the supreme anxiety. I feel as someone who is still is part of this same structure like how do I justify myself within this structure in a way that is not purely self-interested in a way that does not privilege my personal my personal narrow self-interest over a greater interest that I could be serving and I don't know you can't see the back your own head you got to take some faith that you're that something feels right it. It gets to that level and when we all govern ourselves that way and and we just ignore it because it's the implications are too scary if we really accepted the fact that the final decision making that we have is not done rationally or logically or consciously that what the final the determiner is is outside of our senses is felt in the stomach. We would maybe stop to figure what generates that feeling and instead of just believing that we've talked ourselves to an act because I don't think we ever talk ourselves to an act because it's a certain point. Our our logic becomes so abstract that it loses our ability to discern it the way that there is a distance between the end of a nerve and where it's and where it has where it's processed in the brain and that that time that that delay creates a spot in between.

The two set. The two points where it's lost where where discrete like levels of intensity of perception kick over into an into a greater perception which is what consciousness is when it arises out as as an emergent property from sense perception but that creates a black hole. I said this in a previous blog. There's a black hole where the in one end goes unperceived stimuli and at the other end comes our words for it our visual conception of it in our head our symbolic representation of it in our head. What comes flying out of that is not. There is such no chain of evidence between those two points because of the the because of that lacuna that we talk about and that is the root of free will because at a certain level.

Our consciousness is guessing at what reality is every second. It's making a guess about what the real world is and the degree to which it understands the world around it. It affirms to its sense body senses. It affirms to what its body is being told by the world around it but every moment it's flying out of this hole as that we're being shaken and banged around like. Like socks and a dryer we're just banging around the world guessing in every moment what the world is around us filling in the gaps created by our minds and we're guessing together and all of our communication is an attempt to guess together what the world actually is but we're guessing and we're banging against it and we're creating. These things called consciousnesses and these illusions of a self-perpetuating identity that pilots us through a reality that is not real that is at an angle that is orthogonal to the real world to the real world of determined conditions and so while that we are determined over time in an arc in general patterns of entropy and and and you know physical reactions cause and effect. We're all being piloted by these demons. These ghosts of consciousness that are guessing at what the world is and that means they're pressing against the determining structures and that's the and it is then that space that little pocket of air that all human consciousness emerges from and the world. As is the world that we all experience individually incorrectly can't be. It could be experienced collectively and that is what that is the drive for the world spirit that is the world spirit coming into awareness of itself. That is the whole process of the human mind dealing with the condition of consciousness in a physical world and trying to make sense of the world through the scheme through that that veil of ignorance that we have about our own condition and so everybody is getting the wrong thing so we keep banging around and making the thing more and more out of shape.

But if we're all experiencing it simultaneously. If we are all living in the same imagined world. It is there at that point symmetrical with the universe you have locked it back into being and that is of course the you know. That is that is the moment of of total transformation that of course none of us will see. It's important to note that this I guess you could theoretically argue that like since if if everything that could happen has happened somewhere if you take that principle then somewhere somehow at some point that happened where we achieved a final species-wide communion with the galaxy in the universe but that doesn't mean that the world we're living in is going to end that way in fact violet very very very unlikely to be the case. Very very very unlikely to be the case and say that human civilization winks out all the other galactic civilizations that might exist all flare up go out there's never is like a a moment of of of species being of species awareness and transcendence. We all just go we all just eventually die out the the the mach the robots run out of battery The earth loses its ability to sustain us we just cough it up now all and all subsequent life on earth also fails to cohere that way. All other consciousness emerges break up under ecological strain and then the sun expands incinerates earth and the whole thing is over wiped from the galaxy.

Anyway say that happens in this universe. At the end of this universe all matter will have been expended right you'll reach a point of absolute. Absolute static moment right like all entropy has been extinguished in the system right. So all all matter energy has been unwound. Matter is no longer extant. That condition is the condition of the big bang so you don't get a big crunch and you don't get a steady state. You get another eruption you get another big bang. Now is that big bang going to create the exact same universe that just extinguished itself. I don't think so because I think that's the same gap that we live in so that means that the next one is going to be different.

Maybe when roland finds himself crossing the desert to follow the man in black. He looks down and he has the horn of eld. This time you know what I mean and so our that means that our moral imperative in life. The one that will keep us in harmony with ourselves and the world around us is in seeking to build a world that leaves a trace that can be found elsewhere in the galaxy where where we can build experiences not just institutions and and structures but experiences that imprint themselves in the galaxy in our. In the the the the ricochet of of atoms imprint that psychically on the world and people have done that throughout history like history is this cycle towards oblivion and annihilation and misery. But then there are these counterpoints that are the human soul screaming out against that and that's us dragging the world in a direction but we could it's just an echo through history that can accumulate or that can be crushed. But we all it is our harmony with the world is our ability to leave that impression because then one day maybe the thing starts off again and the conditions are changed.

A little bit and the chess board is different and remember. This is happening infinitely because there's nothing else to happen. Eventually the lines are going to line up the right way. Eventually all of the the breaks that we need happen and if that has happened if that moment has happened somewhere then it is happening everywhere always because it's what's sustaining consciousness because the universe is just is a consciousness forgive me. This got very very like dorm room. I'm sorry if it sounds too too either incoherent or pretentious or like hippie. But I feel like it's I feel like it's truth. It feels true when I say it which is the the most fun. I have in my life is saying something that feels true somebody asked for the marxist interpretation of world war. One. I would say I mean you can say that's marxist or not I i think of myself in those terms but also I really do not see it as a marxism as a doctrine. I see it as a heuristic. It's like a way of thinking about things so some people would say that means it doesn't count because they want to really get committed to the you know to the branding or whatever or the identity of one.

I don't really care if I'm called that or not but I'd say that world war one is the beginning of the final at the beginning of the end of the process whereby the the land bound classes of pre-capitalist. Europe resisted the rise and domination of the merchant. Ruling class. I'd say if that that that process begins I would say in earnest in the 17th century. With the 80 years you are in the netherlands with the english civil war and then concomitant to that the 30 years war all culminating in the west failure treaty. It starts there and it goes through the world wars both starting in world war one with the final defeat of the landed ruling class and the land-based peasantry everybody has been uprooted and turned into either a capitalist or a a seller of labor.

This is the process that marx talked about at length. Capitalism takes the old orders which were land-based that were based with relation to specific real land and there was there were hierarchies of rule that were affirmed by that relationship and those were cultural and very much importantly religious but also um just but but also structural in the in the forms of like systems of governance and legal structures like common law in the uk that end up becoming permanent features of capitalism and in the in the conditions after the black death and the the scrambling of feudalism that happened this the breaking up of feudalism's fatal. Stalemate because feudalism was stuck in a stalemate at the extinguishment of its viability when the malthusian shock of of the black death sort of scrambled abort. Now it did not mean that cudalism went away overnight. Somebody said that I said that I did not mean that if that's what I said what I meant was is that it changed. It shook up the conditions under which feudalism existed namely way more land for way fewer people with labor commanding a much higher price because of that and that the condition and that that destabilizing change of conditions under which feudalism had been relatively stable. Meant that the class dynamic shifted and you saw the breakup of these structures that gave dominance to rural ways of being. Because of course. The peasants there were things they hated about being peasants but they would all of them the vast majority of this and them and this is true everywhere capitalism emerges peasants. Everywhere would rather be peasants than proletarians. They would rather work the land than work for somebody else. That is a universal preference you don't have to. This is another easy. One people would rather work the land than be proletarians.

Now you can look back at the the arise of history and art or the rise of capitalism say but you see those peasants they ended up. Their kids had higher standards of living and their kids had more sophisticated existences and and their kids got to ride around in motor cars and like yeah but they didn't and it wasn't their kids. Usually it was like their grandkids and they had to suffer for that and who would want to do that especially since they're not they're not imagining depriving their kids of that. They can't even conceive of that they're imagined keeping their kid in the condition of stability and and relative You know security and and self-sufficiency that they had on the land. They're not comparing it to some future where they have access to the markets because that's not real to them.

It comes later and then they get to look around and say well you know what this is better than my dad had it because they're consuming. More and consumption replaces autonomous like our idea of what our best interest is becomes our consumption patterns and and the question of how good how much we validate the regime we live under is how much it allows us to consume because that is what we got that's what they fed us. Now that's how things start once. Capitalism gets a bite in though things change and then you see. This mass move of people to the cities now of course and that is to participate in the thing that got built there. This new this new world that is is less that is more advanced than rural life that doesn't have the idiocy of rural life but now they're comparing it to something that's not true of the early the early peasants and the ruling lords of the land.

They didn't want a seed powered a bunch of cities but they had to to pursue the contest over power between the medium-sized states of europe and the wars between states that start with either within states in in between within states like habsburg. The habsburg low country which is a section a a regional revolt against the spanish crown and then the civil war in spain or in england and then later on the continent between states in and within the holy roman empire you have these things. These th things that are essentially three civil wars that go throughout europe the civil war. Within the habsburg lands the civil war within the civil war. Within the habsburg lands both the lowlands and the holy roman empire and then off the continent in england and those wars are the ruling classes the landed classes fighting each other and in so doing building up the forces of capital that will eventually suborn them completely not just in terms of structures of debt but culturally things like protestantism which undermines foundations that were central to the preparation of landed power and all these capitalist innovations that the landed powers who technically still ruled where they did. All of these account.

Accommodations to the market undermined their power in the long term and they knew that but they needed to use them to fight their wars against each other in the short term because these were independent capitalisms emerging along these national these national identity groups. These national groupings that formed later into secular nation states after the after west failure treaty so if you have capitalism emerging as the dominant mode of political economy in in western europe where it is able to massively concentrate capital and intensify industrial production and and create a more and more refined civilization because of its ability to exploit undeveloped regions and do hyperexploitation there to to allow for mega consumption in the metropole that that dynamic will eventually be interrupted by some sort of crisis of inputs and that's what happens when european. European capitalism hits its first big system-wide european capitalism.

Its first system-wide crisis that then necessitates as it always does economic crisis necessitates conflict over resources among the nation-states of europe which used to be religious but are now civically national but the same thing the only thing that matters is. It'll get guys to get march out and kill each other over it. That's all that matters so that means it's the same type of state with the same sort of structures and it responds to capitalist crisis the same way by everybody killing each other and at every level. It is first the ruling class and then the peasants rebelling against the impositions of capitalism but of course not coordinated with each other and in fact opposed to one another which is why they are both defeated in turn and you have a situation where the old ruling class is stripped of their formal of their actual power. They are bought out essentially into Some variety of um of gentlemanly retirement and the crowned heads of euro of northern europe are the perfect. Example of this where capitalism was first introduced where the ruling class allowed it to dominate.

Earliest is where was most quickly developed a mechanism to slowly extinguish the power of the old land-based aristocracy without provoking them to rebellion and this and that took a few it took the cutting off of the head of a king. It took the lord protectorate of cromwell. It took the reimbu it took the crowning of william and mary It took the jacobite rebellion but eventually formal power of the landed aristocracy was converted into capital. They got bought off from power with money. Some of them became powerful because they invested well.

Some of them spend themselves into dissolution but one way or another. They were bought off from defeating the bourgeois and now are just a part of it one part of it one part of the new ruling owning class the ones who won some of them. They're they're descendants of nobles among our poorest classes. Now people who up who fumbled the bag and fell out of favor and now they're on the bottom so for the descendants of the people who made that deal it was a bad deal but at the time it looked good because they could imagine a future where things were better off which is the exact opposite dynamic that exists with the peasants who can only see things getting worse and so they have to be brought along with the stick bludgeoned into submission which they are over the course of the from the enclosures to the suppression of the peasants revolt in germany and then to the the socialist movement. The socialist movement that becomes the first coherent class-based counter hedge hegemony capable of confronting capitalism and it's like oh my god. This is a this is something that can actually resist the working class. The ruling class will just be bought off. Over time.

The peasants will be broken up and defeated because of their inability to organize among themselves. But then the leftovers of those peasantry will then be able to organize as workers and that emerged and it provided a flight flame of tension and and it is in the context of the rising working class that the the happiness with which the rulers of europe went to war in the in 1914 shows how it contributed to this dynamic of constant eventual punctuated equilibrium of violence where you have these flare-ups and of course. The french revolution is is key to that it is the continental sparking of this engine. It is the it is the it is the overthrow of the french land-based rule by the french bourgeois eventually in the in the personification of napoleon bonaparte and then you have 1848 coming from that where finally now workers are able to organize themselves but only incipiently and then by the late 1800s you have a condition where oh you have a coordinated working class.

In these countries they are milit. They are organizing along their own axis in what is the new version of a peasants war but not run by peasants done by workers who have a greater capacity for self-organization who have a greater for cassidy for coordinated activity and from and all of it generated by class consciousness which they their peasant forbearers were incapable of producing and that conflict comes to a head that drive between colonial superpowers who are in conflict over resources to sustain their internal battle with one another. While also fighting their internal working class. It led them to destroy themselves in a fit of suicidal violence and then emerge from that the rise.

After this war of the enraged bourgeois and what you see in the 20s and 30s is the rise in the vanquished countries or the main vanquish country of germany and then the sort of johnny come. Lately they didn't get any of the glory italy. This working class reaction or I'm sorry. This this small bourgeois revolt against the large bourgeois. So over the course of the 19th century the the the landowners are defeated by the bourgeois the combined bourgeois but then after the destruction of the civil war or the destruction of the of the capitalist civil war of europe that happens it ends. In 1918. The crown heads are destroyed but the working class is not sufficiently organized to to contest for power in europe and instead. The small bourgeois take the power and that is where fascism emerges. Fascism emerges as the enthralled and enthroned and traumatized small bourgeois of europe trying to defend themselves against their own subsumption into the master slave owner employee dynamic that is the fundamental endpoint of capitalism and then the end of that war is the final extinguishment of the contest in europe anyway.

The final contest ends in 1991 when the soviet union breaks up but the the creation of the eu and the nato and the un and and the international monetary fund and the bretton woods system and the dollar and the marshall plan and meant that political subjectivity had been seeded from the europeans they had been bought off. Essentially you guys play together in your fake economy. Here you guys can pay each other money for jobs but you're not the masters of your soul anymore you're not in charge of anything because if you use those your nation states as nation states in this contest for resources you're gonna destroy each other but the good news is you don't have to worry about fighting for resources because we're going to subsidize you us. The united states the ones who was the people who were able to because we were off cast from your conflicts. We're able to synthesize our the social order with capitalism and the geography that we found here and turn it into a new headquarters for global capitalism but that was all predicated on the super profits of empire which are now being more evenly distributed to maintain the structure which means that at the center the treats are running out and the thing that bought us everybody off is is the things that bought everybody off are no longer holding sway even if you're still enjoying the pleasures of your sweet treat life. You can't imagine a better future for your kids and so therefore they don't taste so good and so we have this now american-led bourgeois revolt. But political subjectivity was killed in europe. So now it's all spectacle. Now. It's all just a fun fun house a game. We can enjoy root for one side or another well. Both of us are annihilated by the machinery that is operating underneath all of this unchallenged okay.

I hope this made sense. This was a wacky one. I hope. I hope. I don't sound too out. There man. I don't want to feel like. I'm too wavy gravying it but anyway signing off. Next. I'm sorry wednesday. First three chapters of blackjack events bye-bye.
