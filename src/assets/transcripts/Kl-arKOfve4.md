Foreign hi my mouth is right toxic right here come for the second 40 fry height hi Thursday today because I won't be able to do it tomorrow. So I figured I had some time I'll sneak one in honestly mostly because I'm just addicted to opening these Desert Storm trading cards. It really is the gift that keeps on giving just a flashback to the birth of the of the world that we're all gonna live in as long as we're out well that's not true certainly not as long as we're around you know because we never go anywhere matter after all can neither be created nor destroyed. We're all ah Eternal in that respect because you know there's no outside of the of the the universe and we spin around in that ether and get brought together in forms that regard ourselves and each other and that experience then becomes. This Collective suspended Eternal moment that we just Branch off of before returning to uh but certainly this version of ourselves. The ones that we have erroneously identified as you know our identity. The one that we say this is me even though now it's a very. It's a very very transient temporary uh performance of an eternal self but anyway 1991 the year that uh the year Skynet became self-aware so let's just start right away.

Uh we got the ace. This is military asset Warburg the A7 Corsair. The A7 Corsair looks pretty cool once again. Not a great shot uh just the underside of the of the airplane no real perspective. The uh as I said before the art. In these is pretty bad uh the A7 Corsair Warburg first flew out in 1965. The A7 is being phased out after long service in both the U.S Air Force and the U.S Navy. The modern version can carry more than 115 000 pounds of armament and has a reputation for delivering the weapons uh its weapons. On target for Operation Desert Storm. 20 a7s were deployed in the Persian Gulf. So this guy they probably don't have these anymore if they were phasing it out in 91 to replace with something that cost 10 times as much and was a third to a fourth as effective.

That's How uh progress is gone quote. Unquote progress has gone in military technology since the Gulf War. Uh they've just dumped more and more money into it and without it having to actually be effective because you know we're not at War. We're not in a cold war with the Soviets anymore. We're just playing in a big sandbox. At least that was what they were thinking uh. We can just uh dick around and that's what they did they. Around and now we have planes that cannot fly in the rain because their paint will melt off uh planes that will decapitate Pilots and new generations that are of of uh of military equipment that are supposed to supersede something that there is no competitor for like one of the big services that Michael Bay has done to the US military is to feature uh things like the F-22 in movies like Transformers uh to show people. Hey. This is the cool material we have and this is what your tax dollars are going towards without. You know highlighting the fact that this is literally the only time that could ever happen is if there were alien robots showing up and do you think that that's likely anyway I'm sure that we have replaced the A7 Corsair with something much shittier.

They're getting rid of the A-10 Warthog which is like the the uh War Horse of close air support aircraft with his big  Central Gatling gun mwah uh they're getting rid of it because there's uh money to be made. Now. We've got another military asset a fighting ship the USS Ranger. The USS Ranger look at that guy the USS Ranger uh commissioned in 1957. The USS Ranger was the first ship designed exclusively as an aircraft carrier of the forestall class. She is larger than her sister carrier in the Persian Gulf Midway by more than 10 000 tons. The ranger ordered to the Persian Gulf in November 1990 carries an assortment of 85 aircraft HomePort of course San Diego California an armed military encampment that calls itself a city oh yeah. The Osprey has killed more American Service members than like every almost all of our uh declared enemies. Since Vietnam you know until the war on terror like the Granada uh Panama. You know those guys that we kick their asses. Uh they collectively I mean of course you know the exception being the uh the Lebanese who really did nacha a pretty big W there in Beirut but other than that the Osprey killed more people than those guys.

Uh uh displacement 79 200 tons full load length 100 uh 1039 feet speed 33 knots which is approximately 38 miles per hour. Apparently uh aircraft 85 crew 6289 damn that's bigger than many a lot of towns in this country just think about that we've got Personnel. We've got firefighters. This is a guy in a uh Plexiglas sort of future spacesuit. He's got a big water hose putting out fires firefighters in the armed forces contend with hazards quite different from those with most civilian and firemen deal. One significant reason is that fuels and chemicals used in today's military vehicles and aircraft are often hazardous materials requiring special training and procedures firefighters in all situations strive to deny the fire fuel oxygen or heat to interrupt the chemical Chain Reaction. Deprivation of one of these elements will cause the fire to go out okay in case you didn't know how putting out a firework thank you for that.


Here we go geography South Korea we're getting a shout out to another member of the coalition you signed off. On this war. You get a card Korea with a recorded history of more than 2 000 years was divided into North and South in July 1945. Nice passive voice who is it divided by after that might not be passive voice but you know what I mean after North Korea invaded South Korea. In June 1950. The United Nations invoked military action to be led by the United States truce for the Korean war was signed in 1953. South Korea is not a member of the United Nations is that still true the South South Korea's got to be in the U.N now right. There was a South Korean un's uh General Secretary recently for operation. Uh Desert Storm South Korea sent Supply planes and Pilots geographic area 38 025 square miles yeah. It is so when did it get out of when was it not in the U.N it was admitted in 91 okay interesting. So at this point it wasn't uh uh population 43.9 million language Korean predominant religions Buddhism Confucianism and Christianity I'm not rare among uh Asian countries and not coincidentally because it's also where uh U.S occupation uh had the most cultural impact Capital Seoul government type Republic head of government prime minister Kang young noon Hoon one way or another probably dead all right.

We've got Germany reunited and it feels so good that's right Germany she's back to her old tricks. This is I believe the the thing on the card here is I think this is Mad King. Ludwig's Bavarian Castle is that what this is the one that he spent uh you know 25 years building and destroyed his fortune uh. So we got the Federal Republic of Germany at midnight on October 3rd. Not 1990 Germany was reunited after 45 years of division. The end of World War II Germany was divided into two parts East and West. In 1973 each was admitted to the United Nations. On September 15 1990 Germany promised to contribute a two two billion dollars. Aid package to the gulf effort uh as was the case with other nations Germany companies of course sold weapons and War materials to Iraq before August 2nd 1990. Dan uh spilling some tea here in these cards reminding people that oh yeah these guys were arming Saddam I wonder if they talk about how we arm Saddam in any of these cars geographic area. 137 600 square miles population 77.5 million language German predominant religions Roman Catholicism protestantism Capital Berlin government type Democratic Republic head of government good old Chancellor Helmut Cole. He was a big fat party animal. He would hang out with Bill Clinton. They'd Eat Giant knockwursts uh I think it is.

I think there's a strong argument to be made that Germany should have been uh broken up after World War One and then not allowed to reunite certainly uh after World War II. Like that's a no-brainer. But they probably should have said look if we don't want Germany to interfere with uh you know the establishment of an anglo-led uh International economic system which is what we're doing we are building an anglo-american World system for the 20th century. If we are serious about preventing Germany as a uh subgroup of humanity. The German people people who speak German and occupy that geographic area if we uh are serious about preventing them from grabbing at the reins. Then they just can't be allowed to be one country. They're just too powerful and so they probably should have broke it up after uh World War.

One of course it would have tried to push itself back together again obviously but uh letting it reunite. After 1990 was I don't know probably a mistake. Uh you got another military asset here. The Mirage 2000 we talked about this one yeah. This is a  double. This sucks how am I getting doubles I I have the complete set.


Here they should be all different put Israel in Germany. Yes like there there was a this is this is true. There was a Naka style uh ethnic cleansing of East Prussia. Uh the Baltic Coast Area uh in what is now Poland after World War II uh and the difference is that those people were integrated back into German society when they were pushed. West not you know kept at refugee camps uh for the rest of their lives uh and so if they had uh settled some Jews there nobody would have said a word the Germans least of all because they're responsible oh good. This is a good one military skill teamwork. It Makes the Dream Work folks Marx's parents were from the Rhineland. On the other side of Germany. They were liberated his family were Jews whose family was liberated by the uh occupation of the French army during the Napoleonic War. So teamwork for every combat Soldier 10 people work in support these troops working as a team. Keep the Fighting Force supplied and formed and directed as in everyday life practicing Teamwork Makes every job easier whenever you can lend a hand.

I think that's something we can all agree with oh boy intelligence file Palestinians oh boy yikes. We've had Judaism and now we have Palestinians listen to the uh Larry David music play. Palestine is a region that now consists of Israel the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In 1967 hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled from their Homeland as a result of the arab-israeli war hmm. Today more than 25 2.5 million Palestinians live outside what was Palestine. Their dream is to return one day and to reclaim the land that Israel now officially claims or occupies thinking that Saddam Hussein might further their cause. Many Palestinians supported Iraq during Operation Desert Storm could they really be innocent is Israel really wrong to treat them that way if they're going to support Iraq during Operation Desert Storm a war so great we made a  uh collectors card set out of it that's a good War if you're making collector's cart sets for your War. It's a good one pretty axiomatic there so therefore Palestinians bad okay. Here. We go we're definitely in the second row of uh supporters for the war effort.

Here we got Sweden in geography Sweden. We got Sweden located on the Scandinavian peninsula in Northern Europe. Sweden has been occupied by basically the same ethnic people for approximately 5 000 years. Sweden gained independence from Denmark in 1523. For almost 200 years Sweden has maintained a position of armed neutrality. Sweden joined the United Nations in 1946 for Operation Desert Storm Sweden provided medical personnel. Oh isn't that nice send some Band-Aids. They also probably sent a lot of military hardware because the Dirty Little Secret of the Swedish political economy is that their big time arms exporter. Like that was how they contributed their uh percentage of uh. You know uh industry industry-based consumption which everybody had to do well. We built the post-war order they weren't like Norway which has that  ton of weapons sell them to everybody and here we got another country another very crucial. Ally in the war italyza da dude passed it twice just because she is so nice Angelina Angelina Pizzeria I eat soup in minestrone just to be with her alone Angelina Angelina.

The waitress at the pizzeria okay the Italian republic after a lengthy history as the seed of the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church. Modern Italy was United unified during the middle of the 19th century during the Renaissance Italy led the developments in Western culture. Since Italy was one of the aggressors during World War II. It was not permitted to join the United Nations until 1955. For Operation Desert Storm Italy supplied Naval units and Planes hey we give you some spaghetti too don't forget that huh ah hey what's the matter with you huh. It's very funny when you study World War II and you look at Mussolini and his insistence on making uh Italy once again the Roman Empire.


Uh you know accepting the mantle of colonial Conquest that was thrown down by that very anglo-american uh global economy that was being built right because the uh the the headquartering of world capitalism in in London and then Washington DC. It was predicated on those States command of resources not just at home but in their connected network of uh conquered and exploited lands uh like it's. All one project would you consider that the United States is just this tumor that grew off of the British Imperial State because there's just so much resources and so much land and such a motivation to emigrate that the the crisis racked. Uh British Society creates this new uh Colonial class that's capable of operating under its own for its own self-perceived interests which eventually come in a complex conflict with the greater Imperial interests of England which is why you have the Revolutionary War but at that point you know it's still England's ball. Like the the pound sterling is is of de facto Global Reserve currency. Throughout the 19th century I mean I've said this before but one of the big things that doomed reconstruction people you talk about how oh you know America is just too racist.

It could never have worked one of the big constraints had nothing to do with America's racial uh animus uh and and racism. It had to do with the fact that the US dollar was in a sense pegged to the British pound. Along with every other major economy that traded with England. You were honored a trade you traded in British Pounds. Otherwise the the transaction cost builds up and it becomes uh you lose your competitive advantage uh and so what now the the Republican party after the war didn't really have any interest in a loose money policy for their own reasons. Uh like they were ideologically and materially committed to hard money but that they were not the only Republicans. There were soft money Republicans who wanted to keep uh going because the U.S went off of the gold standard during the war to pay for the war to mobilize. They made these greenbacks unsecured by anything fiat currency and they were the the economy was flush with this money after the war and the question was what do we do with it and what they ended up doing with. It was taper it off but there were Republicans who said no this should be the new reality and one of the things pulling them away from that.

Not the only thing but a powerful force that led to the the eventual domination helped lead to the domination of the conservative faction of the Republicans is that uh if they had gone off the gold standard in effect they would have been much more vulnerable. Vis-a-vis the British in global trade that they would have they would have potentially undermined their economy like the danger of inflation would have been real. It would have required like a real conflict between the US and Britain uh on political grounds to resolve that but that's all based on their colonial Holdings The Matrix of power that they extract out of the earth literally and ex and then like pull through this network of trade relationships.

In the 20th century your country was going to uh be subordin into that structure under what conditions was that going to happen the countries of Italy and Germany. Late comers to the National pageant in Europe were too late to establish the sort of uh uh terrestrial Imperial Dominion that the anglosphere did France by that point had accepted that it would be a junior partner that it would be along for the ride in a sense. But Germany and then later and then Italy too uh insisted that they could have a a commit more commanding uh position Germany. It made sense you know they were the biggest together. They're the biggest most economically powerful Block in Europe. They it makes every it stands to reason that they would make a play for control for hegemony. Given that position it would be irrational of them to not try to seek that because they clearly have the capacity to assert it. But what they don't really realize is that those Colonial Holdings have given the anglo-american uh block a uh a crucial time advantage in building institutional uh. Uh capacity to carry out this control which means you can't take it from them.

That's what that means and they tried. They tried to snatch it and they got smacked back and with Germany as I said it makes sense Italy is funnier. Italy comes down to the delusions of uh the  Mussolini and his Cadre of Hangers On uh who in the context of like a Italian state that had barely been brought into existence that was still just this fledgling structure uh with with very weak. Uh uh legitimacy or effective extension of its power uh it couldn't really hold off this uh you know motivated uh push towards power from Mussolini and his followers and they said we're gonna make Europe. We're gonna make it Rome again. So we're gonna do War everywhere and where were they where was left for them to go to war with. They went to war the Ethiopia and then they gave a lot of support to the nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and Mussolini was fixated all through the Spanish Civil War on getting as much playing time for his guys. As possible.

He wanted to send as many volunteers many of them Italian fascist black shirts to span Spain to learn how to fight to to display uh Italian uh Valor and and and you know Roman spirit and to that end they sent thousands of uh troops. He also kind of crazily did almost unrestricted submarine warfare on Merchant ships going to Republican Spain that saw like the sinking of British ships. Uh there was a danger that the uh the Italians were gonna like go the the British into a war in the Mediterranean. That's how seriously they took it but hilariously the record of the Italian Army in the Spanish Civil War is pretty mixed uh they and they took uh Santander in the north I think but they also were responsible for like one of the few times that the Republican Army was able to execute a meaningful offensive blow and like take significant territory. It was from the Italians and then he invades Albania uh and then hilariously in uh goes into Greece gets. His ass kicked out of Greece has part of Albania taken from him by the Greeks forcing Hitler to postpone Barbarossa and divert forces to the South to secure uh Greece I mean that is a big what if what if it what if  ride because you aren't what you think you are yes you're hearkening back to Rome.


But that's because you're closer to it in your institutions and in your uh culture than Germany is or or the UK U.S or the UK because they have gone through a capitalist transformation that you have uh failed to have initiated and so you have these early pop-offs in pla. In all of the least developed countries in Europe are the ones where some sort of uh uh Revolution or coup took power and then of course Germany which was just decimated by World War II World War One but the institutions get hollowed out or are never built uh geographic area 115 303 square miles population 57.7 million language Italian predominant religion Roman Catholicism Capital Rome government type Republic head of government prime minister Julio andreotti oh my God holy crap uh andreotti was uh PM during this war wow so if anybody knows about um you know gladio about propaganda. Due about the years of lead about the Deep state power that ruled uh Italy during the Heyday of the Italian Communist party that guy andreotti. Uh was the Eminence griss of the political wig of that power structure for almost the entire post-war period uh and he had many people killed. He collaborated with the CIA and a former fascists uh the Vatican and of course the mafia to uh ensure that the Italian communist power never party never took power and so that man false flag terror attacks a massive amount of drugs smuggling to fund the whole thing and probably the assassination of a prime minister who was threatening to bring the Democrat the Communist Party into government. There's also during Nixon uh a moment where a fascist coup was uh planned and like in the offing like it was it was.

It was like midnight was coming and it was going to be Spain in 1936 and then Nixon made a phone call to the head of the thing and called it off and it was just fully demobilized uh and then to this day. Nobody exactly knows why that happened the one of the leading theories is that it was essentially just a warning. It was just showing to the uh powers that be in Italy exactly what the US and its allies in Italy were capable of and willing to do and then because uh they got the message it wasn't followed through on yes uh something that's what happened how did Mussolini die. He was captured fleeing the uh social Republic of sallow uh with his mistress and he was shot and then had uh hung by his ankles. Uh above a gas station and one of the people who shot him actually was elected to the Italian parliament after the war as a communist oh he was given a trial well. That's nice gee. I wonder what the outcome of that was going to be hey. Uh hey. Uh is this the guy yeah we all know it's him but then those people the people who had supported him all throughout that uh period they were just reincorporated into the Italian state just as the former Nazis were in West Germany and to a lesser but still real extent East Germany and you know like that whole. Thing that also happened in Japan also had a gladio-style organization that that stood up a relationship between a political party. The liberal Democrats uh a uh corporate structure a corporate power structure and a black market uh illegal power structure in the form of the  Yakuza uh. The only difference is there was never really a years of lead other than you know like the Japanese Red Guard running around uh because uh Italy because uh Japan prospered way more than Italy did economically in the post-war period so they got just uninterrupted. They got the same uninterrupted rule by that gladio party that Italy did only it didn't have you know truck bombings and and assassinations every day oh and yeah. The former uh war criminals uh and Colonial monsters who had despoiled China and the rest of the greater East Asia co-prosperity.

Spirits were all back integrated into government. It was not the end of World War II. It was a change of size that happened sometimes during war besides like when you have multiple parties more than two parties. At War you will often see allies flip when  Hannibal invaded Italy. He had this 15-year nightmare of securing alliances with non-roman tribes or non-roman uh groups outside of Rome or like on the con on the peninsula fighting with them and then they just eventually he moves away and they go under the sway of Rome again and they switch sides. Yes a few uh Japanese leftists have been were killed by katanas but it's much smaller. It's a much less bloody record than in Italy. So what yeah so yeah uh so all you have is a a breather a timeout which is what you had after 1918. After the Versailles that wasn't that none. Of those issues were resolved by that war it was just they exhausted everybody exhausted each other fighting and had to reconstitute for a while and then they went back at it again and then once again there was an exhaustion moment and then they went back at it and that was the Cold War which was in reality a bunch of actual hot conflicts all over the globe but mostly concentrated in those places where capitalism was still being uh uh imposed at the at the like at the closest levels of Exchange where where the traditional uh economic and cultural structures that had persisted were being broken open violently and that is the continuation of World War II. With the side switched it went from us UK and the U and the USSR against the uh the right-wing Terror states of the access to the defeated accesses uh ruling Elites uh uh now signing us essentially a separate piece with us and the UK and then going to war in the rest of the world with the uh U.S Anglo former Ally the Soviet Union and one of the things that really uh really condemns Stalin because you can defend Stalin.

All you want and say he had to do what he had to do if they were going to beat the Nazis okay but then what happened Heap understandably but still erroneously did not realize that uh that the only path forward was going to be war with not with the West he didn't want that and there we've talked about it before there was a high possibility of that being at least attempted by the United States under a healthier FDR or a Henry Wallace presidency but the fact that all it took was uh that hick Truman becoming president to completely derail. It says it was never a sure thing but yeah like we could have continued fighting that those those national uh demons with our Soviet colleagues in the rest of the world uh which would have eventually met Civil War in the West would have broken those countries in half would have broken Us in half would have led to a lot of violence. There's no option where Warfare is not the defining characteristic of the 20th century but Warfare with perhaps a different outcome like we come on the other end of the of the Monstrous conflagrations of the 20th century. Knitting towards something instead of burrowing frantically away from each other as we become ever more uh biologically and technologically interconnected like we have these processes at banging against each other instead of harmonizing towards one another and that is the the dream that the the left broadly fought in the 20th century. That was the vision and you know.

I think it says something that it's a vision that the right shares in its imagery in its in its uh self-conception and in its propaganda of you know of a stellar uh super super fecundity uh. But it elides like the uh how to get that it elides the question of how that is brought about is it brought about by humans mastering uh uh their environment and then cooperating towards you know a Interstellar civilization or is it grinding humans against one another until you have uh led to the conquest of a class of people who consider themselves The Heirs of a the the uh uh the champions of a darwinist Tournament of uh like survival among the living things of earth right like because that is that is what uh space fascism is right. The thing that our Elites are trying to create oh you know Star Trek but with the knowledge that your Star Trek world was built on uh and through uh the extinguishment of everyone who isn't you uh. What justifies that in the mind of these people is that well we have been selected by this contest. This endless Eternal human contest of Wills and we have one but the thing is the twist is is that in winning you have been pulled to the top of a inhuman calculating machine that is not selecting for the best of humanity that is not selecting for anything vital that we would want to protect and Define as the good in the world. Even if it's totally narcissistically connected to our individuality like the deeper like emotional truths of life are selected against are rung out of the system. The people who pull to the top are those who have been hollowed out so that by the time they're the only ones left what they think that the life that they think that they're taking to space has been  suffocated. They are the Borg so how do you get. There is what matters how do you get to those those ships and those bubble cities and that endless Frontier how do you make the frontier truly endless both out and crucially in how do you make it so that there is always a meaningful Pursuit Of Life not the thwarted gangrenous uh Pursuits the hollow and endless Pursuits uh of of of living uh for base ideas of enjoyment pleasure.

You know Indulgence that stuff since the sensory experience of a single individual if you build a machine to give you that it's taking your awareness of anything but yourself. It's stripping you of connections like real neural connections to the the feedback of life like the the hum of of of of existence. Because yes if you do not have a social vision of uh existence. If you don't have an emotional relationship to other people that is not abstracted into a an economic calculus motivated by your uh consumer preferences. Your your status is homo economicus who yes might recognize I need other people. I even love other people but fundamentally relates that uh has makes that relationship uh a a hedonic calculus as opposed to just the genuine uncompelled love uh of others. If you don't have that then uh you will never make a human move you'll never do a thing for a human motive. You will only do things for a motive that can be abstracted calculated predicted and drained of uh uh free will and meaning. We think that's the condition of life. No that is the condition that life imposes upon us against our will and we struggle with it every day and that struggle is our life. That struggle is uh are our purpose struggling against that foreign pack of these because I'm enjoying it.


Uh military assets the Mim 104 Patriot. This was the most famous weapon of the Iraq War for anyone who was alive at that time. The first one much balihood. This was an anti-missile missile that was used to shoot down missiles. This is pre-ironed Dome. The scud Buster thank you they called it and they used it to prevent the missiles that uh Saddam shot at Israel from hitting anything because Israel at the request of the United States did not go to war against uh Iraq because the U.S had gotten all the other. Uh Arab countries to go along with this war. Uh they'd even gotten Syria which was like ruled allegedly by a bath party uh just like Iraq was even though you know they all hated each other. Uh he had this delicate diplomatic balance and if Israel had joined it then that would have knocked the whole thing off. They wouldn't have been able to uh sustain that even to their own people. Even the dictatorship um and so Israel was neutral and so to get Israel to attack him. Saddam shot a bunch of scuds at Israel and they had the Patriot to shoot him down.

Although I don't honestly know if it ever worked. I don't know what it's what its success rate was. I don't think it did very much. I don't I'm not sure it might have shot down one or two. I don't know if anyone has the stats on the Patriot in the first Gulf War please tell me the highly effective oh yeah. The highly effective mobile air defense missile has been the chief protector against the scud missile attacks in the Middle East. Once launched. The Patriot is Guided by a control station using data from both ground-based radar and a receiver in the nose of the missile. As it nears the enemy missile or aircraft. The Patriots fragmentation Warhead detonates destroying the Intruder hell yeah that's pretty  boss uh manufacturer Raytheon God. Bless Raytheon speed Mach 2 range 42 miles primary function surface-to-air defense Warhead fragmentation The Patriot yeah. I don't think they even use those anymore. I don't think Iron Dome uses them yeah so that was a big flop.

Uh military skill latitude and longitude is that a skill it seems like. It's a tool latitude and longitude knowing what it is is that the skill uh measurement of latitude and longitude provides a system for locating many poses. Any position on the globe major divisions are measured in degrees and minor divisions in minutes. The Prime Meridian is located at the Greenwich observatory in England. Of course it is of course it is where else would it have been. The 19th century was the was the century where judge Holden first beheld the world in all of its glory and started to really do the job of pinning all of the Butterflies to the cork board and so and that process was carried out spearheaded by the dreaded Anglo lizard people. So of course they get the axis of the world. The latitude of Washington DC is latitude North 38 degrees 52 3 minutes longitude 77 degrees two minutes there you go in case you wanted to find that on a map uh government U.S Constitution that's right U.S Constitution read it love it.

It's the greatest document it is. It might end up being Humanity suicide note which would be very funny because I could see future humans looking back at this version of the human comedy and going like oh yeah. This thing here that's some bad code that's going to be a problem. The US Constitution has been used as a model worldwide. Uh actually that's not true at all. It's actually hilarious to what degree the U.S Constitution. The first Democratic Constitution is not the model that other constitutions follow our system of Elections. For example is one that we have never all the countries we've knocked over and replaced the government as since in the 20th century. Not one of them have we given our system because it is designed not to work and in America that was fine because the political work that other uh Democratic systems needed to do in America was done by what you know it. You love it free real estate free real estate patched over that degree of social conflict that in European parliamentary democracies had to be wrangled politically and and disputed and dispersed politically that degree of violence and conflict had to be diffused for stability in America. That degree of conflict could be exported onto cons onto compelled labor and exporporated land. So of course nobody  got our system. It's it's it's it's designed to be ineffective and if you aren't the America the settler Colony. It doesn't work uh uh as a model worldwide. No it doesn't to form workers uh working rules for government.

Its purpose is stated eloquently in the Preamble all right settle down we the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union. Establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution of the United States. A coup a banker's coup against the plain Republic and the funny thing is is like that is both true that understanding of like the Federalists as this group that was trying to trying to destroy the liberty-loving legacy of the Constitution of the of the Revolution. It is true but considering that the people complaining about it and economically mobilizing it we're not the plain people of the of the of the of the country we're not uh the the rebels of Western Pennsylvania. They were the plantar Aristocrats of the  Piedmont South and if they wanted their little uh slave Republic. They were going to have to build a administrative and Financial State capable of fending off uh other powers.

They couldn't accept the reality of their position because they didn't have to because they got to play Cicero in their little fancy. Uh colonated plantation house they got to pretend. They got to live in a fantasy land but then the right and the people in the of the rough rocky soil of New England. They couldn't. They literally couldn't afford those illusions. It's like yeah. They were doing it to gain power and they were doing it for for their own. Uh economic benefit of course that's why everybody does everything you're not explaining anything when you say that the reason they did. It is because they thought the United States needed to be a  computer uh competing Nation to the existing European uh uh Power structure they had to compete they needed to compete for power or they would be destroy. They would be supplicated by somebody and even though they didn't want it they ended up letting it happen why because they secretly needed it. They didn't know it but they needed it and that one of the big problems with American populism as a tradition is a huge percentage of it is just dumbass. Uh fixed Capital holders whose parochial uh who's who's luxurious parochial ignorance allows them to think that they don't need uh the modern State capacity that uh Capital markets provide and they dig their heels in and they  it up and they are allowed to do it to the degree that they can kind of get it out of their system maintain. Their you know uh protection for their industry but over time that goes away if they are in a situation where there is a fully empowered Republican party that is ready to do things like  fiscal cliff to not pay the debt which is just an insane nihilistic thing to do and you could only do it if you are an expression of that particular parochial delusion of the fixed Capital holders of the United States um leader Lieutenant General Charles A Horner.


We got Chuck Horner here well I always put this too low. Uh. He is the Lieutenant General Charles. A Horner. He's the commander of the ninth Air Force U.S Command Center Air Force uh U.S command Air Force Shaw.

One of our heroes we got Argentina here. I think they're either they're the tail end of the Junta. At this point I don't know is the hunter Fallen. I think the hunter fell after the Falklands so fresh little baby democracy. Argentina's post World War II history is marked by the name Juan Peron winning presidential elections. In 1946 and 1951. Juan D Peron became so powerful as a dictator that a coup forced him into Exile in 1955. His wife Isabella later became the atmosphere's first woman chief of state in 1962 Great Britain and Argentina. In 1982 Great Britain and Argentina fought over the Falkland Mal Venus Islands. Argentina is a member of the United Nations and the Coalition forces uh geographic area.

You all believe me you play too much. We got another military asset here oh God another terrible picture. The fa-18 Hornet. This is a very famous plane. I think it was in I think they used the hornet in uh top gun. Maverick again not sure but this picture is very dark uh. With the it looks a little brighter with the the can the light in the in the screen. But it's um. It's very dark. It's a shitty show. It's a bad shot. The fa-18 Hornet uh the multi-mission Hornet is both a fighter and an attack aircraft cool carry or Carrier or land-based. It is used by both U.S Navy and the U.S Marine Corps and can carry up to 17 000 pounds of air-to-air or air-to-ground missiles and bombs. There are 128 deployed in the Operation Desert Storm throughout six carrier groups and U.S marine land bases. Manufacturer McDonald Douglas speed Mach 1.8 max range it 600 662 miles armaments 20 millimeter m61 uh girl two wingtip Sidewinder missiles. Other missiles and or bombs crew one for the fa 18a and two for the fa 18b okay could they still just use this guy do we need the new ones do we need the F 22 do we need. The F-35 can we just use the Hornet like what what who's doing dog fights for Christ's sake. It's not even a thing anymore and we're not even bombing anymore. We just use drones military assets. Uh the spirits class destroyer that's right Bobby. We got a Sprint's class destroyer yeah. There's no F-35 in Top Gun Maverick and they hilariously explain that by saying well we could use the F-35. It definitely doesn't uh crash in the rain but unfortunately they're using some sort of like guidance. But uh Jammer so we can't use it because it'll Jam the guidance. It's like holy  couldn't who when let's hope that doesn't get out because then everyone will just use the guidance Jammer and then you'll never be able to use it anywhere first to employ gas turbines as their main propulsion. The Sprint's class destroyers have undergone modernization. They have received lamps three helicopters and tomahawk missiles.

In addition to Phalanx seaweeds destroyers USS Hewitt out of yokoshuka Japan and USS David r ray of Long Beach California where part of Operation Desert Storm Fleet the Sprints class destroyers and are the largest destroyers built by any Western Navy yeah. That's right. Biggest destroyers do we need them are they useful in this late date probably not but we have more of them and they're bigger than anybody displacement. Eight six thousand forty tons full load length. 563 feet speed 20 32.5 knots 37 miles per hour our limits. Two phalanx seawees two five inch guns. Two triple torpedo tubes and missiles crew 334. Oh yes I've heard about the Zumwalt total debacle. They can't even give those away uh government the Department of Defense. Yes that's right.

We're building the largest office building on earth to consecrate the American military-industrial complex following its Unholy arrive Awakening into existence following World War II. Uh what are we going to do oh. We're definitely going to make it into an occult shape. You know we're going to do that we can't help ourselves. We couldn't help ourselves designing Washington DC and we can't design ourselves with the Pentagon because we know what's happening here. A planetary creature's eye is Awakening and we are creating a Gateway for it to gaze into our Realm created by the National Security Act of 1949. The usdod is responsible for maintaining the military and protecting the security of the United States. The department developed from the need to coordinate the military branches and prevent rivalries. Yeah. I'm sure they did a great job of that the current Secretary of Defense is Richard Cheney.

I remember him he comes back later. This is for Desert Storm leader John Major oh. My God doesn't he just look so handsome and Powerful what a what a hunk y. This is the guy who sent Saddam scurrying back from Kuwait. He's John Major. The prime minister of the UK son of a circus acrobat did not know that that's interesting John Major quit school at age 16 to help support his family. After several unsuccessful attempts at politics. He became a member of parliament as a conservative in 1979. In 1987 he became Chief Secretary of the Treasury. A cabinet position then was appointed to foreign secretary in 1989. In 1990 he was appointed prime minister. He kind of cooed Maggie. Out of there Maggie was getting a little too uh crusty and there were Young Guns in the conservative party who were kind of sick of her. So she didn't lose an election. They kind of forced her out and then he amazingly was able to hold on. In the subsequent election. Major's wife Norma wrote a biography of the famous Australian soprano Joan Sutherland wow fascinating born London England birthplace birthday March 29. 1943 education left school at age 16. Damn I thought all those  like had to be from Oxbridge. I guess Thatcher wasn't all right daughter of a grocer. God. There's never been anything more perfect than the fact that uh Richard Nixon and uh Margaret Thatcher were the were the children of uh like grocery.


Proprietors like uh like comstable uh retailers like people who sold uh food to people the Ultimate lower middle class existence low margin constant grind in conflict with suppliers in conflict with customers in conflict with the state. The taxes and regulates you no friend to any quarter that is the psychic world of the lower middle class and it is why fascism is its uh political fantasy. Uh when it senses Decline and extinguishment uh because it cannot conceive of any sort of solidarity. It trusts none outside of its own so it imagines if we're going down. We go down swinging which means the fascist Death Drive that we're felt well familiar with now. So that is why it is in one sense true to say that the Conservative Republican party now is fascist just in the sense that we finally have in the United States. The land of planting the land of free real estate we finally at the exhaustion of that concept. We have a enthroned lower middle class that does not see a way out. That is the thing that connects this moment to the fascist moment. The difference though is that that expression was able to be channeled into a robust political culture. An infrastructure of Civic organization and mobilization a mass politics and a mass culture that led them able to literally seize control of the apparatus.

This is some of the most powerful states in the in the world that does not persist now. We have the same impulse we have the same Death Drive blinking in the brain stems of the dying lower middle class of America. But they're not that isn't being channeled into uh mobilization. It's being channeled into uh fantasy because we're just in front of screens. We've been demobilized and de-politicized as as subjects. Those those organs of Social Power that a person could go out every day of their house and know existed and nowhere to go to amplify their energy. They're gone now you got guys like running around in in polo shirts cosplaying that because they're younger and more motivated and they actually want to get to the fight rather than dream about it. But they're defined by their lack of power. The people who are enthroned politically are by definition the one for whom this Death Drive is a Dream It's a fantasy. It's not a thing that they actually want to enact which is what the uh mobilized fascist subject was it's a good news bad news situation like those social passions can't be. General can't be channeled towards like uh effective fascist takeover of our institutions. But it means we don't have the capacity to challenge them from a position of solidarity.

Either but solidarity can be built through experience and that is the hope of the world final one for today geography Iraq. This is a pretty important card. I would say you don't really have a deck without this card. Republic of Iraq ancient Iraq was known as Mesopotamia. The land between the rivers Tigris and the Euphrates. Modern Iraq meaning cliff in Arabic I didn't know that encompasses more territory than Mesopotamia. The present boundaries were set by the British oops in 1922. What do you know uh denying a viable Outlet to the Sea except for the shot.

Al-arab Iraq tried to connect these land Problems by correct these land Problems by Waging War with Iran from 1900 1980 to 1988. On August 2nd 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and the British mandate. They really did some wacky stuff. In there they really uh they really planted some very hilarious bombs that would later go off in the face of everybody geographic area. 167 924 square miles population 18.8 million languages Arabic and Kurdish predominant religion Islam Shia government government type Republic du jour dictatorship de facto all right buddy getting editorial again head of government president and prime minister Saddam Obama Hussein okay.
