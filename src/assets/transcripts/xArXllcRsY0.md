Because many more things I can tell my rock sack has offend me pillow. The heather is off bend me bed and sooner than part from the mountain. I think I would rather be dead. I'm a rambler. I'm a remember manchester way. I get all my pleasure lord mold and way. I may be a wage slave on monday. But I am a free man on sunday ah. I'm doing a rare weekend. Rare mid-afternoon show early afternoon show because one. I'm gonna be gone next week. No streams two. I wanted to get a look at the backyard during the day. So you could see some of this cool snow because it's cool and the snow is cool and I like snow and I'm glad that it snowed because I kind of had given up on ever seeing. A nice snowstorm again in the northeast got all that guy in there delightful. Oh boy oh boy. People are gonna start puking. There we go and it's the good stuff. It's the good packy stuff. The stuff you want. Not that wet  is broken here. So it might fall at any moment oh no. It's snowed in wisconsin. It's known over thanksgiving didn't it. I mean I guess. This is the first winter snow but like it has already snowed in wisconsin.

I know that for a fact oh it mate boris canceled bloody. Christmas mate it's an honorable looks. They did it mate. They can't show bleedy christmas oh god good to be able to eat me borax pie with me gran. Those freaks take christmas seriously. They invented most of the  germans invented christmas one way or the other whether you're talking about the central european traditions that created the concepts of like the the uh father christmas saint nicholas and uh and uh gift giving and the tree uh which of course is a descendant of like pagan. Uh traditions of forest worship and then the anglos just. It has nothing to do with the jesus or uh the nativity or or anything that happened in uh the  up there and now they're not gonna get christmas because they've created a new tier. There's tier four. If you're in tier. Four christmas is cancelled those people love it.


They love acting like blade runner. Going there are three people you are now divided into three tears. Your tear is not your destiny. You can escape your tear at any time. By compliance they love it. They hate their freedom and they want it to be taken away but not through like a collaborative process but through a violent domination because they're a bunch of sickos.

What I think is most interesting though is that it's the conservative government that's doing the lockdowns and and then you can't really you don't have like the the federalist mishmash to give people like confusion about who to blame about a lot of these directives um because like all those people were pissed at democratic governors for enforcing lockdowns and stuff most of the time it was not them doing it but they were the nearest democrat they could blame. They have like you know a parliamentary government without dumb federalism in in britain and they have a conservative government and they're the ones doing it. They're literally canceling christmas and I know that england has all of our dumb culture war stuff even if it's not quite as armed as ours like I know. There's a hilarious deal where people are trying to put the magna carta in their  shop windows to keep them from being closed which is just chef's kiss. Just the way that our idiocy like like britain exploded in the early modern era and like the dumbest parts of it flew across the water to become our base morons and now the idiocy became so dominant. It's bouncing back on them like any I mean don't you know enough art. British. I thought the british were still educated enough to know that the magna carta was just about giving the barons liberties over their  literal class society but anyway like they have our kind of culture war anti-mask anti-lockdown sentiment but where does it go politically where is it going. I don't know. I mean there's less of it to channel because people are less psycho there.

But uh it's got to go somewhere are they actually doing brexit. At the end of the year did. They kick the  can down the road again because if they got another extension then it's never going to happen and it'll just be this forever which is the perfect metaphor. The perfect metaphor you have this thing the concept of brexit that would represent a genuine break with the current like european uh trade order and like the state system honestly if you talk about ireland uh and that's essentially something the system cannot absorb at the moment. So it can't happen but you can't just cancel it because that would obviate the fiction of democratic participation by these subject governments. So you just kick the can down the road. Eternally. I think that's honestly more likely than them. After hitting. A hard deadline is them just never just always kicking it down the road and someone joked once that in 50 years there will be a weird ritual that nobody understands the purpose from where a guy in a powdered wig has to take the  channel over to france and then like walk like a road to canosa thing to uh to brussels with a parchment and then give it to a delivery guard in front of the uh eu parliament and nobody even knows why he's doing it. But it's like a ritualized extension of the deadline.

I don't think it's like the debt but that is that is literally not real that that's not real but like the the the uh the political crisi. The legitimacy crisis at the heart of european governance is very real and brexit is a reflection of it and the question like that that matters to policymakers is how much does that get channeled into political uh power that can no longer be contained by the rickety structures of the european union. That's a real question and they don't want to get an answer because it might be the wrong one and one way to postpone that reckoning is by postponing brexit inefficiently all the countries on earth. But two are debtors who do they owe the money to. It's like brunei and the vatican are the only countries on earth that aren't in debt who the  are they in debt to aliens. It's not real in the sense that it is not real. The way that your personal debt is as if you can be like beggared by it because you're only being beggared by your debt because it's also it's a it's a instrument of coercion. It is a fiction designed to get compliance what that means is there's never going to be some reckoning point whereas brexit the definition of that vote was at some point in the future. We're leaving the eu so that has a actual timeline to it as opposed to the debt.

Where they just point at the number and like frantically just gestured say it's so big like that meme of the the porn star going looking at the national debt clock and you're just supposed to infer that that's supposed to mean something. It's supposed to have brought the end of the world. For the last 30  years and every single time we have ever gotten close to paying off debt or balancing our budget. The politics instantly turn away from surplus to getting over whatever as quickly as possible bill clinton actually balanced the  budget which now seems like an impossibility and essentially is and honestly shouldn't be done. He shouldn't have done that it was bad he did but he did it and as soon as bush got in. There the republican the party of fiscal responsibility the party that was always yelling how do you have how do you pay for it. There's no free lunch immediately set about getting rid of that budget surplus so that's not real and yeah one of the  brexit is. It's the knock on the door for the european project. Now maybe you can keep these. Goons satisfied with the christmas hams and and champions league soccer but at some point you have to worry can.

This be contained because there are because it isn't a fully uh like subordinated um political unit like the united states because these are are separate countries that were never really integrated at the political level that was always supposed to come later in the eu. The eu talk about kicking the can down the road everything that the eu is built on was predicated on a political uh uh tightening of political ties that has not happened and that in the absence of would render any long-term crisis unmanageable which is what we've seen in britain since 2008. Basically yeah they're not going to be on maneuvered by boris johnson which is why they'll just keep them in the eu. By prolonging it forever they don't want him to leave and these dumb asses don't really have any incentive in seeing brexit complete it either because it would be bad. I guess. I assume. I don't know maybe they're making it up. I have no idea like. I said I've said before the whole question of like how catastrophic brexit would be to like. Uh standard of living in. Britain was always the big the the big uh the cudgel to oppose uh brexit. But I don't know how real it is. It's it's not made up completely but how significant. I have no idea. No you've not left you've said that a million times shut the  up you have not left you're not out of the eu shut up.


I watched somebody's asking about michael caine of stalin. I actually watched that when I was a kid because that was cool there was a big. I think it was tnt or it might have been one of the networks multi-night series about uh like the uh the big three and the and the uh all the conferences you know like uh uh tehran to potsdam or something and uh john lithgow played fdr which great casting perfect long uh. Uh and uh bob hoskins played churchill which is pretty funny considering that churchill was a literal lord. The descendant of marlboro like a high. The highest of uh of of a blue bluest of bloods and bob hoskins was just a pudgy little. Michael kane played stalin with a half-assed russian accent. It was fun. Yes churchill was half american. His mom was american all right thank you someone says I'm blonde I i know.

This is very indulgent and like kind of eagerly but it has been kind of weird to me to notice. Since I've become a public person that that people have very different ideas about what color my hair is and I think that's weird. I feel like usually most people they get exposed enough. You see the picture you see a video of them or you meet them enough. You get an idea of what their hair color is because but I've realized that my hair is like a perfect embodiment of like the main european hair types like there's three main european hair types and it's essentially blonde red and then the mixture of the two brown and so you know. Since there are three types of hair blonde red brown. What type is this and I think the reason that's an interesting question and not just soft. Solid cystic is that no matter what way you slice it right like this is if it's blonde. It's very dark blonde strawberry blonde. If it's red. It's very like rust-colored. It's not bright red but I have seen drawings of me on the internet with like blight bright white like yellow hair and also just  pepper and pippy long stocking red hair.

And I think that's because you might see it as darker light or like but as long as soon as in your head. You turn it into one of those. If you turn you take it from you know the reality of this uh muddled red ish brown or blond ish brown or whatever ish you turn it into like the most vivid version of what that word means. It's like a it's like your brain is you're playing telephone with reality. That's that's the transl like. That's the that's like your mental translation of of ideas yeah. Like I had a groin. Somebody made a griper of me and it had like bright red hair. But I've seen ones where it's blonde and so. I thought the best way to get an answer to here is. I put it on twitter.

I said if you know if you think you can answer this question. What color is my hair and the lowest was red. It was only like 22. Then it was like 27 for blonde and it was 50 almost. I think even over 50 like 51 brown the combination of the two and I would say that since none of these are real categories they don't represent real characters. It is all subjective inherently then that is the objective answer to the question no matter what I think and I thought I was blonde my whole life. Part of that is because I was born like white-haired and when until I was like six or seven. I had you know the the uh. I had that uh like village of the damned white blonde creepy blonde hair like the kind of kid. You're like you like. I had the white blonde hair and then it started darkening. But I had I was still like a blonde blonde until I was you know in my teenagers and then after puberty. It got darker and darker which is a very common thing so but it never got to the point where I felt it had left blonde but then red came out of nowhere as soon as other people like started coming together and trying to say what my color hair color my hair was yes. I had draco mulfoy here. I don't. I don't watch that. But yes that was my hair color. So. I just think that's interesting and uh and I think by getting that number by doing the machine learning. We can get it something that's objectively the answer. It's brown no matter what. I think no matter what you think it's brown because you ask. What was it like 12 000 people. Yes 12 000 people and more than 6 000 of them say brown. It's brown.


That's just the answer. Italians aren't really european come on. I guess. I'm talking about like the three nordic hair colors like above the above the alps the hanseatic league colors yeah. There we go but it was just weird to hear see. People call me a redhead because that always felt very that always felt like its own thing like its own kind of identity that I never had that I was. I never had any uh connection to and so it's been kind of weird yes. It's very. It's very angelic. Now. It's like getting shot through and that's the other thing if like the sun is on it. It looks pretty blonde no matter what like it looks blonde and like if you see it under bright lights. It looks pretty blond but you know that's not that's not anything.

That's just that's just subjectivity. You got to get like a enough people together and then the sum total of their responses is the actual answer commodity fetishism. Someone wants to know about commodity fetishism. It's very misunderstood because the word fetish throws people and they think that it stands for like materialism and being materialistic and caring about uh the commodities and wanting to  them. No it is imbuing commodities with the properties of the labor that went into them and that is how we create uh the the fantasy of the value form and and where where we we we give a value a monetary value to commodities that imbues on the things themselves what is real in reality the value of the labor that went into them and that is what allows for that fetish is what allows for us to uh to suborn labor and and support surplus labor under capitalism and and then essentially pay people less than they produced to buy less than they produced yeah.

Like a voodoo doll sense like they they've imbued like a fetish. A fetish object in in a in like traditional religion is a is a statue or a thing or some sort of made made object that has a spiritual imbuement to the people who who uh like made it or or carry it and that in in marks that process of of enchanting an object is what we do in creating commodities because in in a tribal community that fetish like the god that that fetish represents is the god of of the of the of the people and and they represent. Essentially. The social power of that group and our social power is extracted off to the commodities that we create and that means and that's one of the I mean and the commodity fetishism. It translates into culture in the way that we imbue cultural products with uh with social meaning yeah.

That's that's like that's the abstract stuff. That's the stuff that that's the reason it's hard to to just read capital and a lot of people need help. I know I've used needed help because uh because it does that stuff it doesn't like it's very hard to relate to specifics because it is it's it's the meta. It's essentially the closest thing that marxism has to like metaphysics because you're talking about the alienation away from a social production. A model where people are producing for a social group to one where labor is abstracted alienated and and a surplus is uh acquired and then taken and there has to be and and you know marx doesn't phrase it in spiritual terms. But it is a spiritual process and so it's the most abstract and hardest to sort of describe to people because anything that is that touches and brushes. The ineffable is hard to describe harder to describe than other things yeah alienation. Now that's an important one and it's very intuitive and you can point to examples all over the place uh like for example that uh if you're giving a massage to a loved one there's an oxytocin release like there's a there's a serotonin whatever the good brain chemical release that is similar to that that is felt by the person getting the massage but if you're being paid to give someone a massage that chemical experience doesn't happen. That's a literal measurable physical alienation that occurs due to the alienation of labor and you can extrapolate that that response that that physicality that that physical the reality of that physical impact of of the wage relationship and capitalism broadly across every segment of social interaction and and personal uh identity formation.


Vote phase are you guys talking about uh felix's vote face. I could never do that. I give felix credit uh. I might. I'm. I'm the best. I would say. I'm the best chapo at soy facing will is pretty good too. But only one of us is on the front page of the google image search respon response to soy face and that's me uh but felix gets credit for inventing essentially taking a type of face and defining it in its most monstrous and disgusting way. Felix is definitely a shaman. Felix is uh if you yeah. Felix is someone who got plugged into the internet at the exact right moment to be able to ride its consciousness. Essentially he's he is kind of a paul atreides figure like he emerged onto the the blasted sands of the internet point 1.0 world at as a knife like. I was too old. I encountered that  when I was already fully formed or at least close to it or at least fully traumatized into what would pass for adulthood. Felix was still still a young pup and he was able to to march uh out into the dunes of of internet auracus and and  ride the sand worm and now he sees uh. He sees all times through the lens of uh of posting felix is on there.

Too is he on the first page though I'm on the I'm in the first line. I'm on the top line okay. I mean my god uh just off the top. I had the hot couch thing like he took an experience that everyone had had among a certain demographic slice and articulated it in a way that created like a spontaneous collective prustian reverie for thousands of people who encountered it the since instant that they did that's pretty impressive and that's his gift and it's it's it's amazing. I think it's because I came to it later. I I saw it for more remove and there's too many layers of abstraction between me and the zeitgeist to do anything other than sort of comment on it.

Uh retrospectively rather than bring things into being felix might be an all-time observational comic. You know that's funny. It's weird to put it that way because that is kind of what he is. It's just that instead of doing the seinfeld thing where you just say the thing you uh articulate the experience of encountering the thing which is much deeper what is the origin of soy face well. Soy face comes like most of the good memes from the alt-right. The that is the one complaint they have that is fully uh accurate. They got ripped off everybody stole their  and at the time I always felt kind of weird about it like yeah. No it is kind of funny that we keep embracing these. These griper memes from these people.


Who we otherwise think are absolutely you know socially uh doomed losers whose bitterness has overwhelmed their entire uh humanity but now the way I think when I think now about like when I think now of the online overeducated post collapse you know precariate that is like the the brain of the internet as one thing rather than as discrete objects when I think of it as a holistic you know kind of a consciousness within the greater collective consciousness. Then those are uh. Those are the ones who saw most clearly at the time uh the horrors of the uh liberal order because they were the most ideologically alienated from it because politics as we understood it didn't really exist. I mean obama was sort of supposed to be the abolition of politics and the replacement of them with uh with validation of identity and and uh things like that and instead we got this you know a rocket ship to hell world and people started to  look around themselves and think what the hell is going on. But the first people to be alienated the ones who were alienated on cultural lines cultural lines and so and that means racial that means they were alienated by all of the honestly the most necessary uh and uh progressive and useful parts of the emerging. Thesis of like globalized capitalism which of course must be destroyed must be you know challenged and defeated but things within it are gonna have to be absorbed into any future and like at a basic level like liberal multiculturalism is going to have to be because without multiculturalism as a base the working class cannot win. The working class cannot effectively fight global capitalism without the multiculturalism that global capitalism brought into hegemonic uh cultural power that's how your  any more than the uh. The american descendants of slave people who think they're gonna get reparations from white america by yelling at them online all day.

That's not going to happen either. There is no version vision of liberation that is not multicultural and multi-ethnic and multi-uh uh multiracial because that numbers is are the only weapons you have if you don't have power and numbers can only be got through collaboration. Any politics that that demands separation uh and uh stacking privileges on top of each other will be destroyed and broken into those factions that will then be turned against one another by capitalism and then fully completely dissolved by capitalism and destroyed by capitalism.

I saw someone on a show say that you can't get medicare for all without reparations first and I have to say that was jaw-dropping that was mind-blowing what is the thinking there before you can get to a thing that could benefit pretty much every working person in this country and save thousands of I mean every working person in this country. Everyone before you get to that you have to get something that by definition will only help a subsection of americans and those who aren't at benefit benefited will they you have to explain to them why it's good that they aren't benefiting. From this you have to get them to recognize their privilege and feel bad for themselves that a bad bad about themselves that's ins. I don't understand how that could. I don't forget if you're talking about it as a moral proposition.

I'm sorry that's secondary the question is how do you get to any of this stuff and if we're talking about them as like policies that you're trying to push through a political process. Then you have to start with the broadest popular base because the left does not exist. The left doesn't exist has to be built one of the big faintest. One of the one of the big things that undermines leftist organizing is the fiction that it does and that fiction is propagated by people even if they're not trying to sell out for the democrats. Even if they're not trying to be sheep dippers for some uh you know con artistry of electoral strategy. Uh they are still devoted to promoting the idea that there's that they are offering influence to a meaningful group of a meaningful organizational ma. Uh like collection of people people who could be uh or uh mobilized and coordinated in their actions and that doesn't exist and so every question needs to be in how to get it to exist and a question and they are an argument saying reparations first.

I'm sorry that is one that because because you see more possibility than there is in the current ordering of things just a misapprehension. Oh that's interesting somebody actually brought this up to me in a dm uh someone's asking what about latin america talking about the coming conflict between china. The united states what about latin america. Like there is a genuine counter-hegemonic counter-imperial current there in the form of venezuela and uh now avo back in bolivia. There's there are significant movements that have momentum in chile uh ecuador and peru are restive uh. Uh brazil is obviously uh gripped by reaction right now. But there are some green shoots at the grassroots. Uh cuba of course holding it down 90 miles from florida like a goddamn like the goddamn kings and queens that they are uh the problem though is is where is the independent source of like capital you know where where can they uh. Where are they able to. I mean. I'd say amlo but like.

I don't know how any mexican president can can. It seems like kind of like being president of mexico seems like it's almost like being like a big city mayor. In this country you can't really do anything that goes against the will of uh of the united states can you like realistically. We have so many uh strings to tighten. We have so many ways to make uh your job impossible. I don't know how you'd handle it maybe. I think the role they might play is if we do get some sort of conflict between china and the united states they could sort of tag in and and put their weight behind china and maybe use the fact that they actually have an empowered working-class movements across that continent uh to bring working-class people to the table. A little bit who knows just just spitballing it would be nice though if if uh if if at our work if the united states and its dark moment is like battling rush uh china not like an actual war obviously but you know in some sort of some sort of new cold war situation and then off the top turnbuckle comes latin america which we've spent the last 200 odd years just vampirically sucking from and and massacring.


It would be. It would be pretty sweet. Uh recommend you a christmas movie how about die hard no I'm kidding die hard 2 which is also a christmas movie by the way takes place during christmas. I love that they lampshaded in that movie. They have a line where uh john mcclane says another basement. Another elevator how can the same  happen to the same guy twice oh well. Let's keep going that movie is funny because the plot of it is essentially if oliver north took a airport hostage and tried to like break manuel noriega out of prison which is pretty cool for a big budget movie. It was fun. It's wildly violent way more violent than the first one. I mean it's renny harlan yeah. Die hard 2 is pretty uh intense. They show a whole swat team because remember. In the first movie. The swat team uh hans goes just wound them and they shoot them all and like the legs and stuff and they show them all going like terminator 2. In die hard 2 a whole swat team of cops just gets murked by robert patrick actually speaking of terminator 2 and a bunch of uh a bunch of like us cia guys and also in retaliation for an attempt to violate the rules uh oliver north uh commands unwittingly to the people in the cockpit of british plane full of people and they even show inside the  the plane. They show like all these old british people and little kids running around just to tell you how many innocent people are about to get splashed and then john. Mclean tries to warn them off for the runway but they smash into the  hardcore.

The ejector speed escape from the crash hercules that's pretty baller uh he. Uh jet engine oh best of all spoiler alert but the movie's 30 years old. So this is the best part so they got this plane. Full of mercs and oliver. North and manuel noriega are about to take off for a non-extradition country. John mclean gets on the side of the plane. Uh the the turncoat special ops guy played by john amos. The dad from coming to america comes out and they have a fight on the wing. The guy flies out into the jet engine gets sucked in then john mcclane fights the oliver north guy played by william sadler. William sadler kicks his ass and throws him off the plane and he lands on the runway while they're flying away. Bad guys win wrong. John mclean while he'd been on the on the plane.

Wing had opened up one of the fuel tanks to like try to get him to have less gas and when he's on the runway flat on his ass. He sees the big trail of gasoline and he just takes a zippo and lights it and the uh trail of gas zips up into the air into the plane engine uh the gas tank and blows up the plane in mid-air. He murders like 50 guys like that's just that's just a murder that is that is illegal in all 50 states and the district of columbia. There that is like no police officer has ever done an act of uh brutality and like excessive force on that level. Since like the move bombing and it's great everyone's happy. They use the down-burned carcass of the plane as uh landing light for all the planes that have to land because they're running out of fuel amazing and you could argue yeah sure you should have done that  those guys and I probably agree with you.

But it's not the kind of thing heroes and movies generally do like anybody. See black rain with uh with michael douglas where he it's one of those japan panic movies from the early 90s when we were afraid that the japanese were going to take over because we were having a nervous breakdown in fact about the fact that we were cutting our own balls off in regard to the industrial economy but because we have no way to actually interrogate our own government's uh uh industrial policy because it's beyond politics. We had to put it off on somebody else and we decided to blame the japanese for it. Even though the japanese literally their entire  economy their post-war industrial economy was stood up by us on purpose and then in the 70s we intentionally changed uh the rules to facilitate uh manufacturing in japan in order to give them an industrial base to uh to stand up from and uh that meant that the capital was going to flow that direction. We did that  that was a choice but we decided it was the japanese ball but anyway uh michael douglas goes to. Japan fights. This guy who cut his partner's head off with a samurai sword and he's got him like in an arm lock and then there's like a broken plank with a big spike coming up and there's a shot where like he looks at it and he looks at the guy and you think he's gonna kill him. But then it cuts to him bringing him into the uh police station and booking him. Even though it's japan.

He'll probably get like five years uh anyway. John mcclane not even the warm blood of in the middle of a fight just flick push. I would love to see that in one of these  marvel movies. I shan't be watching anime. No worries about that one goodbye shannot the boy. The ladies note for anime as margaret thatcher said the lady is not for anime.


I haven't actually watched babylon berlin. Yet I feel like. I probably should check that one out at some point is it good. Robocop's really sucked pg-13 no peter weller. Out of here robocop 2. Though is a little underrated honestly also very very uh prescient. It actually has the city of detroit declare bankruptcy and sell itself to a corporation which is essentially what has happened. Detroit literally declared bankruptcy and I think the quicken company. Dan. Gilbert's company essentially owns the middle the center of detroit they own all the buildings and they have a private police force. There's also a great uh little meta commentary about the nature of making sequels in that movie. So there's uh so in robocop 2 you know robocop uh. He gets blown up in the line of duty and kind of taken offline and he's like he's lost a step. He's sort of turned into like a big pushover and ocb ocp decides to do a new robocop. Hey people like that old one they're sick of the old one. Let's get a new robocop and so there's a very funny sequence where they show uh all of the trial attempts to do a robocop by getting another cop who'd been injured the way that murphy had been and then putting him in a robot suit and the first one they show is a guy who kind of looks like an atm uh kind of like robbie the robot and he just starts shooting. He says stop and I'll shoot and he starts shooting the um the lab assistants and then blows his head off and then another guy comes out and he's got like the visor on and he just grabs his helmet and pulls it off and starts screaming and you see the top of his like bloody skull and then he dies and eventually they realize oh like murphy was a very specific special case is lightning in a bottle and not everybody is murphy. You cannot do it to a normal person and they ended up having to get uh kane. The evil nuke dealer and creator played by the great tom noonan to be robocop ii because they needed a literal psychopath to do it. They needed a a heartless murderer to do it.

I know you might say uh but the cops yes yes propaganda we all know move on and that is and then he ends up literally opening fire on a room full of reporters just massacring the  out of them. Uh it is definitely a warning about like hey you get what you pay for with a sequel and yeah. It's also could be said to talk about the nature of policing itself like if if policing is just the uh heartless. Uh enforcement of property rights and property rights need more and more brutal enforcement in an era of austerity. Then the person who does that job has to be uh a psycho. It's also the only sequel I think ever where the title is said by a character in the movie. The the great dan hurley. He who also played uh connell cochran in halloween three. Uh introduces the psycho nuke addict robocop ii at a press conference by saying robocop 2. I'm going to re-watch robocop too that movie is good but obviously you don't need a sequel to robocop robocop's perfect.

Why is every movie pg-13 now because only kids go to movies young people who still want to go out and do something go to movies. Nobody else does that anymore at least not the numbers you need to justify the  budgets and the budgets have to be big because the returns have to be big. I'm not doing a chapel episode on the cruise. I've never even seen the croods. Someone reminded me that the croods actually have have a netflix show so maybe the croods never went away but does anybody watch anything on netflix. It's baffling to me. It seems like such a black box. I mean obviously people have netflix and they watch things on netflix. But what they watch is not what they make in any kind of significant numbers right. I mean they're going to lose the office at the beginning of next year. How much of their viewership is just people watching the office and what are they going to replace it with. I do think the kids watch. I mean they probably watch a lot of kids shows because you know press. The button have your kid get pic get distracted but the whole thing seems like kind of a scam. I mean the fact that they are a publicly traded company and that their numbers are only internally generated and not released to the public is that not essential how is that different than mark to market accounting that happened under enron. Maybe. There is an independent uh uh entity that sees the numbers but I don't know is it true. I have no idea it's interesting to me but if there's a correction in the media space uh netflix will probably get eaten by. I would guess disney at this point gonna be disney plus hulu netflix versus amazon and then maybe those guys merge at some point. I mean eventually they would it's all internal to netflix. They're publicly traded how am. I supposed to know what the value how how how accurate that valuation is if. I don't know if anyone's watching the  that they're paying billions of dollars of borrowed money to make it's kind of crazy to me.

But I think that's true of all tech. I mean the entire tech economy if you start asking these questions. The whole thing falls apart because it only exists as a way to circulate capital. That's what we 2008 we recapitalized the economy by giving the richest people all of the money that they could possibly want and then they said here use it and you know what are they going to do with it. They can only buy so many gold-plated back scratchers. They have to invest it in something and silicon valley exists to give them something to put their money. In that's it it never has to make money. It never has to generate a profit or become viable. It just has to be a thing to put money into so that they can create an economy around all those uh all those corporate campuses and uh catered lunches and foosball tables and self-driving cars uh and and oh what's this you've also created a giantly overheated california real estate market out of it too all of that generated by this. This. Uh this investment mechanism that is not actually designed to get anybody money back. It's only there to to circulate money the economy and what's insane is that we could do that for regular people. Instead we could do that 100 for regular people instead but if we did that we would lose crucial coercive mechanisms at a time of decline declining profits and investment and profitable investment opportunities and it's so sick because you see all right. What do we do it one way. What do. We give all this money these. What do they make they made silicon valley what is silicon valley given us. What is it done into the physical reality of living in the area that it is geographically located at and what has it done to our culture. It is poison in every sense but it is preferable from those in power to give that money to people who will spend it in a way that can be predicted and pounded upon and redounds to reinforce their power than in ways that might undermine their power and yes. The whole end. Point of this is that is that as state structures and state capacity declines as it is and will continue to do. That capacity will be taken up by these concentrations of capital who have used that circulation of money through silicon valley to create not profits but instruments of surveillance instruments of technological control drones. Boston dynamics robots panopticon social media and uh device panopticon that will render resistance to the distribution of resources.

Moot 666 viewers baby hail satan uh. I just lost four people god damn it. It was cringe. I get it. I'm sorry. I apologize for the cringe and you can't even say it's good oh. It's created all these well-paying jobs well. It's created a new class of rent your scumbags but then below that you've created a bunch of people who are spending tons of their money and  rent that's just getting sucked but sucked up to like existent uh. Uh power powers that be within the area like the landed the real estate money that then like buys off that segment of the ruling. The local ruling class the local bourgeois to go along with the the greater project and so you get just people who think they're happy but are miserable living in guinea pig uh warrens sucking soylent while coding all day and then people who can no longer afford to live in those places being forced to move further and further away spend more and more of their time commuting if they can even find jobs all right uh all right so.

I'm gonna be signing off for about a week. We'll be coming back a week later before the new year's hopefully to talk about the last half of the first part of the republic for which it stands uh finish the home chapter. It's gonna be good uh. I hope everybody has a fine holiday in your respective quarantine zones. Your tears your tier ones your tier twos your tier threes. You you poor bastards in tier four uh tier two uh uh eat your mama tom cheer uh tier. One import bye.
