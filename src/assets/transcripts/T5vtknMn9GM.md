Foreign cash all right if you don't scrub that kitchen floor you ain't gonna walk around no more yeah. Don't come back coming in up your room how about that in that broom get all that garbage out of sight or you won't go out. Friday night yeah don't talk back down yeah. You know cleaning up your room foreign well call my congressman and he said quote I'd like to send you some but you're too young to vote. Sometimes I wanna what I'm gonna do cause there. Ain't no cure for Summertime Blues with Robert next Sunday night out. Now I didn't go to work told the boss I was sick well. You can't use a car cause you didn't work a lick. Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do cause there ain't no cure for the Summertime Blues foreign having solved the audio problems. I think permanently I think I have permanently solved the audio problems. I clicked the thing on OBS and it seemed to have fixed it but now here. I am bereft of insight a hollow shell of a man a husk. A thank you thank you yes I yeah at the end of my usefulness I guess anything yeah. I don't know I don't know just want to have a chat. Even though I have nothing in my head right. Now. It's empty. It's a sanded and objectless surface. My head. It's empty there's nothing in there I got nothing I have nothing in my head at all got nothing why is everyone talking about the stupid. Balloon is this seriously is it just are we all thinking about balloon. Boy is that what's going on here is everyone thinking about balloon boy and how much fun balloon boy was balloon.

Boy was maybe the first okay. This is an interesting conjecture was balloon boy the first social media event because balloon boy happened in I think 2012 right which is right around the time that social media reaches its efflorescence as a thing that people are engaged in beyond the peripheries. The Fringe is the most terminally computer adult like regular people start going oh. What's this thing oh hey. I can I can find out what other people are up to and swap ideas and and give people memes oh nine okay. That's earlier than I thought that actually is it though. That's like Ground Zero that might be a little too early honestly if it wasn't it. But I think it might have been like the first social media event before you get like because it takes like four years to get like the real thing because you know it had to be after the um. After the crisis. The the the the the economic 0809 crisis ended foreign. We get our fake recovery you know like the the reality of like permanent quantitative easing to replace any actual attempt. At you know changing the economic structure and it's in that context of social media. As we know it blows up. So 09's a little early then so I guess you would call it pre-figurative but people sure didn't go crazy for that. Balloon boy who wasn't actually in the balloon and I believe his parents were like on a reality show too. This does raise the question then what is the first mature social media event. Somebody says it's when Kim K's butt broke the internet. I don't know that feels too self-conscious like they're trying.

They've literally said breaks the internet in the the thing that seems like a sold to on the nose I feel like the the it would have to be a little more organic than that I've heard that there's a some degrowth communism book that's like the best-selling book in Japan which is totally fitting since Japan has been doing degrowth for the last 30 years. Japan's been doing D growth since the early 90s. They even though they're still you know the Pachinko parlor weird futurist country. Their economy has been like ever since the early 90s Abe R.I.P did some of his own quantitative easing style stuff abeinomics to pump the prime of the pump. A little bit but um it's been basically flat for 30 years. So if any country is going to get on board. The degrowth train is going to be Japan. They know what that's about I mean apparently you could go into Japan Japanese stores and like buy VHS like they have they have analog technology for sale that people buy yeah. The d-growth country. 2012. I guess that was it wasn't it. It's too obvious an answer but at the same time what else are you going to pick. It's got to be. The year is right because that's the thing 2012 is the year that's why I wanted in my head. I wanted balloon boy to have been 2012. So I guess it was Cody 2012. And Coney by the way still out there.

It's amazing people want to make everything on Twitter to be a psyop. Everybody wants social media to be this Haven of psyops. All of these perfectly calibrated government interventions in the mind space to get certain outcomes and yet none of those outcomes have actually come about. They didn't get Coney We didn't send peacekeepers into the DRC yeah. We're in Japan. We're in Africa in the horn and in Western Africa in the in the Sahel but not because of Any social media push not because of Any memes because the psyop is not any discrete incident or discreet set of symbols within the social media matrix. It's the social media Matrix itself. That's it that's it. It is the illusion of forward progress. It is the illusion of momentum. It is the illusion of sociality of the internet that does the work of psyoping us because it doesn't matter what our opinions are on anything as long as we have an Avenue to express them to send that energy out and and and it is into this ether where everything is just captured and then processed by pre-selected groups by as as content to be chosen or ignored by people who are looking to build a psychic world. Then it doesn't matter. It has it doesn't matter at all what our discrete opinions on anything are. It's about what are what we do with those opinions and the only thing we could do with them is what we do what we're all doing what I'm doing um. What we I think things like 20 Coney 2012. Really are is just people being literally driven insane just like Q Anon is by the by the illusory potential of the internet what taking the internet on its face seriously if you take the internet on its face seriously then yeah.

It is a place where discrete ideas and movements can have incredible revolutionary potential and pursuing that idea will drive you off a cliff. The Coney 2012 guy is the perfect example he ended up going insane on bath salts and jacking off nude and a highway in San Diego and that's why it's just funny. This or that group is going to try they're trying to get us to war with China. They're they're trying to normalize a new cold war or a new escalation with China. That's built in the U.S will have some sort of escalating conflict with China who knows where it reaches its Tipping Point I mean maybe we are able to establish some sort of new Cold War deal that is advantageous to both sides and provides a new platform you know for a new Bipolar World Order people talk about multi-polarity but nobody really wants multi-polarity because what is multi-polarity but the situation that you had in Europe in 1914. Nobody wants a genuine situation of multiple medium-sized Powers competing with one another on a global framework because that is global war. It has to be now two big powers mutually assured with a mutually distured destruction situation that can be managed as the Cold War was I will go back to letterbox. If Twitter actually does end up dying I just I don't wanna. I don't need more.

Enough I don't want to make it worse. Although I did see plane I saw the me movie plane with Gerard Butler which I gotta say delightful the kind of movie that you that they increasingly don't make just a solid tight like 95 minute movie. Solid action scenes where you can actually see what's happening and I gotta say if they were using if they weren't using squibs in that movie if they were using CGI for the blood hits then there that some of the best CGI blood I've yet seen in a movie. There's a couple of shots in there that it's like I don't know man that had to have been squibs and if not then I bow to them for for busting that one out because I did not think it was possible and one of the best things about. It is that it's got the coolest thing you can have in an action movie in my opinion which is a Barrett 50 caliber sniper rifle. There's towards the end of the movie. There's there these mercs are unloading their gear and there's one dude busts out of Barrett and I'm looking at it like oh oh and then sure enough a little later on just blowing guys away through like engine blocks. You can't beat it. It's wonderful and they let They let Gerard Butler do the Scottish accent. They let him be Scottish for once which I'm sure he appreciated. Although it's actually pretty interesting. He has like kind of a half-assed Scottish accent. Now it's almost like trying to not do it for so long has warped it Charlie human style into this weird hybrid accent so yeah thumbs up for playing very very encouraging to see that that kind of movie can still get a theatrical release. Now I gotta see knock at the cabin don't spoil it one of the one of the finest film Minds of the current ERA. A guy named Lex G who is a locked account on Twitter pointed out that he he kind of has a hard time to just distinguishing M Night Shyamalan from Jordan. Peel and I'm like I read that I'm like thank you because I think that those guys are very similar and one thing that they have in.

Common is that neither one of them should direct their own scripts. They should be directors for hire because whatever the hell they're trying to do with their scripts almost never comes together but they're decent. They have decent visual Styles. They have decent eyes and we really got to blame Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino in the 90s people for getting it into people's head that you can't be a great director unless you write your own material. Almost none of the greatest directors wrote their own stuff. Very few. Spielberg doesn't write his own. They should just find a a good young screenwriter and make their own damn movies Ryan Johnson shouldn't do anything honestly. I mean I've never gotten anything out of his visual style either. In addition to me finding his screenplays. Just increasingly obnoxious I gotta say I've never liked the Ryan Johnson movie.

Everyone went crazy for Brick and I watched it and I'm like okay yeah. They're they're kids doing like gangster voices. What else and then I was deeply disappointed by Looper which I had been very much looking forward to seeing and you know the Last Jedi whatever it stinks. I'm sorry. I'm. It's not because I'm I think my non-gamergate type. Guy Bona fides are well established by this point. It's just over long and bad and yeah. It's the opposite of Return of the Jedi which is still Return of the Jedi just but if you just if you just do the opposite of what is expected you know Return of the Jedi retash. I'm sorry Empire Strikes Back. If you are just doing the opposite of an Empire Strikes. Back remake that you're still remaking Empire Strikes Back Knives Out was okay. I didn't hate it. I enjoyed watching it but it was fine fine. Capital small F fine was as much as I'm gonna go with knives out and then Glass Onion is just genuinely obnoxious. I have to say though compaganda. I like it.

I there are plenty of things that are complicated that I enjoy something being propaganda whatever the hell that means it's not going to make me not like it. That is not going to ever make me not want to not like a movie is if it makes cops look good if you want film if you want film in general to not make cops look good then you're looking for the you're looking at the wrong um artistic medium I mean Cinema and and it's a mutant stepchild television. They privilege action. They privilege positions of of command and Authority because that is where drama and narrative reside. So the figure of the police officer is going to be an incredibly fascinating one for the for the camera and and it's going to be impossible almost impossible to detach that character from some sort of sympathetic world that they're embodying and they're in in fish emission foreign. It's almost like all of the attempts to critically diagnose contemporary media end up letting contemporary media off the hook because you really are implying when you criticize things like propaganda you're implying that there is some sort of liberatory non-reactionary Cinema or television when in fact no the the the the forms themselves reaffirm these structures.

The thing is though is that these structures are separate from the way that these structures as imagined in the narrative are separate from their social form. Their social function I would say that like Law and Order the law order franchise specifically is another. It's an extra version. It's like it's so and the thing like those Network procedurals have a more specific agenda but again that's what you're going to see on television. There is no other version of police shows that are going to be on even streaming television. I don't think you have to condemn any form as fascist again. What does this mean at this point in history. What does fascist mean at this point in history when we are de-politicized when we don't have political subjectivity that can be socially magnified when all of our political subjectivity only bleeds off leaving us to enact our zombie-like adherence in advance to capitalism's demands. I think you just need to engage with it with the understanding that none of it is going to change anything that they're that they're the Shadows on the wall that we we absorb that it is the circuit. It's the cultural circuit that matters not any discrete element within it. Same thing with the internet do I have a favorite prosthesis of a historical figure the one that I have had in my head.

The longest is Peter. Stuyvesant's Peg Leg I've talked about this last week about how apparently the kids today don't learn about Peter Stuyvesant. But he's one of like 10 historical figures that I remember from like Elementary School history and social studies well this because it was he had gold bands around the peg. Leg Rasputin did not have a prosthetic dick. They just cut it off after he died that's not the same thing Tycho brahee's tin knows is good that is the same five Ascent that they named the Stuyvesant houses after yes in Manhattan. Peter folk did have a glass eye as did Sandy Duncan Sammy Davis Jr and Big Bill Haywood Big Bill Haywood who was the leading figure in the iww and the Socialist Party and the early minors unions in the West He had a. He had a glass eye and he would imply in speeches that he got it in the course of his life as a toiler because he was a guy who had spent a life you know as an actual laborer. He was not an intellectual. He used to say I haven't read Marx's Capital but I have the marks of capital all over my body but in actuality He lost his eye because when he was a kid he was whittling a stick and he accidentally stabbed himself with his knife in the eyeball gotsvan barelykins.

 iron hand also good I mean it makes somebody's saying that the piracy the Golden Age of piracy is happening. At the same time. We don't really talk about it on the show but we could do a whole. Subsidiary series on how piracy forms out of this the Caribbean Caribbean piracy. The Golden Age piracy is born out of the 17th century crisis because that is one of the things you could do instead of submit yourself to this machine of annihilation is to opt out and just go out and steal some. Especially since you could get at least some sort of legal protection if you could get a letter of Mark and become a privateer that meant that you could be a pirate and there could still be ports open to you where you wouldn't have to worry about getting strung up does.

Everyone doesn't even know if the child. This balloon is Chinese or are they just saying it's Chinese. How would you know are they tracking. It did they see it get released in China and they've been watching. It come across the Pacific. This it got like it's got like is it shaped like a dragon oh. So if China has apologized for it. They said my bad so wait a minute oh okay. They're saying. It's a weather instrument. Okay I mean probably would you say is that a good spy mechanism. I mean it seems like it does the opposite of everything that Espionage is supposed to do which is primarily about doing things secretly anyway. As you can tell I have not been following the Chinese balloon story and I just do not give a I absolutely cannot care seems like some people like with everything else they're hoping. It's going to cause a nuclear war. They're scared of it but they actually want it to happen like people want all of this to fall apart one way or the other so that they have to get they don't have to live in.

This agonized tension people want finality and I think that the essence of maturity really if there is anything to it is coming to terms with that tension and living within it and accepting it. And the movement towards politics and specifically radical or esoteric politics is the attempt to push beyond that is an attempt to try to find some psychic Escape from the ambiguous tension of just like living at the in the thrall of forces beyond your control foreign. But I think we're finding now in the aftermath of 2020 and everything else and certainly the aftermath of the 2022 midterms at least for me. A realization that the pool of people who are drawn to the political as an escape valve is limiting self-limiting and I think a number of people are going to realize that what they really want especially the people who have decided to become a reactionary radicals. They're gonna find that the system as is is going to give them what they want like. The performance of politics is just to distance himself from the full implications of what that is because it's also going to give them everything they don't want but those two things are inextricably linked the Nightmare and the the fantasy of annihilation. The nightmare being of being dominated by the other in one form or another and the fantasy of dominating the other are both contained within capitalists death. Spiral capitalism is death.

Spiral I have not seen Family Guy in 20 years probably yeah so the jobs report came out and it's 500 000 jobs. I don't know man you've got you got the Federal Reserve just mashing the recession Button as crazily as it can because that's the only only lever it has to do anything about inflation but inflation does seem to be coming down anyway. Even though jobs have not come down yet like employment hasn't come down if it doesn't feel like anybody knows what the is going on. I'm actually the least of all me I mean I've been sitting over here like cringing waiting for a huge 2008 style economic crash to happen for like the last six months and it's nowhere in sight. So this is all and of course my my waiting for that was part of that very same fear slash desire for a paradigm rupturing event and what I'm trying to come to terms with is that I maybe that'll happen. But I cannot 

I cannot continue to assume. It's going to happen or or sit in kind of paralyzed expectation. I I just have to keep moving forward I mean the thing is is of course. We are in the middle of a paralyzing rupturing Paradigm rupturing event. The problem is is that you don't get a new paradigm until later and nobody is going to be able to recognize the paradigm shift until it has already occurred. So we're sort of cursed to live through a breach without getting any of the catharsis. That living through a breach is in our minds that we imagine we would be able to enjoy the the compensation for the the tumultuous and agonizing times. So I'm just trying to live and right now that means trying to find a new project.

Now that hello presidents is largely done. We have we have to do the interviews for the auxiliary episodes we're going to be doing those in the next month. Those will come out at the end of the series which I'm very glad. We're doing because I know I know that as people are listening to the pods I'm sure there's stuff that they are like wait a minute you know what about this and what about like stuff that we don't really have time to go through. And I'm hoping that these episodes will the auxiliary episodes will fill in those gaps. I the menu is okay it needed to be more perverse in my opinion it needed to go it needed to get more sick. You need to go more sicko mode.

[35:15](https://youtu.be/T5vtknMn9GM?t=35m15s)

It's it's in that that neither fish nor foul genre flash like issues movie limbo. Someone says can you talk more about the Italian words. We're going to be talking to the war nerd about the Italian Wars and the entire military revolution in one of the subsidiary episodes. So there you go foreign parasite. I don't know if I've said this before. But I saw parasite in the theater after everyone was creaming themselves and I was like what this is. This is just another over long Korean movie that I don't really like that much it was okay. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was robbed at the Oscars. That year. There's an AI YouTuber a v tuber whatever the of course there is I didn't know that but of course what do they do what are they talking about everyone talks about the nice guys and I wish I loved the nice guys. It's just every scene feels like it's almost getting to a point of being really good and then it just doesn't do it. So it uses the chat thing to reply to chat messages and then just plays a video game with AI That's Awesome. What does it look like what is the like. What's the Fate is. It is it does it look like Max Headroom does it look like a human does it have a bunch of fingers. It looks like an anime girl what a shot foreign the scene where Ryan Gosling punches the window and cuts. His hand cuts his thing and has to go to the hospital. That's very good. That's my favorite part. Yeah.

I think of that the same way I think of inherent Vice which is another movie where I'm like all the way on the film side. I'm leaning forward I'm waiting for that click and then it just doesn't come and I know that with inherent Vice that's like the point but okay it's that's not working for me people were posting the Babylon ending montage and I in context I don't know in context. It wasn't bad watching in the theater I kind of liked it. Because it is the movie is about you know the death of Cinema. So it makes sense that it does gives you this DMT. You know look back at this thing and then you know the the collapse into unstructured Sight and Sound. Foreign lake is great wonderful film definitely one of the top movies to watch if you want to understand the crisis of masculinity in the post-2009 world. The the the everybody who's decided to become a conspiracy researcher on the internet is perfectly represented in this movie and I gotta say that the fact that Babylon like was a big bomb really does put the button on the entire thing. It's a little ribbon so this is interesting.

Somebody says what's good about Tarantino and I understand the case against him But I think the reason that he is not what his critics say is is because yes vapid child's brain that's regurgitating a lifetime of of consuming pop culture crap absolutely but his formal rigor like the way that he he he he conceives of shoot scenes. Paces his films is like a Counterpoint to the content in every way like it's it's this and it's that contrast between this yeah juvenile baby brain. Pop culture addicted creative toolbox in a container of like very rigorous. And non-indulgent for the most part like there's a couple scenes where he just like let's rip but he does not give you the sort of easy indulgent catharsis that the Cinema that he's riffing on is based on and that is an interesting counter play and the the contrast between those things makes his movies interesting to watch like take and glorious bastards. For example which I think is up there with his best films maybe his best movie he's riffing.

On. These you know World War II Men on a mission movies like Dirty Dozen and and the Original Italian and glorious bastards. You know where eagles stare and guns and Navarone and all that stuff and it doesn't have any of the. Movie theater so yes it's like it's it's Pastiche but it is corralled within this like weirdly because the thing is he didn't just watch all the crap. He also watched a lot of good movies. A lot of you know artistic films and so there's like this conscious and subconscious working together to produce this thing that is at the very least just narcotically entertaining foreign is one of my favorites of his is because it does move Beyond pastiche to self-awareness to look back on like the the psychic implications of of film viewership. Collective specifically theatrical Collective film experience. And its contribution to you know the creation of National and political narratives that's actually very interesting. So is he did he just say the same he said he's going to do a John Brown biopic. He says He said he's gonna do a million things. He said he was going to do a Star Trek movie. I'll believe it when I see it and yes he does. He does the same thing thank you. He does the same thing with Inglorious Bastards he does the same thing in once upon a time once upon a time in Hollywood talk about like you know the the The American Dream Factory which is not coincidentally part of why that is another one of his very best films. It's very fun God Tarantino doing a John Brown movie. That's so funny just the reason.

It's the reason I can't get mad at. It is again you got this white kid who grew up with Black Culture fetishizing it the way that the way that generations of young white men did and then that fetishization turning into this you know desire to affirm solidarity with black people in a way that only John Brown in American history really does embody so of course you're going to make the John Brown movie where he's a badass killing on behalf of black people which he already really ripped on in Django unchanged with the Unchained with the character of of Dr King hilariously named Dr King Schultz. But I thought that's Django which I also like I like all of his movies is interesting because again he gets a little. Beyond this the wish fulfillment and the Pastiche and a little reflective because in that movie you've got the situation spoiler alert but you should have seen it by. Now They go to the plantation to try to trick candy into giving over Django's wife and they they figure them out and they force him to sign to pay like full price full Freight for her. But they have the money so they're. Gonna make the deal and then he's like you gotta shake my hand Leonardo DiCaprio's like you gotta shake my hand and he goes to shake his hand and of course he does.

The the gun boom blows him away and then he just turns to Django and he goes. I'm sorry I couldn't resist before getting killed and then you know Django's got to kill all those guys and he's got to escape from the Australians including hilariously Quentin Tarantino go back and save his wife and that all happens just because Dr King Schultz is too self-centered two conceited too fixated on affirming his superiority to the other white people around him that he up this chance to save this guy's wife. He he condemns them in effect to death out of a selfish need to be better than other white people. If he was really going to be an ally he would have just taken it on. The chin shook the guy's hand and gotten out of there so that makes me interesting to see how he would take something that reads much more as just pure Indulgence like a John Brown biopic and complicates it. I mean I would I'm not going to not watch it that would never happen Michael Shannon by the way if you can if you've got casting ideas Clinton and you you don't listen to this. But if anyone knows him get it to him Michael Shannon as John Brown please and it's not just because you know he's a stentorian badass.

[48:27](https://youtu.be/T5vtknMn9GM?t=48m27s)

It's because he has played people with like non-sane degrees of certainty about their world like have anyone seen bug a little William friedkin movie based on a Tracy. Let's play take shelter is another good example because if you do to do John Brown well you don't make him just a righteous you know um font of virtue. You don't just make them a raving maniac. You have to convey that he genuinely was insane like if if given what we understand historically. What does it mean to be insane what is insanity He was in that he was living in another world than everyone else around it wow but the world he was living in is one that Accords to deeper truths than were applicable or are understandable at the time.

If I if I want to do a thing about John Brown it would not be about John Brown. Specifically it would be a part of some old history. I honestly don't think it would be straight out history it would have to be all like an old history premise like threaded through something else where John Brown hooks up with Karl Marx after he moves to Texas which is something that he was very much considering doing in the 1840s foreign. But if you're going to do a straight John Brown thing instead of doing a biopic which is bad I think you do a a keyhole segment in the life. I feel like that is the best way to convey any kind of story about historical figures not to do any kind of long-range biopic. It's a incident or like a a constrained era within someone's life and I think that for John Brown I think I might end it with the osawatomi massacre which is really when he decides to take. Take the plunge into like violent opposition to slavery which before he had not really done.

Although man it would also be something to do with a movie that was just about Kansas because there's some wild. In there like he's getting into these massive shootouts with like huge detachments of of pro-slavery militia men to the point where he just can show up on a battlefield show up in a conflict and the other side will literally just run away. But you know that's indulgent power that's intelligence fantasy for a liberal contemporary audience. They get to watch that and be like that's me. It is wild how a few things there are about Bleeding Kansas in popular culture. The only really thing the only real thing about about the Harpers Ferry raid is the movie The Santa Fe Trail which is in the 50s where John Brown's the bad guy and Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan play George Custer and George Pickett I think the John and the the um the Ethan Hawke show I've said before I really did not like it got a little better as it went along but it the whole tone was wrong and Hawk's performance was kind of embarrassing. It was it was far too self-aware of its moment and and it had to it was compelled to make him into kind of a funny crazy person like humorously crazy because you know you have to defuse that religious element that the popular contemporary audience can't process and I honestly think that would be the most interesting thing about a Tarantino John Brown movie.

How would he handle the religiosity I haven't seen clerics 3. Yet I should I've seen too many Kevin Smith movies. I was born at exactly the right period to get Kevin Smith full in the face so I saw clerks too. For example I I I I tapped out a while ago but it's way too many to have seen and I should definitely see clerks three even though I'm sure it's terrible that that Jay and Silent Bob rebooted thing was unwatchable. Everybody has a heart attack in the movie well right. What you know didn't. He have like a massive heart attack and almost die well the thing is is that Kevin Smith was ruined like many artists are by success. Like his he got Successful by writing his life which as being a cashier type loser in in New Jersey. But once you're in Hollywood you gotta write other stuff and he didn't know anything about that foreign. I mean you don't have to be ruined by that experience if you challenge yourself and I think that Kevin Smith did challenge himself if you see the movies he made after he got big.

He's trying different forms different ideas. He's getting ambitious like Dogma even though it's pretty. Dumb is like this ambitious attempt to cap to challenge to tackle religious questions he made that Jersey girl like he tried to make like a a studio romantic comedy type thing and they were mostly bad and people told them. They sucked and he decided well fine. You I'll just play with my toys like you hit you hit your point you hit your sweets. You hit your limit of talent and then you have to deal with it. And I gotta say just deciding to have making fun movies with your friends. You know it doesn't matter that they're bad if you're having a good time and your dwindling audience still likes them. There's worse things to do with your time. Thank you I mean he never learned to direct is the thing he never learned how to actually move a camera around and that's what he should have been focusing more on than the content.

I was only in San Francisco for like a day I I did not have time to to hang around sadly. It is it is probably the prettiest American city in its layout. I don't know how you beat that the hills next to the bay that's really hard to beat but you know filled with texcom Seattle I've been to Seattle Seattle's very pretty. You've got the sound but I don't know man those Hills like I was just I was in I was in the cab driving downtown and just just driving into the city. You've got all the stuff the hills man come on. I like one thing I enjoy in a city and and you get them more on the west coast than anywhere else is is a vertical geography. La has that too to an extent Vancouver is very pretty. Like you can't the east west coast cities just as As Natural environments are I don't know no one can compare compare to them in my opinion in in in the continent. I do think La is actually very pretty because of that because the fact that you see. Hills you see you see in a a geographic assertion and then people build around it foreign ugliest City. That's a good question I haven't obviously been to everyone I've been to a good number of cities.

Though I mean Indianapolis is hard to argue for just like the state of Indiana Detroit is sparked. There's too much Pathos in Detroit for it to be ugly honestly like as gross as it is. It's. It's It stirs the heart in a way I've never been to Jacksonville I've heard a tell on Earth. I haven't been to Phoenix either which is another one that makes me feel. Like It would be an absolute nightmare.

Philadelphia is pretty ugly now that I think about it of East Coast cities. Baltimore too I don't know I like Cleveland I have a soft spot for Cleveland Cleveland's like Milwaukee. Like those pure strained Rust Belt cities speak to me especially anything that's on Lake Michigan. If you have the lake you have a something going for you. She got the slopes coming down to the peninsula between the three rivers get out of here foreign but you cannot. It is an eyesore like it is genuinely a offensive and abrasive to look at but the one thing that is good about. It is that there are like nearby Hills and like small mountain ranges near it which I really do enjoy because that is like the the Glo that's the the the CL. The clock of the earth like just ticking just you know reminding you of you of of the short time that a Abomination like Las Vegas could possibly exist on the earth. It's like when when they would do a a um when they would do a Triumph in in ancient Rome and some guy would come back from you know defeating the Gauls and they'd they'd have the big parade through the city and he'd be riding his Chariot. He'd have a slave sitting standing next to him just to tell them and saying is here you are mortal you're mortal and in Las Vegas those Hills that you can see from the street are are that voice like this is not.

Gonna last Chicago once again. You got Lake Michigan. You got a lot there. If you got Lake Michigan. It's got some nice neighborhoods but I don't know I'll always have some I'll. I'll never be able to fully Embrace anything about Illinois being from Wisconsin. Even though it's dumb and tribal. The the Midwest is the American Balkans. You know so we take that seriously. We've talked about that on the stream before yes Chicago is Dubrovnik correct I think we tried to go through this before I can't really get it to map out. But all I know is that Ohio is Serbia the rest of it. I don't know I do want to come to Toronto I've only been to Vancouver into Canada. I wanted we want to do a Canadian tour and I think we will try to do that this coming year in 2023. We'll see I want to go to. I definitely want to go to Quebec. I want to go to Montreal want to go. I want to even see the Prairies I want to see this the hell. The hell dimension of Canada Arkansas is not. The Midwest. Arkansas is a Southern State.

What are you talking about Missouri. Isn't even the Midwest get out of here. Oh I've played geoguessr. I'm no good at it. I don't know any of the tricks that make people like Michael Hudson good at it. Somebody says which Ohio city is Belgrade Columbus the capital because it's because Belgrade is notoriously ugly and Columbus is the least visually enticing City of the big. Three sea cities in Ohio Cleveland and Cincinnati are both much more much better looking than Columbus Missouri. St Louis has like an exemption St Louis is like It's like kaliningrad you know like that's part of Russia. But it's not connected to Russia and it's surrounded by Lithuania or whatever St Louis is the Midwest but the rest of Missouri I'm sorry. It's a border state. No state that had slavery in 1860 can be in the midwest. I'm.

Sorry Canada is to America what Scotland was to the English Empire and not a coincidence. A huge percentage of the Anglo settlers in Canada are Canadian. I always think it's funny you just look at the cast of the of Kids. In the Hall. You've got a McKinney a McDonald and a McCullough. They got the Scots and America got the Irish basically because the Irish wanted to get the out of the United Kingdom and its Dominion well. The Irish ended up in New England was this a east to west type situation the French r d the Irish or Canada but they got their own area which is interesting whereas the Irish sort of had to share power. They weren't able to create. They were. They were able to create like parallel institutions as opposed to just like dominate cultural institutions if they'd like Turned Boston into like a Quebec type deal.

That's interesting would there have been like a quiet revolution in the 60s I guess we had a quiet Revolution. It was the it was force busting I do Marvel at any of the separatist movements in in the Western countries. At this point like Quebec Scotland Catalonia even Irish unification what are you getting out of it again. There's only one Authority and it's transnational. I mean Ireland really did just you know give sovereignty from London to Brussels by joining the EU the way they did and now they're just a parking lot for American Finance Tech capital foreign for Independence is like Cambodian style. Autarky like yeah we're gonna. We're gonna be an independent Catalonia and also we're gonna make all of our own stuff and we're not going to depend on any exports or Imports and we're going to use our own our own system of like coupons and ration books and we're going to be a collective social.

Enterprise. All right go for it good luck. I wish you well but if you're just gonna be like.

I'm we're independent. But we're also still depending on the same. Capital flows that we always have then what the are you getting what are you getting out of it. In the case of Catalonia. It's literally I don't have to pay taxes for those lazy Galatians anymore. Like in that respect the only like really The only separatist movements that have any juice are the ones where like they're gonna. You know impose like a q Imperium like wigsit or like Eastern Washington or something like that is. That's that is a 

That's National Suicide like that's that is taking the bull by the horns because really all we're seeing now in this play between right and left on the international stage and the national politics is two two groups of people who know at some level that we are circling a drain towards Annihilation and why not that we're all going to die not that humanity is going to die out but that our understanding of what it is to be human will be annihilated and the liberal left wants to deny that wants to assert some fantasy of escape from it and enact the politics that attempts to escape from it. But what's this only actually reinforces it as it must and then you have this extraction petrocapitalism. This the the fixed regimes of capital all around the world which are claiming instead ownership over annihilation and finding through the conscious drive towards Annihilation meaning and that is a thing that they have over the level left and that will help them.

I mean it doesn't. The thing it must be stressed is that this contest who's going to win is functionally meaningless because it cannot be won by either side and it is the fighting of it that turns the screw of History into the ground but in terms of recruiting people into it. The advantage that the right formation has is it does offer a genuine fantasy of cathartic apotheosis within politics whereas the left liberal Vision insists on denial and sublimation of what we really know of our real feelings and they continued in acting of a fantasy politics that requires you know a certain set of speech in a certain set of of virtue ethics that are meant to meant to drive us towards a expanded vision of humanity but in reality just end up acting as weapons that we wield against each other and ourselves due to our deep self-loathing and our inability to detach from enacting our own destruction. The right alternative though the irrationalist push says no through the process of accepting all of our basis darkest urges and turning them into virtues and willing ourselves towards describing an Annihilation as our goal even if we're going to be blown up by the same impersonal forces of history that are going to chew us up regardless of who's in power as it trades back and forth our engagement in politics is genuinely cathartic genuinely liberatory in a way that the left the liberal left can't be but both of them assume at base that the current order is doomed and inextricable doomed and fixed and the challenge is to resist the Despair and self-loathing on the one hand or the the cathartic nihilism on the other and insist on denying yourself those those packets of psychic energy and instead coming to terms with the impossibility of politics at the current moment and the necessity of any real politics meaning a break. A break with consent the the the the giving over of consent resistance basically like real resistance and that is the thing that all above ground politics assumes as impossible is Meaningful resistance because that means meaningful Danger and no conscious politics can absorb can process that because everyone who is into politics is in it for pleasure individual pleasure the despair of the end of History the despair of the end of politics because there's nothing inextricable and and inevitable about what exists if people stopped consenting. If they resisted I mean that sounds vacuously obvious and yes it is. But it's also a reality that cannot be touched by given political language that is why real politics is occurring right. Now it is occurring outside of Politics as we recognize it. I mean I say this mostly to myself to prevent to talk myself out of indulging in the the orb pondering and and surrendering to the a a discursive structure within politics that to invest in which I did was for a long time and and now I'm kind of like like. This is basically like Methadone for me I should get a Cabinet of Curiosities like old Rudolph.

[81:54](https://youtu.be/T5vtknMn9GM?t=81m54s)

The second I got a few things but they're not that interesting like my Cabinet of Curiosities is like this guy. There we go yes. I have a Funko Pop. No I did not buy it. Chris got this for me because he knows that I enjoy muncher as a as a meme and as a character. This is muncher so yeah I don't have unicorn horns I don't have. I don't have grimoires with like the the devil's home address in it all that kind of cool stuff This was a gift from for my wife because when I was a kid the California Raisins were big and they released in at Hardee's. That's what Carl's Jr is called east of the Mississippi. They had a promotion where you could get one of these guys with your meal and I at that I was in elementary school and I was playing the saxophone in band. I was very bad at it. I couldn't read sheet music and so I ended up quitting because I'm dumb. But I really wanted this guy. I wanted the saxophone playing raisin and I kept bugging my parents to take me to Hardee's and one day they finally did it. And I was so excited that I have one of those you know. I only have a few like really embedded memories of being a kid a little kid but one of them is me in line at the hearties doing a little saxophone like in my hand like a like air saxophone like moving my legs because I was so excited about getting this goddamn California raisin and then we get there to the counter.

We order the food and they say can. We get a raisin like nope that's only for breakfast who's going to Hardee's for breakfast. So I never got it. I never got it. I told that story to Amber and then she got me this guy so this is my. This is this is what I have instead of all that cool. Rudolph had I should meet some Alchemists though I should I should find some Alchemists. They've got to be some. I mean I mean I'm in California. After all there's got to be some. Alchemists around here somebody brewing a big pot of piss.

I just it can't be anything having to do with computers. No one is being liberated by computers. There is no techno Horizon of salvation for the human race that is that is a chimera that is a fantasy that is that is That is a literal trap. Set by the devil technology must be suborned. It cannot be Unleashed. I mean it's already Unleashed anybody's saying like oh we need to unleash more they don't understand. It's as Unleashed as it can get because we are at the stage where if a thing can be thought of it will be and it will be invented and it will be then applied. We are at the mercy of Technology. It does not. We do not get to decide we we have a we have an algorithmically generated social structure right now and it is a question whether any human formation can truly Master technology to a human purpose. I mean that we can is the dream of humanism. It's the dream of you know the the entire human tradition and a lot of those right. Wingers the the esoteric ones specifically the neo-reactionary types. Their starting premise is that they can't that can't happen that that we are and always will be enslaved to our technology. And so we should then embrace it rather than try to deny it.

But that is a surrender that I don't think needs to be made. I I think it is. It is a failure of of the of the imagination and the Heart is is failing the test that we are all put to to live on while living on this Earth and I do think that there is some degree to which our lives on Earth are are a trial. But I do not think it is to test our worthiness to ascend to heaven or whatever all of our inputs are building a knowledge that is applied elsewhere Another Place Another Time and so the Judgment that we think adheres to our actions is not applicable. It doesn't stick so I think we are all saved at the end of the day but that very fact the fact that we are all saved is exactly what gives us the necessity of acting for the good. Someone wants to know what saved means I don't really know. It's just a feeling that I have I don't I think that it is not a individual experience. It is just a phenomenon a general phenomenon of recognition and Reconciliation form of which I could not even begin to imagine all right talk next week peace.
