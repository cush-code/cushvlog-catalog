There we go there I am hello howdy joke folks. Howdy jokes hi jokers heidi tokers howdy midnight smokers getting your loving on the run. Sure don't want to hurt no one one of the worst songwriters in american history. The opposite of bob dylan steve miller. So today. I wanted to start by talking about special effects in movies because someone tweeted today that they were that they had watched me recommend the blob remake. The 80s blob remake with I believe kevin dillon jeffrey de mon written by frank darabont and they said that it was great and they were glad. They hid and I got to have a little bit of a chat online about the wondrousness of the 80s. Sci-fi remakes all of which are great but which I think a blob is honestly the by far. The most underrated one and I think in in argument really for the best. It's that one or the the thing in my opinion and it's close. It might be a toin flip in my opinion um and of course one of the things that make both those movies great is practical special effects and all the things special effects are pretty well known. They're sort of the gold standard. People always talk about the thing but I really feel like the blob might even have more impressive special effects and it doesn't get talked about nearly as much the blob.

In that movie is this it doesn't eat people the way that the jello mold steve mcqueen blobbed people. It dissolved people and you could see through it. You could see people being eaten in by the acidic blob and they showed it. They showed people having their faces melted off on scramble. They saw the guy get pulled down. Entire body pulled down through a garbage disposal and it's also very nasty. It's like it's willing to kill children it has very funny reagan-era politics because the blob obviously the original 50s movie people took that at face value this is about communism big red blob coming to get everybody you know you could also say no. It's actually anti-communism. No it's actually 50s 50s conformity whatever any way you slice it. It's pretty The surface was certainly supposed to be anti-communism. It's red.

It's a big red blob come on but even the surface text of the blob remake is very like pissed off. 80s left in exile because instead of the blob being an alien creature the blob is actually the result of a us government experiment by carried out by the military to create a super weapon and when the government scientists come up come around they're willing to kill everybody spoiler alert. Although it's it's not really part of the it doesn't really matter kill everybody to preserve it and then another bad guy is like this holy rolling preacher played by del close who founded the chicago chicago second city. I believe it's like. It's the classic reagan era left-wing boogeyman of the military-industrial complex and evangelical protestantism but anyway very good movie and the practical effects are a big reason why and it led to the whole see the classic cgi. Practical effect argument you know practical effects are better and then people say no cgi is more versatile and the thing is is that on the question of practical versus cgi.

I would actually say that that is you could that could be boiled down to a matter of taste um because as much as I might be a practical guy because I grew up with them. I'm an analog guy at the end of the day. I'm oregon trail generation. I'm I remember getting computers so that means. I'm not a digital native. So that means that I have a certain expectation of presence on screen whereas kids who grew up on video games which are all cgi and then cartoons and stuff much more and then of course everything online that's all smoothed out. It doesn't they're not missing what I'm missing and so you know okay fair we've heard of that and in addition to that there's a genuine trade-off because one of the problems with practical effects is movement fluidity. It's very hard to make a practical effect look like it's moving across a room. How do you create something that's like a robot most of those robots and stuff. They have you know limits to how far they can go because they're not full auto automatons. That's the technology. That's it's too much. It's unnecessary You can you can cheat but it looks like it's cheating a little bit like that's where that's where stop motion comes in.

That's where green screens all of these things don't look perfect whereas the promise of cgi is pure fluidity of motion. Now you could say well. I don't like fluidity of motion and I don't care about fluidity. Emotion compared to concrete sense pres sense of presence on screen. I'd say amen but I will acknowledge that there are people especially younger people for whom that distinction doesn't matter and they like the fluidity of cgi so. I'm willing to write that off as just generational and aesthetic. But there is one thing that I will not and that is cgi gunshots and blood splat. The cgi bullet holes going into people and there's blood coming out of people from shot from being shot in my opinion that is not a question of generation. It's not a question of aesthetic preferences. Cgi blood and gunshots look bad. They are inferior in a meaningful objective or close to objective sense and what I mean by that is this for now cgi blood and blood and gunshots and this is not objection. This is not something that's arguable. I don't think don't look real. They don't look real that's not. I don't think that's the thing you have to like argue with somebody with even even a damn zoomer. I think the argument would be what difference does it make just like it is with that cgi creature. Doesn't look real well.

It can move on screen which like a puppet couldn't to which I say no in a horror all bets are off but in action. It is paramount like the point of showing blood coming out of somebody when they get shot in an action scene is to see what is as close as possible to the image of a human being being shot with a gun. That's what establishes the stakes in action films. That's what we're there to see. We're there to see damage being done to characters to enjoy the visceral as in gut-based satisfaction of seeing violence done to somebody who isn't me which is a deep lizard thing in people um and also to establish stakes for what will happen to our characters who we love hopefully. If the good if the good is the movie is good and I would say that cgi blood and bullet wounds do not look that way and therefore they cannot fulfill the role that gunshots in an action movie are supposed to do.

They can't do it. They can't do the job and that means that they are inferior inherently and that's my take on that and I say. I can't argue you can argue but you're wrong. That's one of those red lines like. I'm all about you know. It's all about there's no binaries until you get to 51. You know and I'm way past 51 on this one. I'm near 100 on this one um but yet fewer and fewer films feature squibs and blood even big budget hollywood movies that's crucial here. It's not technically a question of cost. Big movies could technically afford squibs and that is why for a long time I yelled at movies that didn't use squibs because it felt like they were cheaping out on purpose and I've had a creeping realization lately especially. I saw after I saw the five bloods the new spike lee movie on netflix and they used all not only cgi bullet wounds. But cgi gun flashes. They didn't. The punisher series on netflix did that too they didn't even put blanks through the guns and it was awful like and they had to pretend to have recoil like all the actors. The gun wasn't firing so they didn't. They didn't have like actual recoil at all they had to pretend. It was like bang bang bang bang bang. It was like kids playing dress-up and I was like how could spike leave let this happen but I think what I've done what's dawned on me especially seeing like a movie by a real movie maker. Not some.

Hack that was like that is that I don't think that that I think we've reached the point on squibs that we reached with cgi a while ago where these are not questions that are being raised anymore. You know it's like when when spike lee signs on to direct a movie. At no point is there a discussion about whether it's going to be in color or other than unless. He's got a hair up his ass or like whether it's going to be shot on digital unless you have a specific hair up your ass. Those things are all assumed yeah. We're going to use digital cameras because those are cheaper you know we'll use. Cgi we'll use where we can. We'll use green screens that's built in there's and I'm feared. I'm afraid now that we have reached the point where bullsh gunshots which are objectively inferior Cgi gunshots have been baked into the new understanding of where the budget goes um and that to me is awful and depressing and sucks because I don't know if. I'm going to see any good action movies anymore every time. I see an action movie. Now. I'm just holding my breath for the first gunshot and then I either turn it off or if it's got anything else going for it. I watch it and just at the every gun every gun play scene. I just get a little more deflated so many movies. I think are really good and get undermined on that one way. I can't distract myself from like the purge films for example and then but then if I see it oh my god and there are so many dog.

Squibs I mean and that's what I mean is what I mean is that it's not technically about money because like there are squibs in in movies that guys made in their backyards in the 80s like staphon. If anyone's ever watched best of the worst redliner media you know stuff like get even and these weird vanity movies that like local real estate magnates and they have they have squibs you couldn't afford squibs. But they I think it's been phased out of even even on the on the on the budgets. At this point. It's not an object. It's not a unless you insist on it like. I don't think tarantino's ever going to make a movie with whibs no matter what but of course he can make that argument because he is a big money. These movies they sell so he gets to stake the terms for even directors. A lot of directors don't have the ability to make those demands and I think the reason for that is that this is this thing where this is literally and fully the fault of capitalism.

This is an example where you can see objectively the way that the artistic integrity of films like any other artwork are undermined by the degree to which they have to adhere to market logic. It's a genuine case. It's like darwin's finches if you want to argue about capitalism destroys culture and argue that culture cannot be progressive in the way that liberals want it to be and think that they can make it and make that make everything good. No. It dissolves like acid all qualities and I know I mean obviously that means ideological but it also just means aesthetic. It literally just means a commitment to art as an expression of human beauty. A all artists is trying to is trying to present a perfect image from the mind somehow a crystalline connection to the unconscious and put that in the world in some form and filmmakers try to do it with movies and if they have had it written if it's been written out of the logic of filmmaking that you have you can't that you can have to show.

Cgi looking blood coming out of people you have undermined the artistic integrity of film and the reason they do. This is because it's way cheaper to use cgi for one reason. Cgi is compatible with the new gig economy prolific neoprolatinarianization that we're seeing our deprolitarization. We're seeing where people where the problem is that like the the the type of film economy that produced squibs doesn't exist anymore where you had union crews doing union jobs to to keep them happy because they were making all this money and they had to keep the workers happy and so if you want to have shoot a bunch of people with squibs and have them go off so satisfying you've got to have somebody rig up. The clothing. You got to wait around while you're getting to set up that and then set up the shot and then if anything goes wrong wrong. You gotta get a whole new wardrobe because you've ruined that one and then set up another rig and do it again. That is the compounding costs of that are tremendous whereas you're shooting people with cgi bullets. One shot everybody falls down you're happy with it.

Good you want two for safety go for it but then the real work is done by overtime certainly no union benefits. The costs are just so over time accumulative that the logic of filmmaking has now squeezed out a genuinely meaningful craft that undergirds a certain type of filmmaking and makes it what it is. It's very very very sad but it also shows like we've got to do this. We've got to get rid of this and of course you know a libertarian will try to jiu jitsu this and say well that's the fault of fat union contracts these guys these guys care more about making their union rate than making art to which I say should be all funded by the government. This should all be publicly funded. There shouldn't be any profit in it at all so your that objection is stupid but even if you accept that logic that well they should do it. They should do it for the love of it and they're ruining everything with their fat union contracts. It's very hot. That's why I'm sweaty. It's. It's no longer pleasant new york. It's it's oppressively human but even if those guys are even if those guys are working fiverr rates instead of union rates.

They still have to set up the shot probably going to not do as good a job as the guys used to pay more to do it by the way because why would they and they gotta supervise the work and it takes more time and time is the most precious commodity on a film set because the time that you're setting up a shot or dealing with a logistical issue is a time when a lot of people are not doing anything and that is just so the capitalist. The dagger to the heart. People standing around you got time enough to lean you got time enough to clean and cgi gun play especially in action. Movies that are heavy with it streamlines the the streamlines the amount of time. It takes you to make the movie just cuts. I don't know what it would be. But it's significant which means compounding.

Significant amount of money is saved by not having everybody sitting around for days on end while you set up shots of people getting shot with corn syrup and the thing is is like that's. That's not a problem that can be solved by doing away with cultural marxism and sjws. It's it's not. It's not a problem that can be solved by anything other than removing the the the decrepit code the the the um the monster in the machine. The capitalist profit motive. It's the only way to redeem this and yeah of course. People can point to good movies that still get made a lot of the time it boils down to either luck happenstance or it's just a few people. It's it's the same thing as the american economy. There's a there's a remaining hangover of people who are still holding on to those last bags of money.

Those last chunks of ice of of the ice of the sink of the melting the melting ice cap of post-war prosperity and that applies for directors too. There are guys who are still walking around with big around with a thing like squibs but those people are shrinking and shrinking in number and they're even their leverage is is declining over time so even if there's a few. I'm just saying treasure. The the really treasure the the gifts when they come aesthetically because they're going to be fewer and fewer farther farther between somebody pointed out the john wick movies one of the things that makes the john wick movie is just. I think I've come around to feel finding them very. I rewatched john wick 3 the other night. I'd only seen it after once in the theaters and I was like this is not. I don't like this actually.

I don't like this. I officially don't like it anymore and part of it is the fact that the plot is structured so that none of it has to happen. It's. It's one of those things that is well. You could have just started here at the end of the lap you could have left off where the last movie did in. Basically the same situation give or take so the whole plot is pointless and you know. It's obviously it's running out of maneuvers with the the choreography. They added some dogs but the monotony of the cgi blood splatter is so deadening and they do it better than most because they don't overdo it and they keep it dark that helps it hides the clash. They don't get the color right. They've never gotten the color right and of course we're not talking about real blood. We're talking about movie blood which is all you need them to look like and you know how you do that make some thing and you've got it infuriating so. I'm not looking forward to the next one. But I'll see it out of completism probably and you know people like to say oh what's tough with It's tough with john wick to use square squibs because there's so many head shots. One don't have as many headshots. Why does everything have to be a headshot if you have to compromise so. Deeply as in using cgi maybe don't do that but also you can. It's not impossible to do head shots and have you know just a little tube just some. Corn syrup sprashed on the back of the wall if you've gotta do cgi gun muzzle flash because you can't fire blank that close to someone's head okay. That's a concession to just logistics. But you can still you can still do and they don't. They don't do it three movies. They don't do it yeah. Early squibs weren't great either. The thing is even a bad. Squib is still still on screen and I feel like that is still going away from the need for as I said.

Realism is the point of bullet wounds in in action films. That's what makes it artistically fun and interesting so that's still not at the ideal. But it's already by virtue of really being on a screen and and actually having like fluidity that is not obviously uncanny valley-like. You're already up you're already up meanwhile after what 10 years now of hegemonic squibs blood cgi squibs as bad. As it ever has been. I saw I saw arms or guns akimbo. I saw guns.

Kimbo wretched film absolutely wretched film. One of the things was wretched about. It was the cgi blood which undermined the entire thing but I will say this because the whole movie is supposed to be like this. One of those dumb ass critiques of like the culture of spectacle and violence but you're not looking at real. Anything that even comes remotely close to real violence. You're looking at cgi graphics you've already. It's like I'm already playing a video game. You've lost it. You've lost your your connection to some sort of critique. This only works if I feel like these are real stakes but what scares me is if that movie had used cgi if that movie had used squibs especially considering how much violence was in it. I probably would have raved about it even though it's objectively terrible in every other way. I'm losing my ability to even you know feel like I'm really appreciating something or just happy to see something. That's not so distractingly terrible but those are the burdens we pair. In this life. Heavy is the head that eats the crayons so what are you guys up to oh god something happened to birth. Movie's death did they find out that all of those people are still devin ferracci under a screen name. I wouldn't be surprised. I've never seen any of them in person who knows if those are real people man that is an underrated terrible sight.

I mean the the the business model of that is hey what if we did sponsored promotion but didn't tell anybody. We were doing sponsored promotion yeah that's great because then you're making money no matter what you can you can you're pursuing the traditional click-based ad strategy of regular news or a regular entertainment news and opinion sites. But you're also getting paid under the table by the very studios you're reviewing the films of it's pretty impressive. It's a hell of a racket and then the fact that it was founded by a just awful unpleasant creep who who hilariously tried to come back as a born-again buddhist which is very funny for me to talk. But I wasn't being canceled when I decided to have some sort of spiritual experience. He essentially did the same thing that televangelists who get caught diddling the receptionist and pilfering from the poor box do which but because he's in california and he's amongst the libs he can't be christianity. So it's a nice eastern religion that feels worldy and and vaguely left-wing So now what happened did it collapse how do I feel like harmony corrin's movies. I'm up and down on corinne Gummo is really disturbing and memorable I never saw julian donkey boy. I'll admit.

I don't really like kids um. I just thought beach bum and was kind of underwhelmed although. I really really like jonah hill but I and I never. But I have to say I do really like spring breakers. I think that he really kind of he hit that one out of the park he kind of grooved it. It was one of those perfect situations where he got the the perfect marrying of subject matter and cast. Especially my god. Franco specifically is brilliant in that and vanessa vanessa hudgins is very good too and for in my money. There's fewer scenes that better define pre-covered late or early 20th cent 21st century. America than the look at my vampires. Apparently you cannot just have the full clip anywhere. There is a gregory brothers auto tune on that. I got shirts all colors. This is it no that's my favorite of his. I think that's pretty pretty universal opinion. I'll admit I'm not a huge malek guy. I'm not a malakian. I don't really vibe. I've liked some of his movies. But it's just not my. I don't know. I need more of a I think. I'm more of a lock. I don't know.

I try to I like I kind of lyrical filmmaking has never really spoken to me. I feel like maybe it's cheating a little bit because like mood and is what film is and what like the challenge of commercial filmmaking. Anyway is to shape it into. Something is to give it a spine and like the conflict between that like the conflict between the art and like the expressiveness of film and its narrative structure. The artificial imposition. I think that's what's interesting and I and for mount with malik. I don't feel enough of that. I don't feel the gear is more turning enough. I appreciate why people like it. It's just not for me. I like von trier. I have to say I thought that antichrist is brutal. Melancholy is great. The first half of nymphomaniac is really interesting. The second half is very bad and then the serial killer movie that apparently like everyone hated except for the people who love his. Is now on hulu but it's only like the hour the two and a half hour version. I kind of want to see the whole thing because netflix had the whole uncut nymphomaniac which is what I saw and I'd rather see the whole thing oh um. Dogville's also very good. I never got around to seeing mandalay maybe because I wasn't buying bryce dallas. Howard were you ever a big fan of john carpenter. Yeah.

I'm thinking I am considering. I think that he might be the best film. I think he's the best filmmaker of the 80s pound for pound. I mean it's that's a tough. That's a tough decade too because that was commercial filmmaking at its height because the studio system broke down just like every other like fortis modernist post-war concept in the 70s right and then an initial explosion of the of the financialized film industry. You know you had that at that glorious moment when money was going to everybody and all these fantastic auteurs got to make whatever they wanted almost and it was dizzying and and and awe-inspiring because you had this huge flow of money in an industry that was expected that was that was used to a certain degree of return. A certain relatively modest return on investment but then of course the go go 80s the explosion of credit and what do you know all of a sudden and then artistically the reply the result of that the birth of the blockbuster and a new paradigm. These movies can actually make a ton of money which means they're worth investing more money in so the movies become more larger spectacle more impressive visually. But they also have to make more money which means they have to be narratively more constrained in their ambition to be maximally acceptable to the audience and interesting to the audience. So the 70s is like the big bang explosion and then the stabilized new system the 80s the mature moment that's where you've got all the best blockbusters. That's where you've got spielberg in his height. That's where you've got semecus back to the future films. That's where you've got the best action films. Schwarzenegger's phenomenal work that nobody even remembers now. I mean maybe if I look back. I would it would be rose tinted glasses but I'm willing to bet that like if.

I went back and watched like romancing the stone that michael douglas kathleen turner like bogey and because throwback adventure movie. I bet that holds up better than anything similarly oriented in films in cinema. Now so you had blockbuster filmmaking the formula's greatest the biggest investment and and the biggest return but then over time what happens the aperture slows the money gush comes to a it. It loses its its hydraulic power competition right rises up shrinks shrinks the aperture even further and that means what happens is. It gets the money flow gets diverted and now there's a small amount of money for people who want to make very small films that can be released at this point now digitally entirely and not even go to cinemas and then films that require these massive massive massive budgets because all profits in the in the era of quantitative easing and financialization. All profits have to be massive messy massive. There's no more reasonable expectation of return. There's only a maximum return because of maximal investment and that means everything has to be as safe and bland and dog. As possible and now and now the fact that cgi is so much comprehensively cheaper than practical effects in every respect means it's going to get smoother and blander visually and artistically for the same reason.

It's a bummer man. It's a real bummer. So that's why we have to cherish whatever little gems we get the remaining few directors who can who can get something made we should cherish it. I mean my god scorsese got to make a Oh my god. He got to make a three and a half hour long meditation on regret and aging and death and materialism and and in america. With I mean you want to talk about cgi. The cgi there is awful but on purpose in a very purposeful way in a way that it's it's brechtian that film is brechtian and that's the kind of that doesn't fly in studios anymore because of the um. The risk of alienating the audience and netflix only did it because they're still trying to now compete with cinemas and they and so the brand name of scorsese is worth the investment which it isn't to traditional filmmaker film studios because he's already out there. They don't need to prove to anyone anything. They're already the movies. There's nowhere else for him to go up above the movies well if you go to tv. It's not the same thing we all understand it at some basic level no matter how good. Tv got the prestige era in my opinion. It's the inferior model it always will be because it came later because it's more commercialized by inherently but sometimes you'll get a thing like netflix willing to pay 200 billion dollars for the scorsese brand to bring eyes and and authenticity to the to their brand that it's it's marketing.

It was a marketing expense. It was a lost leader so we'll still get that sometimes but it's gonna be fewer and farther between everything else is gonna get shipped. There's no other way for it to go and the only way you can reverse engineer this to make sure where it went wrong. There's no cultural explanation has nothing to do with sjws. It's not devin faracci and his hollywood pedophiles making everyone want to want to watch representation rather than art. It's money movies are cheaper to make now but the cheaper ones aren't going to get return so they're not going to waste money on them which means that that more than anything honestly even more than than budget although we're at a point now where at the micro level you can't even do squibs because you're cutting out of central stuff because of how low the budgets now are But also where's it gonna end up this netflix with in a big pile to me.

Some violence has been done to the artifact. I know that's stupid but I feel like like these things. The the symbolic order of meaning around art is not purely the thing itself walter. Benjamin talks about this. There's that the the presence there's the aura and that aura isn't just physical proximity in like reality. It's it's presentation. It's it's ritualized consecration seeing something on a big screen means something and it abuses the thing you're seeing with meaning beyond what's on screen seeing it on a little. Tv is different and it's like well yeah but you see movies on tv too later afterwards after they have been de-sacralized but they were once sacred once again. Here we have no ritual of sacralization just dump it out like as they said on redliner media like steam tray. It's a it's the pile of of like wilted spinach in the corner just so that someone can say their spinach on the buffet and then at the end of the night. Nobody wants it. They just throw it out and make some more once again desacralization. We come back to de-sacralization. We come back to the the the the the um the sacrilege of ritual. The the destruction of civic meaning.

That's what I'm talking about in favor of pure lucr pure economic maximization of of profit and efficiency. It's bad stuff and that is why I'm against it. That's why we got to get over it and get done with it. Before it's the last culture we had was this dog. They they've come.

They evolve their way out of the boiling seas 500 000 years from now and like a on a planet that's had it's been completely re-terraformed by global warming and humans like slowly slowly died out over the course of a few millennia and now we got the cephalopod overlords. We got the the tentacle people and like another hundred thousand years of tentacle people we get tentacle people in their own cycle of capital accumulation and they find our and and our moss-covered civilization and we have we have floor is lava on netflix and I know you're saying oh. It's. It's that's it's digital. One of the good things about digital is that it'll be completely gone. It'll be completely wiped from the planet. Unlike the the the you know our our ancient history will have more reality to any future generation excavating than our digital one because all of its efficiency goes off. But let's just say like one server survives. You know hypothetically and the cephalopods of the future devise a way to reproduce that technology and translate it not impossible. I mean they. 3d. They 3d printed the the larynx of a neanderthal so that they could hear what it sounded like or a no a mummy and it's it's flores.

Lava has anyone seen flores lava. I don't want to sound like andy rooney here. But I watched a couple episodes with a friend of mine the other night just because we were like flipping through netflix and making fun of how bad everything looked and we were just like. This looks like in the deer and we watched it and I mean I get the appeal of that kind of thing. Like american ninja warrior. The japanese game shows they're all based on and I see the appeal and I've enjoyed them. I was a kid I liked american gladiators but flores lava is like pitched so stupidly like it's the level of intelligence assumed of its audiences and and it's competitive and the people competing is so low that it can't be enjoyed by anybody who has more than a room temperature iq because even if you're trying to turn your brain off it won't let you because it's still too slow like.

It's not fast-paced the way that a show that's supposed to just be turn your brain off fun is it's too slow for that it leaves you contemplating it and that's not the point you're not supposed to be contemplating these shows. It's supposed to be all my nars and you're like oh that's funny. Love to turn my brain off and watch some guys getting hit in the nards. This is too slow to to accommodate that you end up contemplating the object and it's grotesque and that's because it's pitched to people who are so stupid that it's not too slow for them that it's at the right speed for them and the most telling 

 symbol of that is that the the the announcer who's like some nascar analyst. I guess his voice over an explanation of the people as they go through the lava room. His voice is pitched like a especially stupid person condescending to someone who they think is even stupider than they are like. He already sounds just like a dumb guy and then he exaggerates his voice. The way people do around kids to get points across and he he condescends and you're like what do. They expect this audience is and it's like you can say oh yeah. People are always that stupid but like most of the for most of the history of even mass popular art. They were expected to have to deal with like the pace of the median iq the median ability to like decode symbols and now it's slowed. It's actually slowed because the aperture of of alienation has to widen and widen exactly. The audience is children because eventually you have to widen the aperture to everybody and you can't alienate any part of that audience. If you expect to lose any of it or if you expect to keep them all. They all have to be there and people are saying it's for kids. But I'm sorry.

I watched hiddens of seekers of the hiddens temple and I watched double dare and those things are fast as those shows were fast. They were running around they were zipping around they're expecting less of our children. It's a soft visionary of low expectations of our little rugrats. You're going to tell me that you can you watch an old clip of double dare or secrets of the hidden temple and tell me that it's moving at the same speed and with the same degree of condescension as flores. Lava I would disagree and the thing is is that like this is not just one direction. It's not just pure decline. I'm not being oswald spengler here even though I've sounded like it. It's not pure to blind like as as there is that infiltration of art into commerce you remember the technology changes. Technology becomes more intensified and then leads to new.

Art forms new ways of expression that are their own reward. I mean film itself is one of those I mean phil you could argue that film and television are deformed deformations of of the theatrical experience. I mean you could make the exact same argument using similar similar lines of argumentation that I've been making to say no no real drama. It has to have a sense of presence physical presence my assumption that no the presence is in the frame that's because that's what I grew up with so I you could already argue that yeah. No this is this is actually not objective. This is just as enmeshed as anything else but they that they but who wouldn't give up who would give up cinema who would even give up television even though most of it's dog facet of it. So I guess what I despair of is and I think maybe this is a kunian thing. This is kunin and commensurability where like because I am so wedded to certain notions of you know physical of a presence of presentation of ritual in in artistic consumption which is very you know you could argue.

That's all very 19th century and not younger people don't aren't beholden the same way to that kind of stuff. They they then you could say yeah. There are new technological art forms emerging that are that are if they might be less artistically acute than stuff that doesn't require a lot of capital or isn't as technologically advan accelerated. They have their own dimension especially and most importantly are more relevant to people living now because that they're operating in a frequency of reality in a way that older art forms are honestly not. They are antiquated. They are obsolete so maybe. I'm just like. I'm you know this is this is why generations must rise and fall. This is why the the the the that's why the wheel of car has to keep turning because otherwise it sultifies because people there's all those the grinding of like expectations of like birth and and and and setting and and like the ritualized space that we inhabit that is that changes as time passes and so people have different senses of it. But I would just say that the thing that concerns me is that you know even though technology allows that for the infiltration of money into art to diversify art in a productive way. I would say that the de-sacralization process is unidirectional and that is a genuine decline that has to be interrupted and that's why capitalism has to be overthrown. Because there is a embedded in all of the embedded in all of the productive conflict between emerging forms of art emerging generations with different contexts they're being driven to a state of radical alienation radical individual alienation that is antithetical art and human consciousness and human the human soul to get very very sappy about it.

I've read a little bit of burrows. I read naked lunch and I was okay. It wasn't really my thing. I should try them again. I did see dr sleep. I even watched the extra long version although I really couldn't tell what was expanded I don't get why people like that. I really don't understand though. I mean. I guess. I like I guess people like that director but I've never. I don't get that either he seems like a he seems like a journeyman scott flanagan. He seems like it was just a you know. He seems like a george p costamos type guy like just a me a ham and egger. I I don't get this thing where he's supposed to be a auteur.

It doesn't help that the book is terrible and I do think it's funny though that the book dr sleep is a sequel to the shining and then but the movie is a sequel to the shining the movie because they have different endings partially because at the end of the book spoiler alert the overlook blows up and it doesn't in the movie the shining and so both of them end at the site of the overlook and so that changes the whole ending. But no I mean rose. The hat is not scary at all. I mean the jokes right themselves looking like a little affair trying to suck people's steam out I mean rebecca. Ferguson is wildly attractive but she's not at all scary in that movie and not even that's not just because she has the stupid hat on it's because she gets owned the entire film. Every single time. She encounters danny torrance and the little girl. She gets her ass kicked. It's always established from day one from moment one that they're way more powerful psychically than her and so at no point is there any sense that she's gonna win. There's no danger at all and then you have the fact that it's it's the lady from four non-blondes not being threatening. You don't even have visual scares. Oh terrible rose. The hat paul paul have you heard of rose.

The hat king does have a hard time ending books and it's because he doesn't plan him ahead of time and you can't blame him for it and I'd say. I would argue that it's one of those deals where you have to accept the good of the bad and that like the the almost all artistic um. All almost all artistic abilities and talents within a art form have deficits at the other side of them so like a lot of directors or a lot of writers who can like really strictly plot out work They lack a certain like looseness and they lack and then that their plots get schematic with stephen king like I mean his process is sloppy. His process is just explosive compulsive narrative. There's no time to stop down and structure it but that means once you've gotten to like 600 pages. It's like what do. I do now and you've got to start. You have to start halfway through knitting it back together and you got to take it. That's why his short fiction is his best stuff as early short fishing especially skeleton crew I always forget the other one.

I enjoy. I still read new stephen king though there's always value I find I i kind of like the institute but I have noticed that there's a weird thing now where he ends a lot of his movies now with his books now with shootouts just people shooting each other even movies with even books with supernatural. He ends them with people shooting each other. It kind of feels like he's like because he's getting older. He's losing patience with the process of knitting things back together and so he's just like and then everyone shoots each other and then boom like a third of the pair oh we get to pair a third of these characters we get to close a third of this plot holes perfect I like the institute. Although you know it's basically greatest hits of his 80s stuff with all the kids being experimented on by the evil government. Although I've always loved that I always love that stuff fire starter everything's eventual short story which is kind of he ripped off for the institute um favorite on-screen depiction of the devil that's an interesting question. I think the witch is really good just the moment when the voice hits thus thou wished to live deliciously with thou lice to taste butter and then the man coming up from behind that's good. That's very good al pacino. The devil's advocate why not just go for the rafters you're the devil why would you have any subtlety. At that point. He's an absentee lad.

Lord did I like blue ruin absolutely blue norton's great. I think blue ruins like wonderful amazing not his debut second film. But his first film is very low budget. It's called murder party and it's actually pretty good especially when you consider. It's his first movie and then blue ruin is fantastic. Amazingly assured and then of course green zone is practically perfect. Was not much of a fan of the netflix one. There's. It's. It seems like most of the netflix movies and part of it. Maybe is that de-sacralization. I don't even know what's happening like. I feel like. I don't watch him as closely. I feel like. I don't watch these these netflix movies by like even guys. I really respect. I don't. I don't respect them like a certain. There's a certain patina off their names that and the film that robs me of of of investment in the story and I noticed that that was true of like gareth edwards movie that he did for netflix. The one about the cult. I thought was really bad and it's like I love gareth or no gareth evans and I was like I love gareth evans what's going on here. And I think. I don't think it's a great movie. But I think part of the reason. I didn't like it is because it just didn't feel right the first the first big name director to do a netflix movie that won me over fully even though. I didn't felt it was sacrilegious to not see.

In. The theater was a ballad of buster scruggs which I thought was brilliant stem to stern enrapturing even though. I watched it on a little relatively small tv compared to a koen brothers movie in some ways. I would argue. I would argue that that's one of the most accomplished things. I've ever done because it's the greatest hits package right.

Every one of those every one of it really is like they're. It's like one of their Like the the um the clips episodes of a tv show. Only the clips are new and original and it's like hey you know hey you guys like oh brother or art thou and they're like wacky antic old-timey cartoon style like that hudsucker proxy. How about some buster scruggs for you do you like their bleak nihilistic existential horror. Here's some like no country for old men. Here's meal ticket. Oh you like the philosophical and and and self-referential naval gazing. Like a serious man and barton fink here's the last one with the with the the stagecoach. I can't remember the name but and then in the mid cause and like.

I'm not. I'm not mad because I'm getting all the good stuff. It's. It's a good book. It's a good cohen brothers buffet and then in the girl gal got rattled. They have a earnestly depicted bromance that is almost unique in their. Film canon. They pulled they like they developed a new pitch at like age 60. They're great and that movie was so great that it kind of overcame netflix thing. I'm still digesting the irishman. I really really appreciate what it did and i. I do think I understand what he's going for with it and I think he succeeded a lot. I don't love it as much as some people do. I have to say people who say what's like a better than casino or goodfellas or even wolf of wall street. I would disagree but I think it's it's it's maybe his most ambitious work artistically and and then that respect considering how much he lands. It's a dude's rock masterpiece and deserves to be and I honestly wonder though like will will will loves it. I think a little more than me and guess what he was one of those guys we got to see in the theater. I was unable to see in the theater and I wonder if that participated the fact that it to me really was a full netflix movie might have robbed it a little bit. I don't know I like the lighthouse. I didn't love it as much as a lot of people. But I was on a very potent edible when I saw it.

I should re-watch and I will who do. I think is the most grill-pilled fictional character that's very good I mean obviously jeffrey lebowski. The dude is often bandied about as a dude's rock icon. I agree completely um dud from lodge49 of course protagonist kurt russell's son wyatt russell doing a wonderful job although he does often kind of feel more like jeff bridges as kid channing tatum's character in the magic mike films of course of course rick dalton of course rick dalton. I'd say I would say cliff booth with an asterix because I think cliff booth is a more complicated character and on purpose like. I think people who say that movie is bad because oh he killed his wife. It's like first of all that is not established and second of all. He didn't have to put that in there he put that in there to thread the thing with complication and to complicate the audience's relationship to him as a wish fulfillment as a masculine ideal and honestly that's prove that is in its own way dialectically dudes rock so. I'll throw him. On there too hell yeah peter from office space are you kidding also peter venkman from ghostbusters. All the ghostbusters in fact yeah today has been movie talk and I'm glad. I haven't done it in a while and I really like movies and it's hard for me to talk about them because so few of them are good anymore you know. I don't want to be a broken record but I think I've established why. I think that's true even if other people can disagree so. I'm hoping to see something good in the near future. Someone send me send me an angel. I haven't hit anything above like a soft four stars in a long time. If anyone has any suggestions even old movies that I might not have seen maybe it will take this last couple of minutes to see.

If I can palm springs was fine. It was very cute it was sweet. I think its approach to the the subject. The old tired groundhog day subject was good and clever. I think like all those stories a good one is buddhist and that one was buddhist which I appreciate it. I especially love the idea that it acknowledges the the like the dual reality of having of accepting to yourself that nothing matters. That nothing is accumulated that nothing is accumulated over time that there is just the present and the acknowledgement that everyone else is not necessarily has that same understanding and that that creates compassion or it should and that's where love comes from and then eventual subsumption between the fantasy of separateness and the eternal but still netflix hulu. I like jk simmons. In it he was good but once again like three and a half three and a half stars. I'm topping out at a soft four is what. I'm saying. I see something really good all right maybe. I'll watch the host the jack belt even though it's only two and a half hours and not the full like three hour enchilada friends of eddie coyle is a great movie. Oh. I think I've recommended before how good and underrated andrew nix killing them softly from 2010. I think is but but that's like literally the spiritual successor because I think they're both based on george. V higgins books about boston scumbags in the 70s and it's got robert mitchum. It's dirt bags oh. It's good straight time. I've always wanted to see that. I had that on my list like grown-up movies to watch when I was a teenager but I never got around to it. Strange days is pretty good killing him a sacred deer. I saw and didn't really like very much. I think I'm not big on that lord ghost guy. I think he's to me. He's not to me. I worry that he's a medium talent. At least so far. Ravenous is good but I've seen it take back the park h interesting bob roberts is a great movie blue collar is also a great movie. Gamer is really good neville dean and taylor man underrated.

I saw a good time. I didn't really like it the first time I saw it but then I saw object gems and I got what they were going for because at first the reason I didn't like good time is because the characters are so dumb. They were difficult for me to want to be around long enough to even watch the movie. But then I saw uncle james where it was that wasn't a problem and and I got like their whole aesthetic and like the ratchet thing. I was able to fixate really on like the rube. Goldberg plot stuff over the annoying characters. I have to say I know everyone likes robert pattinson now. But I'm not a fan of his like really sub brando like tryhard physical method. It just feels it just feels forced like. I know. A lot of people liked him in that movie. What the hell is that out the outback movie was with guy pierce. I know a lot of people liked him in that. I hated him in that. I did not like high life or him in it. Honestly it felt like good time would have been better with a different lead actor too in my opinion. That's right that's right. I don't. I don't credit him. I don't. I don't credit patents and I'll say it right now the rover. That's it and even in like lighthouse. I was all about defoe. I didn't really care for pattinson in the lighthouse either. I'm spilling the tea right here. That's right matt christman. Not a terribly fond of the robert pattinson renaissance. I'm trying to think of who would be better for people to focus on than robert pattinson but I kind of don't like any of those young british guys yeah. The foe is my other choice beside michael shannon to play john brown in a real movie that took the religiosity of john brown seriously that like centered the prophetic tradition and and was subjectively in the period like the witches that would that would also be really good.

All right guys. I'm gonna split oh. Just one more thing have you noticed that now every movie is about operators. Like all the plots that were probably used to be about cops are now about operators they got they've got operators versus street gangs in that movie extraction. They've got immortal lady operators in the old guard and then they've got now megan. Fox is a lady operator fighting a lion. A cgi line of course that's funny blood meridian is kind of about operators what if somebody did blood meridian in afghanistan maybe someone should do that not a direct not a direct adaptation with the same title but basically just take the plot structure and some of the like the visual and metaphoric motifs and use it to inspire a tale in afghanistan. I think that might be good much to consider all right guys talk to you soon.
