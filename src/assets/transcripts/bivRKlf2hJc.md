Pain away did they do it did they impeach him did. They do the impeachment do. They hold him accountable that's what's mad really matters. I watch some of it. I watch the speeches one real ugos in congress. Some of the ugliest people I've ever seen in my life a couple of cuties but by and large beasts hideous just freaks also just the stupidest. Dollars just absolute both sides. Mouth-to-gate losers just dumbasses like half of those guys look like panicky. They sounded like panicky auctioneers or like they were they were. They recited their speech in front of the mirror for 50 for an hour beforehand and like we're practicing all their stupid hand gestures pathetic. It loses folks they're losers but beyond that one thing I did get is that accountability must be must be attained. We have to have accountability. The president must be held accountable but of course. The grim comedy of that is that the job description of the president is that they are not accountable if people who reach that level of power and that level of criminality which go together are accountable to the system. Then why would anybody who makes up its sinews take the job and they need these people. They need the faces so that president can't be held accountable.

Very notion is absurd the very notion. It's like. It's like holding. It's like holding a hurricane accountable can't do it. The title is a peaches reference. Yes remember those remember her from the bush era but apparently whatever they vote and I guess. They're probably going to do party lines that like four republicans voting for so it's gonna pass and then it will be taken up. I think in the senate by mcconnell like an hour before the inaugural so they might on. I'm wondering. They probably won't do it at that point like they're wait they're essentially waiting like for the thing to calm down one thing. I will say that I feel like I'm being vindicated on for everyone who says you don't know what you're talking about you've been wrong. About everything is that they've already said that there's going to be 20 000 troops in dc for the inaugural they're bedded out they're bunked up in the.

We really cannot afford to de-indulge in you anymore sorry but of course that doesn't mean the end of stochastic violence. It'll only be the beginning and at every level as I have said and will say it will be encouraged by the state security apparatus and what fighting fascism will mean will be backing the biden administration as they extend the war on terror domestically. That's it that's all that will have like this impeachment. Thing you can argue all day about why it's necessary but who is this convincing if it's about isolating the trumpest. Rump from regular americans who care about the country shouldn't there be something for them to care about and it's kind of amazing seeing people who have sort of laid in the cut when asked to do stuff about you know progressive actual you know policy ideas deciding that now is the time for symbolic action and that this is symbolically important. I mean I think symbolic stuff is jack off all over the place.

It's all jack off oh. It's gonna. Let people know they're gonna say who's gonna see the same who are already all alive all on their own side. All have decided that you know posting is practice on both sides or have decided that if they're on the q and outside they're they're gonna bum rush state capitals because they have the the fear of god and the love of god in them that none of us have even if it's delusional and it's based on just watching too much tv. But it's it's a real motivator nobody on the left left. Like that's even a thing has a motivation. Democratic voters are by and large absolutely cowering and holding the hems of everybody every democrat because they're terrified of being of the republican mob being let loose on them and so since there's no left like symbolic actions don't mean anything but it is interesting that people will say symbolic actions. Why are you wasting your time on this stupid stuff with medicare for all and then say that this impeachment. This is a symbolism that matters so the thing that might. I don't know drain the swamp a little bit by giving people an idea that there is something else. The government can do other than punish. People now that can go on the back burner holding the president accountable and reminding people about the the fascist menace that that needs to be a priority. It's It's all very. It's kind of it's all going in a way that is very easy to see you know. I mean if you can see this turning into this anti-fascism.

Now this popular front that we're supposed to have with the democrats if you can see that creating anything other than like patriot act 2. You know patriotic to electric boogaloo literally because it'll be about the boogaloo boys. This time. Then. I don't know what to tell you because there's no other forces at play. There's nobody in those rooms other than democrats and whatever the specific desires of any members of that caucus are they are overwhelmed by the structural incentives of the party itself and the people who run it and they kept talking about liz cheney as the good republican. One of the most bloodthirsty narrow cons there are the daughter of a dynasty of blood. I mean caring about I get why people want their feelings to be validated because that's why they go online to get their feelings validated and they even get it in their head that like sticking up for the validity of the feelings of members of congress is somehow an important thing to do because it what it establishes the stakes. It establishes how dangerous the moment is as if our anxieties do anything for us.

But paralyze us give me a break give me a break break me off a piece of that kitkat car. I know people are being mean to me on twitter but they're all losers. I pay them no mind and I certainly am not accepting any. Any insults of my appearance because I know that I'm looking fresh to death lately. I know it's all it's all coming together and yes as many have noticed. My skin is dewy soft so enough of that. Let's get here.

[08:06](https://youtu.be/bivRKlf2hJc?t=08m06s)

Let's talk about what's really interesting what we're all here for the republic for which it stands baby. The biggest chunk we've read yet second half of the second part when the really hits the fan. When we get the great upheaval of 1885 we get the we get the hay market. We got a homestead strike and we have what is in my mind my favorite part of the book so far and I've enjoyed the book a great deal one of my favorite parts. My favorite part so far has been a part where white carries out a examination of the political economy of the western cattle cattle drive and that makes sense since. White's area of specialization is actually western expansion. He's written books about the the the establishment of you know markets and and political entities in the west and a movie a book about the railroads. So this is his wheelhouse and so talking about the cattle very very interesting and in fact let's start just talking.

I want to read a little bit from am I back on somebody call my phone. I guess you're supposed to stop it but I don't know how my back oh my god am I gone. I'm back okay good sorry somebody called my phone so let's start talking about the stuff that's in the first chapter we read dying for progress which is all boils down to statistic that white points out which is that throughout the 19th century a time of america's rapid expansion its economic its economy exploded over the course of the 19th century the average american got shorter and not and this is screening out. Recent immigrants from you know the benighted bogs of ireland or the shtetls of eastern europe. Native-born americans over the course of 19th century got shorter lived less and lived and had shorter life expectancies and got frailer and got weaker. They literally got less healthy.

They couldn't they weren't thriving because industrial democracy. Their industrial. Industrial capitalism was literally squeezing the life out of them and filling them with adulterants and and gim cracks and and tainted meats and and rotten Flour and food is terrible in such small portions. Basically so the whole rest of the half that we read is sort of reckoning with. It's. It's about the country reckoning and specif with and the liberal elite reckoning with the fact that the smallholder democracy that had apparent supposedly triumphed after the civil war. The the land of freedom of contract and individual liberty and free labor where the scourge of slavery had been removed was not creating the prosperity. The broad prosperity it was supposed to. It wasn't recreating lincoln's springfield which white points out in the beginning of the book is the model of like republican political economy. A small town surrounded by industrious farmers.

 people professionals laborers yeoman. None of them terribly poor very few of them very rich many of them moving from one field to another most of them ending up with a home and property. That was the idea and then by the by the 1880s and 90s you had south where slavery had been reinstituted under another and another name and the economy had completely stagnated. You had the eastern cities that were filled with just stockpiled with wretchedly poor immigrants. You had everywhere that industrial capitalism was being consolidated you in the railroads and in steel. You saw massive numbers of injuries and deaths and terrible working conditions for people of all ages and even those farmers who had been given the land after with the homestead act and all that came after it were in many places struggling especially in the west where unbeknownst to a lot of people when they started moving people out there oh no once you get past the hundredth meridian It basically dries up and there's no water and the agriculture that we assumed was going to be the basis of this economy is not really possible and so you end up with this. Economy of you know ponzi ski railroad ponzi schemes propping up real estate speculations that usually ended up with people going broke because you can't grow up there so one way or another.

It's not going the way it's supposed to and we talked about how the liberals kind of made their transformation we're in the process of making their kunian transition from from mid-century. Los angeles to a a more interventionist model and I want to actually go to the very end of the last chapter of part two and read a little bit here to bring us back to where we were last time talking about the sort of cri. The the ideological crisis at the heart of like the liberal elite who became the administrators of the administration the administrators of the bureaucratic state in the 20th century and also the people who made up its media class his intellectual class and its political class and who had instituted after the civil war. A a easy piece on the south with the promise of prosperity for all smoothing over um.

All social conflicts well when you know it. The opposite happened everybody's shrinking forgot. They're shrinking oh my god that's not great so I just want to read this a little bit about at the end about how the economists who had gone from being you know classical ricardo adam smithians to involving to absorbing like german ideas and then finally the the marginal revolution of um that would end up shaping the response of the bureaucratic state to to democracy academics. Here we go most academic. Social scientists held back as labor and vanguard anti-monopolist pressed forward in the 1890s urging on cooperativist and state-based solutions to the long economic and social crisis.

[15:26](https://youtu.be/bivRKlf2hJc?t=15m26s)

The academics by and large were not willing to join the assault but neither were they willing to accept a set of liberal doctrines and social arrangements that they had spent their careers in overthrowing. Instead they fashioned a new position which emphasized consumption over production corporations and large-scale production over competition and bureaucratic expertise over democratic control. It was a position that some of the older liberals whom anti-monopolists had opposed could also embrace it jettisoned. The laws affair reduced the scope of individualism and abandoned small government but it left private property capitalism natural rights and elite rule within a restricted democratic framework intact so that is a perfect little capsule description of liberalism as we have understood it since the progressive era which was that class of people coming to terms with the failures of contract freedom to generate the country that they wanted it to but the basic premise was because these were people in the property or near property classes who were around the finance capital who were not who were invested in the maintenance of capitalism. The assumption is all that all those marxist notions all those socialist ideas that oh the real root of this is a class conflict that we cannot resolve democratically the difference between someone who wants to work as little for as much money as possible and somebody who wants them to work for as long for as little money as possible that that is a conflict that can only be decided by force and in a capitalist system. No matter what we tell about democracy that force is monopolized by capital and they didn't want to change that but they did want to keep it if not more humane more stable because this is the aftermath of as we talk about.

The 1885 of people would saw the largest out up almost like spontaneous eruption of strikes across the country um caused by the the knights of labor basically getting in over their head because as happened with all of the big labor eruptions in america and most other places. Honestly they were out of the hands of the formal organizations that they came from the types of labor did not want a full-scale confrontation with the state. At that point. They were they were still very they were still new and they were still unsure of themselves and they were still very cowed by capital and but they were in the middle of this extended economic depression which all of the employers were using as an excuse to even if they weren't suffering their profit suffering to reduce wages and control over work and so how do we how do we deal with this well. We get rid of some of this laws I fair. We regulate the trusts we distribute some of the the profits publicly but we keep the structure intact and that has been the model for liberalism ever since and in the section. We read that there are two great examples of how liberal reformist instincts operate in this context where there are people who are embedded in capitalist relations find self-conscious identification with capital over labor but also have this the sort of sophisticated social self-conception that comes with acculturation and civilization being refined meant having some sort of or more importantly than being refined that's for the gentleman being um being useful being someone who could contribute to the public debate someone who could be administer a state apparatus or work with a reform organization. I mean what what what they pride it out more than ever and always have is their own virtue and they sought to affirm their virtue by solving problems that were caused by the system.

They supported which meant that their solutions would always exacerbate the problem and two great examples that white talks about here are indian policy and prohibition temperance as it was called back up and he talks about how the allotment system which was the single like most brutal assault on traditional native american folkways that was ever done out within the confines of like admit like the administrative state and the legal process as opposed to just you know genocide. Was a reform move yes of course. It was allowed to happen and encouraged because it meant land would be allocated to hungry white settlers but for the people who pushed it. They saw a future where native americans indians would be physically extinguished from north america if they kept their ways carlisle the founder of the carlisle indian school famously said kill the indians save the man and for those guys as cynical as it might have been and as as I said it was only allowed to become a a policy because it helped it helped the interests of those who wanted to exploit nato in native lands. It did point to a real conflict which was the native way of life was incompatible with turning america into the rationalized checkerboard of private property that we were going about doing and so the solution for a good-hearted christian indian reformer is well. Make them have farms make them settle down make them farm and be like us and then they can live as citizens and we don't have to worry about them. Getting wounded knee anytime. They decide to start dancing and in the narrow parameters where the choices extinguishment versus assimilation assimilation is. The more refined is the more civilized response even though it is in its own way genocidal but that's because it could not and and it's in action destroyed many native american communities that is the end result of reform within a system where the reformers are not part of a broader press against capital but are within it trying to direct it.

It will only compound all the contradictions that are that are they're responding to and prohibition temperance is a similar thing. These middle class victorian evangelicals were horrified by the drunken rabble of the cities who the irish germans and catholics or the irish catholics irish germans who would just get shit-faced all day when they weren't working. You know 20 hours a week or 20 hours or 12 hours a day and instead of recognizing that the rise of saloons and the rise of drinking was a direct response to being hyper-exploited which was an untouchable assumption that to to to work to change that would be to violate sacred concepts of free enterprise and private contract. No you just pass laws so that they can't drink irish germans like tom hagan and there's a example that white gives of the reformers who are able to win temperance in um iowa. But then with a with a coalition of you know the more the more refined catholic elements and the middle class protestants but then immediately as soon as soon as It was interacted and enacted lost their coalition's control. Because the the immigrant the immigrants didn't. They wanted to drink and the response from those middle-class performers was to say actually you know what the problem isn't alcohol. It's the immigrants they're not.

They're not acting like we said they should well. They can't act the way they should you act the way you are because you were cradled in the bosom of the lincolnite. Freeholder america you got in. You are there they can't act like you but then instead of recognizing that because recognizing that we recognize the inherent contradictions within the system that you're supporting you have to find a solution that only exacerbates the problem and the thing that hampered all levels of reform everywhere anti-monopoly soft money temperance all of which had virtue within them. Even the temperance movement was a genuine attempt to reduce things like domestic violence. At every level. They were undermined by the fact that there were there was some segment of the population that was opposed for one reason or another to that reform and that would cause the reformers committed as they were to the system as such to decide to condemn them as demographically and divide within and that has been that's been the story of america.

More than anything is that our our polyglot nature has meant that at every crucial moment of conflict there has been more that breaks up the labor half the labor side of of the equation that brings them together and now and what is all this for what is all this to defend. What are all these reform pretzels. What is andrew carnegie going oh. We're gonna buy. We're gonna give everybody libraries and they can go read and not be sorry. We shot the hell out of all.

[25:49](https://youtu.be/bivRKlf2hJc?t=25m49s)

Of your your family members and are making them work 12 hours a day but here go read a book what what um what is this system producing culturally. It's producing mass entertainment and mass amusements that are horrifying the middle classes but are the only thing available to poor people. I mean they literally want these people to have middle class tastes when they are don't have the money of the middle class. They think that middle class means something other than at that point other than income in a social relationship. They think that it's it's a state of mind that they need to impart and if you can't take it. Then you need to be kicked out of the country basically um. So it creates a culture that they hate even though it's being generated by the logic of capitalism that they endorse it's creating alcoholism. It's making people smaller and more sickly and what is it making economically and I want to talk about.

I want to read a little bit and talk a bit about what. I was saying my favorite part of the book so far white's description of the political economy of the cattle drive. I'm going to read a a section here that'll be relatively long. But I think it's perfect because it describes so the description of the economy of of cattle investments in the old west and the cattle drives from texas into into to the to the rail hubs. Um is essentially the same model that you find at every juncture of finance capital and the physical economy in america or any kind of economy in american history. Let me see if I can find it here so let me just start by saying the whole reason that the cattle drive happened. All those fears going up through to abilene was because texas longhorn cattle carried a tick that made them dangerous to be around other types of animal because they had a a fever that from the tick that they mostly became immune to as chi as as calves but which if the tick got to a different cow that hadn't had that would make the cows sick perhaps kill it so. Longhorns could not be brought to local rail hubs and shipped with other cattle like domestic breeds that people brought to texas. They couldn't take them to local rail heads because they were not allowed with the other cows so they would have to go basically around to isolated rail heads that were sitting there doing nothing because one of the marks of the railroad infrastruct.

The railroad investment of the post civil war era is that a lot of it went towards building railroads that never saw much action and never got much traffic because they were all speculative white points out. The railroads went first in most of the west. It was not people showed up as settlers that oh here's the railroad the railroad went first railroad. The army went first and then people followed now in a lot of places. They didn't fall. They didn't not many not very many of them followed because oh we can't actually grow anything here.

So you had a lot of just up into the into kansas and even into the dakotas and the thing that funded them. This was like the people who were this was the single most sort of rationalized financialized and and industrial elements of the western economy which is what makes it so ironic that the cowboy mythos goes around it. Cowboys were not sodbusters. Cowboys were not independent settlers out on the planes huddling in their cabin against indian attack. They were employees they were workers. They were hired by big firms to prove those cows which many of them were miserable mistreated died starved in places that the buffaloes had thrived for millennia because because they were domesticated and you could move them and you could ship them and you could turn it into profit.

You don't have to go up to one buffalo shoot it and eat it for a year texas cat. I'm going to read this here texas cattle gave an init. This is page 595. If anyone wants to follow along texas cattle gave an initial boost of to beef consumption. Beef from longhorns was tough but it was cheap the grass on the public lands and for that matter railroad land was free always desperate for things to carry. The railroads touted the great plains as a place where cattle effectively cared for themselves. It spawned a separate genre of boosterism pretty much summed up by the title of general. James s brisbane's beef bonanza or how to get rich on the plains great name for book by the way. In the late 1870s and the early 1880s cattle raising spread steadily north. I have to say he should have just stuck with um. He should have just stuck with beef bonanza. You don't need the ore there beef. Bonanza is so much fun okay. By the 1880s cattle companies and corporations created by eastern and british investors dominated the western ranges and then he talks a little bit about how teddy roosevelt went out east or went out to the dakotas to play cowboy and it was all made up british and scottish investors.

Alone pumped 34 million worth of capital declared book value into the western livestock industry in the united states. During the last quarter of the 19th century. What attracted investors was an industry heavily subsidized by the federal government. A set of economic calculations too good to be true and promises made by promoters that amounted a little more than a modern ponzi scheme. John clay was a scotsman who remembered much of his adult life in the catalan who spent much of his adult life in the cattle business. It was clay remembered a crew business at the beginning and that remains saw until the end the subsidies as with the railroads were enormous. The federal government had opened up the public domain by evicting indians whom roosevelt despised and whose removal he saw is both inevitable and commendable. The federal government provided roosevelt. Another cattlemen with free land and nature provided the grass and water that the cattle consumed. The federal government and state subsidized the railroads that promoted cattle raising and hauled cattle to market for all practical purposes. The producer in this industry was the product itself for cows and steers got precious little help from humans in surviving on the great plains. Their owners branded them rather than with when ready for shipping and sent them off to market. A fairly simple set of calculations made profit seem inevitable. Catalin calculated the price of maintaining a steer at between 75 cents and a dollar 25 a year when stockman reported. They could sell a four-year-old wyoming steer for between 25 and 45 with costs exclusive of capital and transportation being between three and six dollars.

[33:35](https://youtu.be/bivRKlf2hJc?t=33m35s)

A steer how could they lose if corporate reports were to be believed always a dangerous thing to do in the gilded age invest and not. I'd say also now elon musk hashtag. How is that company still around hashtag. How do you not think that this is a gigantic bubble that is going to collapse on all of us. Tesla is one of the biggest it's like enron on freaking crack folks okay anyway investors were not losing. Anglo-american cattle corporations produced dividends of 15 to 30 percent between 1881 and 1883. The dividends as it turned out actually came from new investments and loans not profit from cattle. The corporations actually had little idea how many had they owned because actual cattle are hard to find during roundups so to estimate their herds.

Cattle companies created a book count book count. Cattle existed only in the ledger in an age that was perfecting actuarial tables and life insurance policies. There was nothing remarkable about making educated guesses based on the average survival and reproduction of large numbers of cattle but men. Seeking investors do not make good actuaries in the book counts. The west was a land of perpetual spring and toothless wolves. Real cattle died had accidents and failed to calve book cattle book cop cattle reproduced at a dependable annual rate. Usually 70 percent book count calves matured. It begat more book cop calves western cattle corporations borrowed on their book count cattle which were immune to the vagaries of western life as a cheyenne saloon. Keeper told a group of disconsolate cattlemen drinking at his bar while a blizzard raged outside cheer up boys.

Whatever happens the books won't freeze now of course that whole thing eventually collapsed but it was everybody was bailed out. You either lost or if you knew the right people you got bailed out and that for that right there that model that is the model of the american economy since essentially its inception but certainly since the civil war and it's the same thing as the railroads. The railroads operated on the exact same way. The railroads thrived on continued investment and gave people gave investors dividends to induce further investment. Those dividends not coming from the profits from often unprofitable railroads that have been speculatively laid out for free because the government just gave them travel on your rails or how much wheat is going on it. That doesn't matter look at.

These returns how many cattle are you actually moving to ability. It doesn't matter we have them right here and what and all of these have in. Common is that you have a things that are common necessities like transportation infrastructure like agricultural production that are established through direct government intervention clearing the land providing in a real sense. The capital and then private actors whose proximity to the plate to the interaction to the transaction is luck in the sense that it is personal relationships it's not. Wisdom and vision and genius are then able to essentially act as as ticks creating fake propaganda and and fraudulent book keeping to keep a flow of investor money in as long as they can paying themselves as much as possible until the thing falls apart that's the cattle that's exactly like oh. I've got 500 head of cattle headed to abilene.

Look at this look at these notes look at the ledger so so social forces produce industries and then are then and then the The the product of them is is kept and privatized because at the end of the day they don't trust us with it and nor should they and of course. They say the reason you can't trust people with it. It's because they're a bunch of uncultured swine who will spend it all on booze. Some of them are but the one thing that is definitely sure is that if there is worker control of their actual like the capital they work with as opposed to just a wage. The the super fluidity of the capitalist becomes very very quickly and very readily apparent and that is the last thing. Any of these people want and one of the signs that the working class uprisings that you saw with the 70s. The 77 strikes with the haymarket and the eight-hour day movement and homestead were being met with enough.

Brutality enough unified violence and enough resistance at the highest levels of both parties because as much as you have this efflorescence of anti-monopolist in both parties and he talks about the budding populist party emerging out of kansas and moving through the country and challenging republicans and democrats in the north and south. By the late 1880s the demands of labor symbolized by the american federation of labor and samuel gompers. It emerged as sort of an umbrella organization of the emerging labor unions moved away from demands for control of workplaces and towards wages towards consumption. Okay we cannot be owners of the means of production because you will kill us if we try to do that and we're too su. We're too we're not unified enough to fight you and win what we can do is especially since it's good for the damn economy is get more of the surplus in the form of wages which we can then spend at our discretion. We can become consumers and that's what they became. That's what they are now. That is why so much of the hair splitting about who counts as working class is incredibly tedious and pointless and honestly. I think it's mostly about people just looking to sanctify themselves morally like. I think a lot of people who who go to college to learn about things like class oppression filter a lot of the stuff through a middle class morality and they hear working class and they think good and they think anything else is oh. Those are the bad exploiters and so you have all these people insisting. I'm working class like well maybe maybe in terms of your your relationships and means and production. But the reason that that was supposed to matter in the marxist conception is that people in those relationships generated social relationships with each other and generated class consciousness. Out of that we're in a situation where we have 100 330 million consumers. There's nobody has a class character and so seeing people argue about.

[40:48](https://youtu.be/bivRKlf2hJc?t=40m48s)

It is very baffling unless you realize oh. They're just trying to have someone validate that they're good people. Yeah. I saw that hispanics and young people believe in q anon the most and of course. They do because they have they have not invested in any of the that we tell ourselves about this country. What I mean by that is I mean like that these institutions have like a secret a sacredness to them in themselves like a lot of the q people. They imagine that there is you know some america some ideal america that they're representing. But the actual institutions of government and media to them are this disgusting corruption of that and that is a reasonable thing to think if you're just observing the world you turn on the tv and there are all of the major tech companies and every awful giant corporation telling you that donald trump is a bad man and he has to be stopped and he's not american and stuff oh and by the way here's you're not getting anything You're you are you are left to the devices of the market good luck in the middle of a pandemic. There's nothing for you. But you're supposed to care about this stuff and you're supposed to be concerned about america's democracy as though it has ever done anything for you as though it has ever done anything for you.

I think q and on started with boomers. You saw that in the early stuff but it's a different thing now. I don't think it's the same thing. I think that those first generation of popularizers were facebook grandmas but once it became viral. Once it became just. A shortcut for the system is filled with criminal lizard pedophiles which is a a sensational narrative hook for any young person who's disengaged from politics but is aware that the world they live in is and also that it's a good way to get paid like that's. The other thing is that the the the original like q anon conceptions and and like the original proofing and stuff. I think was done by a bunch of house-bound old people but once it hit tick-tock once it hit social.

Like young people media it could be something that could be turned into a a hustle and all of us are looking for a hustle every one of us because that's the only escape route. If you unless you have the money unless you are part of unless you're sitting on some of that. Hoarded cash from the mid-century bonanza if you are even the cha like not e and and I'm not saying working class like maybe not a a boat ownership dealer but the bone ownership dealers like second son. The boat ownership dealer second son especially since that boat ownership probably doesn't make as much money as it used to and it's probably got a bunch of leveraging you're not getting anything. Nobody is getting anything and no jobs have any kind of promise of stability or or certainly stability at all. Let alone. The kind of creative satisfaction that the knowledge economy was supposed to provide the labor for people who went to school and got it and got and learned there's nothing there's there's. There's gig economy gerbil work unless you can monetize your own self somehow like. I have.

I am. I'm a perfect example and like the the bernie thing was essentially a q-esque phenomenon in that sense and that it provided a common vocabulary for alienated people online to talk with and then to talk to each other and then to promote each other and q is the same thing I'm not hammer. This is my first beer. Let's see if there's anything else. I wanted to talk about from this section I did like the detail where he points out that when teddy roosevelt went out to dakota after his wife and his mom died on the same day in his house that he bought a gold-mounted bowie knife from tiffany and company trump tr really was a trump type in that he was a tough guy who people thought was a tough guy but who was actually a fancy lad but the difference between the late 19th century and the early 21st is the difference between having to actually do something to think of yourself as a tough guy and just tell selling telling everybody that you're a tough guy that does work.

Wisconsinites are built differently oh. I wanted to quote this little ditty that nativists in massachusetts said the irish and the dutch they don't amount to much. For. The mix have their whiskey and the germans guzzle the beer and all we americans wish they had never come here. I have to say not very catchy pretty bad. It's a reason that those people did not really make any culture. The middle class protestant american beef with the catholic urban immigrants was that they didn't have culture but they were the only ones who had culture like that. American middle brow was nothing oh yes.

I wanted to bring up good old frederick taylor the founder of taylorism and scientific management of of work movements who brought mechanism mechanization to the actual act of performing work human mechanization. People probably know a little bit about taylor but I think what's most interesting about him is that he was a laborer. He was a foreman basically and he essentially made his own job. He created the idea of being a of being a um mechanical engineer out of nothing he just bullshitted it and that's how when we talk about the formation of you know the bureaucratic class that interposes itself between you know the purely exploited worker and the capitalist. A lot of them are you know these men of letters like like howell that white talks about but some of them are eager working-class drivers who just hustle their way to bluffing people into thinking that they have a certain um a certain expertise and as long as that expertise can be profitably sold to capital. It will have value and taylor no matter how spotty and non-existent the scientific basis for any of his theories was. He was able like edison and other people. He was able to sell himself to capitalists because he was telling them something they wanted to hear and he was a guy who had he got to go from the factory floor to a nice office because essentially he made his own job with and that was a big part of building that middle strata okay. They talk a little bit about.

The I want to talk a little bit about the knights of labor so the knights of labor were like the first they were the before the afl. They were the first attempt to create an umbrella organization for workers that would be able to coordinate across geography and across industries and they were not modeling labor unions. Really they were modeled on um. Originally the knights of labor were modeled on the fraternal orders like the freemasons and the odd fellows that were blowing up in america to fill in the gap of that social connection that you know they didn't have here and then a lot of them had had in europe and the sons of the knights of labor were were a explicitly working class fraternal order that over time was able to do things like collect money for strike funds and coordinate action and and move against workers and assert workers prerogatives. But it was this jerry rigged system and it was it's apogee and then fall came at the same time which is that it precipitated the great 1885 railroad strikes. And then it was once those were broken. It sort of was on a slow decline and eventually was supplanted by the afl.

Good old samuel gompers. Samuel gompers we'd love to hear about samuel gompers. One of those names I remember writing down in my book in like ninth grade history. There's. I thought about this a while ago that there are certain things that I just get stuck in my head from learning. American history never and because you know you mostly you don't learn what's going on or why you just learn discrete events that you're supposed to memorize. It's the worst way to teach the subject and it's the reason. Most people hate history and I don't think anybody in power is unhappy with that turn of events. But I remember samuel gompers zimmerman telegram.

 the xyz affair wilmot proviso absolutely the gadsden purchase. It's another one teapot dome. T-bot dome is so funny. Teapot dome is hilarious. The 1920s were an incredibly important period in american history. I mean it set the stage for a catastrophic economic collapse and then the the reforging of a new political economy out of the wreckage of it. It had the prohibition it had the rise of gangsters that all said the only thing you learn about from the political strata of that era is the some siphoning some oil out of a hole in the ground. That's it which in like the the panoply of of corruption one of a very low-tier thing I mean like I hate talking about like trump is as you know some horrible crook because they're all crooks but trump's personal corruption dwarfs anything like that and yet teapot dome because you gotta talk about something right and you can't talk about any of the actual stuff going on like the fact that the clan took over half the country and ran like the state of indiana for example. Seward's folly is a good one. Stewart's folly is a good one. The cross of gold speech william jennings brian but if you're anything like me and you went to public school when you learned history. It was just a collection of these things that you just had to remember why any of them happened what any what connection any of them had to each other. It was all vague to non-existent sinners in the hands of an angry god absolutely oh.

You got to talk about jonathan edwards if you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake and I have a long straw. Here. It is I go across the room into your milkshake. I drink your milkshake still my favorite scene in movie history. I drink it up. I drink the blood of lamb from abandoned tract. All right.

Let's see if there's anything else. I want to talk about here that's pretty much it so for the next next wednesday. We're gonna finish it next wednesday. We're going to read part three which is the last part we're going to go through presumably the pullman strike. The second cleveland administration and the fact that cleveland let another economic collapse happened and did nothing. The democrat broke this floaming strike and then refused to provide any aid to suffering people because at that point it's baffling it's amazing and it reminds you. It's not baffling really. It's it's just. It shows how over time the party system exists essentially to mask the confluence of interests at the top of both parties and they were divided sectionally for a good chunk of america's history. As after the civil war the divide was regional. It was not ideological. The parties had basically the same structure in many ways. Regardless of the fact. They had different demographics of support at the base. You had a variety of people including a I would say a by this period in time. I would say the the base of both parties is composed of people who are in favor of anti-monopoly action soft money to increase the the currency supply and and increase and help the position of debtors but at the top were hard money men. Maybe the only real difference. The only idea the only actual issue difference between the two. Besides of course the administration of voting in the south was um was tariff was the tariff was industrial policy but in both cases the preference for one or the other was not driven from the bottom up. It was driven by the interest of the top which at that time were still divergent because of the regional differences because all that finance capital and specifically all of that industrial capital that needed the tariff to maintain to be to protect it from foreign. Competition was in north.

I find that I'm always learning new stuff like. I obviously am fairly familiar with this period of time but re reading. This book a lot of things pop up like because people are always going to find interesting and and fun and insightful juxtapositions that you wouldn't otherwise know even if you have a general understanding. Also you get great names like one in this section. There's a discussion of a corrupt indian agent which is of course a redundancy named valentine mcgillicuddy wonderful 19th century name and what's known and that reminds me of one more the last thing. I want to say about this section and the book and that era reminding me of the indian agent thing is the fee for service model of public administration. The thing about the united states at the civil war is that it had theoretically a vast amount of power over the continent. A huge amount of land that had theoretically dominance over but its administrative capacity to carry out that authority was limited by its its undeveloped infrastructure over such a large sized country and part of that was technological. We just didn't have the ability to really coordinate and so what filled the gap was self-interest in the form of fee-based services if you were a cop if you were a judge if you were a indian agent if you're if you had any role within the government as a as a regulator or or official you were not necessarily paid. A salary so much as you were paid fees for the people who you work for which of course that goes against the idea of a public service right because it should be provided for free but that would not have allowed for the motivation factor that wouldn't have not gotten people to do the work you've got a bunch of We've got a bunch of people fleeing the authorities for example into indian country from missouri like in true grit nobody's going to go and get them unless they know. It's going to be worth their while and so you got to have bounties and that extent that logic extended throughout all of the administration for everything and that plus the spoil system was the basis for like the wildly corrupt nature of public administration but the thing about the spoil system and as I pointed this out last week which we we're told if we learn at all about it in history. As this was a corrupt non-democratic structure and that civil service reform eventually like cleaned it up. In reality there was the um the spoil system allowed the the parties to assert some independence from capital because they had independent funding sources because the deal with the spoil system was say you're like a bartender or a ward healer or a popular guy. In the neighborhood you get a bunch of people to vote for the democrat or the republican you're rewarded with like a sanitation job or marshall or something like that you. If you get a salary or fees you give a percentage of it to the party. So it's personally corrupt like you had to give money to the guy the your patron.

But also it built the party capacities because and that was necessary because the stupid constitution by assuming that parties couldn't. Exist ended up creating a vacuum for administration of elections that ended up having to be filled by the political parties and meant that political parties ended up being a load-bearing member of a a load-bearing element of a structure that was designed not to include them at all. Wild and what of the consequences of getting rid of fee for service and specifically getting rid of the the spoils kickback system is that the parties became even more dependent on large money donations from capital because who the hell else has the money to give a political party. All right so. Let's see the last part for next week oh yes and also he talks like. I said last week. Henry george ran from gov mayor of new york against teddy roosevelt and he talks about that in this section and it was a three-way race between a liberal democrat who was running with tammany support. Even though he was not a tammany man teddy roosevelt running as a republican but as a sort of quasi-populist republican and henry george running on a labor ticket and the and the working-class irish who were the tammany base. They they liked what they heard from george and the way that tammany was able to win that election was by replacing the votes they lost to george with middle and middle class republican votes because because they recognized the threat where they saw it and that's the thing about tammany and the urban machines is that yes they were more democratic than the bureaucratic state that would come later certainly. But they were still At the they were still structures that served capital and that got a better deal for their constituents. Their clients than you know the raw market would have but that when push came to shove would coordinate with capital to prevent a real challenge to emerge to its prerogatives. So they impeached them h . John morrissey yeah. I I did a a dollop episode. I guess not a dollop episode about john morrissey fighting build a butcher.

It's pretty fun third party win yeah. That's a good question. I don't know. I mean honestly. It might not even be a party. We might be beyond that by the time it gets organized but depending on the whatever. I don't know. I don't know man. But it's it's at some point. Presumably there would be a party expression of of challenge. To this. This dead conflict between neoliberal inclusive capitalism and white nationalist. This petty pooch temper tantrum because they will only reinforce each other and that to me more than anything is why. I have no obligation to to supply any kind of rhetorical support for a campaign to raise the alarm and to demand a a defensive line supporting every hysterical argument about from democrats because none of it is going to go you're saying well. We got to do it. We have to fend off the fascist threat well when will that ever happen it'll never go away. The republican base isn't going to change their mind. They're always going to be there and the only response to the democrats will be hysterical clapping and punitive police state measures because they sure should have no interest in draining the swamp by making life in this country. Any less miserable for anybody who lives in it biden today says we're not going to do a big. Reckons. We're not going to do a big reconciliation stimulus. We're going to go through the regular channels and work with the republicans and maybe. In the end. They won't do that but it's the same scam. It's the exact same scam. These guys are a threat to democracy. These guys are existential enemies of the republic also though they are the ones who get to dictate domestic policy and you will have to support that even as it makes everything worse even as it creates more yahoos more people willing to compete violence on behalf of their orange god. Emperor more people violently alienated from society willing to carry. I mean. It's not people are worried about q anon violence and that's going to be a thing sarcastic. Political violence is going to be just a feature of politics but as I said crime in general is up and going to keep going up. Because this is falling apart. The social coherence is collapsing to the degree. There never was any because it was all held together by plenty. It was all held together by the promise of more that's what kept people together even though we never melded into an actual national identity and the answer to all. These is going to the only answer that liberalism can give is suppression. Just like those it's it's the exact same thing as those reformist evangelicals trying to break up the indian reservations into allotments.

It's like we're caught in this death. Spiral global capital is un un unleashed the only place for profit is at the expense of labor. Every job has to be proletarianized. Every person has to be proletarianized if they don't have access to enough capital and um you can either learn to code or be or just if you can't. Then you just have to take it you have to take it and remember that this is a good country and there's a lot of shows on netflix. You can watch and you know that's only 10 bucks a month that those are your choices and if you don't like it. The answer is going to be the means who are going to be cheering along the entire time because we have to stand strong together even though it will be the policy of this. Party these democrats in power that will make everything that these people are terrified of worse. I will never be held accountable. How dare you even suggest how dare you even suggest that I will be held accountable. I mean these people are how is it like the thing. I was supposed to have been canceled for when I said that the capital is not some sacred institution. It's a goddamn. It's a it's baphomet's ritual altar place um that's bad because it like lets them off the hook for the riot. How how at this moment in time with these democratic institutions showing themselves every day to be frauds showing us every day that yeah in a class society democracy is impossible. There is no such thing as democracy in a class society because one class has the power and they're going to exercise it and your ability to to influence them will always be channeled and and reduced and dissipated and you might get you might get a little more pie now. But eventually you will be put through the shoots into the goddamn slaughterhouse. If that's what the ledger says to do and in this moment we're supposed to be re-sanctifying this hollow ritual with meaning that it does not deserve who does that benefit sure. Charade going as long as they can like the democrats think that they have the whip hand now at least in terms of public opinion. They think that those they think and this is the important thing. They have no way of knowing because they're caught in the bubble just like everybody is like they can make fun of cute people for being delusional. But I'm sorry if you're a democrat you're as delusional you live as much in a filtered reality that does not tell you anything about the average sentiment or like will to act in any way of the mass of the american people and so I watched that debate and everyone's saying america. The american people are horrified are they what happens you hope that's true how do you know though you're just gonna bluff it and hope that enough winging the alarm and waving the bloody shirt will discipline these people. But they're the thing is all they want to do all. They want to do that with all they want to do with that with hand. It's not push policies. It's not oh here. We got him on the ropes we're actually going to institute medicare for all. No. It's we got him on the ropes. We're going to reaffirm the america's trust in our sacred democratic institutions and then launch like a domestic drone program to combat combat terrorism. I think you're ignoring the fact that some lawmakers were explicitly targeted and probably would have been executed if the bob was more lucky. This isn't funny.

I mean it's funny. I'm sorry. All of this is funny if you don't think it's funny. Then log then you should not be on the internet my god but like was it terrifying for the people in it. Yes. What's really weird to me is people who insist that like I haven't. I have. I have we all have some sort of um duty to affirm like the lived experience and emotional response of members of congress like their posters like their other posters. Their other like online friends of ours who are trying to validate they're members of congress they have more in common with each other. They have more in common with kevin mccarthy and louie gohmert than they do with us the q people as the new anti-masonic party that's a good that's not a bad comparison actually because and in a sonic party was a similar impulse. It was people looking around at the at the bounty of of of the american of the virgin. America finding roadblocks to the advancement that they thought that they would have in it and decided that it's it's that that couldn't be in this land of plenty that that couldn't be in america with its constitution and its and its founding heroes. It must be in this secret of bunch of people hanging around and wearing aprons and who knows what in their secret societies they even had like a their own um like epstein case. Their own sort of woe or I guess seth. Rich would be better that there was a murder. There was a famous murder of a former mason who was threatening to publish a book exposing masonic secrets in northern new york which helped spark the animasonic party coming into being and the anima sonic party was part of that drive towards it was. It was a middle-class movement much like the know-nothings ended up being in in the upper upper north of the country of the united of the northern tier it started in upstate new york but I believe there were eventually anti-masonic congressmen elected in maryland so like up through the through the mid-atlantic region but not the deep south and it looked. It's a horror at the jacksonian democracy and the slave power that that dictated it but could not find any It could not put any faith in the whigs as an opposition to it because it was filled with masons and q anon is a similar thing when you're just trying to make sense of this world and you're looking for bad guys they're everywhere in both parties. Now it takes a certain sort of american brain poisoning and essentially mental like suffocation to decide that donald trump is the person who's going to defeat them but by the same token why wouldn't it be like the idea of a of a lone hero stalking. The halls of injustice is is an american archetype and it's built into the way we think of the presidency like you can go. Why do. These people believe in donald trump but of course. He's donald trump. But he's also the president and we have decided that the president embodies something as opposed to just essentially being a vessel for interests far beyond his personal ones and that they're their adherence to the job is predicated on the understanding that they will carry out those will that will and that they're like self-actualization will. The power is more a matter of embodying the moment and embodying the interests and powers and constituencies of the moment than of shaping anything but that's certainly not how we think of them like how could we put that much emotion behind it. How could we invest so much of our sense of ourselves as democratic participants in it. If that's all the presidency was. The presidency has to be some guy with a. It's pretty late damn. I went fa. I went long all right well. We'll see what happens next won't we next week. For example we will have all this and also by the way 20 000 troops in the capital. So my prediction is still solid that it will be a orderly intense transition of power and then you're going to start seeing. Some people pop off and then you're going to start seeing. The the fists of the state come to smack whitey in the face and tell them no no you thought it was one way. But it's the other way.
