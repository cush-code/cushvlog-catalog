Peas peas peas peas eating goober peas goodness how delicious eating goober peas we love. The goober peas don't we folks we love to eat a goober pee. It's the best you go you take them you put it in your mouth. You march through georgia with your group of peas if anyone remembers that they probably don't that was a civil war marching song about peanuts. That's how unentertained people bear back. There. They had to sing songs about goddamn peanuts how sad can you imagine how bizarre how bizarre so today we're going to talk about the first chapter of reconstruction but before we start just do a little how you doing everybody don't worry. If anybody didn't do the reading. It's no big deal. The first chapter is mostly setting the stage.

It starts with the emancipation proclamation the signing of the emancipation proclamation and it's essentially focuses on the way that the civil war had broken apart american society how it was exposing and intensifying friction points between elements of the social order and most importantly creating new formations and new relationships between them. That's that's what that chapter is really about before you even gotten to the end of the war and what phoner does is. He basically goes through the north and the south and examines the ways that the different broad social groupings of the north and the south have been changed by the war starting of course with the slaves who by 1863 had begun in huge numbers to resist plantation authority to flee to union lines whenever they have a chance and to in general withdraw their labor from the confederate war effort. This is what du bois. I know calls in his book general strike. That's how he frames it and that what fonder is getting at here.

Most importantly is that this is an assertion in the context of the war of like black freedom and and an assertion of black rights and a demand for not only the end of slavery but the end of the the social caste system that had emerged and on the other hand the non-plantation-owning white population of the south. At the same time that this was happening at the same time as slaves were sort of rebelling and resisting slavery and aiding the union army the up country as their known southern whites. The poor subsistence largely subsistence farmers of the appalachians but and essentially anywhere of mountainous terrain where plantation agriculture and the hegemonic culture that plant technology plantation agriculture created couldn't sustain itself and in those places. Resistance to the confederacy was always relatively high and got higher over the course of the war. As the confederacy asked more and more of smallholders of poor whites and less and less of The rich plantation owner class. The the south instituted a draft. Before the north did it exempted before the north.

It had its 100 man policy. It exempted owners of slaves. I believe more than 20 slaves from conscription and most interestingly and importantly. I think the interests of individual slave owners came to conflict with the interest of the confederate cause because there was money to be made from dealing cotton and other materials to the yankee and veda which was too much of a temptation for many southern southern plantation owners to resist. Meanwhile the poor up country whites were the vast majority of the military. They were they were they were the the cannon fodder of the war and they were also asked to pay the lion's share of taxation and suffer the most the ones who stayed home due to shortages in food. There were bred riots throughout the south. There's a the most famous one was in richmond but they were all over the south and this led to a wide light wide-scale sabotage draft resistance and union sentiment in the upcountry of the south. Now that did not translate to some sort of solidarity with slavery with slaves because in many cases upcountry southerners blamed blacks for slavery as much as they blamed the owners of blacks for slavery and I just there's one quote from that fauna.

 puts in here from a methodist circuit riding preacher in eastern tennessee which was a hotbed of anti-confederate sentiment because it was mountainous and in fact if it hadn't been for the quick deployment of confederate troops to root out unionist sentiment and hang unionist leaders. There's a good chance that eastern tennessee could have seceded from tennessee the same way that western virginia did earlier in the war which by the way west virginia being able to secede from the confederacy and become its own state that was the one site of the war where mcclellan was able to distinguish himself at all. That's where he got his early reputation was in securing western virginia which allowed it to secede from the confederacy that would that could have happened in eastern tennessee except for the the confederate army which came in and started hanging people without due process because they love liberty so much but what this this preacher this anti-confederate you pro-union preacher.

William. Brownlow said that he wished to arm every wolf panther catamount and bear in the mountains of america. Every rattle snake and crocodile every devil in hell and turn them loose upon the confederacy. I just and that's the way that like people who now all have confederate on their houses and then their shirts and stuff. That's how people at that point felt about the confederacy because you're always most aware of the exploitation being perpetrated by those nearest you and then and that hostility between the upcountry and the plantation regions that had predated the war and it was exacerbated and intensified by the war and founder notes this just to say once again that this is a moment of profound friction and conflict and change. The relationship people have to their government to the institutions that they have taken for granted is in flux and then in the north fauna talks about the way that anti-union sentiment was to be found. Not only among the butternut regions of southern ohio and illinois indiana which were filled with people who had migrated from tennessee and kentucky and virginia and who had slave sympathies slave slavery sympathies but also among the urban irish immigrants and the draft ride of 1863 is a big example of that and in this case you have people who are being asked to fight for a union that they do not feel that they are being um benefited by that and to defeat a system that they do not find to be a threat to them and there is one interesting distinction though which is that while the northern weather confederate elite found themselves in a situation where their narrow self-interest was often in conflict with the self.

The the collective interest of the confederacy. The confederate project in the north being if you had access to capital and you were in any way in industry. Your self-interest was in fully supporting the labor of the the war effort because that's where the money came from The the northern economy was completely revolutionized by the injection of a vast amount of liquid currency fiat currency into the economic system in a country which had not had at any point before that. A national currency that's the thing to remember is that before the civil war there was not a lot of currency in circulation in a lot of parts of this country especially farther away from cities and places where there was currency. It was issued by banks which had charters from the government allowing them to to to issue currency backed by a reserve of gold that they held um and in order to fight the war.

The united states created greenbacks which were backed by nothing other than america's force and which injected which created a explosion of economic. Activity was incredibly beneficial to um northern agriculture but was and also about. Was very beneficial to people who held debt who were in debt to financial institutions because they could pay back with cheap money that which they borrowed with dear money but for for workers for that burgeoning class of wage laborers inflation cut into their their actual income it red. They saw a real drop in a drop in real wages over the course of the war which was one of the things that exacerbated hostility to the war effort itself and so in pointing. This out phoner is saying these systems are in flux and more than anything we are seeing one system be destroyed and another defeat victorious the contradictions within them both contributing to their victory and the the to the defeat and if anybody I mean honestly.

I don't think there's any case to be made that there is a moral that you could say that there is a moral superiority in any sense to to the jeffersonian small government model as it ended up being practiced in the south because one of the big things that kept those poor whites. So poor is that there was very little taxation or infrastructure or or public education of any kind in the south which is one of the things that actually paradoxically allowed for the tension between poor whites and plantation economy to remain. Latent was because not a lot was asked of poor people. There was a very little taxation in the first place and that and that allowed the state to sort of be seen as you know not an interdicting fact in people's lives. But the reality of that then that ended up being that people were stuck in a pretty much a permanent condition of poverty that they could not overcome that they could that the ladder of improvement that like wigish model in the north allowed for was totally off the chart off the table for southern poor southern whites.

But that was not because it was not the result of explicit policy but rather the lack of policy. It was not necessarily directly tied to tied in the minds of you know poor whites to the state itself to the to the powers itself that changed though when taxes started going up to pray for the war and conscription started to send people to fight the war and then in the north. You have this new industrial economy ex spinning up into existence in order to fight the war and defeat the confederacy and in so doing creating one the huge expansion of the concept of rights the concept of liberty in america in a positive direction instead of the notion of you know negative rights that had predominated in the constitutional in the early federal era because of you know the the the fact that there there was a war on that was over the course of the war more and more identified with the cause of human freedom but to fight that war and to win in the win that war and to create the economy that could do so.

It ended up concentrating economic power in the halls of finance and and among this new class of captains of industry. These new industrial leaders and who would use that power to guarantee to assert assure that for themselves that whatever political reality emerged from the war it would be one that would take as its basic premise the inviability of private property. The inviability of of the financial sector and of the wage relationship more than anything phoner in this chapter is saying that is pointing out the the the points of friction conflict and opportunity and I think more than anything emphasizing the fluidity of the situation and that fluidity which in retrospect can often appear to be predetermined because you look at a situation and it often does become difficult to see where anything different could have happened. But the reality of the war is that so many established forms were breaking up that that what came after was really contingent and over the course of the book we're gonna find out exactly how those contingencies solidified into reality oh. But I was off track for a second. I was talking about how I don't think there is a moral.

There is no argument you can make morally that the plantation system that emerged in the south out of the jeffersonian notion of small government was in any way superior to the northern federalist slash wig notion of internal improvements and central authority. So if there is no moral superiority there and even like stipulating let's stipulate that that the federalist free system isn't even better. I mean i. I don't think that's true. I think if you have slavery in your system. It's inherently worse but forget that say they're fine or say. They're equivalently immoral because they're equivalent in that they are systems of class oppression. They are systems of extraction of surplus from one group of people for the enjoyment of another that's the case in both systems. The mechanisms the social forms are different but that's the reality of both of them and then they went to war with one another and one of them. At every point. All of the things that were supposed to be virtues of the system ended up undermining the ability of the state to defend itself whereas in the north. Every sys every element of the system combined to make this system into a more effective fighting force into a more effective defender and exerter of its state prerogative and if morals are out the q out of the door then the which one was better to me is solved. Hamilton was right.

Jefferson was wrong. The war was the civil war proved it. You can't say one was morally superior to another or that one system had. Had a superior respect for individual freedom or rights or liberty or any of that. Neither of them did they are both systems of securing class rule. One of them secured it effectively. One of them secured hilariously and effectively and was essentially subsidized by the other until it could no longer sustain it until that relationship could sustain itself at which point it was destroyed by the other but that conflict had to be resolved through force because both sides had enough had enough access to land and enough access to capital to build essentially competing social structures within a fantasy of a national government which had a constitutional system that was designed to sublimate conflict until it could no longer be sublimated. Any longer at which point conflict became overt and boom. The north won did larry flint really die damn all right r.i.p.

To a real one are they gonna roll his dead ass into a volcano or something that'd be pretty funny. So if anybody has any questions about what was in the first chapter we could go over them a little bit otherwise we'll really get into it. I think next week. I'm gonna do two chapters and I'm gonna for that one. I'm gonna like take notes and everything and go through them. This time.

I didn't really do that the thing about the american system is that it is designed to sublimate all I mean. This is true of all democratic governing deliberative. Institutions is that they are designed to mystify and baffle and sublimate conflict away from from reality and into into sort of performance but the ability to keep doing that is really just predicated on. It's not predicated on anything intrinsic to the system. It's not predicated on the values that the system inculcates. It's premised on the ability of the system to ameliorate conflict materially and in america that has always been the ability to after to offload issues offload.

Social conflict through the assimilation of land and the distribution of resources through expropriation here and then globally that that's been always it and and the current conflict we are in is that we have reached the point of where exploration has has become diminishing where we have diminishing returns for ex-corporation and that that that means that the latent conflict is re-emerging and the civil war was a similar situation. The the the only way to ameliorate the conflict between the northern and southern modes of production was continued expansion on the terms of the south but that over time became too too existentially threatening to the northern political system and and economic system. That's why I often wonder if the whigs had gotten in there after william henry harrison had died say. William henry clay becomes president instead of john tyler and you have a wig governant government in the aftermath of the 1837 panic sort of re-orienting politics away from expansion and towards internal improvement that perhaps you don't have that headlong dash to the pacific and the eventual annihilation of the south. I don't know someone says the slavery was the only system that could make the south economically competitive with the north that is true. Because it was it was it was.

It was the it's the land that allows for for um. You know massive profit through the sale of cash crops but the thing is why the are they competing. It's one country. The whole notion of the of their of them being in competition arose from the historical accident of of the states coming in as sort of equals rather than as the the emerging as a as a as like a a whole a whole political unit but regional conflict between regional ruling classes has to at some point be sublimated and that was the project of european centralization. The creation of like the the creation of the of absolutist monarch model of like the early modern era you know like louis xiv that was not at the expense of like the regular french citizens. It was at the expense of local barons. It was at the expense of regional power and that was true everywhere that that centralized authority emerged in europe how radical were the german immigrants in missouri during the war. In reconstruction they were certainly more radical than the regular white people who lived in missouri that's for sure the germans were responsible for missouri staying in the union It was german militia that drove the pro-secession forces out of st louis at the beginning of the war and denied them the ability to to join the confederacy in the first place and yeah the the german immigrants of of missouri but also ohio wiscons. In they were pennsylvania. They were more class conscious certainly than native-born northern forces for the most part. Because many of them had come from they had they had fled like absolutism. And specifically a lot of them had fled the the destruction of like the artisan class by the industrial revolution and they he came to america to try to reassert like artisan rights which put them in conscious conflict not with not just eastern banks but also large landowners like part of the problem of class consciousness or at least oh as the conflict of the part of the problem of native white americans. Seeing the slave power for what it was is that they did not have that that instinctive conflict with large landowners in the south. Northern northerners didn't anyway like they might have seen slavery as a competing labor system but they did not see themselves in any way as personally oppressed by the large landowners of the south. Whereas for a lot of these germans when they saw the big land owners of the south. They thought of the junkers they thought of the yonkers of prussia who over weaned the the the german confederation at that point and and and were the were an occupying foreign force in most of the rhineland which is which is where many of the german catholic immigrants came from so when they saw the fancy lads in their with their dueling and their and their fake walter scott cosplay. They saw the face of their own exploitation and their own alienation.

You I'll pronounce it how. I want junker that's stupid. I mean. It's. I'm an american. I'm calling it junker kick you in the junker. There's no such thing as native white americans okay tell that to them good god get out of here give me a break talking about. It's like self communities by through their own self-conception. They thought of themselves as americans yes muncher with baron von munchausen.

I haven't read the new matte carp article yet. I'm looking forward to it. His election analysis is always absolute fire so I'm sure it'll be great. I don't actually someone asked about the counterfactual 1848. That's not one where I really feel like there was a lot of possibilities outside of what actually happened. That was really that's why would.

I have read that I don't know um because it was a a movement of people who had no c common cause that there was no unity at all and in and you can't even say that unity could have come through struggle. The way that it might have happened and was happening to some degree for the course of the civil war. Because there was no struggle to unify with through. It was always piecemeal haphazard the cop the spontaneous un marshaled and unlit led and it was a it. Was a continent-wide emergence of more than anything bourgeois insistence upon like the liberal state and as that meant a lot of coalition building with like early forms of working-class organization. But once again the working class in practice was still very much in its infancy at that point in europe. The majority of workers who rebelled in the cities of europe during 1848 were not wage workers. For say they were mostly artisans who were being squeezed by the like.

The imposition of free trade and and the you know concentration of capital which was still which was early but was still was still pressing them. It was essentially a a yeah. It was a combination of a new urban small bourgeois fighting with a sort of pre-capitalist aligned with a pre-capitalist artisan class and on an odd hack on an ad hoc basis mostly organized around questions of nationalism and language and in such a situation. I really don't think that they're there there are way too many things that would have to go drastically differently in order to have the overall contours of that event change in any significant way well maybe the idea that the american revolutionary war was the second english civil war. Kevin.

Phillips talks about that in a really interesting book called the cousins war which where he essentially says that the revolutionary the english civil war the revolutionary war and the civil war are all one long conflict in the anglo-sphere between land owners a feudal landowning ruling class and an emergent merchant middle class which would eventually take over from feudalism and that those three wars are essentially the wars that over the course of those 300 years saw feudalism fully overthrown and replaced by capitalism and I think that there's a lot to that and his main argument is is that the social basis of the two sides in all. Three of those wars is basically the same the english civil war. Obviously you can't say that this is true completely. You know there were examples there were counter examples on each side but it was broadly a battle between emerging urban urban merchants and big land owners. The the round heads the puritan side were city. Dwellers were merchants and the cavaliers were the large feudal landowning class. Then the civil the revolutionary war is essentially a battle between the most industrious and most religiously effusive of those merchants going to the united states creating essentially their own country and then going to war with a homeland that was still largely controlled within itself by the large land owning old feudal order. Although of course there were plenty of you know. The the wigs at that point were already like the merchant party they were the urban party within that and they were by the way the people who are most likely to be sympathetic to the united states william pitt whose pittsburgh is named after was the way a wig politician who supported the The colonists and then the civil war is of course the culmination of that on the home. Fully in the united states and then every and once and here you have the large the the the neo-feudal. The attempt to like the attempt was essentially in the south to recreate the the old feudal order in the new world conflicting with the new. The merchant state the industrial merchant state of the north and like these battles are are are a war in the place where capitalism is emerging and it's in its like most effective and durable form out of sort of a feudal loam. But that process is not a a fast or decisive one. It is a it is a dialectical process. It is existing forms of power negotiating with emergent forms of power through politics and when politics fails through warfare but at every point the victory was made was won by capitalists at the expense of the feudal order and by the end of it the feudal order had been broken.

The mule funeral guys in the revolution did not mostly side with the united with the revolution that's not true the reason that cornwall marched south after taking after they took New york is because there was much more loyalist sympathy in the south. Amongst the large landowners now guys like washington and jefferson of course were pro um were pro-revolution but that was not true broadly among the the large landowning class. In the south. So he tended to be more loyal more tory guys like washington. The reason that they were for the union is because have you ever noticed. It's mostly guys from virginia the state that's closest to the the northern merchant capitals. That's whose economies are most tied in. There. Those were the people who were the most who were the large landowners of the south were most like most likely to support the patriot side washington george. Washington was a was absolutely a um even though he was a landowner.

He had the mind of a merchant he he was. His entire life was consumed with the notion of advancement of of of social and monetary success which are antithetical values to the decadent. Land-based urban ruling elite who were beaten largely because their social order looked down upon the sort of striving that people like washington made their lives around and part of the reason for that is that washington did not come from a large from a a family of huge. Like noble birth. He came from a middling class of of of landowners and clergy actually who came to america and immediately started grinding. He was he was from a long line of grinders which is not true of the lot of the large landowners.

 of the south who supported supported the king and the thing that in that book by the way that will that phillips gets really into that reflects what fauna is talking about is that in every region there is a conflict between up country poor settlers and the settled like delta plantation region settlers and wherever and who had whatever politic the politics of the of the elite were the upcountry poors had the opposite so wherever there was hegemonic support for the patriot cause among the local elite. The local smallholders and poor people poor whites were tories and wherever the large large landowners and large elites were tories. The local small holders and poor people were patriots and the challenge. The challenge that reconstruction presented was the challenge of knitting together. These dispossessed groups into a political coalition and that did not happen and the fact that it didn't happen is why why the yankee leviathan ended up becoming completely captured by the emerging industrial robber baron elite. Yes. That's the other thing about. Virginia is that it was the largest of the colonies population and it was also very interested in expansion westward which put it in direct competition with england after 1860 proclamation which for bad settlement beyond the appalachians and guys like george. Washington had direct financial interest in seeing those lands explored settled and sold because land speculation was a huge potential revenue source.

Oh the impeachment trial who why or how could you care and I'm I understand that some people hear you say that and I think oh you're being an edge lord you're not taking it seriously enough and I understand. I don't want to make peop. I don't want to feel like oh. It's not a big deal. It was pretty wild when people rushed the senate and like that is kind of wild that that happened and that the president told people to do it. That is that is a new shift that's a new phase. I understand that but this particular thing this particular process the impeachment trial. After the guy's out of office. It really does feel like more than anything it is a emotional pressure release.

It is a way for people to have their feelings validated and go through their trauma and then sort of heal about it and if you want to do that if you have the trauma and you feel like that's helpful that's fine and if you feel like watching. This helps you do that that's fine but expecting anybody who is who does not feel that trauma that they have to join with you in this spectacle. That's what I don't understand and that's where I refuse to go along with it. Because everyone knows what's going to happen. There is no amount of eloquence. There is no amount of persuasive evidence that could be presented that will get a conviction out of this process.

There are not enough republicans who want to lose their next election basically and so they're not going to do it. They will not happen and with that in mind. I honestly wonder for a lot of these people who insist that this is a very important thing don't you worry about that fact don't you worry about the fact that this horrible transgression is going to go down in history as having been validated by the deliberative process of the senate. The only way this thing makes sense as a political project is if you are really convinced that that capital breach is going to be the thing that destroys the republican party that that the center of gravity of american politics is going to shift away from republicans because they refused to condemn this thing fully and I think that's the only kind of that's the kind of thing you can only believe if you really do live in a bubble if you and and of course. No one is more bubbled than these in washington and more and I think even more importantly. Nobody is more invested in shifting politics away from real stakes and material interests than the democrats.

Either capitalism did replace feudalism not in the sense that because people are pointing out like we're going back we're going towards something that is going to be neo-feudalist techno-feudalism and doesn't that mean that feudalism never went away. A mode of production is a bunch of things. It's a bunch of social concepts and the thing is is that feudalism had at its at its social base an understanding of the world that is not the same as capitalism. The capitalism a set. The liberal liberal subjectivity is not futile. It is different and so in since now liberal subjectivity is hegemonic. Feudalism is gone now if capitalism is replaced with this system of like feudal obligations enforced through technological means not through social means. You could say that like as a mere um mechanism of extraction that you have something that resembles feudalism but its social basis is completely different. It the the social. The undergirding social logic is one of capitalist individualism and to say that and that means and so whatever comes out of that will maintain that will maintain that social reality.

I mean if you really want to go back far enough like. It's always been a war between masters and servants and masters have always won like the masters have always won. The only thing that changes is the is the rationale and conditions and social basis of that mastery. Like when the when the bourgeois overthrew capitalism it was not liberation. It was not human liberation. It was not the subject being being liberated. It was one group of rulers being replaced with another and a new justification for their rule was there anything progressive about the american revolution yes like. It's you cannot have the possibility for socialism until you have capitalism first demolishing feudal. The feudal order right socialism is a shadow form of capitalism. It is it is only conceivable in the real context of capitalism and capitalist relations that allows socialism to emerge as a conception like the freedom of like the the the liberation. The of of a feudal order of a pre-industrial fuel fuel order is essentially a regression to tribal self-sufficiency and then capitalism gives birth to socialism as as a as. It's as a culmination um well.

See that's the thing about russia and china is that they really weren't supposed to be where where socialist revolution happened. They really weren't modern capitalist societies that had like that had reached the point of of contradiction that could be resolved through through socialism yeah. Like I'm more and more come to the idea that I kind of think that once the once the german revolution failed the bolshevik should have made a deal with the peasants. I think maybe bakarin was right in the whole debate about what to do about industrialization and what to do about the peasantry because the the entire premise of the bolshevik revolution has been had been as the opening act of a world revolution yeah but would have would world war. Two have happened the same way see that's there was no when bukharin was arguing. For this stuff.

The nazis didn't exist yet they were not in charge like that you you're looking back through the lens and saying yes but they needed to do all that to win world war ii. That's not historically grounded that's trying to like pick a side and win an argument and yeah. It's like people love to give the soviets credit for for beating the nazis. But they essentially handed the keys of the world over to the united states who were just who were where the nazis got. All their ideas from explicitly hitler looked at manifest destiny was taking notes the whole time.

The thing is is that there's nothing that's inevitable nothing is inevitable in retrospect. When things have solidified into history. You can see why maybe something else couldn't have happened but those those those superpositions don't solidify until the moment of action until things occur that can that can that can be looked back on so like the degree to which people turn marxism into a teleology of inevitable victory which I think honestly is more of a 20th century thing than a thing. People still think that was a way to to justify themselves to justify their actions to justify their adherence to a regime as like the sole repository of you know like the of socialism as a project. There's no inevitability to any of this but there is within like when within capitalism there is the potential for socialism. That's just the fact that's the truth and then you have to analyze that question and okay if you. If that's true and socialism is superior. Then how do we. Get there you cannot assume in the inevitability of anything.

They didn't have the specter of catastrophic climate collapse but they did have a real belief that they were all going to get killed in a nuclear war people forget that like people who want to be doom-pilled now about my climate there was for the among educated people in the all of the world. There was a very strong belief that any given day a nuclear war might happen that would destroy all life on earth and that now is so receded into the backdrop of people's minds and been replaced with climate dumerism that the fact that this thing that was very close. I mean it wasn't just the cuban missile crisis. There's a able archer there's I mean. There were two soviet military officers who had it in their in their hands to cause the nuclear war once during once in the 80s and once during the cuban missile crisis and both times they said no and their human decision is what saved humanity. It was nothing having to do with our systems of mutually shared destruction and our beautifully crafted defense doctrines. It was human choice. It was human agency in the moment that's how fluid and how contingent things are petrov and of course it could happen and honestly. It'd be kind of funny if we end up getting a nuclear war anyway due to climate change conflict. That's totally possible but that sure wasn't what people in like 1963 were thinking was gonna happen.

I think you'll I'm just saying that to to say that that basing your actions in the present on an assumed social outcome either good or bad in the future is always going to just end up being in practice self-indulgence because you're you're at you're not responding to reality. You're making a reality to operate off of and the question is are you make what are you making that reality for and I think if you're assuming annihilation. The only reason that you would want to make that reality and live as that reality is if you want an excuse if you want an excuse to not do things that are difficult to not sacrifice to not build your spirit because what's the point but every day you do that and you're still here. You're hurting yourself and everyone around you. We are in fact already dead. I mean like we're we all died already. It's like your life in the grand scheme of things is around down to zero like it's already happened and this society is already dead but what comes after it is not known.

It can't be known. It's not black pill. God damn it. I'm saying you can't no you cannot know. But if you if you sell yourself you do. It's not because you studied everything then you've come to the correct conclusion because you don't have enough information. Nobody has that information that information is not accessible no matter how much the fantasy of online of the of the information super highway and spinning around the world of the idea that you can reach out and grab all the knowledge and pull it under yourself. Even if you could do that you still have to sort it.

You still have to prioritize it and those choices are not being made objectively. They're being made from either love either from a desire to to see love expressed in the world or out of a desire to selfishly maintain a a life of of indulgence. Whatever that means because you know you can it can be miserable but it can be a misery that is familiar and therefore soothing and comforting oh and on this somebody asked about anti-natalism. I'm fully against that you have to believe in a future even if it's not going to happen. You have to believe in a future if you don't want kids.

I'm sorry yeah first reformed is a great film in a movie. I didn't really appreciate as much when I first saw it because of how enmeshed. I was in the very pathologies that ethan hawk's character presents like he's gonna blow up the koch brothers. But not because he wants. It's going to make anything better it's because he wants to go out on his own terms. It's because he has given up on on connecting to anyone or anything outside of himself.

But of course that doesn't mean anyone is obligated to have kids like freaks psychos like rouse doth that doubt it think but if the choice needs to be it needs to be interrogated at the personal level not fobbed off on some ham cack-handed and self-serving analysis of the geopolitical world or the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. That's made up. That's not real carbon is not made up but your idea of what's going to happen is made up. I'm sorry has to be you don't know as much as you think you do. I don't none of us do. Besides we might not even have to worry about the question of having kids. If if that up endocrine systems is is if that if that keeps happening at the rate. It is then you won't even have to make the choice. Everyone will just be sterilized children of men's style and then hey that'll solve global warming. So then what were you worried about because like there you go there's two things that you can look at the data and they're both very compelling cases for human extinguishment through climate change and also the fact that we might not be able to reproduce in 20 years because everybody's balls are filled with microplastic both very compelling you can fixate on both of them you can't know either way and they conflict with one another. One of them could solve the other problem either way you still gotta up. That's just a weird thing to make political and it speaks more to some sort of psychosexual thing honestly or or a compensatory thing than than any real earnest good faith engagement with politics. Now that maybe the garbage the algae bloom will eat all the co2 you know.

I think the most important thing to just remember about all that stuff is that you cannot filter your underlying spiritual attitude your underlying matrix of reward from your analysis all right. I'm gonna wrap it up so next week. I'm gonna read the we're gonna read. The next two chapters chapters two and three of reconstruction. I will have some notes this time next time which I didn't do this time sorry about that. So we're gonna go through it because I'm reading it on my phone actually. I've got the kindle app on my phone which means. I can't look at it when I'm talking here so. I'm gonna have to start taking notes the thing. I didn't really realize until today which my bad but so chapters two and three for next week reconstruction by eric foner bye-bye.
