How do you feel. I need to let go you know you know. No. You don't you don't wanna shine on through the hearts of man. I wanna reach out and the hearts of man. I wanna reach out with the back of my broken hand. Another headache another heartbreak. I'm so much older than I can take reflection well. It comes and goes on the direction to perfection. No no no no help me out.

Here. We go hi guys we're back on the case how goes it out there in twitch land. I hope it's going well. I hope everyone's ready for the second of turns out two presidential debates. Gotta say I'm excited now that I've pushed through to the other side of the looking looking glass and especially after.

I watched them both simultaneously during the town hall last week which actually ended up being way less jarring and discombobulating than the first debate because one I had a bunch of other co-hosts who were talking so that added you know cognitive uh distortions but just the fact that they were talking like at the same time but about without being aware of it like without you know challenging one another it really uh. It gave it sort of like a soothing um like symphonic quality because I was able to sort of tune pay attention to one or the other like I'd hear both. But if I looked at one of them I could hear them more directly and the other one kind of fell into the background and so I could kind of pick my pick. I could turn into a pixie song and I could go for a nice like shell like a nice a minute or so just listening to joe just this soft for grandfatherly senescence of of joe just sounding like he's talking himself into uh into dreamland sounds like he's getting he's waiting and it sounds like he's waiting to get the edward g robinson treatment from soylent green and that's soothing. But you know it could get it would get boring if I listen to the whole thing.

So. Then I just look at trump and he's screaming at samantha guthrie about how we have the best we're doing the best. We have the best test we have more tests than anybody in china. No and it's like boom they. It's like loud quiet loud and then you go back after that becomes too taxing and you go back to biden. It's like soothing again with them actually talking to each other and having like one conversation. I think it's gonna be uh honestly more challenging to keep zen. But I think with my last couple of experiences. I've learned to just absorb the gestalt and you just absorb sort of the noises the sounds yeah like like a symphony like like their voices are just instruments for aesthetic appreciation. They do not exist to communicate uh ideas or facts or policy or anything.

Is there a more failed world leader in history than benito mussolini that's an interesting question because on the one hand mussolini is one of the great political entrepreneurs of the modern era. This is a guy who saw the writing on the wall in world war. One saw it as the death knell for like marxian socialism as a meaningful political current or at least a political current that could realistically take power uh in europe after world war ii because you know they sure were hedging towards that point when world war one happened and shattered everything uh as we've talked about before on the streams but a lot of socialists were left after world war. Ii very bereft of like an understanding of how to move forward and you saw them fall to bloody uh internal mayhem and germany and elsewhere because no one knew what to do especially after the the soviets won. But uh mussolini looked at what was happening said what do we got here we've got a left wing. That's got this massive popular base but is existentially feared by the powers of being in our society and as we just saw they're willing to do almost anything to prevent the left wing from taking power including destroying europe. Here we are what we got on the right we've got a right wing. Uh movement that has obviously or a reactionary. You know power base that has control of all the power within the society but has basically no popular uh support among actual people which in the modern era in the new 20th century era of mass politics is now necessary. So mussolini said well. We'll take the ship that gets people in the streets for the left and we'll just do it for the right and in so doing he created an entire he helped create and he wasn't the only one who did it. But he was the most he was. The first one and hitler was slavishly uh fixated on what mussolini was doing and the beer hall push was inspired by the march on rome. He thought that the nazis were in a position similar to what the black shirts were uh in 22 when uh they marched on rome and and mussolini was just given control of government by a cowed uh house of savoy and it failed miserably. They got the cops shot him and uh he went to jail obviously not for too long but anyway like that was a hell of an insight that was a hell of a uh move. You know he's kind of like a ray kroc figure of politics uh and I say all that in with those terms because fascism needs to be understood first and foremost as this incredibly cynical attempt to create something that will work it was a it was a it was a a brand.


It was a it was a um. It were people. It was a group of people in search of power uh who had branding that they knew worked like what the kind of stuff that had emerged out of the push for socialism in europe had created like this. Uh this thing that the public at large understood to mean opposition to the status quo in opposition to the powers that be and the idea of a new and better world than the one. We had a progressive one and he pulled what worked out of that and put it out there to prop up capitalism. Basically. Not the old rulers not the old people who ran capitalism necessarily but but capital in general which meant that they got they were able to draw large numbers of people into their organization with the promise of redemptive violence which people love but without having to worry about really getting any kind of pushback from power in fact getting supported by power and getting huge checks huge uh uh wheelbarrows of lyra from uh the big landowners uh and uh the budding capitalists to break strikes and stop agricultural work stoppages and it got him into power almost immediately like look how long it took hitler to get his.

Together. Italy took power almost immediately in 1922. That's impressive but then the problem with fascism is that it really does it is predicated on imperial expansion. It's predicated on uh on expanding its internal market through domination of new territory and new resources uh because of its resistance to the subsumption into any kind of like uh global network of power. Like it's it's a uh. It's a philosophy of national supremacy which meant that for italy and uh. I mean. I don't think it's a coincidence. Italy and germany were the countries that had fascism and they were also the countries that missed out because they weren't. Uh they were late in being formed as nation states as coherent nation states.

They lost out on all the imperial spoils that had allowed capitalism to extend itself and extend its capacity beyond like the locations of its original founding. But if they were going to maintain capitalism as the engine of our economy uh and resist the sort of corporate of uh like naked capital domination that leads to uh uh the social atomization and uh uh that you see in the in like the cap advanced capitalist countries so rather than do that rather than strip that national character you've got to grab some of that territory and when they try to do that it didn't go very well. Ethiopia was honestly harder than it should have been considering what the ethiopian military was capable of and they still used poison gas and  uh and then everything during world war ii really everything during world war ii. He honestly might have helped save the soviet union because operation. Barbarossa had to be uh postponed uh because when it was originally supposed to happen because against hitler's pleas mussolini invaded greece after taking albania and in so doing got his ass kicked so bad that greeks were actually taking back parts of albania and so they had to divert forces to invade and uh conquer the greeks would throw the timetable off and then yeah overthrown taken away by otto scorseny to live in salo to where he presumably ate poop.

According to that movie then caught in a roadway shot by a firing squad hung up by his ankles at a gas station that's pretty fail that's pretty fail but the only reason I can't give him. A full fail grade is because he really was a guy who came from nowhere you know. I think one of the definitions of fail for me. That's most important is that a lot of it comes with just being of the generation that comes that later the generation that's had it happened are for them already the ones who are supposed the ones who are given the position of someone who has amassed a huge fortune or a huge amount of power in the world but then none had developed none of the traits that the person who had uh developed in the course of getting it. You know what I mean like the things that the things that help you get somewhere are the things that help you stay there and he didn't and these guys a fail person to me is someone who got the position but had none of anything that uh like makes you worthy of the role you know in any meaningful sense.

Obviously you know we're talking about cap. Even in capitalism. There is still a role for like skill and ability and that's what capitalists like to point to is the thing that we're trying to reward with this system. But it's very very small. What we mostly reward. What is vastly vastly over rewarded is luck and not just like the luck to not have a brick fall on your head or you know get cancer or something which is part of it or get disabled in a specific way. Uh that's all part of the luck but the big part of the luck is being born into a position of already uh of already having assumed power and we're being ruled right now by the copies of the copies of the copies who built this liberal meritocratic system and so they have none of the the the abilities that are developed and chosen for through like the theoretical uh. Uh competitive architecture of capitalism or politics. So I think anybody who is really fail they have to have in some respect. Some significant respect fumbled. The ball dropped the bag and hit and mussolini  made the bag in the first place.


Uh fargo people are asking about fargo uh five episodes in very poor. In my opinion very bad show. Uh just the it's blunt. It's obvious in a way that it didn't used to be like I kind of got bored with the way it would create these thematic and symbolic uh presence to be opened by reviewers. But I now realize that I kind of missed that compared to the just lack of any subtext and I think that's because they're trying to address a social issue which it's not. I mean the whole point of fargo right. It's supposed to be a riff on the coens the coin universe and the cohen worldview and the cohen aesthetic right and I'm sorry but that's not a big feature of it. It's like social awareness. You know that's not really what they are interested in and a movie and a series of shows that like don't really make sense honestly outside of that context. There's a reason that's called that there's a reason that they have all these like the plots and the settings and even the characters they're all established by coen brothers archetypes and now they're making a season that's about like you know the realities of race as it's lived in america and I'm sorry that's not something that cohens have ever really cared about and as a result you see just like the term paper mindset kick in where it's like we're going to give everybody a monologue about racism every episode which is not something that the previous seasons had but I will say like. I don't think. This is some huge drop of quality because fargo was always like clever but not fantastic just because it was so so you know fixated on like appealing to you know an idea of quality and now.

I think the thing about this season is is like now that element like having to have a racial or like a social awareness element to the plot. I think that's now here not just as like some pander but because are not like a direct pander to like oh people are woke now. Let's give them something that's woke but just you know if the show really does seem to be in some way being driven uh by like the pers the idea of what the critical response will be then now. I think in this current moment everyone is aware that the new critical consensus has that like for a real work of art to mean anything in the popular culture. It has to speak to these questions and if it doesn't it is inferior and I just don't think that's true.

I disagree with that premise gabinet uh somebody wants uh biden cabinet uh predictions. I'm gonna go with the grimace for secretary of the state. Uh I know you're gonna think uh hamburglar at treasury no thank you hamburglar at defense. No. I honestly don't get why people get riled up about uh any of the pet cabinet stuff one. It's all just being leaked by specific staffers to make up like to do some internal office politics. Like that and just assume oh. This is like the campaign telling us the truth. As opposed to. This is some weasel in the campaign trying to position themselves for the post-campaign era and you know that doesn't mean that it's not true and it certainly wouldn't be surprising. But it's also not something that one first of all we can even no means anything other than office politics and people shocking for position which I mean tells you something but two it doesn't.

Government will be run we know because we actually saw a primary contest that had like meaningful stakes and the party destroyed a number of its presiding uh institutional concepts from me too to the iowa caucus and then killed their own  voters and if you can't give them uh. You can't say that they're dumb like trump when he denied the pandemic. They're the they're the party of science right they listen to doctors and they were telling people after the  lockdown started. I'd go vote don't worry about it be a hero do democracy and if anyone said don't do it. They said wow the sanders campaign bringing up the ugly history of voters voter intimidation and suppression hearkening back to the days before the civil rights act when democratic when minority democrats were prevented from voting and that's what bernie sanders and his gang of bulls connor are trying to do like that was a fight and like they didn't want biden. I think it's pretty clear when you see how wide the field was and how long it took that the last thing they wanted was to have this  fossil on top of the ticket.

But they had no other options because the party faithful broadly construed didn't really have any preference among the heirs to the throne because the democratic party has forgot how to appeal to actual voters like look at what look at what the democratic electorate and these are people who are democrats. They accept so many of the premises of the democratic party. They they're in fact basically enthralled to the democratic party because they will vote the way they're told to which is what they ended up doing. But when it's when they were forced to choose between a choice like they basically got a lineup. The the ms the dnc basically said here's your choice. It's who you want and of course. Bernie was off the table bernie had his supporters. Birdie had his chunk of the electorate and you know he was working to try to expand that mostly through reaching out to non-voters didn't work well enough. But that was the goal meanwhile you've got the regular democrats.


These are the people who go in there and punch the ticket on the dems every four years. Every two years. These are people who don't believe a lot of the uh you know right-wing uh american knee-jerk slanders around the democrat party like they don't think that they're eating babies you know they think that nafta might have had some bad effects. But in general it made america better. You know like these people are not even like trump curious folks right. These are solid democrats and with presented with a next generation of people a next generation to assume the mantle of the obama clinton uh neoliberal democratic party. The dnc the dlc mutant that emerged out of the 80s uh and post and in this like in a post 2008 world. This is these are your options kamal uh buddhish gila brand uh biden whatever uh all of the new ones all of the ones that were supposed to be the fresh face. Uh were got no influence. No no. I mean no uh real interest. Besides of course. The freaks in iowa new hampshire who specifically uh are fixated on the new and the fresh. Basically they see themselves as like focus groups and they see give themselves the self-satisfaction and seriousness of purpose of a focus group. Like okay.

This is going to determine the next year's new flavor of eminem. I have to make sure that it's a good one or like oh my god. These chips if they're bad that's going to be my fault like they think that way because they're first everyone else is actually trying to think of like who they want to beat uh who they think could beat trump and who they'd actually like to see and none of them caught fire at all. None of them got any real stick with any of those people. The only one who got any support was as a default joe biden because he was the one most directly connected to obama who they actually liked and who they were really fond for the guy who was able to successfully mask neoliberalism with a uh like a a appeal not like just to black americans but to like a whole segment of like college educated whites as well. That uh that just disarm them to any of his faults and to the democratic party party not the democratic party's faults in general which they have you know fallen away from but from the democratic party and even though these are all people who like oh you know they're all intersectional. They all know the language. They all know the language of this new you know woe capitalism.

People talk about that is the only thing that the democrats are standing for at this point and no none of them could gain traction. None of them could and when it came down to uh to south. Carolina people say like clyburn uh chose the cha. Clyburn sealed the fate of bernie and guaranteed for biden when he endorsed him uh. I think I mean that's. I think that's in a sense true. But I don't think it's because clyburn picked by the democrats and said biden. I want him what happened was it was getting down to the wire. None of the other people had any kind of uh support among his actual base in south carolina. He didn't want to go like out outside the lane to pick somebody that he knew people didn't like who did people still like they still like. Biden just give it to them like that's what he knew that he was connected enough to his own constituents to know that biden's the guy that people like because they think it relates to uh if they remind him of obama and they think that because they think he's a safe choice he can win and that's because they don't know his brain is gone like everyone in the democratic party does so clyburn was forced if I'm gonna be if. I'm. I'm either gonna keep my mouth shut until election day and then I know then. I've lost my power because who needs me for anything or I'm going to ratify the decision of my supporters or my constituents by saying uh biden and then getting everybody in south carolina to get rally around that which is what happened because south carolina was not just huge margins in the black community.

It was a huge surge in white suburban uh turnout for democratic primary. It was a revolution against bernie which until that point they had been stymied by the fact that none of these people looked good but biden also didn't look good and for another reason for it's like different groups had different awarenesses of the different uh. Uh problems of the other candidates and so biden was the last choice and I'm saying all this just to say they didn't do this for nothing. They did this to hold power look at what they did with the  platform where they could have said anything because everyone knows the platform doesn't mean anything they still made sure there was nothing in the in the platform about at universal healthcare or  israel or anything anything hot button. They didn't give the democrats any uh the bait the base the leftists the berniecrats they didn't give him anything because they didn't have to. They saw the measure of their opponent. They were able to defeat them which means they don't fear them anymore which is why I keep saying there is no left stake in this election from the standpoint of like doing anything in a biden presidency. There is no pushing him left there is no having them like somehow recognize the worth of having the left as a part of the coalition. The fight has been one lo has been lost at that point like we're already in the aftermath of the defeat.

Like that bernie was the effort it was to hollow out the democratic party from within like like one of those wasps who like bore into the head of like a grasshopper or something and lay eggs like if you want to vote for biden do it for whatever like harm reduction reason makes sense to you even though none of that makes sense to me at all. I don't think we're heart we're reducing dick uh but for god's sake don't do it thinking that the left has anything to do with it and by the way same thing goes for saying no. I'm going to vote for. I'm not going to vote or. I'm going to vote for a party or I'm going to vote for trump as the ultimate own that's not going to matter either because if you they lose they're still in charge and they get to blame you for not coming out. If they win they get to take you for granted again but honestly I've been thinking about it and like the entire the entire liberal argument that they give use for making the left vote is in my opinion basically incoherent uh like from just a moral perspective tell me if you think this is crazy but uh like they say a vote for a vote for anybody. But biden is essentially a vote for trump and of course that only makes sense if the underlying assumption is is that that person would be voting for biden or should be voting for biden and more importantly than should because technically shouldn't everybody be voting for biden shouldn't even uh trump supporters be voting for biden why are only leftists. The ones whose failure to vote for biden is the is the cause for them to be the reason they lost that's because they they say no no but those trump people they they are back. They're either stupid or evil you know better but see that's twining different types of knowledge into one thing like that what they're referring to is the fact that you have a similar understanding to the liberal about you know the need for you know uh things like anti-racism or uh. Uh you know civic equality uh economic egalitarianism even because the liberal will insist that they're just as socialist as you they just know it's realistic and they say we both want. These things you want those things then by not voting for biden. You are voting for trump but the thing is is that there's another level beyond just that common understanding. It's all right.

We have these values how do we enact them and that is a tactical question that is separate from the question of whether or not you have a similar understanding of what the political good is how do you achieve it. That's the whole. That's the whole thing that's the actual point of argument and they lie to completely to assume it within the greater moral imperative for you to vote and I would say that if you look at voting as it really is not as we fantastically imagine it to be as for you not as a general thing but as you as a person sitting in a voting booth uh what it is is a expression of a preference for government right. So if like you're saying the person has to vote because like everyone should vote basically the kantian imperative of do it do what you want everyone to do like in a political realm. You should behave the way you want everyone to behave and it's like yeah. Then you want people to participate because otherwise then you just have some sort of dictatorship. You have to if people aren't going to participate in a punitive democracy. You don't have one so yes you should vote but then you should vote but then the next but within that is who are you voting for because you are doing an act of individual moral reasoning. You got to remember that you're not coordinating activity. We pretend we pretend that voting is a collective endeavor instead of 100 million individual ones to allied this fact. But this is some fun like when reasoning about it if we're gonna if if I don't know what anyone else is going to do really beyond like maybe the circle of my close friends and like what I see in  polls. Then I just have to act from what I think should be done and so then the imperative is not to just vote. It's to vote your conscience which means vote for you know a third party of your choice or write in somebody because if everyone wrote for that person you'd have something good. If everyone voted for who you're voting for then you'd have a great outcome.


I mean that's and if anything that's an argument not to vote ironically to like if you're not going to vote for biden vote earnestly for a third party person of your choice or write in bernie or something. But it's not an argument about who to vote for that's separate that's about tactics and it's also about your understanding of what the parties mean and what biden's presidency would mean because there's plenty to art. There's plenty of evidence that a biden presidency will you can't say like. It's going to be not as bad as trump in a broad sense but once again like what does bad mean uh but it will definitely be a further development of terrible terrible processes. It will not be interrupting but rather accelerating the worst things that are happening in our political and economic system and even there you know who to vote for is up to you you gotta thread that needle. But it's not this open and shut case because the open and shut case is buried down here in like the moral uh argument about like a coll. A mutual understanding of like you know rights-based human humanity uh and equality even though if you really are if if they really are a diet if they were really are a lib and someone really does have you know deeply felt socialist priors. They're not even there's not even an agreement there because the idea of what constitutes you know rights and freedom is different but say at like that level you know not as deep as where the conflict begins and not as shallow as where it comes back.

Tactically. There's an agreement but that's just like one thin slice of agreement and they turn it into a moral imperative to go along with their horseshit and I say I just want to. I just sound at this point. I just want to see something funny happen trump talking about how he wanted to kiss all the guys for a couple days while he was jacked up on steroids that was pretty fun that was funny. Someone says we need to stop moralizing about everything 24 hours a day holy. If I see one fundamental flaw like beyond obviously the nature of online political argumentation I would say that you know the specific expression of that like the the the the category error that occurs that is generated by online argumentation and like the the structures of it is the constant turning of every question into a moral one. Every question is is a question of like essence like a good or bad is this act. Good or bad is this person good or bad and those questions are unsolvable by definition because unbeknownst to the people making them they're making them just to have something to do they're arguments that are made to be had who is the moralist favorite president.

Jimmy. Carter absolutely carter absolutely was a moralist first and foremost earnest one. I would argue that that jimmy carter like he has had a virtuous post-war post-presidential life. I would not argue that point at all compared to the other ones. My god. It's not even close and that kind of gives people this idea of like well. He couldn't have been that bad of a president because he is a better man than most presidents and the thing is yes. He is a better man. I would say in some sort of soul-measuring contest with the other presidents he would win but that very fact in the context of his presidency is what made him such a uniquely terrible president because he was absorbing all of this essentially reactionary uh economic uh propaganda and turning it into like the firmament like the actual structure of reality and then reasoning morally from within that constraint which as president of the united states. I'm sorry he should not be doing unless he wants to reify all of the worst emergent ideas within capitalism and the worst tendencies and he did what he did like try to bring about a recession on purpose. Steer. Somebody said uh uh that yeah that like well. Volker did a lot of it with the with the interest rate hike and that wasn't you know that was just that's technically not carter because he's you know appointing somebody first of all that's. The federal reserve is just like the supreme court. It is a political institution that is designed to look like.

It's somehow independent of the political process and it's and it's all a a a collectively agreed upon lie that we maintain in order to prop up the system which is why john goroberts is the smartest republican on earth and why every dem every republican who yells at john roberts really proves that he is well. He's either playing to the base or he's a  because roberts for example roberts joined the liberals in a pennsylvania case about a lower court ruling to stop the republicans from preventing mail-in ballots from going out three days before the pres. Before the election and some democrat republicans are genuinely pissed. About this they do not understand or they don't want to understand or they don't care. I guess that roberts unders roberts understands that these things being perceived as independent institutions is what maintains their their persistent power in american politics. If they did not have that they would eventually be attacked by the political system. If everyone understood them. There was a collective understanding that these things were not independent of politics.

If there was not a taboo against politicizing them uh they would be immediate. That's what the republicans are saying we're going to get put more guys in the supreme court and then they're going to add guys the supreme court like if you're me. I I go who cares so what liberals democrats understand that that's a genuine threat that's scary because if that were to happen it would politicize the supreme court in a way that would render it no longer usable as a box stop to prevent real you know left-wing government control or exercising of control because you can you can't point to the ref and say it's not me. It's the ref if the ref has lost his if the ref is understood to be tim donaghy for example uh and so roberts understands that if the court's gonna be around to do things like stop a green new deal from happening with uh uh legislation or more likely than anything uh prevent universal health care from coming into being uh or just like further stripping voting rights away especially if the left becomes ascendant. Uh that's only going to be possible if there's if if if there's enough uh there's enough political cost associated with attacking the supreme court to prevent it from being carried out or more importantly to prevent the base from demanding it be carried out like right. Now the thing that allows democrats to play uh possum with the dem the supreme court. Uh is the knowledge that there's really nothing their base is going to do about it.

They don't  care uh they or more importantly even though they are horribly angry and awful and feel terrible. About this well. They have absorbed the democratic ideology that there's nothing to be done because the supreme court has to be protected from from politicization. If that perception goes away. It becomes inevitable over time that there will be pressing there'll be pressure on the court as an institution and he wants to prevent that from happening and doing things like joining the liberals especially on things that they really care about and right. Now what they care about more than anything is making sure that this election does not turn into 2000. Again that's buying him good boy points for the next ruling but anyway this is all a big digression to say that carter thought he was reasoning in this reality that was actually a pseudo-reality that was being projected to him by this new uh post keynesian austerity economics that said that the thing that was driving that the only way to solve inflation and to get the economy back on track was to break the back of working class power uh rather and essentially end the continual rise of the workers labor share of uh of now dwindling profits instead of. I don't know taking those profits from the uh ownership side that wasn't on the table and so when he told people wear a sweater and you know turn down the thermostat and we're going to stop you from being able to  um borrow money like I was. This is what I was saying when I was talking about the vulture shock. It wasn't just volcker. He wasn't just applying volcker. It was it was doing he didn't do wage and price controls. He did credit controls where in the second half of his uh term he reduced the amount of money that could be lent to people at the retail level. That's the kind of thing that will basically force a recession to happen. They were doing it on purpose and he was doing it out of virtue. He was going to wean america off excess on behalf of virtue not capitalism but virtue so yeah moral questions.


At this point what is the point of it other than entertainment how about some questions of efficacy how about some how about some questions of usefulness and effectiveness and I know that these are not totally un uh uh removable. But I find that any actual tactical questions get turned into moral questions almost immediately and then it is insisted. No no we have to solve this moral question and decide who's right between these two sides and this moral issue before we can progress because then we're going to be using the master's tools or some  and my answer to that is just these differences you think you have are unresolvable and besides the point because you know the rightness of the of the morality. Honestly. A lot of it will be revealed uh in in the course of who is arguing in good faith uh and uh and with an eye towards like reality. Those are the kind of things that suggest you who is uh more connected to reality and more likely to be able to conceive of and pursue effective action.

Uh is it that is that easy to remove your choice from revolving ironically from the af effect that not having trump in office has on many americans well for one thing. I don't know what that effect is going to be. People say that but what does it really mean do you. What do you really mean by that is my question. I guess what and I would like people to list this what realistically do. They think what pain what persistent pain are we going to see removed from america by biden being president instead of trump. I'm not talking about anything in terms of uh you know norms or or even even things of normalizing and all that stuff because yes that's that might be true. But it's a little pie in the sky. I'm talking about actual conditions. I mean do you think that they're just gonna open up all those uh cages for the kids and and just let them out and do you think that's going to happen. I don't think that's going to happen now yes uh. I would say one group visa holders or people seeking visas absolutely 100. I agree that that will that there will be a immediate uh boot off of your neck for sure. I'm not like saying there is none I'm trying to run through what they actually are so that's one for sure visa holders in general but other than that like people who are here illegally there might be fewer ice raids and stuff but like deportation's still going to happen ice is still going to be there environment.

I mean what does by what does biden want to really do what does bind really want to do. That's that different from what trump's doing maybe he might close off a few public lands to drilling which is good but once again like in a broader sense have we decelerated any trends significantly and like the big one people want to talk about authoritarianism. But I'm sorry with this  whitmer kidnapping plot and a response to it. I mean. I don't really. I don't see some sort of ratcheting down of authoritarian uh like excess in the biden term. If anything what you might. See is sort of like a war on terror more on domestic terror like where the whitmer plot becomes a model for like a newly anti-fascist uh a federal law enforcement mechanism like antifa dhs and fbi that's gonna uh you know maintain popular support by reminding people how many how many nazis are under the bed even if they don't do that there's gonna be plenty. There's going to be uh plenty of uh blame to go around enough to allow sort of the the current. Uh authoritarian moment to continue essentially unchallenged like these democratic mayors who send in squads of psycho cops to gas everybody.

They're not going to act any differently with bidens in charge and binds not going to what put any real pressure on them. But again these questions are secondary because none of you are going to determine the outcome of this you pressing a button doesn't make it happen you going in and voting for biden doesn't mean that when binds in you're responsible that he's in there and therefore responsible for all the lives that were saved or if you don't vote for biden you're responsible for all the extra deaths and misery that's not true why is voting for bernie. A collective political act for voting for biden can't be because bernie represented a coherent challenge to the democratic party as such from within and you had to accept certain premises that differed from fundamental democratic policy. Uh uh agendas and and tactical uh understandings and doctrine in order to vote for bernie and that wouldn't mean that you're going to now become a die-hard you're not going to. But it's going to mean that your voting is. It's not just for one candidate. It is for a coherent political project. The democratic candidate who emerged from that  primary after defeating bernie uh has no such there's no coherence behind the vote against it. It's everyone from embarrassed suburban republicans to uh to anti-fat and who the hell do you think is going to get the actual influence in that campaign or I mean then in that presidency that's another way you can tell the really dumb the dumb cons.

The dumb conservatives are the ones who actually believe that biden is like enthrall to antifa or whatever the  conceptual james today about involuntary conservatives about people who will accept all the horrible ideas that yes we understand 100 how terrible trump is we are reality based we understand that trump is awful and that he lies and that he is a fraud and a criminal and all this stuff because to not unders honestly like educated people understand that to not at least recognize trump's manifest and manifold failures as a human and as a  president and his everything requires a certain uh glassy-eyed mania to you. It requires you to be in the thrall of mega to some degree uh to to a degree that is reality warping outside of the accepted level of warp. You're allowed in polite company so you've got to think of some other reason and the one. These guys have cooked up is that I can't vote for biden because look at these guys saying abolish the constitution and court pack and and uh and enforce uh anti-racism at the barrel of a gun and that is a result of someone being a  and also just looking at twitter all day and thinking. It's real life because if you can't look at the actual dynamics of the party and what has happened in the last year and see that there is no actual influence from that part of whoever ends up voting for the democrats on biden on the dnc on the party. In general you are you are as you are as self-hypnotized as a cue person. I'm sorry.

I don't care if you want to think you're smarter than them but you're basically not if you could look at the world and look at the democratic party and say yeah you know biden. He's a he's a puppet for uh for the. I mean now when you want to talk at the level of like language yeah. I would be. I can't wait to see how hilariously woke biden tries to be like obviously they're gonna use kamala for most of it. But there's gonna all the language. All the academic anti-racism language is gonna come up. It's going to be horrifying and I welcome it because you know. I think it'll be an alienating moment for a lot of people to just see the wildly uh cynical use of their language and they're going to be left with a choice like do. I do. I accept the the reality that this stuff really at this point is just just a cudgel for the establishment or do. I realize that it has to be transcendent and I mean. I'm not saying everybody's going to choose the right choice there. But I think some people will and I welcome that as a possible good outcome of biden being in there but anyway there will be no practical changes.


No policies are going to be enforced to make your life. They're not going to  blow up the constitution or the supreme court. It's just talking about how they need to reinforce the the the public uh they need to super what they're going to be doing in there is taking every institution that trump undermined by treating it like it was because trump went in there like a child and he didn't understand that he's supposed to be upholding the kayfabe that no these institutions are not independent these institutions are not political. He just went in there and just like yeah. No this these guys all work for me right. Fbi director works for me supreme court worked for me. These guys are I'm on the apprentice and these are my employees in reality yeah. Like at this point you know the constitution plus uh you know 250 years of uh of governmental uh expansion and complication all of it being concentrated in one executive office that is the combination of head of state and government for some stupid. Reason in reality.

All these things that were supposed to be checks on presidency are not just extensions of presidential power especially and then if the party that the president in a new par in a partisan political environment where there's two coherent parties with like different agendas that supersede any kind of investment in an institution that they might be a part of that means that if you control the legislative they essentially work for you too and he treated everybody that way and democrats have spent four years freaking out because we're not supposed to realize that we're not supposed to know that we're supposed to think that no these things are independent. These things are checks on both sides so that they can be used when they need to be used and when you get a six three majority in the supreme court you're the democrats my god. That is a gift now we now we have a guaranteed uh excuse for why we can never follow through on anything that our base wants and has a delusion in their mind that we actually want have any interest in pursuing and so when he gets in there biden is going to just be like. Uh uh fix it felix from wreck-it ralph just going around and uh putting back all of these institutions building up the their independence from from the executive and that means they're not gonna  and you and you've just stared into the abyss of the online for so long that you've turned the  random hooting of a bunch of just cope addicted um pseudo radicals who spend their days online cosplaying a political revolution that they know in their heart will never happen and then say yeah. These guys actually control the democratic party wait a minute all right.

This is interesting your argument is forget about the visa holders forget about the covet victims forget about women and minorities. I need to wax ambivalent about voters to self-sooth about the bernie laws once again. I don't get what that has to do with my vote. I am not determining any of that my vote and even when I say on the stream will not determine that outcome and I keep banging that drum because like losing these things lose these ritualized pseudo performances of political power have to be broken down and that means voting as like the locus of political meaning and moral expression and also posting because they're just different manifestations of the same. The same phenomenon of of just this shadow politics now voting for dinner nope that's different if you don't get why it's different. It's not for you and nothing in this world is remember that one all right what is it. It's almost time maybe one question before I go voting less than posting less than podcasting. I would say. I would say. I would say voting is will be one step closer than either podcasting or voting to real politics because it does contribute to an event that has an actual impact on something. I will say that but it's just one level more advanced.

It's just one level removed uh and the thing is there's an accelerationist case for biden too like there's all these guys out there who've decided that they're gonna that their their form of cope is. I'm actually voting for trump because uh you know. He's the real challenge to the status quo and over like that you're just trying to uh ring. Some some meaning out of this some sense that you're not owned sorry everyone's  owned in this. We've all been owned there's no way out of owner. There's no vote you can do. There's nothing you can have in your head while you're pressing the button. That's gonna unown you. In this election we are fully fully owned uh if voting isn't meaningful then running for office. Isn't either. I didn't say it's not meaningful. I'm saying that its meaning is not in proportion to the way that people talk about it to the amount of psychic resources that it kicks up the amount of people's political identity. It composes and I'd say running for office would be one more step closer to real action than voting but once again at that point come the questions of like tactics and feasibility. If you're going to run for something. Why is it to get out of the house do you have an actual thing to contribute beyond.

I've read the posts and I have the good politics from the good posts is there something about you specifically that positions you well to present a socialist alternative in a plausible like uh electoral context. Like it's a it's a stack. Like political identity is the stack of actions you know that go from thinking some having certain things that you think of as ideas to expressing those ideas to the people around you expressing them online in different formats then expressing them through actions like you know organizing uh you know organizing a union or your work if that's viable or running for office or whatever or voting. Whatever those are actions and it's it's a our understanding of ourselves like pursuing political goals. Embodying political ideas is some percentage of those things and all I am saying is that voting is this gigantic thing in people's self-conceptions around it and as long as it is.

It's just going to rob you of the fuel to really pursue anything that might be more close to the ground and more consistent like a daily use of power that goes beyond just thinking things and expressing them online a daily pressing against the the accumulated horrors around us living a political life living political ideas and voting not saying. I wouldn't be part of that. This isn't all this isn't either or it's yes and it's adding things to your understanding of what it takes to be. What it really means to be a political subject and the only way you can do that is if you have to make room for other things and and I'd say the thing to kick out first of all the thing that dump off the  uh the hot air balloon to lighten the load is your understanding of the of the moral uh weight around the issue of voting beyond that like when people say what do you okay well log off. What do you do that's up to you you have to make that decision based on your own world and your own life and your own understanding of your world in your life. I can say vote as part of a political expression then though who to vote for same thing you got to make that choice all right guys. I'm gonna log off here. It's amazing. I'm going to likely the fake news. Media is going to smear me again after this about what he said about voting. But it really does seem like there's like a conscious decision to not hear what.


I'm  top of my head. But I really do feel like the responses. I get from people when I try to explain this stuff. It does seem like they're trying not to get what. I'm saying all right. I'm logging off bye.
