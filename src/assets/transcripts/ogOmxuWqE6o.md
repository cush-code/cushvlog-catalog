Oh feel like honking pills down baby. If I live without you. I live without hank honk honk everybody talk pill time again. Are people doing sh sea shanties on tick tock. This is a cultural appropriation honestly from from coastal salt dogs and I will not stand for it. I'm triggering people by drinking a white claw.

I'm embodying becky hood. I have become becky destroyer of worlds. That's me so apparently people are starting to post out of context clips from the streams to try to cancel me. But my takes are just too strong and correct to to be cancelled. So once again cannot be defeated sorry. You're not going to get me because my every word and sentence and expression is a perfectly crafted conceptual item and none of it is going to be you can do nothing but try to squint at it to try to find out to try to make up something and sorry sorry folks for the discerning online denizen. There's just no way for it to hold water so boom so. I'm. I'm always I always feel validated when people try to own me for my posts and my correct statements. But they can't because they're correct and that is the defense they say the best. The the per the pure defense against reliable is the truth right well. There we go. I cannot be hold accountable can't do it of course. This quote will be great pulled out after I've been held accountable. Somehow could happen but right now. I don't think so right. Now.

They might impeach him actually on the 19th which would be hilarious and that would mean that would make sense because the whole argument for impeachment right now is that it is symbolically important to show a line that you can't cross and I could definitely see republicans getting behind establishment republicans especially getting behind making that a bright line because it does it looks a little dicier and less controllable than a lot of them are probably happy with. But they're one they're going to want to string it out as long as possible and they're going to want to reduce antagonizing these people as long as possible so doing it symbolically like an hour before he leaves office would be perfect. The perfect sort of thing that looks like action and people can convince themselves as proof that our democratic structures work but is in every respect. Just stage managed bit of public relations yes yes I know impeachment and removal are different but they could remove them too like an hour before he's supposed to leave anyway. Although that's a lot of senators that's a lot of senators and yes. The senators are less less vulnerable obviously but you know a third of them presumably a number of republicans.

Although not that many because it's a very bad map for democrats next time on the senate and honestly the fact that they they had a great map this time and the fact that they were able to what get to 50 50 was honestly a disaster for them and it means they're definitely going to lose the senate in two years. Unless of course. You know they're able to hang this around their neck and everybody cares about this and it becomes the new political litmus test for you know seriousness and I don't know we'll see about that. But you don't want to have to run for re-election in two years having voted to kick him out of office. Guaranteed guaranteed you're done and you know a lot of these senators. It's like that's not the worst thing in the world. Oh you lose you just you lose your spot. Oh. No now I have to get a pay bump to be a lobbyist.

This is terrible it'll be interesting to see certainly if we do get. I gotta say though as I said la out last time if you're worried about this whole thing breaking down. Then you clearly don't get it because they're sort of bad news. Everything is on a trajectory to and I mean a world where you don't feel like there's nothing to do but post isn't that a more isn't that a more vital life even if it's scarier at least you're scared of like real stuff. You're not just scaring yourself about computer narratives but like I said more than anything that's why. I don't think that there's going to be some sort of catastrophic confrontation because it would be too destabilizing and I don't think that there's any real reason to believe that the the choke points and the the choke points and the coercive and seductive mechanisms of power that currently exist are in any way been undermined or compromised to a permanent end by the fit and the capital last week. I'm not blaming anybody for posting.

I'm a poster I'm a poor. I'm a I'm a pure posting machinery took all of my energies and put them out there. I don't recommend it for everybody. R.i.p to a real one sheldon. Adelson. You know my first gig opening for him at a at a massage torture cave that he was visiting that he had funded personally yeah a real rest in piss sheldon adelson. But of course you know he's got the world he wanted. He got he got a untrammeled israel that's able to do yakubitsky. Yakubitsky and reform zionism congratulations. They got their iron wall and now he gets to go to He doesn't even get to go to heaven right. There's is there is there's not jewish heaven. They name a bunch of stuff after shabatinsky. That's it. They name a bunch of stuff after him in israel. So he gets that instead of going to heaven there's one thing.

I wanted to say about elaborate on yesterday that I forgot when I was talking about the beautiful boaters and it's talking about the the regional barons who make up our you know lumpin ruling class out in the hinterlands. The real divide as we know now like demographically and electorally and politically and culturally is between urban and some rural areas and the suburbs are the limital area between them and like the democrats. Gains for biden mostly came in those suburbs where those lim those people. Those those knowledge economy workers who aren't the hipsters who fill up gentrified neighborhoods who want to be out in the suburbs and want to have a house but work in a professional capacity. Are moving towards the democrats because of how unhinged and um and ira erratic and irrational. The republicans are being of course that's not every one of these white suburbanites. The ones who work in things like I don't know law enforcement. They are hardening in their other and their position otherwise but anyway that's the liminal space and the thing about these rural areas. Is you know um. They they have towns in them.

They have cities but they're just they're smaller. They're more provincial and the people who live there are really cocooned in this culture and what they all have in. Common is that those places used to be where people farmed and where people where farming and agriculture still occur but not on the family plots that used to be there. The the yeoman small holding farmer would that was the model american citizen and and and for whom america was created ostensibly that survived. As obviously. It survived as the mental idea of freedom that that reactionaries have to this day in america. But it survived much longer than a lot of people think in the country itself. You didn't see the real collapse of smallholding farming in america. I mean obviously you saw a big move away from agricultural labor to urban labor as technology decreased the amount of human inputs that were required to farm but you still had family farms and it wasn't until the 80s and the work of guys like ed butts who was reagan's racist agricultural secretary earl butts rather not sorry earl butts helped create a a modern agricultural subsidy program that doomed the small farm for the most part. There still are small farmers around the country and they are as smallholders. Everyone are deeply reactionary but the people who used to have those farms got. They didn't all go to the city and learn how to code they stayed around and became sort of a resentful and unmanned. You know removed from like the matrix of of sufficiency and self-sufficiency and self you know actualization that they used to that used to be a possibility for agricultural for people who owned farms people who were able to buy some land and work it. Now. That's mostly conagra and archer. Daniel's midland and monsanto and and a lot of it is and a lot of the actual labor is performed by immigrants illegal. Many of them illegally illegally employed and the people who used to farm that are still there and the only story they hear is the story of the mad little crimson kings who run those little fiefdoms and they have all directed their psychic energy towards the big crimson king in the white house.

[12:49](https://youtu.be/ogOmxuWqE6o?t=12m49s)

I guess he's in the white house okay. This is actually something that's trip freaking me out a little bit. It's about how trump has not been heard from since they took his twitter account away. He's the president he could just step out under the rose garden and there'd be reporters there in five minutes and he could just start riffing. He hasn't demanded to go on tv. He hasn't done a press conference has he made a public statement. He I know they're saying. He's gonna go to the alamo or apparently alamo texas which is a town just the stupidest people on earth. They don't know what the alamo is. They know alamo that's where they fought the mexicans alamo texas building town. We don't know so did he say anything today but the fact that he's having it in san antonio or in alamo really shows you that he has run up the red white flag and it'll be interesting to see how long it takes for these people to get it that he has thrown in the towel because he'd stay in washington. If he really wanted to press. This thing you might do it in an alamo rental car. A lot that'd be funny like the I mean.

The four seasons thing in philadelphia will still not be topped for pure ioducci that is pure uncut yanuchi. The four seasons oh four seasons lawn supply by the air by the airport. I do wonder if somebody slapped him like I wonder if one of the joint chiefs just hit him in the face that would be funny. I would not somebody's asking about who would be the protagonist of the mothman movie. I would not really want it to have a traditional protagonist. I would want it to be more um more removed and more pointless. I guess like incidents not really a and like with a cost of characters that maybe has a through line like keel would certainly be in a lot of it but I wouldn't want them to be like have an interiority. Necessarily. I'm not gonna apologize not gonna happen. It is amazing when they try to get me canceled. I'm just such a nice boy you can't do it. I'm a nice boy with correct takes you can't get too mad at me or end up in the when you do you just look unhinged. Everyone who gets mad at me just looks like they have spent too much time online.

I saw that red letter media is gonna do a review of the blob people are saying more and more folks. The blob tremendous people the horror. The sci-fi horror remakes of the 80s people talk about a lot like the thing is obviously now. I mean I'm sure john harper would have john carpenter would have really appreciated it. If people back then liked it as much as they do now. But the king is. The thing is a towering achievement and it's one of the big reasons that I cannot credit anybody who argues that ridley. Scott isn't a hack because oh he made alien I'm sorry. The thing is better than alien and it came out like two years later. It's not even the best sci-fi horror movie of like the year period that it came out in I am not. The thing and of course cronenberg's the fly great movie be afraid be very afraid snapping the arm puking on the donut shotgun to the head can't beat it but the blob man written by frank. Darabon doesn't have. I can't even remember who directed it. Not a not a auteurist thing that has been recaptured but in my opinion as good as those movies and in terms of its special effects maybe a little better. The blob in that movie is so good and my favorite thing about that film narratively is how nasty it is how it kills several characters who are set up as the protagonist of the movie early on how it kills a kid. It's a pimp movie and it rules it lost money. It's another movie that failed so.

I guess. The only one of those that succeeded at the time was the fly because I think the fly was a success. Tremors is a perfect movie come on yeah frank darabont and chuck. Russell wrote the screenplay who and the director was chuck russell who made he made nightmare on elm street three dream warriors which I have not seen since. I was a kid he directed eraser with schwarzenegger your luggage and the scorpion king wow that is a that is an interesting career. He directed the mask too oh smoking not alrighty then smoking and he directed fringe. The tv show fringe I am wrath that terrible travolta ripoff of death wish which I watched with will last year. I don't think we even got through the whole thing god damn how the hell do you how do you make one great movie and then never hit the hit.

It again. You probably don't know why your movie is good honestly but anyway the blob great phil. I feel like somebody says the mask is cringe now. I don't know if that's true. I feel like the mask has made a comeback because once you get through all the levels of irony. You are back to looney tunes you're back to a guy hitting himself on a car with a head on the head with a cartoon mallet. It's the only thing you can do. Once you've you know got too sophisticated in your comedy and anti-comedy stylings. Eraser came out the same year as mission impossible and has the same plot as mission impossible. It also has some amazingly terrible cgi crocodiles which coming from chuck russell who made one of the great practical effects. Movies of all time really does tell you that the intro when they brought in those computers. It really was the death knell for craft in film effects your luggage your luggage god.

[19:40](https://youtu.be/ogOmxuWqE6o?t=19m40s)

I saw I didn't watch that whole schwarzenegger video I saw that it was seven minutes long but there is an alternative world alternative america where we did not have um where we did not have a constitutional requirement of citizenship or of like native born citizenship to run for president and schwarzenegger not doesn't replace trump as like the republican party because that is go that was going in the direction. It was going no matter what but as like some sort of um like high. Charisma spectaclized codification of like democrat neoliberalism because at this point he is a democrat. Schwarzenegger is a democrat. I don't care what he calls himself he would I mean by the time he left office. He governed basically as the same way newsome and and brown do and he could have and he could have been like the the counterweight because now we're in this dangerously un balanced situation where trump is this you know this. The the the thunder from the depths of the earth with his voice because he's able to connect to people at that level of you know fame and american um the classic american con artistry and hustling a charisma schwarzenegger has is better than trump at all of those things and he could have provided a alternative now not an alternative to you know neoliberal hell just an alternative public expression of like spectacular politics that could have given something for for the non-republican base to care about and for non-republican non-voters to care about as it stands now. We have this totally vapid democratic party that stands for nothing and isn't able to replicate the spectacular figure of barack obama that was the whole point as I said before of that primary why they let it go so long and why they risked.

Bernie winning is because they needed to and I the taste makers in iowa and new hampshire find the person who could replicate the the the obama magic couldn't be done. There's nobody there schwarzenegger could have done it but without now he can't run for president. He can't run for president here so sorry not gonna work too bad too bad but like I said it would still be terrible. They would just it would be more likely that the democrats could actually like discipline the republicans and their base which we'll see how much they're able to do it because like I said i. Think they're terrified of seeing of pushing against the republicans because they're afraid of them making a decision to just not accept their intimidation which when you're talking about the democrats trying to intimidate people. It's very understandable.

Why they're like that oh no cuba back on the state sponsor of terrorism list. It'll be interesting to see how much of this stuff biden rolls back and how much they just let there and act like they have no control over because remember guys oh those florida cubans and and the word socialism. That's what cost them florida someone's asking about the persian gulf everything everybody has sort of been failing including me to notice that there's been a very significant buildup of u.s military and israeli military operations. There some israeli subs running around israelis they've been stepping up bombing into syria They assassinated that tooling around just waiting to crash into some boats and this is all after the secret meeting between pompeo and mbs right after which the they declared the houthis a terrorist organization which is completely idiotic and is gonna just get more people killed once again. We'll see if biden bothers to lift a finger on that one. But it seems like what they're trying to do is essentially like lash the tiller to the to the to the door and in such a way that ensures that biden is doesn't have a free hand to reset u.s. Policy towards iran away from the brinksmanship that it's currently being defined by and you know to which degree biden even wants to do that is up in the air. But they're ensuring that it won't be up to them that there will be no way to reverse course by the time they take power another great another real reason another reason for why it's absolutely great that we have a what almost three months.

Yeah two and a half months no almost three months. Yes almost three month period between the presidential election and the inauguration of the winner because we have to make sure everybody can get their horse cards to washington in time. What's amazing is that it used to be longer. It used to be march. They didn't change that until as until they passed. I believe the 25th amendment and they just moved it up to january just I guess. It's like well. We you know we want to give them the whole calendar year. Can you imagine if it was march if that hadn't changed the 20th yeah. It's amazing how many of those amendments are just mess are just actually fixing just bureaucratic elements from the original constitution. That's how hastily and shittily drawn that thing was such an insane idea to federate it fetishistically. But of course it must be pointed out that there is no ideologue. There's no content to the constitutional fetishization in this country. Nobody does it because it's just such a great document.

They do it because they imagine that it exists to and they're correct for the most part that it exists to maintain their privileges. In rat respect. It is very similar to the magna carta which we which is thought of popularly by dullards like the ones who try to say oh. The magna. Carta says you don't have to wear a mask give me chip shop. Those things are not law rules. Those things are not the prerogatives of regular people. Those are privileges of the barons and the one and the constitution exists to maintain baronial privileges in in in this in a vibrant context of like democratic demands from below here's your democracy. But here is the guard guard rails on it well that will prevent it from expert actually becoming democratic. You can't right now or don't have to wear a mask on the lorry look at the magna carta. It says the king can only tax my wall exports once a fortnight how many wool esports do you have you. I do love that they have a constitution in the britain that is not written down which makes sense when you consider that the whole thing flows from the common law tradition which is all just laws made up literally as they went along which meant that at every level they were attempts to accommodate power as it currently existed because that's how you make decisions. It's oh.

Here's a new thing. Here's a new challenge. You're not finding some platonic concept you're not finding a razor-sharp piece of fully persuasive legal reasoning. You are saying okay. How do we accommodate this conflict with the system. As it exists with the distributive mechanisms we have in place.

[28:51](https://youtu.be/ogOmxuWqE6o?t=28m51s)

That is why napoleon was the good guy. I'm sorry I mean obviously he was a he was a megalomaniac and he caused a lot of deaths but in the battle between the british and the french. I'm sorry captain jack aubry is a reactionary. This is interesting. Someone says in the chat there his dad is a const. My dad is such a constitutional fetishist. He thought the designated survivor in the line of succession was in the 1783 document.

That's so funny because all it says in the constitution about the state of the union is that once a year the president will be required to deliver or to deliver to the congress. A um like a statement of of the nation or whatever it's it. The content of it is is totally tbd the the way that it is presented is completely dbd. It was originally just sent to congress written and then like the sergeant-at-arms or somebody would read it out loud. I believe it wasn't until wilson that the president started delivering it in front of both houses and then only after that are people like oh. They somebody might blow them all up somebody might somebody might guy fox their asses. There's nothing in the constitution about anything it all had to be made on the spot. That is why the only reason it worked is because george. Washington was around george washington in an era when the the elites of the 13 colonies were all divided by state which had to have changed but at the moment it was not. They were individual like ruling elites political and economic ruling elites and they all made wanted. They needed to come together under a federal government if they were going to get their money back that they put into the war effort more than anything it was. It was a bomb the beards talk about this and the origin of the american constitution.

It was a bunch of bondholders wanting to make sure that they didn't get left holding the bag which means it was the richest people in all the parts of in all the states so they needed a central government but the thing they were afraid of was not their precious liberties. In the way we get told it to us. They were afraid about their prerogatives. Their ruling class prerogatives being in any way take it away from them and like abstracted towards a state interest. An interest that was beyond their narrow specific interest which of course in their minds was the interest of all mankind because they were good enlightenment psychos and so there was a mexican standoff the and and this whole document it got a lot of resistance. There was a whole anti-federalist movement against the federalist papers had to be written to propagandize the thing because these local power holders especially the ones who were most distant from finance capital like southern landowners for example except for guys like george w washington by the way who had a ton of sitting on a ton of bonds and was actually very cash poor after the revolution and had a very insignificant economic incentive to get behind central government and he um was the man of the revolution.

He was the man who beat the british and most importantly did not become king after that who went home became cincinnatus and because he'd already done that he'd already turned down power. Everybody who was making the constitution assumed that you could trust him with this position and so he just made it up. He made up what presidential powers were as he was president and because he was like self-consciously trying to knit together a national interest out of the state's interest. He did what they wanted but the problem for especially the southerners was oh no he's actually creating a central government. No oh we didn't like sorry idiots. You have to have that like the federalists were in like a marxian sense the progressive force in the early constitutional era and you can point out the fact that they were ripping off the the veterans of the revolution and the small holders in order to you know feather the bed of bondholders correct.

But they were also making it possible for capital to concentrate which if you don't have it. You have a a decadent stagnant society which is what antebellum slave culture became and which is the inevitable byproduct of of of allowing capital to accumulate individually and not allowing capital to become something that can be um accumulated and dispersed like from a central perspective instead of by you know the million. Individual plantation owners along the mississippi river and that but that anti-federalist notion of unrestrained baronial power that is the engine of american reaction ever since and it has manifested itself in different places and at different parties over the history of america. But now it is firmly ensconced and in fact like the governing ethos of the republican party.

But it was the original motive force of the democratic party but it was. I would say it was the democratic it was tammany really more than anything. It was the democratic subordination and and client relationship with the emergent working class of the cities that ensured that over time the democrats would essentially become the federalist whig party of like interventionist government. The anti-federalist thought because we have all the land we have basically unlimited land. We don't need government all these the government exists to to like um over see disputes over resources like and you know police labor relationships but if you have self-sufficient farms and slave plantations although you know guys like jefferson will assure you over time. This incredibly lucrative labor relationship that creates its own completely contained like cultural context where it's it all of its like worst deficiencies become like load-bearing psychic structures. It'll just go away over time that's because they didn't realize how much more profitable cotton would get but if you have that if you have like thraldom where you don't have to worry about politics because politics is the master's whip or sufficient smallholders who don't have to worry about working for a boss or disputing a paycheck just getting goods to market. Then you basically don't need a government that was the theory but you never have all the land. Even if you did you still have to. Like if you want to be a small holding sufficient farmer you have to be able to sell your surplus. You have to be able to sell your surplus product of your farming. Otherwise you're just a subsistence farmer and the whole point is that you can go beyond subsistence to improve land invest capital into your land and buy finished goods. That's the most important thing exchanging your agricultural surplus for finished manufactured goods where do they make manufactured goods. Jefferson's hated cities literally a a literally um symbiotic relationship between city and countryside and jefferson says yeah but but it's bad so it shouldn't exist okay good.

[38:19](https://youtu.be/ogOmxuWqE6o?t=38m19s)

That's that'll that's that has anything to do with anything. Out of here well haiti somebody asked about napoleon and haiti. I mean one it's not like the british were better guys. At that point they didn't. They didn't ban slavery until the 1830s. So all of those caribbean like the difference between jamaica and haiti is. Haiti had a rebellion if j jamaica had had a rebellion and jamaica had several very violent and partial and like momentarily successful slave uprisings that were brutally suppressed by the british. They would have they would have done just the horrible stuff that the french did but his decision to try to retake haiti made probably in part because of his. The fact that his wife josephine was a descendant of the planters of the big whites of the island was a terrible decision and not and like morally obviously but you know in the context of early 19th century morality.

He's probably about on average for europeans understandings especially since so much of the The wonderful luxury economy of british of french cuisine and and and indulgent life was fueled by agriculture slave agriculture in the new world but more than anything it was a mistake as taliran said about about the execution oh what's his name it was worse than wrong. It was worse than a crime. It was a mistake um because because he there was a a figure of comparable skill and like mastery of the moment in haiti who could have collaborated with napoleon in the form of tucson and he wouldn't have known that you know. Toussaint wanted to meet napoleon and honestly if he'd if he if he had done that who knows what he would have gotten out of that conversation because one of the big reason that napoleon tried to reconquer. Haiti is because at that point he thought the only way that he was going to be able to change the balance of power with europe after trafalgar was by reinvesting his strategic situation in the caribbean and like turning the caribbean like into a french lake. Because at that point you know everything past. The mississippi was technically france's and new orleans which is a major port in the caribbean was french territory but the real answer to that strategic question is a lie with tucson what are you doing but to give but to give napoleon a little credit. He did admit when he was on saint helena that that was a boner he shouldn't have done that and yeah. That's one of the reasons they sold us it to us. And that's a big what if we want to talk about contingencies and counterfactuals. What if that what if that back door that free real estate back door was closed because we weren't in a position to fight the french for the continent you know.

Maybe we actually have to record with our political problems instead of fantasizing them away and turning us into this nation of fat toddlers who cannot reckon with political conflict because we've never been forced to resolve. Any we just find the people who can take it because they don't have political representation in the system. We give it to them hard be. They black be. They native american be. They immigrant and and or poor just poor in general and then everybody else gets a lollipop but we're out of lollipops and now we don't know how to deal with politics. But yeah you want to talk about alternative north america how about one where napoleon makes a deal with. Tucson recognizes haitian independence and then has him invade like Mississippi has toussaint lead a black army into the heart of mississippi liberate. All those plantations and give people guns probably not likely but you know you can imagine it. Napoleon wanted to invade britain. He made several attempts.

The the they attempted to land troops in ireland during the the the 98 revolution that was before napoleon. But there was a long-standing french. Plans during that whole period to just invade britain because it's just it's it's so frustrating. If you're napoleon how frustrating must it be like you marched across all of continental europe and you just dust the the greatest armies of thousand-year dynasties and you just battle away like bad tooth. Chinless freaks these lidless huns who just like eat boiled beef on a little shitty collection of islands. You can't just walk over them because they ruled the sea. They ruled the goddamn waves and what's interesting about the british domination of the sea is it really didn't even come down to technology or anything. It literally came down to the fact that because they were like the premier naval power I mean they were a island and they had invested in naval development for a long time whereas like big continental powers like france were inward-looking. They were able to develop a store like a a soros of best practices and um and skill distribution that just made their crews better. They were better at being semen. They were better at boat. They were just better at it didn't matter.

The resource distribute this distinctions. Nelson somebody says nelson was a psycho. Nelson is one of the most despicable figures I've ever read about who is traditionally thought of as like a military hero because obviously you know every everybody who is venerated by history is some sort of criminal or scoundrel and that's fine you ha. If you're occupying history stage. You are in the sense you have to be operating beyond concepts of good and evil or else what are you doing there so you have to judge them that way. But nelson was just a a glory hounding psychopath who was willing to risk the lives of everybody for pure personal glory. Like he is the exactly type of showboater that you know traditional chivalrous. Masculinity is supposed to look down on but they got a giant. He was a notorious cocksman who had a very public scandal about involving improprieties with society ladies. But he was just a complete vainglorious. The kind of character who is um historically like if you if they were accurately portrayed you know in a in a film or something would be like a stereotype of of narcissistic. Vainglory very much like custer custer is a similar figure to nelson custer of course was not anywhere nearly as good a cavalryman as nelson was a sailor. I mean nelson was actually very good at what he did. Custer was a complete buffoon but they had a similar just psychotic narcissism.

Yes they did blow up the pillar in dublin which I gotta say that's good on you. That's that's just good form in my opinion. That's the thing that people who hate on statue destruction don't get they say you're destroying history like just pulling a statue down is making history. Now of course it should not substitute for politics and one of the ways you knew that the summer demonstrations were going to peter out without real. Long-term impact was when they started doing that but like as an isolated incident and as like a specifically targeted event it it is. It is historical in his own way like blowing up the head landing in somebody's garden custer's one military exploit with any kind of meaning or behind it like any any. The only real credit in his record is the third day of gettysburg when he prevented the cavalry attack on the union rear that was supposed to coincide with pickett's charge and might have changed if it had been successful might have changed the outcome there but that's about it best civil war general.

I mean that's a weird category. I don't know. I would say hmm there's different ways so many different ways to say best. There's certain ways to like define best my I think that one of the most like I mean. It's.

It's annoying that like stonewall jackson was genuinely brilliant. But I hate him and I don't want to talk about that. But like thomas. I'm a big fan of george thomas the rock of chickamauga I mean he destroyed john bell hood's army. But john bell hood basically gave him the hammer but you know he did a good job at it. Nonetheless save the army of chickamauga along with august wilch and ambrose. Beerus were all there defending snodgrass hill or I don't think they were on snodgrass though. But that's where thomas was. But they were all like chickamauga I'm bringing a cyber chalmer to well. I mean first of all statues are almost never like as historically meaningful as like a cathedral. I mean especially when you're talking about american confederate statues. Those things are mass-produced bronze schlock. They're basically bob's big boys that were all built in the early nineteen hundreds by the daughters of the confederacy. Like that there's much as there's much of like a historical. You know there's as much historical value to them as like a bob's big boy sign. Now.

I'm the last south broken man on a halifax pier. The last of its private tears. I like george thomas I like sherman a lot I'll always have a soft spot for grant just because he's such a He's a hard guy that to not sympathize with for me. Anyway. He seems like essentially a proto-fail son. He seems like the kind of guy who he's like a model for a guy who was so here. You go. He was given the same lively. He was given the same chances that everybody was in like the fertile early the fertile um. The the fertile middle west you know or at that point. It was like the northwest in ohio. You know his dad was a relatively successful a tanner. You know he didn't. It was he was his family wasn't as poor as like the the lincolns were even But he didn't want to be a tanner tanning sucks and then he he went to west point because it was a thing to do.

He didn't really want to be a soldier and then he fought in the war he found out he's good. At some things the mexican war he hated the war he fought in. But he learned some things he learned how to ride a horse. He was good at that and he learned he was cool under fire but then they sent him to garrison a bunch of forts in california in the middle of nowhere and he just drank himself out of a job and then he went back to the midwest and with the same opportunity that millions of americans were given to make something of himself he at everything which is why he is third of the the mirror image of mcclellan. A guy who had you know visioned himself as a military genius since he was a child and was finished very top of his class at west point as opposed to grant was a middling student and then won a few early engagements in west virginia which helped allow west virginia to essentially secede from virginia and was heralded in the eastern press and essentially bought his own hype and went insane like in that kids in the hall sketch where kevin mcdonald gets promoted to head the head male clerk and immediately snaps and like buys giant gold rings and beats people to death. This guy thought that he could march on washington and over-pro the government. He wrote that in a letter I think to his wife after getting some good early newspaper clippings and then he went to confront lee and he was so terrified of losing. He was so terrified of failing that he was frozen. Grant had failed his whole life. He wasn't afraid of failing somebody wants me to talk about the english civil war.

I might talk about it future because it's a very interesting subject that gets undertalked about but somebody in the comments is saying. It's that 1688 is more interesting and you know if you really think about the english civil war. Like periodization is more important. I think than trying to keep things pithy and the same way you could argue that like world war one and two are part of one larger process. That the same is true of the english war and the glorious revolution and you don't. It's really one event and it is. This prolonged crisis of authority in like a budding capitalist system that is emerging out of like a decaying feudal husk and it was a battle over like what is the um actual like proper place for um you know authority to reside in a merchant social order that is breaking away from the the feudal.

Bonds of you know just the old feudal aristocracy and creating a new class. Like the people who overthrew the king and cut his head off it was a class. There was a class character like parliamentarians were urban merchants. Broadly. There were of course big landowners who were parliamentarians but the base of the new model army was that east anglian people who were engaged in the new immersion economy that was emerging out of there england in the low countries what became modern capitalism at least where I put it like after some fits and starts and early creations like the thing really kicked into gear there and they wanted essentially to wrest power away from this old feudal order represented by the king but it was premature because the social basis for that kind of government didn't exist yet you still were dealing largely with the feudal a feudally organized society. Even though feudalism had been obviously in crisis and collapsed for centuries. It had not yet created a alternative like social mechanism of authority and so the attempts to stand up parliamentary democracy without an attendant. Social formation immediately collapsed and cromwell kept having to step back in I know that there's it's obviously very self-serving the way that he always acted like oh. I've been forced to intervene back here. But I honestly do feel like if they could have put together. A viable parliamentary order cromwell would have washingtoned it but he couldn't he couldn't. Washington was able to walk away because the social base existed to stand up a parliamentary democracy in america that didn't exist in the 1650s and so he just had to basically be the king with no without a name and that was not gonna last and then so they bring back the royals. But they bring back with the royals. All the old questions about the catholic church as a stand-in for medieval authority you know and bringing in those dutchmen because the dutch people actually were the ones who invented the like concept of a of a merchant-based capitalist economic order. Like that's where the stock market first opened that's where the first joint stock company was chartered and the british essentially just took it from them like when the we're taking this from you and we're changing the name too and so they say hey you guys you know how you guys actually were forming these structures before us even can we just borrow your king your king who's been like kind of capitalized kind of soifed as it were protestantized and we'll we'll take him. We'll we'll take him from you. We'll take him off your hands. We're their ruling class or whatever their their their their gentry had learned their lesson.

What are the what is the chat fighting about someone's fighting. I need to resolve this chat fight before. I log off one of the packers playing. I haven't really watched the game this year. I will not. I will not lie but I try to watch the playoffs. Apparently. There's one dumb ass in the chat god damn them all. I was told we'd sail the seas for american gold. We'd fire. No guns shed no tears now. I'm a broke man on a halifax pier. The last of where it's private tears. I might watch. We'll see people seem to be talking about what's cringe you. I think that as well. I am guilty of having used that word and trafficked and cringed talk but you really have to kill that concept if you're ever going to be able to act because all action is cringe. All acts can be abstracted away from the context where they make sense and turned into something embarrassing and if you worry all the time about your actions not being cringe-worthy you will never be able to do anything that's basically what what david foster. Wallace's entire corpus was about how cringes is.

 is essentially social. The most essential post-modern post industrial mechanism of control ah the putney debate. Oh we love it folks. We love the putt we love the diggers we love. The levelers too don't we we love them jiren. Winstanley was the spiritual founder of the diggers in the aftermath of the english civil war or the inner regnum. I guess before the final glorious triumph of of anglo-dutch protestant capitalism over anglo-irish. Land-based feudalism but jared when stanley He wrote a pamphlet where he essentially prefigured marx's theory of class struggle as the engine of history what 150 years before marx did or 200 years yeah like 200 years 16 yeah 1650 yeah and he says that as long as as long as some labor for others like his basic premise is that like as long as some what labor for others they will be in conflict because that relationship cannot be one of equality. It is one of coercion and mutual animosity and distrust that come from that and of course. His answer was you know a kingdom of god where all where the need to accumulate is removed by the desire to the desire to live in communion with everybody and of course. You know that's essentially what communism would have to be and I would argue it will have to have some sort of spiritual component. I don't think it can be anything connected to a his existing structure of faith though because they're too culturally segregated but it's going to hap there's going to have to be an infusion of meaning into public life in order to allow people to make a new deal essentially where you trade time for stuff and people don't want time instead of stuff unless that time has as much value as the stuff does and because our time is completely useless to us our time what our time to what look at our phones our time to be miserable and be anxious our time to worry our time to be disconnected from one another our time to pursue pleasures that lose their enjoyment with every indulgence.

That time. Why would we want give me stuff give me stuff. The time has to have you have to be able to to spend that time meaningfully in order for that to make it be a good deal for people and that's what's so heartbreaking. About q anon is that in many respects q anon is the sort of popular grafting of alienation and and disillusionment with the current economic order with a spiritualized like will to power you know they're able to do what they do. Because they believe they will win. They believe they're right and they'll believe they win. They can win which is something that no one on the left believes either of those things they if they're right. They don't know they're in a constant contact. A constant personal crisis about whether or not they're right and not knowing if they're right inhibits their actions in every move and they certainly don't think they can win and the left needs that the left needs that but I mean what they don't have to go to to lean on that the q people do is. The I mean q was made by a combination of honestly at some point. At some point the government got involved in queue there's no question.

I don't know who started it but at some point the government got involved somewhere at not maybe the level of distributing the actual proofs but at some level of of of psyopping around it because why wouldn't you it doesn't make sense. I mean especially when you consider the hilarious number of actual literal deep state psyopers who are deeply enmeshed in the q anon at one level or another but it was also a consumer response. It was a consumer demand being met by the market and leftism can never be a consumer demand left met in the market that is the problem and a lot of the people who get mad at the left like the left they don't want to win. It's a culture of narcissism. It's a bunch of breath because you're operating in a much more constrained political context you cannot depend on the spectaclized gibberish. The people's power wash their eyeballs with 24 hours a day to reveal a path towards like effective anti-capitalist action. That's absurd why would it do that at least absent like a real coordinated effort you know like a ground a grassroots and like a movement moving towards one another which we don't have. If it's just gonna like emerge spontaneously from engagement with the media in the marketplace.

You're just to end up at q because q is like every good pyramid scheme and cult which are basically the same thing and in many cases are literally the same thing. In this country. You need to get people to get involved through their self-interest and what motivates these people to become q evangelists is yes meaning yes belief but that's only going to get people to commit so much what they also get is a chance to market themselves or their products. Apparently. One of the biggest cue decoders is some failed screenwriter from new jersey. The q shaman is a failed actor people. All have res they all have cvs and head shots or they've got a trunk full of herbal supplements that they want to get you to sell for them. Those motivations reinforce one another but only towards the direction of madness and jibbering savagery because it's it's america's broken psyche looking in the mirror. The only what has to emerge to counter that has to be coherent and it has to be in opposition to the existing. Sewer grade of information that people swim in it has to be counter hegemonic and what I argue against people like the Those mmt kids who interviewed me for their podcast is that that counter-hegemonic like feedback loop cannot be built from within existing media structures and the existing social media structure most specifically because they are designed to produce the opposite of what you're trying to create.

I'm sorry I put that white claw right there looked like. I was doing sponsored content. I swear to god. I'm not It is somebody. Somebody said I they were chilled by the sight of me drinking drinking a white claw because I embodied white privilege while I was doing it. I think that like status anxiety about white claw really tells you that everybody is just on here making themselves nervous like victorian housewives like I read from The book last week who all had nervous exhaustion because they were too they were too bored. They were bored house cats who gave themselves anxieties and things to worry about. We are similarly restrained in our ability to express ourselves and but we have the internet to give us anxiety and fainting spells and and nervous exhaustion and so what do we do we like oh people like me drink white cast white claw. But I hate people like me because people like me are me without any of the extenuating circumstances that let me give myself a break everybody else around me is just me and my worst so. I can't I have to like allow create some elaborate justification either for drinking white claw or not doing it. I just enjoy it because beer is a little too hoppy usually for me. I like a sweet treat. I like it a little sweet all right folks. I'm gonna sign off. It's been real. Don't do any honk pilling that I wouldn't do.
