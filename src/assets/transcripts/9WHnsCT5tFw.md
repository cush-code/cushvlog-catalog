All the gold in california is a bank in the middle of beverly hills and somebody else's name. So if you're going to california yeah don't matter at all what you're planning for california is a brand new game. There we go. We're all here it's kamala folks who cares boring as possible choice. That was why it was the most likely no the one good thing about. It is now you don't have to talk about it because what's to talk about z z z zzzz. Zzzz snooze don't care don't care to quote. Jay cutler don't care once again. This is a yp not an mp like. I said there'd be something they wanted to make it interesting. They would have picked somebody who was not already turned over and slapped around and spit out by the by the primary process which found her to be so thunderingly uninteresting that she didn't make it to a  iowa because she didn't want to get shelled in uh in california where she was in fourth place. Amazing well don't have to talk about that anymore thank god in fact instead.

I'd like to talk a little about something called the iraq war that a few of you might remember. Some of you probably don't even remember it or at least the beginning of it but us old heads remember and uh I've of course been listening to blowback by the traitor brendan and noah colin uh the podcast about the iraq war and it's been great going back and remembering all our old favorites from the bush white house all the lovable oafs who failed to stand up against them. They actually reminded me of something that I had forgotten or I guess my brain had rearranged. I had always remembered the incredibly douche chill moment of the 2004 democratic national convention when john kerry came out and saluted the audience and said john kerry reporting for duty and I by listening to the show where they played that clip again. I realized I'd remember that wrong and that he actually says my name's john kerry and I'm reporting for duty and that's so much worse. Like more words. Just he sounds like a  nerd or like he's at a a or something anyway watching uh listening to blowback has made me thinking about the iraq war and how even after all these years.

I don't think that there's a coherent fully agreed upon theory on any part of the mainstream uh or even on the left really about why the hell that war happened like what what was because it was such a clear case of of of a choice. A war of choice right like talk about how the presidency is much more constrained than we think of it as and that the choices presidents get to make are for a very or through a very narrow aperture because so many choices have been taken off the table by the reality that they're merely managing a global uh empire essentially uh and that the the inputs of that system are what determine. Most of the things that are theoretically and in our minds imagined to be part of the remit of a president but in reality are out of their hands so they end up doing kind of what the consensus is best interest for monopoly capital or would-be monopoly capital. But there is so much that seemed dicey and unnecessary about the war in iraq that it really makes you scratch your head because obviously it wasn't for any of the reasons they claimed.

I mean duh but also even the vulgar leftist material critique that it was about oil doesn't really make sense if we really wanted the oil. If it was the oil we wanted are we gonna made a deal with saddam. I mean my god the one thing we knew about. Saddam is that he was somebody we could make a deal with and honestly. I had wished during the war. It wouldn't have made a difference but if I wish during the run-up to the war more people had pointed out. You know how. I know that none of this is a big deal and that you guys are making something up and that I don't even have to argue about whether or not there were aluminum tubes or if there's uh whatever the  colin powell is talking about col. Uh the reason. I know that.

I don't have to worry about saddam hussein trying to destroy my way of life with chemical or nuclear weapons is because he lives in a big gold mansion and he has a bunch and he has kids who drive around in ferraris. He likes being alive and there's no way he could realistically wield any of the powers that we were we were claiming he was seeking in a way that wouldn't have destroyed him and we know he was a guy we could make deals with because we've made deals with him. For most of his career. We handed him a list of communists to execute in the 70s and we uh we helped him fight iraq. We basically gave him the idea to in that if he invaded kuwait we wouldn't do anything about it. We set him up so we could have a good pr victory and then we just decided to keep him as this punching bag. But he could have been brought back into the tent and the oil is fungable. Anyway oil is something that that is sold on an open market.

You can't really claim it the way that people like trump for example think you can where we go and we get the oil why didn't. We get the oil we bomb the oil and then we get the oil like you could take it out of the country or something and then even then who is selling it to whom it's all that's like that's. What baby brains think the oil oil politics work so if you just if you want to get oil in like if you want to get access to iraqi oil even profit. If not you know the profits of uh private companies because they did not end up taking over the iraqi oil. Iraqi oil is still controlled by the iraqi government. I mean there's concessions to be had there but they did not. It was not a bonanza for private oil companies. The way they claimed it was but there's still money to be made as being as moving it across the country and and facilitating the the trade so there was deals to be made with saddam even if you wanted the oil and I think the real only way to answer that question about uh about why we went into iraq and why that specific group of people the neocons who got in there around bush pushed that agenda so specifically in the face of the majority of like the the institutional uh bureaucratic knowledge base inside government and the military and and the state department and stuff they were doing.


They weren't doing a radical break and you can wonder well why the hell did. They go to iraq of all the things they could have done why did they go to iraq and I think it boils down to the fact that the us was seeking subconsciously and consciously at the level of policy and the aftermath of the iraq of the uh end of the cold war. A new uh a new ideological structure to justify the maintenance of the military keynesian economy uh the the the one of the big generators of capital accumulation in the united states. After world war. Ii was a massive uh investment in defense uh the military industrial complexes. Eisenhower warned us about like there's ways that you can uh you know operate a keynesian economy uh the british as they offloaded their empire to us and no longer had this justification of wielding military power throughout the world. Their keynesian post-war era was building.

The things like the nhs and public housing like public housing is vastly vastly vastly more common in the uk than it is here because there was much much more direct state housing. Built in that post-war period we made bombs we made bombs we made tanks and the thing about those things is they got to get used and the and the uh and obviously there was a strategic and tactical reason during the cold war to maintain that kind of uh thing and that's was accepted within the public.

Like that was a reason that held ideological sway after the cold war. The us is not going to abandon military keynesianism. It's not going to abandon its military posture. It's first in the world position because that would mean ending reducing america's power from being the unipolar power in this new arrangement to being part of a multi-polar world. A mutual drawdown among everybody and a redistribution of power horizontally across nations and part of that would be a significant reduction in american military and that is something that is theoretically possible that could have been done in my opinion uh but would have required political will to do so that was antithetical to the powers that be the powers that were rather and continue to be in the united states in terms of its uh its ruling class structure and the bureaucratic uh uh conventional wisdom uh that this became like sedimentary layered within institutions like the media and the state bureaucracy and so the 90s were this frantic uh search for modis vivendi.

Here a reason how can we re re-establish america's hegemonic military position in the absence of a enemy and with people clamoring for more spending at home on hey. You know how we like never really got a welfare state because instead we built this world spanning military power. Now. We don't need the will of spanning military power maybe. We can go ahead and build that social democracy now but of course as it was understood at the top levels of power to to give up the military position would be to give up amer america's dominant posture in the world. Uh economic order which would in their mind inevitably lead to america becoming weaker less powerful and and economically bereft uh now of course. The economical breadth of this thing is a joke because our position in the world economy has intentionally left our economy. Entirely hollowed out and replaced with this uh this hodgepodge of gig economy service industry jobs uh and and everything predicated on massive spending through credit. So it's not like that is working out too great for the average american now but of course at the top level of planning.

It is considered uh better than a a multipolar world where maybe we have to give up creature country comforts but also maybe we take all that social democratic stuff seriously in the absence of this fake conflict uh and and that like redirection of of resources and uh control of of society and the workplace downward maybe that reinvigorates the civic culture that uh that can accommodate not being the prominent dog the number one dog in the pack being part of a molar multipolar world that sees that that sees a mutual draw down but none of these things are possible because they would eliminate this ruling class so of course that's not going to happen that's not on the agenda and nobody who would want it is anywhere near the lovers of power. Instead you have a bunch of guys who need a new justification for a military uh economy and also at the same time a need to establish a new military order in the world where the us military maintains its position as the as the primary as uh the primary force of global uh law enforcement. Essentially. I mean world police is exactly what we are that's where the world police of the global economic market place.

That's where the mall cops that's the job and without the soviets and with you know uh competition from china and stuff uh there and russia turning away from our orbit after yeltsin gave way to putin there's a real need to uh reestablish america's military dominance and if that's the question it's just a question waiting for it's an answer. It's a question that now is is waiting for an answer in the form of how is what's that going to take and then 9 11 happened and I think one of the most one of the reasons. I think a lot of people instinctively believe that there's a intuitive truth to birth or to uh um to trutherism is just how much 911 was able to reorder the american political scheme in such a way to essentially give them carte blanche to create this new structure. So I don't know agnostic on I'm agnostic. I don't really think it was. It was bush but I don't know. I mean. It's certainly in my opinion wildly plausible that uh intelligence about 911 and the planning of 911 was intentionally ignored because hey if this happens.


It's not like. It's going to be bad for us that's possible but once again. I don't really try to look too much into that madness rune because I know that that way lies insanity but anyway one way or another. They get this thing fall into their lap or they bring it to their lap. Either way. It creates a new structure where america now instinctively has re re-embraced its martial virtues because now there's a new global war to be fought and of course you've talked about. If we really wanted to prevent another 911 and reduce the threat of terrorism. We would have treated it like a law enforcement activity. It would have negotiated with the taliban for the overthrow of bin laden which they were willing to do. They were absolutely willing to do it. We we essentially told we essentially turned down uh any any serious offer from the taliban because we needed to make something go boom because when something that horrifying happens and that and that destructive to the social fabric and people's understanding of what could happen in the country they lived in because americans were the most costed baby country on earth were where that kind of thing essentially never happened on the mainland and so it was literally inconceivable for people and they needed a way to understand that and so if that anger and that confusion and that pressure if it didn't go out it was going to go up and so they had to do a military response. Anyone would have gore would have also turned down the taliban and gone to war in afghanistan even though that was not going to be the thing that reduced terrorism getting them handed over safely and then prosecuted and then just bump up. Like maybe you put some locks on the air. The cockpit doors and stuff you're  basically gonna be fine uh instead. We did what we did and it was because because a war a global war with no end time is essentially the ideal state to to govern your military and economic logic around.

I think it's interesting that uh that the gop voters who for whom the iraq war was the signal issue like I remember the 2004 election and the 2006 primaries were almost impossibly unique end of 2002 of course midterms. Those three elections were amazing because they're almost unique in modern american history other than maybe like at the height of vietnam and that they were elections about foreign policy where domestic policy really was not anything that was in anyone's top agenda. The economy was still kind of puttering along with its uh housing bubble the early housing bubble happening and so it was actually it was all about 911 and then iraq and so the war in iraq was like. That was the sum total of one's righteousness in the political arena. It was the thing people cared about the most and got angry about it. I remember and they turned on a goddamn dime and now all of them are like yeah. Bush uh we shouldn't go to war anymore. This is uh we need to be isolationist like how the hell did that happen and it really is as greg. Grandin puts it in his book the end of the myth. The failure of our big uh retributive military strikes to actually satisfy the itch that they were meant to scratch culturally and politically meant that all that uh meant that even that made everybody at some level come to terms with the fact that oh the expansive project is over the u.s can no longer project itself. It is it cannot express social tensions through pushing outward by either taking territory or extending its influence into the world beyond its borders. Even that power has now left it and with that gone. Then there is nothing left but to retrench and turn inward and build a wall and pretend like you can uh.

You can triage that up the remaining char shards the remaining uh the remaining boxes of the of the dwindling amount of cargo left that you're that our cargo cult economy worships gay marriage was was the one it was amazing. It was gay marriage and the war in iraq. Those are like the two biggest issues for a couple of elections there. While wild sluff wild stuff. So there was yeah. It was all social issues because people saying abortion too yeah. No it was all social issues and the war in iraq that was it. There was basically no economic agenda for four three straight elections man what if trump just does  with the mail enough that that uh like there's tons and tons of ballots that don't get counted and he wins a a prime. Uh he is able to claim a electoral vote victory even though he loses by like six or seven million votes in the in the uh popular vote and it's only because like he's able to get a court that filled with his appointees to not acknowledge like some states with enough electoral votes for biden to go over the top because they didn't because of the elect fraud and stuff and ballots not being collected. It would be amazing if he pulled that because I kind of see what would happen if it happened like that where it like fought it followed regular procedure even if it was all being gamed along the way.

I think it would be a real surreal sight. You would have an entire culture an entire mainstream culture to the extent that they still exist united in horror and and condemnation of this and like oh my god. This is this is it and this is the bright red line. This is what we were all terrified of and a good fifty percent of the population feeling that same horror. Uh the only people really happy about it is a honestly a dwindling 30 percent maybe of the population. Like these hardened little turds wedged into the small large intestine of the different suburbs of this nation's uh hell states and everybody else just horrified by it but everyone's just like being horrified and saying. I can't believe this is happening and then just days go by and it just it happens because everybody is just so horrified and so in denial that they're just waiting for someone else to do something and then nobody does just paralysis pure paralysis produced by our our hyper awareness of being in a panopticon that would be nuts that would be wild because I'll tell you one thing if that happened. I guarantee you this the democrats they would not do anything like uh. I mean because I think that they have the power technically to just stop all business from being conducted if they if they if they didn't show up. They would not have a quorum right. They could actually stop congress from happening and there's other things they could do too but they wouldn't do any of them. They would complain a lot but they would show up for work and they would show up for the inauguration to watch the swearing-in. They would just it would be. They would go along with anything but uh I don't know.

I think a lot of that depends on the election being more of a disaster than I think. It is going to be because we've seen elections carried out over the course of the pandemic. For the most part they have been relatively smooth. I mean obviously that isn't true in areas with minorities and low income but that's always the case. Those things are always happening. They're just buried or underreported but for the most part they carried on in a way that like votes for being tallied and stuff and turnout which is something scares people because they think because of covid and because democrats believe in kovid. Whereas republicans all think it's a hoax. They are going to not come and come out to vote. But the turnout of these uh covet elections has not been lower in a lot number of cases. It's been higher so that's another thing where you have what you kind of think is going to happen and then we have this counter trend. But there's no real way of knowing what it's going to look like that far in the future and how it's going to intersect with that those trends so once again. I have no idea. It's going to be nuts.

I've never. This is that never this is new. This is all new territory. I mean this is they're  doing zoom uh uh conventions for christ's sake. Like this is this is a 150-year tradition gone. Oh.


I actually think I forgot to put a bow on the thing about iraq. I'll do that. Now. They chose iraq in the in the matrix of their set belief system and decision tree that necessitated a military. Uh a military expression that was concominated with the need to establish a new military dominance in the 21st century and to placate the bang hounds of americans who felt personally aggrieved because they'd lived in a candy-coated bubble. Their entire lives and then the question of answering the answer of why iraq is because it's the perfect country to do that because it is oil rich but not an ally like saudi arabia because saudi arabia obviously is the place that was actually putting out all that terrifying political islam in in uh in their madrasas that they were uh funding all over the place and of course. I don't know the fact that almost all the hijackers were saudi that the government at the time was aware of this even if the public wasn't allowed to know that the saudi government officials were connected to funding and providing homes and documents for the hijackers. But they're a stable ally. They're on our side like why you wouldn't want. You don't want to smack around an ally because that gives a bad idea to the other allies that that your uh your your that their uh loyalty isn't going to buy anything so you can't do them. Egypt is of course another place hotbed of fundamentalist islam. The  uh muslim brotherhood and whatnot but egypt doesn't really have any oil and also you've got that arrangement with the israel with them. It's like a cornerstone of like the like that the post-79 ditant thing that eventually now has led to israel being stealth uh stealth allies with both egypt and saudi arabia like they're essentially behind the door behind closed doors. They are a unified like regional uh uh uh on taunt and that's all that all stemmed from the the first for the camp david accords.

That's where that started but that's not that you want to knock that up why would you do that iraq been on your bad list for a while ton of oil right next door to iran which is a real big bad with a big bull's-eye around it because they had the also in 79 had the impudence to overthrow our shah and then take our guys hostage and and have and have because they have oil and because they have a large population are able to do things like exert regional influence. How dare you how dare you exert regional influence in in that region. Even though it is the region you live in. No we exert region uh uh influence in that region and so iraq is the one. It's the place to put the pin. There's nowhere else that fits all the criterion and in their minds. The most important part was that he it was only going to be the first move iraq was going to be the lily pad the first lily pad while the hop across the middle east taking all of the powers that were outside of the american influence sphere and bringing them in so that you've now got a a full american hegemony military partnerships. Diplomatic partnerships with every government in the most oil rich region of the world and in the strategy and the strategic hub of oil transportation infrastructure good luck china good luck russia.

We are setting the terms of the 21st century. But of course it didn't turn out like that because you have the ruling class in. Any portion of it can only operate from what they assume to be their best best interest and that those assumptions are not always accurate because of those darn lacuna and those neocons had a  ton of lacuna and the just the mere size of the american military gives people delusions as to its its powers because it theoretically is the most powerful military in world history but and it could win. It could win a conventional war with any country on earth. But that that is not that's a blunt little tool as hannibal lecter said that it's not necessarily useful for intricate close quarter.

Uh work you know uh fine fine muscle fast twitch uh that kind of stuff and boom. They ended up blowing the whole thing but if it had gone the way they really had thought about it. It's sort of the way that trots I mean these a lot of these guys are trotskyists. It's the same way that trotsky and lenin he eventually convinced. Lenin went into the october revolution on the unstated but crucial assumption that it would spark world revolution that would then alleviate the pressure and the impossible situation. They would find themselves in inheriting a medieval society in the midst of capitalist reaction. How are they supposed to operate from how are they supposed if that wasn't what they thought was going to happen though same way the uh. The neocons thought this is the first step of a domino that brings the whole thing down. But the beauty part for them is that and just like as as the soviets had to adapt when that revolution didn't happen when iraq didn't go the way they wanted to. They had to adapt and one of the ways was just keep fingering the pie keep stirring the pie if you can't have it.

No one can keep your dirty fingers and everything so funding the rebels in syria doing our weird like alliance and a war love-hate thing with isis where we stoke them intentionally and unintentionally and then suppress them to maintain uh our position there in iraq to countervail iran or at least in the game which we wouldn't have been if we didn't have guys there and we didn't have uh even though you know you could say was strategically a  up because it brought iraq closer to iran's orbit yeah but we're still there we got. The green zone milo is a fed that's hilarious that's hilarious I kind of assume. All those guys are feds like all although all right when you consider the degree to which the alt-right is infiltrated uh and uh in fact a product of uh like intelligence. It makes sense that all those guys are on some list because it's been amazing how many people have been found out in the highest ranks of like the real extreme nazi. Uh to have either been uh actual like cia operatives like the guy one of the guys who founded one of the like terror groups. The really scary one uh was the actual cia contractor and then how many of them are guys who are in military intel in the military in intelligence who are also just vibing the way that like uh hitler went to his first nazi meeting on the payroll of the german army as an informant to keep tracks on extremist politicians yeah.

There's not going to be another shutdown. We're not shutting down and I'm not necessarily. I don't necessarily think we're going to have to because people are actually wearing masks. Now it seems and I think that that's going to prevent the worst case because those early spikes were when not only did people not have mass because of social pressure and uh and like enforcement of edicts and viral videos. You were supposed not supposed to wear a mask people yelled at you for wearing a mask because you were taking away precious mask precious ppe from our nation's heroic first responders which is one of the most monstrous. Ups of this entire thing and I believe is fouchy's fault which makes the worship of him by liberals. All the more hilarious all the guys that the liberals have been like oh at least there's still some people who know what they're doing uh in response to this crisis like cuomo and newsom and  masks because what's this our. Uh our chain supply chains are completely attenuated and if they can be undermined at any moment by anything like. I don't know a world fight worldwide virus attacking the very place where all our  gets made including our ppe oh no and instead of dealing with that and saying hey uh you know watch out stay inside. Uh for masks are important if you can get one do it. If you can't though we're gonna try to get some fast and like turn it into a like. A we can do it type thing I'm not saying this would work with everyone. This is an insane country full of maniacs and idiots whose brains have been turned into absolute sludge by facebook and their television sets and just pure pleasure just the monkeys pressing their pleasure centers until their brains just go out of their ears but it could have my god. It could have helped instead we just switched the thing and said oh no actually you need to wear a mask and you don't you're killing people. Oh wow and now you're mad at all these  scamming people and this whole thing is just an excuse to get rid of trump because he's trying to bring the jobs back oh.


Someone says I got the russian vaccine which I believe is an old tb vaccine. Someone told me that um there's a theory that was being studied. I don't know what the progress is that people who had received this heavy-duty tb vaccine in the soviet era that was common throughout the west. Eastern bloc countries had resistance to covid uh. But I don't know if they ever what the what the findings were on that. So if anyone's taken the uh if anyone's taken the russian vaccine go out and cough on some get coughed on and see what happens let me know. I'm. I'm interested. I gotta say as I have said. I don't care about the epstein sperm. I will get I'll get a vaccine and people are freaking out about oh. No you're not going to have enough.

Uh you're not going to have enough participation and no you're not going to have enough participation to actually to to bring down deaths and infections to the way that they should be in a rational country that has any kind of agreed upon reality that we can operate off of. But I got to think that if you offered the vaccine a lot of people would get it and then the people who get it who got it would be willing to go outside again and because even if they're in public with yokels who won't get the vaccine they know they're not going to get it or at least they feel confident they're not going to get it so they won't care and so then you'd still be able to like get back to something called normal. Even as the people who don't get the vaccine see themselves getting infected more and more but over time that's two ways that's going to be a smaller and smaller group. Some people are going to get the hint and get the vaccine the same way that a lot of these yokels are now grudgingly wearing. Masks and some people are just going to go bye-bye and you don't have to worry about it anymore. But once again. I have no idea. I'm not an I'm not a uh epidemiologist. I've never fashioned a vaccine or even an antis or a serum.

Even people keep saying that that russian guy that michaela peterson is with is a tanki. Because he likes stalin. You guys a lot of russian people love stalin and it has nothing to do with epic uh soviet uh memes. It has nothing to do with collectivized agriculture and and going to the moon. It's it's or sputnik. It's it's  out of other countries ask some of these russian tankies what they think about uh about the jews. And then we can add we can wonder. We can we can break this down to whether he's a tanki. It's just that he's got a actual like national historical context for stalin. Whereas she is a canadian has the same sort of parlor room uh like trading card remove from all historical figures who aren't directly related to their cultural uh uh mythology. I mean maybe this guy's a tanky but he's isn't. He also an alleged like uh sex trafficker. Do you really want him on your side just to own the petersons. I think I would rather him be like just a a good old-fashioned russian nationalist psycho but that shows that the word tanky doesn't mean anything which is fine. It's it's a relic put it away.

Let the let the old words die so just you just you can you can know you don't have to use it. If you find yourself using it ask yourself is there a better word more accurate word for what I'm trying to say or am. I just going to perpetuate a fantasy when I say it. Sherman was a tanki indeed you know that's actually funny sherman. I mean that's a nice that's a good pun. Sherman was a tank. He's sherman tank but I mean if you want to like talk in the terms of of applying that that sort of conception of power to the give the actual dynamic of the moment. Sherman's willingness to uh push. The rules of war speaks to a a a consequentialist ethics that uh that I think most most people who stuck with the communist party. After the hungarian uh uprising was put down. Uh would subscribe to so sure it would be so funny if biden gets in and he actually starts prosecuting states for having weed. Legal and everyone has to all the democrats have to contort themselves into explaining why that's actually woke because actually uh you know states rights. That's some sus. That's some so confederate stuff that's cause that's that that's oh you know states. Rights is used for uh racism. You know will the culture improve under biden.

I think there's I think there's a there's a line of reasoning. I think that you could argue might lead to it. Uh it would be it would go like this the moral hysteria of the trump world of the trump of the trump presidency of the need for people to constantly be renouncing. Mostly a a sense of white guilt being associated with trump and his project has made culture much more self-conscious and try hard than it. Otherwise would be because everyone feels like. They have to participate in this project of self-abdication or of self-absolution from the association with trump's white nationalist project as they understand it and if trump's not president and all the stuff that was horrifying them. Every day is now normalized because biden's doing it maybe they'll feel less the need to try so  hard and they can relax a little bit and be less hysterical. All the time. I don't know if that's going to happen because it assumes that you know things getting radically. Worse economically don't have their own knock-on effects that we can't predict. But it's it's. It's our only hope really cross our fingers. I saw someone fall guys is this game I've seen people play where you're like a little hot dog running down.

A slight incline is it like a donald trump simulator. It doesn't seem like it should be that hard to go down an incline with a little hot dog man is it because the controls are really unintuitive on purpose. What is it because people are saying. It's very very hard but I watch it and it's just a little guy walking running down a running down a little incline. So why is it so hard. That's the trainer all right well.


I might play it like. I said we're going to do some streams from the office. We're going to be doing sieve hopefully. I want to do europa universalis because I want to try to see if I can get the safavid empire to take over all of europe uh or I want to charles the fifth it and try to just do habsburg hegemony. The right way or prevent the reformation in england. I think that'd be fun. I would like to prevent that from happening uh but also I would like to do the goofy games like I want to do katamari damacy or whatever it is where you roll up a big ball that sounds fun uh and then the little hot dog running down the little donald trump. Simulator sounds fun too no. I would not do. I went out and I do a martin luther uh uh escort mission. I would want to do martin luther merck mission. I would want to see if I could just prevent the reformation from happening anywhere.

Someone actually makes a good point that if I played up my disability more I would be able to be more problematic without people getting mad at me but the cost of that would be that I would have to fake believing in that entire ableism framework for uh for identity which I don't and it's just too much. It's. It's a bridge too far for a minimal game. I do like whipping out the card though sometimes just to own someone. I remember. Like two years ago we were getting yelled at by someone for being ableist and someone said it would have killed you guys to have a disabled person on one time and I just had to  episode it's me and the fact that you can't know that I don't know man. It makes me think that that maybe this concept that you're imagining exists is not quite as encompassing as you imagine it to be. If it's if that much of it if that much of the public like of public politics and public presentation of self can be sublimated in someone that doesn't have to be that doesn't have to be at the center doesn't have to be. The center of their politics doesn't have to be the only thing they care about and it's very hard not to see people who fixate on something especially when it's self-diagnosed. That's always very funny or I think there was one guy who was like a some sort of disability caucus chair something who had diabetes very funny as someone who is way more disabled than any of these people and who's had his life actually shaped by it uh just having like somebody who took a  test and decided that they need to like have a special. Uh non-clapping zone is just amazing to me uh but but the very sheer variety of the experience of being disabled is what makes the idea that it is a unified experience that it is a that that there is any kind of inherent unif unity between people who are with disabilities is fantasy and people only believe it so that they can get in.

They can get further up in line in the progressive stack. It's a way to cut in line in the progressive stack so people pay attention to them and take their  meant anything would uh would eventually have just destroyed my soul so no thanks so. I shan't be talking about someone asked directly so. I thought I'd address it because I've seen some other people talking about it. But now that's it not quite krauthammer thankfully. But uh.

But I'm definitely more disabled than I'd say nine of the ten people. I see carping about ableism online and starting every tweet with as a disabled person or whatever the. It's weird. How they have this thing where they want disability to both be a category of of identifiable experience. That is common among a group of people noted and that it's like a trauma and that it is something that impacts one's ability to function but if you suggest that it actually impacts their ability to function that that's being the equivalent of racist oh. I'm sorry. This disability disables you what how dare you. No no no you have to listen to me because I have it but how dare you say that it might limit my ability to do anything oh. We'll never  social of socialism and a socialist and a broad socialist movement. There's no specific ableist issue that necessitates sacrificing uh broad appeals to uh to reassure people within an imagined group that they're not going to be left behind or whatever the  so yeah if anybody ever wants to get mad at me about anything refer to this chunk of my show somebody cut this out and say why matt can can do slurs. Why do I hate steve.

Miller have you ever heard any of his music. He's the worst lyricist at rock history favorite napoleonic general. I think I might have a different opinion about this as I listen to more and more uh more of age of napoleon which I plugged before on here and I think is really one of the best history podcasts going uh. But I'm a big fan of uh of ogero. Because he was uh. He was a crude horny street kid from paris. He was the son culotte general and he was just like a spin on the floor rooting tootin hombre and I think that's charming it's interesting what do you mean ignoring.

Someone says ignoring marginalized groups that like how does how does something like medicare for all ignore disabled people. It it. It brings them up in a huge way from where they were massively and and has the altered effect of helping literally everybody else in the country. My god who is being left behind there. The idea is that I don't feel personally engaged with and I don't feel personally soothed and told that I'm special it it. That's people have confused that with with like meaningful politics because it's all they have. It's they're doing all their politics. In the friendship simulator. Yes universal programs help marginalize people disproportionately and that's good that's one of the things that's great about them. But they have the it's the beauty of it is. It disproportionately helps the most marginalized without inherently creating a politics that requires a a enthroning of virtue and sacrifice which is counterproductive to organizing in america. All right.


I'm gonna go soon so. I got about uh. I got one more one more question from the from the whoever whoever can throw me a good one here. I will answer um did losing hair. That's funny losing hair hurt my self-esteem. Not really. I guess. I just didn't see it coming. I didn't realize. I was balding until one day. I was walking into a grocery store and there was a security camera above the door and I could see myself and there was like a white circle on the top and I was just like what because. I don't really look in the mirror that often. So it was more just shock since then. I've been uh. It's been. It's been. It's been a process of uh of coming to terms but it hasn't been that traumatic. I'm. I'm basically fine with it. Now the one thing. I will not do that.

I've uh that I've debated in the past but have now decided now as the cowards move is. I'm not going to shave it not happening whatever this turns into we're going to find out whatever if it. I don't think it's going to turn into sides. I don't think. I'm going to get the full costanza and if that did I would probably have to consider maybe shaving because I do not want the costanza but I think I'm going to keep enough of this in the middle to kind of just nicholson. I think I'm going to nicholson it and I think nicholson hairline to me is goals and if I can stay around there. I'll be fine come on like in the 80s like shining era great. I'm not going to use any of that hair replacement stuff. Either there's no uh there would be no. It wouldn't be work. It would literally not be worth it like it would not increase my self-esteem enough to be worth the expense and time to do it. Yeah just got done meditating before uh before the stream. Today. It's very good. I highly recommend it ironic toupee is kind of funny like like just a real rug. I will not grow anti.

I could not get anton sugar. I don't know if I wanted to yeah. No chiklis. Chiklis is not quite as good uh an outcome as nicholson would be and chiklis ended up shaving it as we know. I hope they nominate. I hope george clooney is the new senator from california. I hope someone at the dnc gets the idea that the reason trump won is because he's a damn celebrity and we need to get more of our guys in there and and they make clooney the  senator that'd be fun. They're not going to make ruffalo a senator. Why would they do that it gets appointed by the governor. I think is is. California is it appointed by a governor or do. They have an immediate special election. It varies state to state oh man. Jerry. Brown dragged his 900 year old ass out there. I guess it depends on how well the succession line up like the power structure is and then if newsom has that party all settled away. Then. I think he would pick somebody who would be there for a while but if he picks brown then clearly that they need time to create for have a placeholder. I am governor jerry brown my aura smiles and never frowns. So I will be present. Carter. Power will soon go away. I will be fewer one day california uberallas california oh alice yeah. Let's get jello and we offer on there. Let's make a let's get a viral hashtag going to get uh jello. Biafra appointed to kamala's seat or anthony. Kiedis. I'd be fine with that how about dave. Navarro and his signature issue is tattoo acceptance in the workplace jello like warren. That's hilarious. That's so perfect god. Damn don't get old people. Don't let it happen to you yelled a bullet yelled at both 2012. He fired yell to both 20 20 24 20 20 20 20 20 24.

It's a french revolution. It's the podcast. I was referring to age of napoleon. It's more about napoleon but it spends a lot of time on the revolution itself. It spends a lot of time on everything he's incredibly uh detailed you get if you're not even interested. In napoleon. You get so much stuff about the era like the power structure. The diplomatic structure of uh onshore regime europe and the you get a good like multi-episode. Uh capsule history of the french revolution and then you get napoleon all the way through his whole damn life.


I did not see a press conference from trump. Today. He did it again because yesterday he was in front of the cameras when that guy took a shot did that even happen by the way I never even found out what happened. There did that actually happen did somebody take a shot at the white house because after I heard the story it never turned into anything did it not happen do none of us know. What's happening at all. Anymore does every event just like fall over come over the transom and they just fall over the waterfall never to be  connected to anything else again and we have no idea whether it actually happened or not but it still builds. This tower of of delusion in our minds is that what's happening that's not good if it is that's not a good sign. But no. I didn't know he had one today.

What did he talk about what would the big wet boy say did he talk about uh did. He talk about how biden is gonna run god through with a hattori. Hanzo blade did he really claim that did he did trump really try to go after kamala harris for supporting medicare for all man. He really doesn't want to win does he yeah so the thing with biden the idea of biden being like the radical leftist wasn't really sticking. Apparently. He was having a hard time getting voters who weren't already on board with the whole cue delusional mindset to accept that genial old joe biden was some sort of radical so now he's going to try to be like oh. No it's going to be harris as a radical. But I honestly don't think that I mean she's less well-known. I guess so maybe he can have more luck at defining her in the media but I just don't know if anyone's paying enough attention to any of that  who knows who will win. No one knows feed those hungry hungry hippos bye.
