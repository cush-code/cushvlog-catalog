Oh no I said zortex protocol that's pretty stupid bugs back here now not that many how many we got got a few shouldn't be too bad got a few little muchachos messing around. I'm streaming today streaming across to the virgin chapel fym twitch stream and I've got to stream free to the good people of twitch.com or whatever the hell. Tv hi guys mosquitoes are here took a while but they're here now not that bad certainly not wisconsin level. But I'm being reminded of their their needling little noses their demonic demonic aspects although I am relatively lucky when it comes to mosquitoes because they bite me and you know it stings when they bite me the way it does anybody but I guess. I'm not allergic to whatever this the goo is that they put into the wound that makes people get the little red bumps that itch like I can watch it. I can watch a mosquito land on me take a little pouch full of blood off and it's nothing ever comes up. I never get a rash does. Anybody else have that I explain that to people they're all baffled is anybody else not allergic to mosquito saliva. I know that there's it's. It's a common place. It's one of those things that people think they know is like a fun fact that you could kill all the mosquitos in the world.

If you could figure out a way to kill them. It wouldn't really undermine any ecologies. It would be a pure win for everyone because not only do they kill more humans than any other animal thanks to malaria spread and of course now with west nile expanding into the us and marching up the globe. It's going to be even more vectors of disease and they also do not provide like the primary food stuff for any other animals. Because that's usually the argument is ah see. You can't get rid of this animal because it's part of a chain. There's no animal or key key insect species whose diet is primarily mosquitoes. They're they're a they're ancillary so if we can get rid of them we could that would be cool and that's the kind of thing where you know we're not going to fix climate change but someone will figure out a way to kill all the mosquitoes as they become more of more of a problem after supply chains accelerates. That's that's how we're going to manage climate change. There will be no huge break that destroys civilization all of all of the like. The meta problems emanating are going to be rationalized away and marketized away through some combination of technology and and financialization. But the main thing making everything worse will just continue to go because there's no alternative to that there's no profitable alternative to that. Someone asked me what blood type. I am and that's an interesting question vis-a-vis the mosquitoes but I'll admit it.

I don't think I know my blood type. I don't think I've ever actually I got one of them bleeding and I'll watch I'll see. If anything comes up. Does anyone know if there's a correlation there. That'd be interesting to know but yeah. I don't know and yeah that's probably not the kind of thing you're supposed to say publicly anyway but I wouldn't be able to if I if I knew it now. I never gave blood because I was terrified of needles for a long time thanks to the fact that I went for being a kid who is terrified of needles. The way normal people are to a teenager who had every nightmare of needles that ever scared me happen all at once. I actually had a spinal tap like it's like an exorcist which you are awake for. You're fully conscious of that and there's not really an anesthetic. It's pretty horrifying and just having that happen I was just like kind of. I was in shock just because I was so unbelie. I was unable to assimilate that this thing I was terrified. Happening was actually happening to me and so that after that I was just and ever since I've had this. I've been got. The main like traumatic elements is. I have this fear of medicine and fear of medical implements and also hypochondria. I spent years vacillating between different conditions that I was certain. I had like. I was a lot. I have I have some issues related to the spinal injury that caused cascading. You know discomforts in the body and over the years.

I've convinced myself that I'm I've have cancer a bunch of times and then when that's no longer viable. I have been very sure. I was about to have a heart attack and you know the you can always rationalize. It like sure you know you're probably not going to die of one of those but odds are in america. You're gonna die of one of them right at some point so. I was in this thing where I was a hypochondriac but I could never really have my fear dispelled because the hospital was just as scary as thinking. I was dying the thing I was thinking. I was dying of I've gotten over that recently though like this spirituality to sound hokey has helped has genuinely done what I've. I saw it do with other people for most of my life jealously which has soothed those kind of those kind of recurrent existential fears yeah like I don't worry anymore even though I'm older than I've ever been and it got worse with time because I got more aware of you know bodies breaking down and just like the longer you're alive. The more likely. You are to die right just that's the actuarial table at a certain point but now. I don't feel that way anymore. I feel better.

I mean I when I say about spirituality. It's like it's everything. I've been talking about like the satori moment the recognition. I have now what I what sort of what I've intuited from reading about people's descriptions of like feeling the divine or something like the idea that there is a presence and that was the big thing. That was why I always rejoined a religion for my entire life was. My brain doesn't work that way. I don't feel anything. I don't feel presence and I don't feel that there's anything there but my own voice clanging around in my brain and now. I feel a presence. It's not of a person. Though it's not of an i. It's not of a consciousness. It's of all consciousnesses the the the veil of maya between me and everyone else and everything else and every time else. I'm aware that that is a membrane. I'm aware that there's something like vibrating at a different frequency beyond it and that makes a lot of the existential nightmare stuff that used to make it hard for me to enjoy anything. Really. Less biting someone is across across the sink here. That's what they call the interior parts of of like townhouse blocks in in cities. Like this you know with apartments and stuff like apartment buildings and townhouses well.

It's a whole thing and it's all facing outward and the inside is everyone's backyard and that's called the sink. I can see a big puff of light smoke like they just elected the pope over there and that means grilling is happening. I'm also going to be growing tonight having to have an having a little fun gonna do some grilling and do some steaks the low end low effort tonight. I do have the long term before the summer ends or maybe I think september maybe realistically like like a sort of goodbye to the grill thing. I'm going to try to do the yeah less humid too and I'm going to try to do. I'm going to try to do the brisket the all-day brisket that's the big project we got to find a butcher and do that but that'll be later I think for the rest of summer for the rest of august or anything anyway. I'm just doing regular stuff.

But it's a good example of like the the hollowness of capitalism. The hollow the hollow value the hollow rewards of this system so the thing behind the thing in the middle of a block an apartment block in new york. It's called the sink right and it's divided up by the lot by the areas. So this one. For example. It's a little narrow thing the length of the house and then because I'm in the service quarters. I'm in the basement. I get a little area here that you've seen and then there's a wall at the other side you've seen at the other side of the There's a wall on the other that's right next to the grill that is a much bigger portion for the upstairs neighbors like it's it's got. It's almost a lawn and they also have the deck up there. But that's because they got more money and so the advantage there is. Both of us now have this like secluded area where we can sort of have privacy and that's true you know and that has its uses but at the same time for everyone. This entire area is completely broken up and blocked off and I just like to sometimes I imagine because there's a lot of trees not in our backyard but in neighboring yards that are really nice and I'm just imagining. If this was like an internal park you know and I just feel like that would be that that would be worth that would I think be an addition. I think you could have enough privacy like in the area around your home to like do what you would do otherwise like have a cookout or something.

But then there would also be you could like take a walk. There could be like a path in the middle here with the trees and everything as opposed to feeling like I am in a and as it looks to you guys like I'm in a bunker and that's that it's that thing of like the value. The the the because there is a genuine you know. The promises of capitalism are not entirely hollow like like privacy is a is an actual thing that has use value in something that people need to be able to negotiate the pressures of dealing with other people. But as a totalizing value. It is it destroys so much that is vital to the very functioning of the human mind and replaces it with only further indulgence along the axis of isolation. I mean that's why infinite jest is the book of the moment because he was he figured out he saw where everything was going like not only just not just in terms of how like loneliness was going to take over the social order and just strip every one of their souls because they don't know how to relate across the chasm of experienced other people where there see them as equals and not instruments and the terrifying isolation caused by viewing all people like that.

But he also predicted skype and I believe instacart and a bunch of and his president johnny gentle famous crooner is closer than any 90s dystopian vision of the president ever written. There is one exception there's only one other thing that I think was there's one other president idea like for a future 90 sci-fi thing that is in my opinion the most perfect for future casting imaginable so there is so robocop has a sequel. A robocab has two sequels. Less said about the third one the better. It's not even r-rated directed. I believe by frank miller or he wrote the second one. I don't know if he directed the third one anyway dog. It doesn't even have peter weller. It's got that canadian guy it literally had a canadian non-union canadian equivalent of robocop fobo cop more like it zing. That's right. I said it. I called him phobocop okay irvine kirschner. The same guy who did an empire of strikes back and you know what it's another. It's not quite as well. The thing is it's not as good as empire strikes back but it's definitely better than its reputation and it's that and a lot of it's the the fun of it is.

It's actually about like the making of a sequel and my the best sequence in that movie is when they show all of the attempts to make another robocop and they fail because like the guy shows up and he just starts shooting the the doctors and then blows his brains out and one guy pulls. This helmet off revealing his screaming skull and then dies just the way that like the the artist the human revolts against the idea of a cash-based sequel but even with all that but with that kind of mindset. It's it's a good movie pressing it. In its way it talks about detroit being declared bankrupt and then sold to a company which is essentially what has happened to detroit. But there was another. There was another screenplay for robocop 2 not by frank miller but by the writer of the first robocop ed neumeyer and they never ended up using it and I've read it. It's online you can find it. It's not good I will say that it is a it is. I mean. It's always hard with scripts especially scripts that didn't get made to imagine them in your head. But it's there's a lot in it that does not work but there's one thing that's actually kind of just a throwaway that is so perfect that it almost redeems.

The entire project is that is that so the premise is that robocop gets like ambushed and essentially disconnected like he gets. He gets his plug pulled and he ends up in a warehouse for like 20 years before some scavengers grab him and try to reconnect him for reasons and then he goes to war and it's and it's it's much. It's pit. It's pit. It's pitched at a much higher dramatic level than either the real robocop two or the first robocop. The stakes are much higher. It's like the fate of the planet and everything which is often thing that happens with sequels and but they mention in in passing the president in this future world and it's bixby snyder and bixby. Snyder is the name of the I'll buy that for a dollar guy from robocop the guy who's on tv every moment that they're watching television except when it's johnny laser and that's essentially what we got. We got we have president bixby schneider. We have president I'll buy that for a dollar guy the star wars sequels aren't good either and edney. Meyer wrote those too. I think the budget has a lot to do with things and collaboration also very important and yeah you got to give cr verhoeven a lot of credit because newmeier basically his entire career has been writing robocops and starship troopers. Movies and none of them are as good as the first one and you got to think that verhoeven had a lot to do with that. Someone asks an interesting question.

 is romance inherently reactionary capital r romance and I would say like anything it's something that needs to be resolved. It needs. It needs to be stripped of its reaction and it because it emanates from a genuine desire when that is the desire to transcend and and renounce the rationalization of human life which is the de-sacralization of human life. It's not just that but that's one thing that it is and that process well it's necessary if you want to overcome you know the bounds of incredibly limited tribal societies with no understanding of the natural world or ability to harness its resources which you do if you want to create a human a self-aware species if you want to if you want to immunitize the world spirits which you do. I mean. It's not even a question of wanting to it's inevitable so de-saccharization has to happen because you have to be able to move in a world of objects not in a world of gods and and you know powerful powerfully enchanted symbols you have to be able to to strip them to their nes to their utility. But the process has to be managed by a a intensifying heart elsewhere and romance is that heart and in the wrong hands in the wrong moment it turns into fascism if it attempts to suborn rational to to the attempt to enforce a a purely emotive. A non-structured libido that's not good. That's where you get the fashion. But like there needs to be a sacral. There needs to be a recognition of the insufficiency of the material world and that's and the romance speaks to that. I got.

I got one second here. I might have to. I might have to log off but I'll log right back on. I got a message. I gotta respond to. I'm back. You guys am. I am. I still here all right here. I am back sorry about the ads yes. I've been replaced by q anon clone. The proofs so by the way I got bit by I got.

I got stung by a mosquito or bitten sucked off by a mosquito about What I'd say about 10 minutes ago. I got nothing. I got nothing. I got no irritation. I got no redness. I got no itchiness. I don't know what that means. I don't know does that mean that. I'm the messiah probably not but until I meet somebody else who has that same condition. I'm gonna have to assume. It means that in some way I have been chosen by the cosmos to complete a great destiny. No. I'm kidding. I'm normal.

How long does it take. I kind of assumed. It would be instantaneous. Oh man. I'm wondering if there's something. I could spray out here to get these guys away from us. I don't want to make the grilling uncomfortable for people. I'm still rocking the lacroix gotta finish these before. I get a new one fingers crossed hard cherries next in town by the way guys. I got I got chicken nuggets last night as I promised. I would and I used my gochujang the the pepper paste as a dipping sauce. I mixed in a little ketchup which is a that and garlic is is the recipe for the sauce. They put on the korean fried chicken anyway very good. It was nice the spread of q anon.

It's inevitable man. I mean everyone has to resolve these contradictions. Everyone has to resolve the reality of bourgeois democracy losing its legitimacy in real time and and the flight to like a a narrative. A a compensatory narrative that allows you to believe that someone's in charge someone's in control and that you don't have to do anything. It's it's going to be incredibly powerful especially among the petty bourgeois. The the most the most alienated portion of the economy in terms of of the society in terms of like being alienated from each other and alienated from any sort of unconditional reality. The social basis for fascism and q is is a is. A is a it's a It's a backstage mission legend or whatever the hell they call it in german. It's it's the november criminals all over again only. The thing is is that the the nazi pitch and this is why fascism is not a useful term in my opinion to describe what we're going through. So compare q anon to the nazi doshas legend backstab myth right the the nazi history history of world war one was brave powerful. German empire was in a position to win defeat the horrible the the dirty anglos and the and the jacques. When these politicians these sdp. Politicians spd politicians. These triple parentheses politicians rose up and stabbed them in the back but that was just the first part of the narrative. The second part of the narrative and we have to punish them join. The nazis come out into the streets march. Vote beat up a communist. Maybe shoot one if you're really serious about it and what does q anon say q. Anon says we live in this decaying.

Realm that's supposed to be the greatest country in the world because our the institutions of governance and and social control are ruled by a cabal of of child worshipping monsters. Not they have the same otherness of the of the jewish of november criminals. But because anti-semitism has become less of a cohesive social expression and now more of like a fringe alienating thing it gets turned into essentially stuff that was taken from culture. The same way that anti-semitism is drawn from like folk european culture. Vocal european culture was suffused with anti-semitism because the jews were not part of the community. That's the that's the flip side of community and why community is such. A fraught concept is because it's unity but it's also unity against and that is why the fight that's why there's a teleology to marxism is because a global self-conscious human species has transcended the the divide between self and other between group and out group and but if in the absence of that you have tribalism and you have fear of other and so the jews were always an excuse for why things went wrong because it's easier to take it out on someone else than it is to deal with an internal problem if you're on the top of the pyramid or the bottom. It's still there so anti-semitism is a folk european folk european concept that could then be channeled to explain away the the incongruity of the mighty german army losing a war to a bunch of frogs and brits and and half-breed americans. We don't have that that's not really. I mean it's part of the firmament and like the more abstract level. But it's not as as gut evocative or as widespread as european anti-semitism was. It's now been transferred by culture by by our by our hollywood dreamweavers ironically enough into these archetypes which these guys have decided.

This is the bad guys and they're why we don't have a good country and but the difference is the next step for them is not and now we have to stop them. We have to punish them. It's enjoy. The show watch what happens next. It's yeah. There's bad guys in charge of everything. This is but the institutions are not bad the institutions are not that it produced this outcome are not irredeemable because those institutions are institutions. I have a lot of emotional and financial in a lot of cases.

Commitment to no there are still there is still There's an immune system that has been activated by us and by donald trump and if we let him do his job buy gum we're going to. We're going to take care of him but not by us doing anything we get to watch we and we get to interact we get. It's basically a giant game of goo blues clues you get to follow the clues but it's up to steve to like actually grab the thing and that's why fascism is not what we have because you need a society. You have to have a social dimension to politics to be activated for fascism to be an operative concept and and that's the thing that abs the fascism concept obscures when we're trying to figure out what the is going on because it assumes a public and we don't have one and if you assume a public it leads you to incorrect conclusions about what to do next because you're making assumptions about organizational capacity that are not true. We don't. We don't have the social fabric necessary to sustain or require that all we need is the technology of authoritarianism which is what we have oh like you need this much you need ex. This is the amount of authoritarian control you need in a society where bourgeois democratic norms have been stripped away by crisis and can no longer sustain the social friction caused by our by exploitation of capitalism because there's no more money to lubricate the exchange we're grinding gears here.

It's pure extraction. We're being proletar. We're being. We're going from being proletarianized to being reinsurfent under techno feudalism and it's like the mach the chassis is buckling under that reality. What do you do well you've got to have a certain amount of repression. You have to have a repressive apparatus to maintain enough of a social bond to keep these people in the positions as consumers and workers that we need them to be. So. This is it and it's a mixture of human inputs and political legitimacy and technology and in the 1930s like the ratio is mostly human political input. Because the political spirit is engaged everyone's political they just got democracy in in germany for christ's sake. At that point. Everyone was the vast majority of people imagine themselves as political vectors and specifically the working class.

All communists or or social democrats considered themselves part of a political project and lived politically and had a political and that meant that the government required. A political legitimacy and fascism was a mechanism to to put to procure political legitimacy for capital in in the realm by adopting a lot of the language that's why they call themselves socialists. That's why there's a red in the banner. They actually said why why do you want it red. The communist flags are red and I think it was hitler said or it might have been anton. Drexler said we want to out herod herod like they're red. We're redder because beginning at the end of the day. Fascism stripped of all of the confusing and the and the loaded emotional stuff and the argument about like is. It is it the theory or the practice before it was anything it was a sales pitch. That's what distinguishes fascism every other political ideology that dominated european democracy at that point from from socialism to liberalism to arch reaction embodied a class perspective. A specific class or in the case of the center party religious perspective. Some acts an axis of identity that cut against capital because very few people saw themselves as capitalists. Not the way people sell themselves as farmers and workers or catholics and so where's the mass constituency for for capital fascism emerged. The guys who created it guys like hitler and mussolini were con artists first and foremost they had no real beliefs. They saw a need in the marketplace and they filled it post-facto with the first post-modern political. The self-consciously post-modern political movement designed as a sales pitch to an electorate in order to capture enough people in the in the in the space of the public sphere to confer confirm political legitimacy on capitalism in crisis which is what it did the current model now where we're living in this same amount you need the same amount relative size right of repression. Almost all of it is technology.

Now there's barely any public space. The public sphere has been completely deracinated and depoliticized and destroyed by suburbanization by the long labor piece weakening class bonds to racial conflict. Everything you could name to television to the internet. All of these things together have stripped us of a social fabric and therefore stripped our institutions of the need for a certain degree of public political legitimacy that they used to have. The legitimacy is now just stark power in the form of our police power and our military so that means that nothing there is no need for that pitch. You don't need to pitch anything the extent. The the the mask will slowly fall but at every level it will be legitimized by process and then reinforced by our techno authoritarian systems of control at no point will it intersect with mass movements someone asked for a good book on buddhism.

 there's a couple actually my friend shout out to my friend john who's who can he had a very similar experience to me before. I did and has been a buddhism for longer than me When I first had my moment he helped me hook me up. He got me a couple of great books tick the hans the heart of the buddhist teachings and mindfulness in plain english which is apparently a textbook for school kids in thailand and is a very good entryway to the practice of like meditation and and essentially trying in any way. Just shut your. Mind off which is the hardest thing in the world for me anyway. It's insanely difficult and I need help I mean at this point.

Chomsky has ran out of things to say for 30 years because he does not have in fact a dialectical understanding of history so all he can do is keep ringing the same dinner belt. Keep saying you got to vote for a democrat because the republicans are nihilistic well. The over time the democrats by embodying the the values they do and partially the reason they do that continually is because there's no pressure at the bottom for them to change because their votes the votes of voters. Are being held hostage by the party because of the very moral rubric that chomsky endorses like. Chomsky tells them you have to vote for democrats because of the moral question because as distinct objects the democrats are better than the republicans on some scale that that is idealism and it is garbage. The reality is because the democrats fear nothing from their base and fear no rebellion fear losing no real votes from their base as long then can continue to be the party that drifts rightward with the republicans and in fact accelerates the republican push right because if the democrats push right like as a triangulation strategy that means that the republicans have to go further right even independent of like the natural flow that pushes them right they get accelerated even farther right by the democrats accommodating them. They're connected all these things are in connection with another. They're not discreet things and that's why I don't really have any use for chomsky anymore.

But that doesn't mean he's bad or that like his classic works aren't worth reading or anything because everything isn't all or nothing. It's all on a gradient because everything's connected to everything else so you cannot cut something off from its connection and determine it all to be all of one thing. Now you can make 51 judgment which is what we all do and need to do for everything because things do boil down to yes no questions and binaries but that answer is not complete. This is all of this and this is all of that it is this is 51 at least of this of course if the democrats lose of course they'll go to the right.

I mean look how far right they are now look at look at how the democrats went from humoring people on medicare for all to essentially curb stopping anybody who even mentions the concept like remember when when obama pushed the aca as a first step towards socialized medicine as something that they could be built on now half of these. People think that socialized medicine is racist or something but of course that means they're going to get push. They're going to get pushed further and further and further to the left on social issues that will of course happen but only at the realm of rhetoric and symbol. That's the thing that's important to remember is that everybody talking about this forgets that when you're referring to corporate and major party co-optation of social issues they're doing it at the level of symbol and costume and if they aren't that doesn't help either because none of these problems can be resolved at the level of symbol or at the level of social issue because you have to make material changes to generate new social relationships that are more equal.

See somebody somebody points out well fascism. If fascism is as you have said colonial efforts being brought inward. Bologna methods of control being brought into it isn't that fascism no yes but that is a that's a element of a greater project and to me you have to strip like capitalism and crisis from fascism as a response to capitalism in crisis. I think capitalism and crisis necessitates as I've said increased authoritarianism resolving contradictions through force by by abolishing the play act. The kabuki of the political process that is no longer affordable like. It's like. I was talking about how you don't see squibs or real guns in movies. It's because the the the line item the amount of money they need. On return on this stuff means it's not affordable bourgeois. Democratic niceties at a certain point become unaffordable and then you have to resolve that because you still have a public to deal with who are used to a certain degree of niceties. They you know die buy a girl dinner first and with them being gone they have to be replaced with something and colonial methods of control are going to be part of it because that's where the state learns how to coerce in the absence of any kind of local political legitimacy. That's where that's where the st a state that is bound by in its core like the like I would say even early in like early colonial england was to a degree like they had the purging democracy that was post-post english civil war.

 certainly post-revolutionary france and definitely the united states they have at their center like a a a basic political culture because there is a basic political legitimacy being distributed through a social order even if it's exploitative as they all are. There's still a hegemony a buy-in at every level colonies especially colonies of like invasion and and occupation are zones where the authority is exercised. But there is no corresponding political identity and political legitimacy just given to that authority by the people it's just naked force and so when political when the political facade of the core capitalism is no longer affordable is dissolved away in the acid of crisis. Then you got to bring back these instruments and they've obviously been flowing there over time as as the facade has gone away but it accelerates with time fascism in my opinion. The thing that's useful as a as a historical and political concept is that political project and I would say that focusing on the term focuses on us on an understanding of the political that is not operative.

I think that made sense right that seemed like a good one that seemed like it made sense. I've been trying to get at something with that and I feel like I finally got it out of there. I felt like I pulled a sliver out of my thumb or something. I feel good. The thing is is somebody's asking like is it historically contingent or is it ideological. It's both everything is both. The question is what's what elements are operative in the current moment. You're looking at through it through the lens of I would say the ideology of not of fascism is relatively second order of importance. More important is its political efficacy as a concept to the current moment and there I don't see it. I believe it is linen. It's very nice. This is one of my favorite summer shirts yeah it has an ideology but the thing is because it was a sales pitch before it was an ideology. It's inherently incoherent. It's. It's just a death drive turned into a party platform and that is why it's so hard. It's so shifting because that makes it culturally contingent that means the ideology is culturally shaped in a way that isn't true necessarily with other ideologies because it is first and foremost a channeling of native cultural emanations of alienation specifically from like the dominant middle class strata as it encounters economic conflict and social change that it cannot process ah. The downshine with the linen is that it always feels like it always kind of looks. Really recently laundered and you get like the curled up the bacon. But it's it's a it's a chill out outfit.

So it doesn't matter. People are telling me that you could be the ottomans and sieve. I absolutely want to see what I can do with that because I don't really think they could walter scheible is pretty persuasive that they couldn't have taken europe but in a video game. If I'm good enough. I bet. I could do it also I i. I'm a big fan of just the whole like battle for the mediterranean. So also I would imagine. I'd like to be the the serene republic itself and see if I could create like I could write could. I could I from venice start capitalism in 1400 instead of 1800 like just get that puppy going let me. Maybe we literally would have flying cars or the earth would be a completely hollow cinder. Okay. Someone said yeah that seems more of a universal universalist thing but that's a good one. I was thinking of like different things to shoot for and I like get create capitalism in europe 400 years early with venice and that's it's it's. The ottomans are a big reason that venice declined and ended up being sort of a prefigurative model and not the beginnings of capitalism. Because it was the reef it was trade. It was the reflow of the redirection of trade to the northern tier that helped jump started in the low countries and and the uk but also legitimately the the the culture wasn't ready for it because the the technology didn't exist to to accelerate it yeah. I know I mean. I mean there's no there was no other way for venice to go. I mean that's that's why these things are all kind of you know bad history because they they make you assume conditions that didn't obtain and undermine like the fixedness of things. How like you really don't have a lot of options.

You really don't have a lot of choice in any moment but in a video game hey maybe I can do it. People are also telling me to play victoria. Someone told me that victoria is the most realistic because it's got. The it's in the most material is because it's got the most fixation on creating an economy and sustaining like an industrial production. Honestly that kind of sounds boring come on. I'm playing a video game just give me a country to click on and so I can click on another guy and like overtake it or something. I also would like to see if I could prevent the Reformation from happening for sure get a habsburg universal hegemony going with martin luther's head on a stick. I played kaiser rock. I actually went on left trigger and played kaiser like a while ago and it was. I was terrible but the thing is. I don't think anybody really knew how to play it. I would need experienced players with whatever it is thing is though if you end the reformation but it doesn't change the fact that there's this trade trade thing in the northern tier of europe. Even if it doesn't get called the reformation. It ends up being capitalism but maybe it's a different version. Maybe it's restrained maybe. It's in a horse maybe. It's in teasers in a way that protestantism wasn't and maybe. It goes in a more humane direction. I I mean obviously towards armageddon towards annihilation towards barbarism but maybe at a chant or maybe at a saunter instead of a jaunt. I mean. I think that's really all you can ever talk about with counterfactuals.

Is are you like are you lessening over time the impact of a process not changing it completely because the flow is just not you can't pick out the thing that does it because it's all bounded together. It's all it's all. It's all. It's all rhizomatic as I hate as a term that is always fun to say to get people annoyed shittiest founding father okay. I like shittiest because it doesn't imply the historical judgment that I don't like making like good or bad shitty is a personal trait and that you can talk about you could you could talk about his historical figure. Like is he an that you could talk about all day whether they were good or bad especially if they were very consequential. Now you're you're mixing your categories up like you're trying. That's what 90 of conflict comes down to is that you've got like the meta spiritual dimension of something that is personal and then you have the The material fully determined relationship of items to one another and one emanates for the other. But they that but the judgment you use for one is not the one you use for the other one But I'd say the shitty is just like personally.

I don't like him is jefferson. He just seems like the biggest like just smug posing prick just I mean obviously there's the cheap There's the cheap irony of him writing the declaration of independence while owning slaves but not only that the way he wrote about slavery the way he tried to like self exercise like exert exercise himself from the moral. Question of it just the um and the way he was a slave owner too like he was given money. I believe in lafayette. It was either lafayette or kosciuszko might have. I think it was kosciuszko Kozushko's was of course you know a polish noble who'd fought with the americans during revolution. It was no new jefferson and he died and he he left a substantial portion of his state to jefferson who was always broke. But the condition of the will was that he freed the slaves and he didn't do it.

He took the money and he didn't do it and it's like this guy and it's not like he was hard scrabble. He just had extravagant tastes. He loved wine and he loved collecting books and he it wasn't. It was it was the there was no other conditions to it. It was just pure a sacrifice of any moral consideration on an altar of just purely personal sensual indulgence. It's about as bad a moral calculus. As you can have. This is a shitty guy. Also the yeoman farmer jacked me off forever just a complete fantasy no relationship to the to reality no relationship to the wheel of history and its inevitable turning. Just just this pure moralistic idealistic notion of like well. Cities are bad and have bad things in them and and and farms are good and have good things in them as though these things are not interconnected and and and require one another and therefore moral judgment is is totally beside the point and is of course this brilliant idea like oh what about a yeoman republic where everybody is a small farmer entirely predicated on the fantasy of continual expansion which you can't tell and the thing about that is that you could say hey they didn't know any better first of all.

Jefferson knew better because he knew how big the country was. He literally was one of the only guys who actually knew because he sent lewis and clark out there after he bought half the thing and the other is that other people knew what this was going to do to us. John quincy adams in his diaries talks very much about how like the the westward expansion is going to destroy the fabric of this country. The soul is going to be eaten out of it from within by this westward expansion by this ceaseless demand for and supply of export exportable land takeable land conquerable land whereas the rest of these virginia dynasty are just like what no everybody gets a farm. It's fine. No social issues will ever emerge. We'll all be great conflict schmonflicked even though schmuck it's like hamil.

I'm not snorting anything. I'm doing my vape. How can you guys not understand the difference in sound come on or that. I'm not like moving my head up. You got to do the head thing right if I was going if. I was doing coke on stream which I would not. I think I'm done. I'm not. I don't do coke I would every time I did it. I would put on a manish boy by when he waters and go into the camera because come on good fellas am. I right you can climb a mountain you can see in the sea. Coke is a bad drug. Very very no use at all for anything garbage. The junk food of drugs and I mean when you consider its ecological footprint and the amount of violence that it engenders just all around thumbs down on that one. I think cocaine must be popular. I mean I wonder why people like it really. I think some people just aren't like confident enough in their opinions to state them until they're suited like they have to have their they have to be like have a button press that says you know tell your ideas. Some of us just have the confidence to just say our ideas to anyone into any format oh.

This is an interesting one who is the most cringe president that's a good question. I gotta I gotta think back through here cringiest president. I would say from the modern perspective and maybe even at the time it's got to be nixon due to his His raw need right because that's what cringe is you're cringing with embarrassment you're cringing because you're imagining how bad it would feel if you had said that right. That's why you're cringing and nixon his entire prospect presentation was this hang dog very kind of self-consciously self-pitying style and then of course. He he he debates with nick with kennedy and just gets trounced because he looks like a sallow loser and then he does things like after he lost the 1962 gubernatorial race to pat brown. He just vents to the media and he goes you guys won't have dick nixon to kick her out anymore. I mean and then he had to resign the only guy ever to do it embarrassing. Oh.

God can you imagine just giving it up every instinct in my body rebels against the notion. But I must step down of course. The guy had wanted to be pre all these guys they've only ever wanted to be president. He gave it up because of how badly he up and the whole time sweating five o'clock shadow talking about his mother. My mother is a saint. That's that's embarrassing george w bush george. H.w. Bush also very cringe because one turner and one termers are all cringe. Carter's cringe poor martin van buren as much as he was a political genius is kind of cringe. The guy built the democracy around the the figure of andrew jackson and then he gets turfed out after one term because the because of a depression that started under jackson and then spends the whole time getting derided as a little fancy lad with silk cufflinks and fine wines sitting in the white house. Even though he was the guy who invented the democracy.

The democratic party originally founded around yeoman masculinity and some wig the party of the party of church boys and and financiers. The the citified party gets this guy to come in from a war. Guy come from the from the from the war with the natives which is exactly the kind of thing that democrats waged unceasingly to keep the the mob at bay with land and he says hi we're up in a hard. I grew up in a log cabin and drank hard cider. What did you do you little fancy lad and it worked. Can you believe it embarrassing like the mush like the rush of mighty water. All the country through it is the ball I'm rolling on for tippecanoe and tyler too and with it will beat little. Van van van is a used up man damn. It nobody remembers anything about martin van buren but maybe they heard that song van is a used up man. I mean that's a political genius. The guy invented the modern political party basically from scratch from the ruins of the of the of the of the the arrow of good feeling and under the nose of poor. John quincy. Adams who thought he was living in a post-sectional america can you believe it van. Buren saw no no no this system.

This conflicts they're going to be resolved through political dreams. They're going to be resolved along party lines. They're going to be resolved. Factually the dream of a non-function non-factional democracy in a capitalist system where all relationships produce conflicts and contradictions that have to be resolved will not involve party conflict foolish. Yes trump is not cringe not yet anyway although he's getting there. I gotta say if he loses he'll be cringe the whole thing will be cringe retroactively but he's like the more it looks like he's losing the more cringe.

He is. It's honest like he's not only I don't know how he would wanna. It's interesting. This is like a good psychological experiment here like a good or a good. It's like psychological thought experiment. Like this is a heisenberg thing so I really feel like as biden has sit. There sat there at the high poles certainly before the whole like now with the post office thing everyone's convinced trump's going to win and they've already basically admitted to themselves. It's going to happen which means when it happens. No one's going to do anything because we've all essentially reconciled ourselves now to oh. He's going to steal the election by by closing all the post offices that means when he does it. We're all going to be okay with it because we're already okay with it because we're letting it happen in front of us. I'm not blaming anyone for that. I'm just saying that's what's happening so before that though when it looked like biden was going to win trump's posts appeared lamer they didn't have the fire. They didn't have the home it seemed.

He seemed more desperate. He seemed less sure of himself but was that him responding to the reality of the of the of the the presidency maybe slipping away from him or more importantly him losing something and making him a loser which is all. He really cares about or do. I only perceive it that way because I think that he is losing his power how could I this is why we all need to get together. This is why we need to overlap our lacuna because I can't answer that question definitively about myself. No one can. It is only through the the the stacking of experience that we can find a commonality and then like pierce a put a needle through it and find core out something close to the truth or closer to the truth that any one of us is going to get to by themselves obama obama. The thing is he it worked.

I don't know if you can ever call it president cringe when he cruises through two terms. I mean he got his ass kicked but did he care like all the stuff that he got his ass kicked on. It's not stuff that he cares about what he cares about is god. Two terms is cool hangs out with hollywood celebrities gets to eat the baby brains with all the other guys hard to imagine he's cringe. Then truman can't be cringed because there's no more epic moment than the 1948 election holding up holding up the truman. The dewey beach truman chicago times you will not beat that for ownage that gets you through a lot lyndon. Johnson also very cringe that's a hell of a cringe spell there and of course of course. It comes after the coolest president right. I would also say that mckinley and garfield are cringe because they're the presidents who got assassinated but nobody remembers which is brutal that's that's like absolutely. They're not here to cringe. But we get to cringe at the thought of being that even though we wouldn't know because like you think about assassinated presidents. It's lincoln and jfk and they have all those things in common right oh. Lincoln's secretary was named kennedy. Kennedy secretary was named lincoln. Kennedy got shot in a lincoln ford. Lincoln. Lincoln got shot in a ford's theater and that completely ignores those two losers.

I would say john quincy adams is was cringe in his lifetime but is now based completely andrew. Johnson was was cringe in that he would do things like go on drunken rants. I mean he was shit-faced at his inauguration which was you know ad hoc in front of a judge because the president just been shot but he was hammered. He gave a speech he gave an impromptu speech. It was filled with retributive bitterness and resentment because he was super self-conscious of the fact that he was a tennessee hillbilly. But he also pissed off he like he was able to single-handedly like derailed reconstruction to the horror of basically the entire political class of the the the winning country like we won that was hooting a jug in the white house so that made him base the fact that he was able to exert that kind of power in the face of unified opposition. Almost jimmy carter was incredibly cringe hey everybody. There's a terminal crisis of capitalism.

Happening we cannot consume at the rate we used to you guys just need to all wear sweaters and feel bad about yourself for being so materialistic and and everyone's gonna see the importance of that and they're gonna give me they're. Gonna pat me on the back for being straight with them that was for like five minutes. People did he got a big bump after that speech people forget that but then at the end of the and then the hostage crisis happened and it was like oh yeah. You're just a big wuss. You're just a big. Wuss yeah. Carter was a complete Psycho did you guys know this. He did not have a chief of staff for his first two years in office. He was essentially his own chief of staff. Chief of staff is one of the most intense jobs in washington very few people do it for more than two years unless they have like no family like andy card. I think was bush's secretary or secretary of state chief of staff. He was bush's chief of staff for the full second term but he had he was like an incel he had no wife he had no kids. It's usually two years and he was president and chief of staff for the first two years of his term. Wow nutcase yeah. I know carter sold everyone a good bill of goods.

Carter was obama and the reason he's cringing obama isn't is because obama got that second turn baby can't. No phase can't see him got that second term carter got the boot because the forces allied against him in the wrong order booyah out of here. But he he sucked and he he got people in because he convinced people that he was a good person that he was a good human being and that that's what mattered because everyone had been horrified by nixon and because we cannot systematize anything because we have to personalize everything. That's what this culture does. Nixon's evil had to be described in personal terms his personal personality and his personal wickedness and that meant that the problem of the lack of trust we now had in our political institutions. It's not because gas has you know gone up 100. It's not because every factory in the company country is already starting to shut down that that you know things cost more and and people are making less No no no that has nothing to do with it. It's because we have evil people in charge and if we get a good guy in there he'll be good and the thing is is that that was also a carter thought. Carter thought he was a good person he wasn't lying and that's why people believed him. He was not selling people some fraud about how he was a great guy. He really thought he was a great guy and tending his moral. Garden was the only thing he really cared about and that meant that when he was confronted with the crisis of you know of stagflation his answer was well. We need to be virtuous and that starts with me and one of the most virtuous things. I could do is start imposing limits on what's politically possible in terms of spending and tell people that hey you know. We're the democratic party and our job is to provide you with the goods of capitalism. You don't get any of that they still get to keep all the gooker. The corporations are still in charge of everything. They still run your life and they demand your money and they get all the profit but you're going to get less money and you should you should you should just fill that hole with spirit. I'm not going to give you even an idea where to get any of that read some for christopher lash or go to church. I don't know and it's virtuous of me to level with you and you know what if I lose power if I get out of office. It's virtuous too and carter losing was obviously kind of like maybe not at the time but in retrospect it's probably one of that. Sicko's favorite moments of his life is losing because he feels like he now can in his mind believe that he did what all christians are called to do and that is imitate christ in his life. He was he was martyred. He was he was crucified on a cross of fiscal responsibility. All right guys I'm outta here good talk bye.
