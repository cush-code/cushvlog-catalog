I want to get the the punters too riled up twitch.com loving to cheers you twitch.com twitch and twitching you reach out to me reach out to me. Gotta go boost this on the bird website for maximum eyeballs. Gotta move this merchandise of the words coming out of my face. We gotta move these refrigerators we gotta install color tvs. Today we are having a craz cranberry lacroix not my preferred. I prefer it as the heart as the black cherry polar number one goat Sadly it's rarely available at my grocery store so I end up getting whatever. I can. I say cherry over anything else then berry over anything else then watermelon and then any other raspberry cranberry type things. But yes. I believe that the goat the goat of the flavors is the black chariot. It's cuts through. It's efficient in its delivery of a of a sump of of juiciness in an otherwise calorically deprived beverage all right. So today we speak not of fizzy beverages.

Today we speak of karen's sing to me o muse of karen's. I know that the the meme is well dead by now but I just thought it was useful to make a point about the whole karen phenomenon in reference specifically to the recent blatant attempt by the president and his minions to ensure that there is not an accurate count of absentee and mail-in ballots in the november election. So obviously karen is now quite a worn topic of conversation. No one uses it anymore as a term other than people who are five who are always behind the times. Not the not the internet literati no one would be no one watching. This stream would be so gauche and so behind the times is to non-ironically a letter karen loose in public. But for a while there my god everyone grabbed it. They loved it oh god they were so happy. It was just a perfect explanatory concept a way to take all criticism a way to take other things. You don't like categorize them very very efficient and therefore very useful and so people loved it and you can talk about how it's a lot of sublimated hostility towards women you know like misogyny on the left translated towards women that are acceptable to not to not be to hate because they're doing like class-based oppression or something when really you're dealing with misogyny. I think that's part of it. But I honestly think that the bigger thing that drove the karen phenomenon much bigger than even the the suppressed misogyny that it did express in my opinion. Was the fact that a lot of things like that a lot of those terms of abuse that could turn into categories of people that can be immediately dismissed and and given you know two minutes hate about and stereotyped and all that are that are expressions of the thing that the person themselves is afraid.

They are and people are tariff and you see on the left side of the internet. The number one epithet is liberal because everyone is terrified that deep down. They're a liberal because they don't really know why they believe what they believe. Most people don't. Most of us are only tenuously confident about any of the propositions that we carry around in our head we mostly keep to them because the social formations that we prefer express them and then we want to be part of that and we're expressing something. We're not really believing it in any kind of depth and so that makes us all worry oh god like where am I wrong where's my liberalism and and the fact that you have to engage with things like mass media and and electoral politics and the fact that real like guerrilla-style conflict with the state is not something. Anybody feels would be worth doing that creates this anxiety around am I really a liberal and so you have to call everyone else. Liberal. Same thing with karen everyone is afraid deep down that they're karen and so they have to get someone else to call to karen and to yell at and that's because we are a nation of karen's in the specific respect that our only recourse on all issues. Especially politics is to ask to speak to a manager to have to. It is to make a request of some other power to fix our current predicament to resolve the contradiction that we are currently being enmeshed with and that we are battling. Whatever that contradiction is whatever that social political reality that that loggerhead is we are instead of embracing our own will political will and trying to change it ourselves. We are asking to speak to a manager to have someone else fix it and you see that I i can't and I I've been guilty of this my whole life too of course I think. I'm not saying this as a point of finger at anyone.

I'm saying that this is how we are conditioned to respond to all things especially politics to be customers. We are customers. The state is the service government is a service. We are customers just like everything else and every other relationship. We are customers first that's how we've been able to subsume class so far by redefining americans away from being workers to being customers. If you're the one getting the the the actual. If you're the one being served in any situation even if you work for a wage even if you are exploited at your job. Even if your wages have been stagnant for 40 years. You still are a customer and that is it defeats class consciousness and it leaves us bereft of anything to do during any conflict in any political question but ask someone else to fix it because we don't know how to fix anything because we're not workers. We're not in a relationship to a means of production that we could collectively interfere with withdraw our labor from cease to allow to function. We are customers and all a customer ever has is their voice. All a customer ever has is their willingness to make a scene and that's I mean you could say that that's the whole of politics right now even on the left even among people who would rather die than think of themselves as a liberal or a karen. What they're essentially doing is asking to speak to a manager.

We're all doing that every tweet that says reminder this is all messed up. It's like who are you talking to you're asking someone else to do it today swear to god as if to prove my. Thesis there was a trending topic around the liberal freakout the liberal dawning of recognition that he could steal the election just by not counting bail in votes about the post office. They're just they're literally taking out machines that count ballots. I mean they're just doing it in front of everyone and then trump says that they're going to do it because we don't want them to vote. We don't want their votes to count. It's it's there's no hiding it. It's out there and yet this is the thing that you would reveal in a movie and that just the the fact of revealing it is would stop it and yet we're at the end of that movie and then no one's doing anything and the trending talk. It was do something who the are we asking to do something congress each other. We have no idea where the levels of power are because we don't recognize that they're actually the only ones that matter are within us acting in concert using our power our labor collective labor power and our organization along those lines to refuse to allow the system to continue to to function. Anything. Less is an appeal to the manager and so.

I have this vision where trump loses by like 15 million votes but in in a handful of swaits that would have given him that would have given biden the electoral college win The ballots just don't go anywhere they're just. They're thrown out in court or something. Some 19 year old judge that just got appointed a zygote in a little. A a a a fetus in a black robe with a tiny little gavel comes out and goes ah yeah. These ballots are bad what are people going to do they're going to wait for somebody else to do something and we're going to watch the whole thing happen and there's going to be no ones and that's going to be if that doesn't happen. That process is a is a a eruption of this of the subliminal action that's been going on over the past 40 years as the safety net has been destroyed as crisis. Capitalism has ripped out the foundations of society and replaced it with nothing with opiates and and tick-tock and vapes and and constant soul death is that people been waiting for someone to do something and it never arose and one of the big reasons. Nobody ever did anything is because there was always the appeal to the electoral process. This sucks but the only real way the only realistic way we can organize against. It is at the ballot box. We don't have enough social cohesion to do something like have a general strike. We don't have a so we do not have the social networks that could sustain that or coordinate it. But we do have enough of a social network to coordinate enough to vote for someone to represent us get into power and prevent. The bad. Things are happening and maybe do good things and the thing is is that that's not an entirely insincere or a false argument like in the absence of a real organized left. Electoral politics has to be a scene of struggle because it's the only one we have. It's the only place where there's a level of participation and social coordination that can be in any way influenced. Everything else is too is too flousy. It's it's just water flowing out getting uncaught by the bucket and so there's always oh things are getting bad. But we can vote and this time even more than two thousand. I mean 2000 was a theft but it was. It was a slow motion theft and all the forms were observed here months before the election you have them saying explicitly. We are going to make it so that these votes don't count. We are going to make it so that we can swing this election on our front. Why would we want to let them sort them sort the ballots that means that people will be able to count the ballots.

He said that so the last layer the last layer of justification and the highest level of of like political spectacle has now lost its ability to serve as a shield to serve as a screen for what's really going on is what's what it's there for it's super structural. The super structures exist to obscure the reality of the social relationship to mystify it and now the last bastion of it will have been made there translucent with no response why because the social cohesion the social fabric necessary the class culture the organic working-class culture necessary to resist. It has been destroyed never really built up enough in this country anyway in the first place but even brought down from that level to a point where it cannot respond to even even the last illusory notions of participatory democracy being replaced by the full acknowledged overrule of minority oligarchy but again. I have no idea what's going to happen shruggy emoji. I always have to end all of these rants and and and cosmic visits. Visions visions with an with a stipulation that hey I didn't know. Don't know I don't know one of the million of things that could happen in terms of the intersection of trump's ham fa candid attempts to rig the election and like the real like nature of his declining political constituency and the reality of of a incumbent president presiding over depression economic conditions. It's such it there's so many variables dude. It's a. I mean as always the worst outcome is the most predictable as it has been so far. The worst outcome has been what's come true basically at every level. We even got the boringest vice presidential candidate with the less you can with the fewest jokes my god.

I mean obviously the easy thing to say because it's the most likely to be true and it's easiest to predict is that instead of having some sort of collapse epic collapses and institutions and and then break up of of governance and and the world market you'll have a steady and slow subsumption of all into that market and then it will not be without disruptions that could be called apocalyptic. But the thing is is that they will be because of our harper. Normalized reality instantly metabolized into this the substance of of existence so they are not perceived by those who survive them anyway. They are not perceived perceived as apocalyptic because they are turned into their turn to do oh that's what it's like now oh. This is how things are now oh this is the thing and so at no point will there be that break that we're all praying for secretly that since the 90s we've been ritually trying to bring about like evo shandor on the veil between us and reality because we cannot bear this this tawdry and empty spectacle. Any longer this disgusting dance macabre across across a dead landscape of mini malls and concrete and and a reified market system that destroys all human autonomy and and here spiritual meaning and everything that happens that makes it worse will just be another thing that now is part of it like if you talked if you like the the american workplace like the gig economy. Reality of working in america would look like some sort of post-apocalyptic neo-feudal impr imposition on people in the high modernist main high point of american history.

I mean look at what's going to happen with climate change not an apocalypse slow and steady a consumption like florida. Florida is going to go away bit by bit miami's going to go away and it's just going to be yeah well. Miami I mean come on what was it doing there really not realist not very realistic dummies and then the rest of it will go and that's just the way things are and this is going to cause mass despoilation of life. Mass death billions of deaths baby depending on how it shakes up but those those who die will not be part of the narrative of civilization. They will be those un people so society will not have broken down even as huge chunks of it no longer function. They will just be gangrenous. Limbs cut off from the world market and within the cocoon within the remaining cocoon things will be kind of the same.

Only worse every day until we have been subsumed into this massive neural network. This this hive mind of capitalism where we are all individual um transistors and the thing is is that the search for for like communism. The the pursuit of pursuit of socialized production at this point of capitalist like productive capacity that is the challenge to turn the human race into one collective consciousness that is itself. That is all of it. That is additive that is all human minds together as opposed to what capitalism seeks which is to subsume all of what makes us human out of humanity and turn us into pure non-conscious stimulus response transmission vectors. So we're gonna be part of one big network brain. The nationalists who talk about how you know what we need to. They should say yes yes you have to deal with nationalism and the reality in the in the here and now. But I'm talking about at a pure at a purely theoretical level. Nationalism is absurdity and it will not sustain human life. It will have to be done away with now that doesn't mean you can walk around in 2020 telling americans that america sucks because they're not going to have it because they haven't gone to the same class as you have. But I do think that that's different than saying that it's inherently good.

But I'm saying it's going to go away one way or the other all these all these categories we think are discrete. About humans are going to go away and the question is are they going to come together. Is it the final transcendent moment or are they going to wink out and be replaced by by just dead circuitry ah but along that way there'll be no apocalypse when you're in that when you're in the slurry vat pushing the buttons to keep the slurry coming into your mouth that will not be they will not feel like. It's a post-apocalypse you will feel a continuum because the the because this the cultural firmament and and the probably even like the political architecture are gonna be not if not the same over time only changing slowly ship of theseus style until there's something else. That's the most likely outcome and it's not that hard to say it because d but we're also here we have free will to the degree. We're unaware of our roundings and that's totally we have free will and we have the responsibility to ourselves and each other to prevent that from happening if if we can and even if we can't because a life spent in the pursuit of the virtuous end will be a more rewarding life and a more meaningful life than one that acknowledges reality and accommodates itself to it.

Whoo man that's a good one on darts tonight. It says rich people are happy. This is a great transition thank you so much someone says. I don't know man rich people are happy. Someone pointed this out to me on the internet. Today it is a it is a little delightful little article about sumner redstone the immediate mom. The media giant one of the one of the guys who created the modern media landscape specifically um specifically like the cable television concept. He was the ceo of viacom and he died like they all do at 97 years old. They live forever because god delights in human evil and their ability to suck vampire-like. The life essence of the working people that they exploit it really does give them a natural long life. I mean that's it's a metaphor you know and it's not literal but like the adrenochrome notion that is just a a a a mythic reinterpretation of the of the real flow of life energy down to up in capitalism. But he died at 97 r.i.p. To a real one. But there was an article about his death about his last days that I wanted to find here I'll go here because yes I'm sure that sumner redstone had a great life. I'm sure cumulatively. He had a great time more good days than bad. A lot of delicious steaks a lot of a lot of hot dames hot air ballooning eating children's brains. If he wanted to all the fun you can have in his life. He had it but listen to this but listen to this article cnbc summer so this was oh no never mind never mind. This is yes it's about his last days but it actually came out two years ago.

I thought this was like his just came out but apparently this has been his life for at least like four years. So this was his life the last four years of his life. This was him media mogul sumner redstone who maintains vocal voting control over cbs and viacom has resorted to communicating through an ipad reloaded with audio clips of his voice saying yes no and you. The ailing 94 year old is currently caught in the middle of merger talks between two companies cbs close to making all stock offer for viacom This is not the one there's another article does anyone know the article I'm talking about well. I can't find the goddamn thing but anyway the story is is that apparently in his last days he was reduced in his mental capacity to just his most base urges and he was just based like frantically trying to like trying to get his dick hard. And I know that that's a common thing with dementia. Patients is that they get like sexually compulsive as they age. But I don't think that there's any reason to think that redstone was not.

I mean just think about it for someone who devotes their life to sensual pleasure and exploiting others for their own stockpiling of sensual pleasure your ability to enjoy. It is attenuated over time so even if as you live longer because you have all the life extension powers of the vampire that you are your ability to enjoy that life drains out of you not only do things just get less novel over time and if you have money you can do everything which means everything gets less novel but your ability to enjoy them your. Actual sensory. Ability to enjoy them goes down because I mean if you like your dick. Stops working if you like eating you get your taste buds.

Your things are shutting down no matter until they invent some sort of machinery to stop it your brain entropy baby. Those telomeres are and so you get whittle so you can't even have the sensory pleasures you once were and they're at their least so at a time when you would need them to be the most centrally overwhelming as possible to make up for the fact that they're bold you can have them like. It's. It's the apples who's the one the greek guy. The guy with the apples can't stop eating. Apples never gets full and so the only thing in your life that had meaning is now something you can't indulge with and you're left with only a growing recognition of your body's impermanence and your impending end and how and the world ending with your consciousness or the world ending and going beyond and the world continuing beyond your consciousness is unconceivable because your consciousness is the only thing that you credit is existing and you live that way even if you don't think that's how you think that's how you behave and so your last years are torture our torture and you might say well hey.

I'd take that deal yeah. A lot of people would that's why there's so many. In the world tantalus. I thought it was tantalus but then I thought he couldn't get. I thought the thing was he couldn't get the the apples. I'm talking. But he can eat the apples and of course like that's why they're all trying to extend their lives unnaturally. That's why they're all trying to go to the moon. That's why they're all trying to live forever. That's why they want the singularity because they think oh. I'll do it on the computer and my circuits will never die and I'll be able to get infinite amounts of pleasure an infinite amount of experience but of course that's fantasy. That's a delusion. These people are deluded that's one of the big reasons. I do not credit ai as a threat the way these people ever do ai. These people is freaking out about. Ai is it's just backhanded congratulations of themselves. They think god. I'm so smart.

I've created a thing that's going to destroy civilization take a roomba is not is not the a-bomb okay and also it's because they like at this point. They have their entire metaphysical. All their metaphysical chips on the board are pushed towards artificial intelligence becoming sufficiently similar to human intelligence to allow transference of consciousness from one format to the other. Their entire worlds depend on that that's why they're doing what they're doing that's why they're destroying people. That's why they're drinking blood so that they can get a a. They can make some sort of pact with the devil to get out of the deal of being a human being but it's not going to work our assumption that it'll work.

It's like. It does does any of this look like it's working and I know people will say oh yeah. No. It's working for the people at the top who are hyper exploiting yes. But there's a frenzy behind all of this that indicates a sickness at the center of the machine and of course it's better to be rich than poor. That's why people shouldn't be poor. We should get rid of that. I'm just saying is that like the the the the tragedy of human existence is something that cannot be transcended regardless of where you end up in the rawlsian state of nature where else you get thrown out of the out of the butthole of the of the random humans circulator from the va and then pushed through the veil of ignorance like jim carrey going out of a rubber rhinoceros ass hmm. I mean ai is not the same as capitalism. The algorithm taking over because the algorithm already exists like you don't have to invent a I for the algorithm. All. It is a question of his efficiency of transmission of the algorithm through physical space. It already exists something separate like a like a machine consciousness that is not just the algorithm of capitalism.

No - someone is thanking me for the for hosting a screening of gremlins 2 with joe dante that we did a few years ago in l.a. I want and and thank you for saying thank you. I just that that was a great night and I wanted to just I thank you for reminding me. That was a lot of fun It's getting to see gremlins too which is a movie that I've worshipped since. I was a kid so on a vhs was actually tricked at the beginning by the vhs specific fake out in the middle. Think it's a seminal film joe dante one of the great american directors getting able to see it in the theater with him. Every laugh hit every joke hitting like a neutron bomb everyone having a great time and then joe getting to take questions and get to talk about a movie that did not do well at the time and was one of the things that sort of contributed to joe dante losing his ability to get whatever he wanted made that he had there for a minute which is tragic because it's such a brilliant. Suits were wrong as always but also if you haven't seen gremlins 2. That's another big recommend from me and the burbs is amazing too.

I would if covet ever ends. I would like to go back to la and do a screening of the burbs too because I think that's it's a one-two punch man in terms of and also if you want to get like political which I don't you think you have to with those movies. But they are both really perceptive artistic expressions of real phenomenon happening like suburban on we in alienation and and like the the emergence of like the techno finance economy yeah. The death of the mid-budget movie man that's a real bummer. It's a real bummer man and the thing is that's the kind of stuff that would be perfect for like that is exactly the kind of art that public funding like public arts is best for because like low budget movies. I'm you don't really need the government you know like you should have foundations and stuff for people who are like I'm talking though about like a relatively even playing field here where we've eliminated massive amounts of poverty in that situation. Low budget movies should be like a hobby thing and big budget movies. I mean if they were to still exist if you had enough money circulating for that to be worthwhile doing which is. I think a big if but if that were to happen they're for everybody you know they're gonna. The market's gonna make them no matter what those mid-budget movies. They need there to be a dimension beyond profit in the calculation of whether to make it or not and there used to be and now there aren't and that's a real thing where you can say.

The system is not really different but over time it accumulates pathologies because as that profit it's really so. Much of this comes down to the fact that that things other than profit that used to be built into the architecture of american capitalism and and art were there because they could be in the minds of the bean counters in the minds of the bondholders and the minds of of the in the mind that is in the mind of the global market economy they could be afforded. Profit rates were such that they could be indulged and people could because people don't want to be a mere instrument of an algorithm. No one wants that they fight against it even if they're part of it even if they do well out of it and cultural superstructure is created in part by people trying to alleviate that sense of being instrumentalized by capitalism and that's it's a double-edged sword because like that acclimatizes people to capitalism like all superstructural culture does but at the same time it means the stuff is better. It means the actual art even though it's compromised by capitalism is better and more and more. It has more qualities and and has a richerness to those qualities and that gets squeezed out like a toothpaste as the profit falls and the need for return increases the ability to lose money on things that aren't sure things that are part of the algorithm is get squeezed out of the system too. And it's it's and that's where the government could stand in and be like this should be made because it'd be cool someone's asking about digital art.

I think it's one of those things where I'm of two minds part of me is like there's some elements of it like squibs where I think no this is objectively wrong. Don't do this but other things like cgi wear. I kind of acknowledge. I'm just. I have a different frame of reference like. I think that here's an example. I find and I've always found matte paintings and rear projection in films charming fun and even if you can see it even if you can notice it. It does not really disrupt my my suspension of disbelief. I'm willing to give it to the benefit of the doubt. Whereas I think somebody who grows up with digital art. They see a a flat screen or they see a like a stop motion or they see a rear projection or a matte painting and they think wait a minute. That's fake and the thing is from certain perspectives like fluidity of motion and like seamlessness. It is faker but they to them that fakeness is is throbbing it. It pops out because of their their seamlessness of their of their cultural context. I didn't come from that I can grow older so. I still value it.

So that's the thing where I could say. It's It's it's subjective but man. I was just. I had a chill today. I think I was thinking about squibs again which I'm always doing never 10 minutes away from thinking about squibs. They say they say the average man thinks about sex every eight minutes that's me with squibs every eight minutes thinking about squibs getting mad about now. There's no squibs anymore and it occurred to me in horror that because of the whole because of the new economic dynamic around firearms and movies. It's just it's cost prohibitive on on the basic slat to do indulgent. Like use incredibly expensive cameras or use rare film. You have to fight for that. It's it's not. It's not included in the suite. It's been seamlessly removed which means that in the future real guns firing blanks and real squibs are going to only be featured in films that are doing it as a self-conscious artistic choice that are doing it as part of a broader thing like movies that are in black and white.

Now that are that are that are conceptual that means that everything else all the genre movies that I would love to enjoy and are at the level of we're not trying to deconstruct anything. We're not making an artistic point. We're just doing an action movie. It's gonna be off the table as much as it would be to film one in in like the academy ratio and black and white like the lighthouse that's a bummer man and I think it's true i. I can't really think. I can't really imagine that that's not the case now especially with everybody streaming every movie now on those dog. Streaming links where like though you can't even get really black or anything and it's just less saturated and everyone's on their dang phone. Now.

I sound like andy rooney. I was trying to be even-handed there and then I ended up turning into annie rooney. The squibs will do that to me oh danny boy the squibs. The squibs are calling from plan to plan and down the mountain's eyes. The sun is gone and all the ways are falling what's my favorite nugget sauce szechuan baby. No.

I had the szechuan sauce it was dog. Like not even disappointing compared to the ridiculous height because nothing could have been that good considering the cultural. The amount of cultural ink and energy spent on a dipping sauce at mcdonald's how good it would have had to have been to make that in any way proportional it would have had to have been the best tasting food on earth. It's like the squeezed like like they took the like a ibis and like wrung out its spinal column or something it would have to be made of ground unicorn horn or something but even for a mcdonald's sauce. It was dog very very sweet. It was basically just a sweet and sour sauce. I was thinking the reason I actually did kind of. I'll admit get a little excited about it when I brought it back is because when they said szechuan sauce that made me think of szechuan pepper sauce like with the red like with the peppercorns you know in szechuan cuisine and I thought oh oh up. They introduced it and they said hey we have it now hey guys. We have it. We have such one sauce and it lasted like two weeks because nobody gave a and it wasn't good enough to stick around. I would say of the mass market ones you can get. I like ranch but I also like barbecue. I suspect that my favorite sauce if it could be found if someone could make this if if a if like a chick-fil-a or a wendy's or mcdonald's made. This they would have my my business for life. A a nugget dipping sauce based on korean red pepper paste the stuff they use on on the korean fried chicken.

It's it's it's. I don't know how to pronounce it That is the bomb that stuff is awesome and if I could dip those mo go go chujang gochujang. That's it a gochujang pepper paste because the thing about is. I wanted to have. I wanted to have a velvety texture. But I also want like a ketchupy umami residence and I don't want that spice. It's perfect so yes that stuff oh. I'm really hungry. I haven't had dinner yet. I can't wait what am I going to get what am I going to get maybe. I'll get nuggets you guys have inspired me but maybe. I wouldn't get nuggets because I don't have any of that paste and it would feel like actually. I might have that paste oh my god. I might have that paste guys oh my god guys if I have that stuff.

It's happening hey guys feeling good feel. Like this has been a good stream good mixture of the high and the low dionysian and such and the what's the other one the apollonian that's it dinosaur and the apollonian you guys. I gotta admit someone's asking about how much I go outside and if I feel panicked I gotta say I kind of i. It's not that. I don't care about getting it. It looks terrifying and I really don't want to get it But I kind of am not really that afraid of getting it. I I think that we've reached at least where I live a a mass saturation point that when I go out. I don't feel that scared. I don't get. I'm not willy-nilly about it of course. I keep my distance and I keep my mask on. But I feel like enough. People are doing that and everything is distanced enough that I'm not really feeling like. I'm taking my life in my hands that much anymore. But I mean. I could get it but you know you get killed walking your doggy oh that's funny idea. Someone said there should be an official chapel mask where it's the soy face god. The nazis would get so mad because they thought that up and we stole it from them tough. That's what happens maybe if you value jacking off in the bank lobby less you could get some bits out do.

I feel that the left is due for a spiritual awakening. I have to say. I mean I've said on the show explicitly yes. I mean I've been saying that for a while now I have been saying that spirituality needs to be enmeshed with practice now and with analysis to overcome the sort of this liberal hedonic treadmill loggerheads. We're at and I think it's going to happen. I just don't know if it's good what form it's going to take or whether it's going to be effective. That's that's the big. Those are the big questions as always. But I also think it's gonna happen because I've been as I've been talking about it. People have talked to me about what they're thinking and a lot of people. I know including people who do not even listen to this and have no idea what I'm yelling about on the goddamn internet have come to the same conclusion and are trying to move like graspingly towards that direction and I feel like that's very good. I don't know what direction it'll take but so far. I have faith that that will that I think people get it. I think enough people get it that you could build a kernel of something and that's all we can ask for right now because for the love of god you can't get ahead of yourself. Numbers are so small getting the people on your side real real challenge and I think people say well.

We're totally atomized how that's ever you know. We're totally pleasure seeking but like the pleasure is getting attenuated very quickly and that's that's one of the situations that can lead people towards change and I hate. I know. It's awful to have to depend on individual like awakenings as I have said that's not how change happens in the mass. But the traditional methods are kind of dead right. Now. I guess. It's less a question of like who to appeal to and more a question of what appeal needs to be made. Can dialectics defeat the demiurge I mean yeah they better they better because that's that's the only thing that could can we get that spiritual awakening by normalizing psychedelics. I hate to do any of that normalizing stuff because one. I think it's sort of a trap to say that you can normalize something because then it gives more weight to your individual indulgence and speech about said then is warranted by the actual weight of the act and then conversely it provides you with a cudgel like if you hate somebody and they're not doing anything outwardly terrible they're not they're not doing it. They're not saying any of the the prescribed curse slurs and they're not. They're not doing any of the the dog whistles. You can say that they're normalizing something bad you need to say like and then you're already halfway there to to righteousness. But the problem with the psychedelic thing is. It's the same problem as like getting. It's the same problem in heron and people who think that you can do something like have robin d'angelo struggle session stand racism. They both they both assume a subject who is already halfway to your position. They assume a subject who is voluntarily in a room having accepted your. Certain opening premise that you could then build a psychedelic experience on top of or build a a note a recognition of my own racial privilege on top of but you're you're assuming when you're talking about an unbounded population. A lot of the assumptions built in our assumptions are based around self-selected groups and when it comes to psychedelics you have to be taking it on purpose and you have to have some sort of purpose to it now not necessarily. But it sure as hell makes it a more efficient vector taiping rebellion but instead of jesus we do it with marx you're basically describing the chinese revolution. That was that was the that was the chinese communist revolution was the taiping rebellion with marx replacing. Jesus have I ever fired myself.

 someone asked if I have ever fired a gun myself yes. I fired a number of guns. I mean I have fired an elephant gun like. I fired a sks which is sort of like a knockoff ak-47 banana clip. I fired a 454 sewell which is one of the largest handguns or most powerful handguns. Kicks like a mule almost put my arms over my head shotgun glock bra. I'm strapped not really but guns are cool.

What shane would. I review for doughboys good question. I assume they've covered most of them if they haven't done culver's obviously. I would do culverts that's a no-brainer but I got to assume they've done covers already if not culvers. I would if they have not had somebody on that show to defend arby's. I would defend arby's for sure. I would do that too ah of course. They did. Culver's in the live show yeah maybe a and w I don't know. I'm trying to think of another one then another like something. On some sort of has anyone talked about that dickies place. I've never been there. It seems weird fast food barbecue restaurant that seems like a contradiction. In terms. We do have a w in america not that many but I remember going to one as a kid oh god rocky rococo garbage oh barf oh god. I could do mission barbecue. That'd be funny and go to mission. Bbq. I guarantee you that you could go in there without a mask. They don't give a fazzoli's. There is a fazzoli's in indiana. I think it's got to be one of the last ones in america. I would love to go to one of the last fazoli's because I went to the zoli's all of the time when I was a kid. Fazzoli's was a top tier choice that was that was a I remember. I have a distinct memory of skipping school with some guys and gals senior year getting a car and going to vizzoli's.

That's how they had unlimited breadsticks baby. You go up there and they bring them around. They had like they had like half-assed table service they'd bring it around and they'd bring you. They'd have a basket. They'd bring in the the breadsticks oh hell yeah. If I could find it for zollies. I would absolutely go um yes yes yes yes yes oh man I'm getting prusie and reveries thinking about fazoli's now. I guarantee you. If I ate it it would be like this is not fit for hogs. This is pig slop but it would still be funny Also another one that was a favorite is this a kid that has gone away now and I think there are still a few are left schlotsky's I remember enjoying their weird bread. They had their sandwiches had a very very weird bread. The almost unique sort of the way that in and out fries are unique among fast food fries and just like with in-n-out fries. I like it because it's weird and different and I i remember liking the weird schlatsky's bread and so if there's a schlotzkis. I would love to go there and get that back oh man people are saying. Shilatsuki's is still good damn it. I had a chance to go to schlotzki's a while ago and I talked. I said nah. I just remember it. I remember it as being good and now people are telling me. It rips damn it next time. I just gotta go yolo on it and say if it's bad. It's bad.

I would love to go to publix. I've never been never been never spent enough time in the south to go to a grocery store. But I've heard the chicken is very good and I would like to try it god damn. I'm. I'm gonna oh. I'm gonna nug up. I think after this big boy needs his treat treats a chicken tender sub see. I don't know if I like that idea that just seems like it's too much starch. It's like. I don't eat the fries and the chicken tenders at the same time. I don't like wrap the chicken tender in french fries and eat it. Why would. I want to put a big carb around the fries to me. They're sex. They're secret. Zaxby's is another one. I would like to try. I haven't had that yeah. I don't think I like it. It's like I why am. I biting through bread to get to breading. Nope. You have not sold me on the concept of a chicken tender sub. I'm afraid. I'm sorry. I'm just gonna get regular chicken and besides I always take bone in over tendees. Dandies are fine once in a while 10 days and nuggets are fine if you're in the mood like I've kind of talked because of the dipping sauces. But it's because of the dipping sauces. That's all beef. Let's all let's stop ourselves okay. All non-bone in fried chicken is about the sauce and it's about what's the easiest way oh boneless oh great. I could stuff this in my mouth fast without having to get around bones if you want to taste the chicken. If you're about the flavor you gotta have the bone gotta have bone-in and I'll I so. I usually want bone in but once in a while if it's really because I want to dip something in something.

That's when I'm gonna get a boneless fried chicken item like canes not raisin canes or no. It is raisin canes but it is not the guy that trump talked to who he loves who he thought it was raisin. He thought it was raisin like he thought it was raisin like the fruit. He thought it was raisin like the fruit because raisin cane. I think that's like an old-timey saying from the bible. I don't think he had any as a little lord fought leroy and crushed velvet pantaloons in his little gated community in queens. I don't think he knew anything about raising kane one way or the other now yeah. Like I think the canes is pretty good. It's juicy which is usually the hard part with wings are worth strip tenders especially when they're that thick because those they're relatively thick and it stays juicy and the breading's fine. But you stay you come for that sauce and I do think the sauce is good. But if the sauce wasn't good I would not think it was good raisin herman cain. I don't think I mean I know people say wow things move so fast. We just normalize things but I really don't think I don't think enough people emphasized the sheer.

Hallucinatory mad fellini-esque dark humor of a former presidential candidate. A guy who pulled at the top of the heap in the crowded 2012 field for a while and if he hadn't stumbled under the pressure when he was the front runner if he'd been able to hold up a little stronger. I think he had a very good chance at that nomination because he was wildly and uniquely popular in the south. People loved him in the south because he was the dr. He was a dream for all the white southern reactionaries who vote in republican primaries. He was a black guy who said which meant they weren't racist and he really loved god and he hated muslims and he had like that kind of dumb guy thing that they think is charming because they're all and they loved him if they had gotten to the south he might have won. This guy goes to a rally to the for the president not even it's not even close to the election. It's just as a way for him to get his spirits up because everyone's been saying mean things to him during the covid quarantine and he wanted to have people say. Nice things to him and people talk about his endless campaigning and his rallies and how oh he's going to oklahoma. He's going to tulsa for juneteenth. He's he's signaling the alt-right and oh he's going to. He's going look at the days going here and he's trying to what happens with trump is. He watches tv all day and yes he watches the people being nice to him on fox. But he also watches everyone else be mean to him and it gets him his power. His health power levels go down his power bar depletes and the only thing that can really top it off like watching. Fox does it. A little bit is getting a rally and having people say he's good and so for. Kermit cane for no reason and just to own the libs who think that there's really a virus going around. He goes masculine to this rally where the highlight was watching the president of the united states during a world defining crisis brag about how he was able to drink a glass of water with one hand and walk successfully down a died for that. He died his ass is dead because he did that because he wanted to give the president a little pick-me-up because he was was so shattered. He did drink that water you did a good job and that corona that's not real corona just puking my just bit right in my face that's not real stuff oh. I don't feel so good dead and his about like kamala harris is trying to say that she's a centrist girlfriend you're tripping the motherfucker's in the ground that's all of our fates just to be this echoing digital signature created by an algorithm meant to like represent our entire time on earth in a little little pithy little epic sayings that just flatten us into essentially the worst versions of ourselves jobs. I had before. I was podcaster.

The longest gig. I had was for the number of years. I worked at barnes noble. I was a cashier. I was very frustrated with being a cashier and thankfully. I was able to get moved over to the information desk where I helped people find books and that was and then did stocking and stuff and that was good that was probably the best job. I had and the longest. I held a grad student where I was a ta during my abortive. My abortive. M.a. Pursuit. I worked as. I've said it before for regis. The company that goes in and inventories retail retail inventory and when I was a kid. I was a dishwasher and I worked at a I worked at a grocery store unloading the truck before my back obviously.

I got to say that somebody asked the most subversive book. I read and I did get it at a barnes noble. I saw the title and it just struck me and I ended up buying it when I was in college. I think so a little older. But you know it took me a while to really even think politically. It was. It's a it's a by a guy who I don't actually agree with very much anymore. Derek jensen the culture of make-believe which is because the thing about him is. He's essentially an and prim and I i discount that entire tradition but just in terms of reading something that was so radically at odds with everything. I thought. I had kind of come to terms with as understanding the world even through like a jaded a relatively jaded like left lens like. I wasn't a chut or anything. I was like you know. I was a I was not a bush fan but it was still relatively It's you know it was. It was a narrow conception of like why.

I believe what I believe and it was such a shock reading it and it was such a challenge that I ended up having to like break down and reconfigure a number of things that I'd held his assumptions and even though. I don't think that he's right in any kind of like you know removed objective sense I feel like for me anyway. His contribution to my intellectual development was very useful but I would certainly not endorse. Even. I can't even remember what a lot of the stuff in the book was and I probably wouldn't endorse any of it because at this point I don't think I need. I need that same thing you know and like that's why it's so hard to recommend books and talk about books. Objectively is because especially when you're talking about things that contribute to intellectual progression. There's times you need something and then you don't need it anymore and then like if somebody else is asking about it and trying to evaluate it well where where are they what do they need.

You don't know and it's it's subsumed into the into the debate and it and it makes it harder to kind of clarify what you're talking about all right. I'm going to I'm going to sign off here with a few maybe. One more question the fred hampton movie. It's probably not going to be good. I will say this though there's this funny thing of people saying off but then they'll be like and you know what they did this wrong and it's like hold on a minute. What's the problem here you know is this thing categorically to be condemned or is it to be engaged with artistically if it's one or the other you don't have to you don't have to say both you know Nobody's gonna think you're a sellout if you just engage with the thing as a work of art under capitalism attenuated at every level by that fact. But if you want to condemn it condemn it and then just don't talk about its aesthetic qualities. What's the point it's beyond. It's beside the point you're implying that there is a version of this movie that would have been better and then you're denying the material under pertinent undergirdings of the endeavor of making a film. I will say that one thing that so people who are engaging with it artistically.

I've seen a number of people annoy that it appears to be through the point of view of the guy who ratted him out. That's the fbi informant and not fred hampton and I mean the title is kind of a of a clue. There. It's called judas and the black messiah and people get mad at that and I have to say from a dramatic point of view if if you're just like looking to make a movie. I ge. There are ways that you can make a movie about fred hampton where he's the protagonist. But I think it's a lot harder but there are more there are more artistically the character who stands out as the character who you would follow is him because he's conflicted because he has a dynamic within his character of being torn between his self interest and his growing devotion. You might say well that's you know giving him that credit is bad because he's a piece of him if you make any of the characters like that. It'll be a bad movie if you make any of the characters as one-dimensional as people on twitter want to make every historical character. It's going to suck because fred hampton's going to be boringly perfect and that guy's going to be boringly evil and I have to say that these guys people who say they want a movie were fred. Hampton's the protagonist you'd have to show flaws and are you ready for that are you gonna. How far can they go in conflict in in depicting a con a complex character before you start freaking out that they're doing propaganda and undermining his his legacy like if you.

If you're sort of stuck with hampton as saint which the title implies yeah. We are and I think we are. I think given like anxiety of influence and and the public space and people knowing what's expected of them. They plan to first stuck with hampton as the saint. So then where's the interesting story. Judas judas much more interesting than jesus and I guess you could try to make like a sainted hampton interesting. But it's a it's a higher bar.

What are hot dogs made out of and elbows alright guys one more question and then. I'm. I'm piecing out perhaps to dream perhaps to mow on some nugs oh. I'll just end with this the uae israel thing. I'm wondering. I guess. It's just evidence of like the lack. The fact that the uae essentially doesn't have a public. It's got a royal family and a bunch of slaves if they don't have to worry about public opinion the way the saudis do and there and so it's easier for them to just take the the fact that everybody at the diplomatic level knows and everyone who pays attention really to anything. Knows is that there is a that israel and the gcc countries bahrain uae and saudi arabia are our allies they might as well be in a defense pact. They've got their own nato for the middle east essentially and they're doing their own gladio in syria and they have been for the last decade and they're doing conventional like kosovo-style warfare in in yemen only much more intensely horrifying like they have they have an agreement. They're together but that's not a thing that like the public in saudi arabia would be able to accept but since there's no public in in the uae.

I guess the thought was I guess they wanted to do trump a favor like hey. Trump's looking like he's getting his ass kicked doesn't know what he's doing. He needs a win what if he brokers midi's piece. I mean remember he sent jared to do that and his came back with something that no one could agree with. It was absolutely out of the question and it just died on the table complete disaster. Another humiliation after building it up so much. These guys keep doing that because they keep not realizing how little they actually can do dunning-kruger all-stars a lot of them. But here it's like hey. Millie's piece just like jimmy carter got got got got him on the table got him to. It's like they're just taking something that was understood and making it formal. They're just taking the conversations that had to be had like on the non- government. Line can now be done on the on the landline. That's it um and it's funny. I think it's I more than anything.

I think it's proof that trump wanted a win and asked them as a favor. Hey could you guys pretend to like apparently. Israel's big concession is they're going to stop expanding their illegal west bank settlements. They're going to stop doing something that they are already enjoined from doing under international law wow and not even forever slow down wow holy crap yeah. No the orb picture tells you all you need to know about those freaks and they're all allied with israel. It's all one. It's all one block. It's a block opposed to the iranian bloc with turkey in the middle sort of the trying to have it both ways the great game baby. You got the ant you got the american gcc israel block jordan and whatnot egypt. Then you've got the the you've got. Iran. Iraq is a contested point and syria hanging on there and then turkey for a while was pretty much firmly in the u.s. Saudi camp but they have been over the past half decade. After they didn't get the results they wanted in syria they had to start intervening. More are now sort of playing both sides although they're still going hard to the paint against egypt in in libya. But that's I mean that's that's about border security. Libya is right there. They want to have make sure that they have complete control of whatever government is in that area next to next to the egyptian border especially considering that they've been in a low-grade insurgency ever since cece overthrew morsi and killed everybody in the square. Whoo man this is a long one but I had fun I might might do one more question but I am really craving those 10 d's. It's just. I have nothing else to do tonight so. It's like. But I am. I'm basically fighting my own hunger.

All right one more question oh the guy who wrote the bush. The guy who wrote the bear about the guy the bush guy who wrote about who wrote the novel where a bear is used to have sex with women and like a brothel in japan. I believe it was scooter. Libby let me confirm that I'm not. I didn't check that first. I didn't cheat. I'm pretty sure using my my bush era blog memory. I think it was scooter libby yeah. It was booyah now. I remember all that. Man. It's all in my head for no reason scooter libby that was the guy. There was a time one of the reasons I was immunized. I mean one of the many reasons just time and experience being most of them but one of the big reasons. I was immunized against russiagate from the beginning immunized against anything having to do with comey or libby. The amount of amount of attention that I gave that guy the amount of psychic energy. I put into his fate because I thought it was going to break the whole thing open and they were going to frog march just like joe. Wilson said they were going to frog march Karl rove out of the white house and then he was going to flip on cheney deluded delusional all right guys.

This has been fun. I never wore a big johnson shirt in high school. I actually avoided the graphic tee era. I respected them from afar but I don't think I owned a single one but maybe I should get some ironically like. I could be the compound in the in the after the collapse of the east coast wearing wearing track pants and a co-ed naked lacrosse shirt and it still won't feel like the apocalypse. It'll feel like a tuesday. They're like oh. I gotta fight the marauders again god damn. It fighting the marauders is now like It's par it's part and parcel with the whole package of being part of society the market the market sinews will not break. They have to be severed. Alright guys bye.
