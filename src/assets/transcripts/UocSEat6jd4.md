Oh. I love this armature. It's so convenient there. I am rock me like a hurricane. Hi guys. I'm back. It's cushy's world tour or I guess basement tour backyard tour rather. But he never really left anywhere. I'm pretty convinced that all those joey videos take place in the exact same. County he lives in. Joey what a fraud it was such a non-shock when I found out that he was a big trump supporter. It's like really the guy whose job is to stuff himself for the cackling amusement of a bunch of rubes on youtube likes donald trump. I can't believe it what would he have to see in trump what would a guy like. Joey's world tour have to see in common with trump that's absurd So the department of homeland security is just abducting people off the streets in portland h that's happening.

Now. That's the next that's the next escalation that's pretty wild you. Gotta say that's that's and that is an escalation for sure and I'm seeing a lot of people were saying like all right. This is the fascism you know the fascism we've been worrying about. It's here and I mean while this is certainly an escalation in authoritarianism. I think once again the word fascism kind of obscures the reality of what we're dealing with because. I mean if you're just using fascism as a synoquinon for authoritarianism then fine whatever but if you're trying to describe you know the phenomenon of a christ of a terminally critical capitalism a dying capitalism trying to protect itself by creating a a nationalist right populist movement. This is an example of that this is an example of why we're actually in a scarier situation than that because I honestly think one of the reason people like to think that fascism is what we're dealing with is because it imagines that they'll get to fight it again. They'll get to go in the streets. Like the red front fighters did they'll get to they'll get to b they'll get to put their stamp on history and say even if they win even if this is the fourth reich i. I'm not gonna go down as one of those one of hitler's willing executioners or or one of the good germans who followed orders. I'll go down there as like one of the one of the first communists to go into the concentration camps after the night of the long knives and the enabling act.

But this is actually kind of scarier because this isn't the cops. This isn't the authorities this isn't capital sending out street thugs to stop people from from protesting. It's first using the existing police structure to beat down the initial excitement and enthusiasm of the the protesters and then as the protests kind of lost their coherence. They didn't necessarily stop happening but they were no longer part of a coherent movement with coherent goals. Even if you know you can say oh. There's there's a political track. There is but at the level of like the individual. I mean it doesn't seem to me. There's a lot of coordination between when cities have protests or what they're demanding and I'm not blaming anyone for that that's the nature of protest that's the nature of politics in the late in 21st century america. But what part of the reason part of the result of that is that we are then demobilized and it then.

What we're seeing now is they'll just grab people one by one. They'll literally pull them away when they're not part of any greater group when they don't have to worry about any kind of consequences for doing so and then have everybody individually suffer the trauma of this police tactic. I mean I'm sure a lot of these people are probably just. They've probably already been let out after being questioned. But the the psychological impact has already been been felt. They have experienced like what it would be like to be one of the disappeared in chile or argentina you know and if they're good leftists they sure shouldn't know about that It's like how they fake executed dostoyevsky in the gulag to scare him straight and it worked by the way which is the funny thing by turning him into an ecstatic christian but but by cutting us off from the herd one by one and traumatizing us individually in a way that won't afford us a chance to react in the moment that's how this is. That's how they're gonna that's how they're going to establish whatever lifo capitalism is coming that's how they're gonna maintain the physical perimeter around remaining centers of capital. That's why we need. That's why we need an organized counter movement as soon as possible.

And I saw this today. I mean. I know that we've talked about how like the question of abolishing the police and you know dealing with the fact that there is a genuine need for a police force to exist for monopoly to be violent for violence to be monopolized by the state for some enforcement of laws in order to maintain basic social stability under capitalism which we still live under but also the need to have a long-term vision to to end it. You know those things are that's a real argument but something like dhs which is the people doing this. It's not the local portland cops. It's department of homeland security abolishing. Dhs is a coordinating fusion centers for distribution of authoritarian violence like they pioneered during the phoenix project and then brought home and that's why you know the degree to which the police have to be restr restrained and have their power reduced which is significantly disarming. Them is one of the big things that should be demanded because a lot of these cops will quit if they don't have to get to have guns and then the ones who would join would be less insane and of course you know you have to worry about the whole you know deep affification question. But I think that could be managed in the context of radical redistribution of like securing the base of the economic structure of america removing the the winnowing horror. The grinding ceaseless traverse on the temple of doom that we're actually on like diverting from that will reduce a lot of that. It'll reduce the need for policing. It will reduce the the danger of the ex-cops left to their own devices and will make the jobs of the remaining and new cops easier. But I mean if you're not going to abolish the policing role in society and you can't do that until capitalism is finished and I don't think anybody has a realistic plan to end capitalism in the near future that means they have to be realistic.

You have to ask what is gonna work. What's gonna what's a possible ask that can be pushed towards becoming that non-reform reform or even if you hate electoralism. That thing that makes people say that's enough to fight over and join your cause which they are not enough of right now and to me. That's the number one question and that's what infuriates me about so much discourse is so little of it is about that so little discourse is about how to get more people. It's a meta discourse on like what the perfect person to get is because it's all about embodying an ideal type and then measuring people against that but they're not there yet so they don't have the markers you're looking for but that doesn't mean that they're inherently on the wrong side that doesn't mean that they have bad faith that means that they have not imbibed whatever you're trying to sell and that means you have to make it in some way something they would want to try. It can't just be tonic of of of of guilt and and taking responsibility and all that because why would anyone sign up for that without an upside because they don't already accept the undergirding assumptions that you do but yeah note the dhs is terrifying and the ability the amount of information. I mean the nhs is a whole other deal or the nsa.

Rather you know we kind of all forgot about it but the nightmare from the movie enemy of the state where the government can hack onto your computer phone. At any moment is true. They can get in. They can watch this webcam of course. They could do that anyway but they could watch it when I'm taking a they can read every email. It's just. I mean really the argument against like why you shouldn't be freaked out about that is essentially well. That's so much data that they can't really find anything and that's true they're not. Gonna just dip their hands in and find out that you you know bought black dark web dmt or something they're gonna. They're gonna poke it at the specific people and then they're. Gonna find the information that way and so this thing of na of dhs probably going off of data. They got from the nsa going in and plucking up people who two weeks earlier like spray painted a cab on the side of a building. All the stuff that they that dhs came up with as justifications. The the lawlessness of of portland boiled down to graffiti charges from weeks earlier like nothing like an emergency.

Someone asked if you should read reagan land or nixon land. First you should read before the storm first. There's four books you should read them in order because it's a it's a story that unfolds over time before the storm. Nixon land invisible bridge and then reagan land because you can't really understand nixon unless you understand water goldwater and the pressure that goldwater represented the new type of conservative. I was talking about last week or earlier. This week the sun belt which was dominated by oil and natural gas money and aerospace and defense contracting from from orange county to texas. Basically.

That's where the new money in the republican party came from where the new ideology was born. Goldwater represented it and then later it came into fruition in orange county. California aerospace and defense hotbed I mean and it was of course this wildly hypocritical movement of people in industries. All of which completely depended on government. Largesse like orange county was built by the defense industry that's direct government money spent natural gas at oil depended on the oil depletion allowance. I mean that's why they bought lbj and a million. Other politicians was to maintain the the delicate balances of tax rebates and incentives. They got that made it worth it to risk pumping for oil and then of course big ranchers who complained about having to pay grazing fees for land that was entire that was only accessible to them because of the deprivations of the us government that dispossessed native peoples and created infrastructure for their behalf. And it's it was essentially a movement of sore winners. The ungrateful winners of america. The people who did so well in that post-war media post-war period that they immediately decided that they weren't doing well enough and blamed everybody else who wasn't as smart. They applied some of that calvinism that deep american calvinism to say why isn't everybody where I am why isn't everybody with their lovely house and my lovely pool and my lovely wife well. It must be because they're insufficiently american. They're too jewish. They're too they have too much ethnicity to them They're they they don't have enough americans stick to it if god blah blah purely just self-flattering. I mean barry. Goldwater inherited a family.

 a family department store and his grandfather only went to arizona to sell military goods to the army and then and but they didn't feel that because that kind of provision is by the way that we structure things invisible because the people at the top are not being given right like we think of welfare as as this distribution downward to the poor and we think of people at the top paying taxes or and giving to the state to give to that person when in reality that's all money being pulled upward. The state exists to rupert redistribute money away from the people who produce it the people who produce value to the people who parasitically squat over them like vampires and so so. I talked the other day about ideology and how some disagreements within the republican party are not ideologically their information ideological. They're informational and somebody asked what I meant by that and I want to say first that that's not quite true. There's no such thing as informational that is not ideological. But the difference is the arguments are along a different axis than the people in them think they are but anyway. This is to say so this new sun belt. Conservativism emerges right and what it's hostile to is the internationalism of the establishment republican party that was dominated by wall street finance capital banks.

The lenders who had and banks are who you borrow money from if you're these people if you're people from the the sun coast. So you actually see them not even as your. Your friends but your enemies as your exploiters and the government exists to help the banks exploit you even though you're benefiting from the same arrangement. You are also having income redistributed upward to you. But it's being screened by ideology because you're at the top you get to think of yourself as as a put upon whereas the poor person gets to gets to feel like a like a mooch for even dani to get the dole they have to feel like there's so much shame among among poor people about getting handouts. Even though it's it's. It's the scraps left over from after the orgy of upward redistribution to the jackal-like parasitic upper class. But that's not how they that's not how the ideology exists to make them feel because ideology exists to make poor people okay with what's up with them with their lives makes it. It's basically to to assuage the the misery of the poor by making them feel that they have it coming in some way or that they can make it if they just apply themselves. They won't be that way anymore and then for rich people it. Tells them that they deserve what they have that's what ideology exists for for people for rich people to do is to make you feel like this state of affairs which I have wildly more than other people into a disgusting degree is justified and and that's because everybody's alienated in capitalism but the alienation is different. It's some degree of alienation of self the way that poor people and and the working-class people are exploited of their time. Their species being that like they're alienated from the time of their their actual existence. Rich people are alienated from everybody else. Rich people are alienated wildly from the human species.

They're they're they live essentially as separate and that is also an alienation and it's like a pebble in the brain and it has to be assuaged and ideology is there to associate both of those things both for the purpose of maintaining the system. They're the they are the the ideology and culture and the culture that spawns it are like capitalism's um. What do you call it white blood cells. It's the immune system. That's what I was thinking capitalism's immune system. Social immune system is ideology through culture and both at the top and at the bottom. It's supposed to keep people where they are and keep people not trying to change the arrangement so what that means though is that at the top ideology eventually becomes so overwhelming because of the difference between the world as it exists and the world as you think it should like. For example. I talk about how like conservatives really think america is great. America is great. It's a land of opportunity. It's the blessed country because I'm here and I'm doing well. It's it's. It's self-worship just like their version of god is them too. It's all worshiping their ego. They don't know that but that's what they're doing. They're worshiping their ego by by equivalent by making it equivalent to god and to america. But then america is filled with suffering and misery and social conflict and the culture. Oh my god we keep getting our values spit at us and we keep losing.

All this respect and we're not being validated by the very thing that we think is the greatest thing that exists on earth. How can that be and so ideology exists to make us answer that question without saying capitalism without saying you are being pulled away from all humanity and everything you thought you valued is being dissolved into ether by the the rationalizing madness of capitalism. Defining all relationships between everything through transaction robbing everything of sacredness spirituality. Social meaning anything we are de-sacralizing the world but you believe in spirit. At least you think you do but you can't admit that it's capitalism so what is it oh. It's the cultural marxist blah blah and what that does is over time because reality doesn't fit with your ideology. You start ignoring the parts of reality. You don't like not even on purpose. You are you you you just glide over them when you encounter them which means even though capitalism is rule of of the work ruling class of of the bourgeois of the of the ownership class it's not rulership of the of the ruling class. According to their interests it's to the um to their understanding of those interests. They're they're they're operating in their best interest as they understand them and everyone's understanding is limited and the more out of touch you get with reality becoming by being rich. The more you have to fill in the gaps of your understanding of the world with ideology. That's what fills all the cracks and keeps the ship from seek sinking and that means that eventually you're not operating with a with a real understanding of the world and that means that you're no longer operating in your. Best interests and that is the war within the capitalist class that we're seeing played out at the political level.

Right. Now like trump was the final victory and takeover of the party by those people who pearlstein documents their rise to power in the republican party. In his books. Those people who were small bourgeois local manufacturers and small business owners and and and the the more successful aerospace and and defense professionals and stuff. Them saying my country isn't what. I want it to be anymore those damn wall street. Fat cats are are ruining are ruining capitalism instead of understanding the way that the people in wall street did. They pulled all the first guys from oss from the wall street law firms because those things essentially already operated as espionage organizations.

They were all over the world with information gathering such systems in order to figure out what the what the business conditions were all over the world so they understood in a way that the locally focused small bourgeois in america couldn't that the only that the real game in town in the cold war was capitalism as a world system versus social socialism as a world system or communism as a world system and as such we had to do things like build up the capacity of our foreign erstwhile allies I mean partially that helps us like prevent a crisis of over production because that means someone is there to buy all of our stuff. But it also means that they're less likely to fall to communism and they're stronger in their resistance to communism and we did everything we could to make that happen. I mean the marshall plan operation gladio vietnam war. These are all parts of that the the entire gamesmanship was maintaining maintaining access on on terms of the purchaser of third world. Raw materials in a post-colonial context essentially reimposing colonialism through the market through the through the new imf world bank brenton woods system and then after that the petrodollar they understood that because they faced outward the small bourgeois represented by now trump did not but they eventually took over the political body of the republican party but they could had no control over the actual momentum of of of world capitalism independently of them. Like they they gave up any once they took over the political level. Once they took over the levels of political power they did.

They gave up demanding control over the economic questions because the early the early versions of this like like robert taft opposed the marshall plan. He said what are we doing giving all this money to the. We don't want europe to go communist you. Cheeseball you're too stupid to understand this but by the 80s reagan carries out deregulation just like carter was just like ford was just like. Nixon was just accelerates the timeline of turning every american city into a bombed out rack and then just filling it with cops. He didn't do anything about that not a god he didn't lift a finger he cut taxes. He cut regulations and he got that money flowing up north you got. He redistributed that thing about the larger questions of like the global economy in america's industrial because it's all really about jobs and industrial capacity. That's what all this boils down to and and whether we're going to have a nationalist economy or not and the more advanced elements like progress as in understanding what they're actually fighting for conservatives understand that and now they're democrats and now we're seeing the final war. It used to be within the republican party now that they've defeated the republican party because the democratic party can only respond by going to the right with the republicans. As the republicans squeezed out the establishment. Like multilateral conservatives. They got absorbed by the democrats which of course is trying to also hold on to the left and we'll see how how well they do that in the fall they're probably going to do well because everyone hates trump but whether they're there for the midterms or something. I have. I have a feeling we're going to see just a accelerated version of obama all over again. Only he go he wins. He only wins one term this time.

So that's why ideology has to be considered in every question and you cannot like. I see a lot of people who you have a very like stiff definition of like capitalist interests and they'll say you know oh. It's not in capital's interest to do x y or z and that neglects a couple of things. It neglects one that even if you're talking about capital ed. It's most self-aware like international finance capital. They still have chinks in their armor. They still have things they don't know they don't know they still operate under ideological assumptions that blind them to the world around them and then and then at that level. They don't even have anybody to really rub against to to to refine down these contradictions because they're supreme they're masters of the universe. They touch nothing but everything falls before their hands so they'll never reform their contradictions. So they have their own defects in perceiving their best interest which is a which is a vulnerability. But then these people who are still captured by a lower level of ideological obfuscation stuff that used to be for the rubes. But then you know everybody started watching the same tv shows. The old guys were tired and died and they got replaced by new old people whose brains been cooked by online in the way that older generations of rich guys weren't and all of a sudden. They all really believed this and that's why you see trump do things that are like this is counterproductive. What is this it's because he's not operating from correct premises. He wants to defend capitalism but he doesn't know what it is. He wants to defend capitalism but he thinks capitalism is the american economy and that means he's going to make even though he's operating from the same assumptions as the global capitalists of the democratic party. Even though he's operating off the same assumptions. He's going to come to different conclusions because he is at a lower level of awareness due to a greater level of ideological mystification at the very hap level you know like that's why.

I think that the the lizard person metaphor that david ick came up with is very very useful and evocative. I hate that it's been so tainted by associations with anti-semitism because I don't think about jews as not human. They're the they're like the jewish tradition is the humanist tradition. Like that's. It's the threat of like self-awareness that runs through all. The it marbles all western civilization and provides it with any kind of texture and contrast. It's it's vital. I mean. It's it to try to antisemitism is just so stupid. I've talked about this. It's one of the it's one of the absolute number. One brain fails the way that you can just like quit taking the test and halfway through and just going out to jack off in the bathroom just pathetic lack of rigor to just stop at that. But but lizards aren't people. They're reptiles which means that they don't have a human. They don't have a human recognition of a recognition of one another as as anything the same they view us as different as a different species because if they didn't they wouldn't do what they do very simple to do what you do at a little at that level of power at that level of power because at lower levels every I mean everybody is exploiting to some degree. I mean I when I order takeout. I'm an exploiter you know when I when I buy a slave labor produced coltan. I am exploiting everyone is exploiting to some degree or another But these people are only exploiting and exploiting totally. They they have to have the same abstraction towards us that we do towards you know towards like primates maybe and not even the smart ones like monkeys and that is reptilian and the thing I just. I think the thing that I would add to the metaphor is that they're not like a race of reptilians that if you do enough of their ritualized violence to other people you will become a lizard like if I was going to do a movie or something with like illuminati. And I was going to have lizard people as the bad guy it would not be.

They changed faces because they're shape-shifters. It would be to change faces because they started off human and then at some point. They they they hit an inflection point of a lack of empathy which they needed to do to keep fueling their their behavior to keep convincing themselves that another computer disc could be worth the wholesale suffering that they unleash on the world oh. I'm going to play the stallot of david ick again still my favorite political song. I think this is the best song about politics ever written and it's a and amazingly it's acapella and I don't think he ever released it on an album. I have stolen my girl people keep saying the shunt.

What is that that was the last I've ever seen knew that her heart was the purest of pure through unbearable suffering. She would endure when she told of the lies and the hatred they spread and our blood of blonde children was used in their bread. So she opened their mouth to the cold lizard tongue that was speaking and code of the work to be done to make sure that the truthful are made to look mad and the starving fat ashes for which they are glad. Because their brain was a camera they just had to look and they said she was wise from the pictures she took which were not unlike anything you'd ever seen to be drowning in honey awaken a dream. The secret rulers of the world have stolen my girl.

They whisked her away in so that's the one it's really good and it basically anticipates pizzagate completely and that was made in that was made for the 2004 john kerry campaign for a collection of a cd of songs by different artists to defeat bush wah murders row on that album david byrne. They might be giants. Okay go when they were the big hits and they had that one on there but like he gets. He gets an essential truth that the q people also get to and that the reptile thing gets to which is to do what these people are doing to us. They have to be sick like that is the big refrain among pizzagate people right.

These people are sick and the thing is. It's true but who they think is sick are like hollywood. Actors who make like 10 million dollars a year you know like they think it. They think it's people because that's how they view the wars through a cultural lens to their minds. Like the guys they see on tv are the ones doing the evil because they live at that level of symbolic abstraction. Politics is the tv. The good guys are the good guys on tv the bad. Guys are the bad guys on tv so when they think of who is doing it. It's robert de niro. It's all the the fake news um anchors. It's all the actors like you saw the thing today of all. The all the friends people being secretly executed this month and turned and replaced with holograms.

It's just it's not being able to see the forest for the trees and so they recognize that in a world that's awful someone is responsible and that person is evil. That person has renounced humanity in a significant way in a morally meaningful way but who that is it's the bad people in tv because that's where they live and that's because most of them are boomers and that generation was the first to become fully mediated and it broke their brains and I think you can argue. I really do think that at some level I mean obviously there's a lot of when you talk about whether or not a project a state project a human project succeeds or not. There are a lot of variables and some of them are contingent. Some of them are completely determined by by the the very structure of the situation that they find themselves in and I guess you could say that like the emergence of first television and then the internet is one of those things that was going to happen eventually but man it really threw a wrench in the gears I got to say. I mean you could argue that it it accelerated certain processes of like of empathy building across cultures but at the cost of our ability to function as social beings which means that any like ideological or or you know social shift is totally secondary to that basic reality that we've been scrambled. We've been turned into the dreaded pringle. We are pringles trapped in a tube but I don't like saying that stuff too much because you just sound like a cranky old man. You know tells you where I have been since like the cops have started really cracking down on people's last time. I heard the helicopter that close I thought of goodfellas and this time I thought of fly apocalypse now when they attack the village so yeah and I know the younger people are so computer adept that it's it's. It's it's silly. You're essentially demanding that people go back to wearing top hats and cravats in terms of talking demanding behavior or patterns that are that alien. I mean it's a completely different thing. It's a different life. It's a different reality and we've never. I don't think we've ever really had that at least not that we can remember like culturally yeah.

Really infinite. Jest really did nail it because infinite just understood that that the solipsistic seduction of entertainment is incredibly powerful because it allows you to live a simulated version of the life that we are all thrust into unknowingly and unwittingly but on our terms and without negative emotional consequences and that is an insanely powerful seduction because life is suffering and it takes a lot of suffering to learn that that is all life is and then it takes a lot of maturity and insight or luck to find yourself in a position to acknowledge oh that means that I have to deal with that. I can't flee from it. It will come and get me and people get to that realization through repeated exposure to the traumas and horrors of life by seeking things and not getting them and then seeking things and then getting them and then having that not be sufficient. After a while the hedonic treadmill we spend enough time on it and we get to realize oh. This doesn't work hopefully not always. But it's a hopeful. It's a it's a possibility and it's it's to degree that humanity is redeemable. It's the degree to which we go through that process.

Nowadays nowadays dang it you can just opt instead for the internet and I did it for years. That's how. I know this is real. You can instead oh. I'm not going to worry about that stuff.

I'm not going to try to answer these questions of who I am what I can do in the world. How I can apply myself how. I can apply my mind and my soul to the world around me how I can reach out to other people and potentially be rejected and dealing with that rejection and building a strong enough self-image that I can withstand rejection and and being able to repeat come back after defeats and push myself. That's how we gain talent. That's how we gain wisdom. That's how we gain love. But it's also very scary and the first time you fail especially if it's when you're young.

The pain is massive and overwhelming and feels like it's the entire world and if you have this possible alternative to that where you get to build a life that has the same system of rewards and challenges and and satisfaction. But on a symbolic intellectualized level. A lot of people are going to take it. I'm not saying you'll inevitably take it but if that option exists a lot of people are going to take it and it's dangerous. It's dangerous because it means that people get into their adult years without ever trying anything like getting it by as little as they have to and then using the internet and video games specifically as a big like organizer to channel that unfulfilled human energy the remainder we have left. It doesn't get alienated by capital. Our our peace with ourselves is a degree that we can we can challenge that in a way that makes us feel like we're doing something useful useful to ourselves first and foremost but then at a certain level. We recognize that that is inextricably linked to what's best for everybody. Those are one and the same that we have to move any way we can to pursue that and I think that realization comes and I think the internet makes it harder but it also allows for things like I mean.

I wouldn't be where I was. I i. It's it's it's very interesting. It's a possible counter factual because the internet made my life harder and worse for many years and then even after the show was successful. I was also not very happy for a lot of time. I was anxious and I was uns insecure in it and I but I also don't feel like I'd be where I am now if it wasn't for that. I wouldn't be able to go where I want to go from here if it wasn't for that. So. It's all necessary you know. I think that's that's the power of of recognizing how important it is to drop guilt to not look backwards beyond recognizing our mistakes. We recognize our mistakes so we don't repeat them. But then we have to drop any kind of negative association and guilt around. Anything we used to we did in the past because it will just make it harder for us to think because it'll make it harder for us to really consider what we did and why we did it because we're not going to want to think about it. But if we rob it of that psychic pain if we rabbit if the ability to hurt us that we can really learn we can learn from everything and that means it was worth doing and that means there was a reason. It happened. It's it's it's if you can find a reason for it happening out of the mistake and that's easier to do if you don't wrap a lot of guilt and question and you know negativity around it.

We got some really nice dappling over here. I got to tell you guys there's some shaftage going on here. Some light shaftage going on by some trees really nice really very very pleasant. It's a good day yeah shout out to neil postman. I mean how could you describe what's happening more succinctly than amusing ourselves to death. I mean if if hypothetically and this is not going to happen but if if this coronavirus does push this rickety house of cards over this gigantic ponzi scheme.

That is the american economy it'll be because americans got so stupefied by entertainment that they turned politics. I mean it was not one thing or another while they were turning politics into entertainment. Politics was being robbed of its meaning by backroom deals between republicans and democrats to no longer talk about economic issues. But it was easier to do that because people were looking at the goddamn entertainment and they turned politics into entertainment and they put an entertainer in charge and he ruled the way that a senile television addicted any one of the people who watches fox news would rule and isn't that democracy democracy is representative government. The question is who does it represent and among those people the people who think that you know well you should really only be able to vote if you're a white landowner anyway. He is the perfect representation of them and he helped rule up.

He helped he helped guide. I mean obviously the thing is going to come apart one way or the other. We are in terminal crisis have been since the 70s trump has nothing to do with that. But he's the one who crashes the plane into the house of cards. It'd be very funny and very postman.

I think a guy like postman like he got considered hysteric and over the top and kind of silly when the book came out and I think that's that's the mark that means that you were essentially just too early you were recognizing what it was. Gonna come out and look like you could see where the tendrils were going to lead. But that led you to overstate the case to people who couldn't see that they would read you and they wouldn't think of what you were imagining which is where it's going to end up. They were thinking of what it was in front of them and they're like. I think you're overreacting neil and that's the problem with persuading people. Neil. Postman was like getting a bolt from the blue about where our where our culture of entertainment was going to lead us. But that left him talking to people for whom the evidence he's going to point to doesn't have the same implications for them because they haven't thought it through that well or they thought it through differently.

I'm not crazy. I'm just ahead of the curve. The damn joker you want to talk about a guy who was above the damn joker. But the other thing is in terms of the like. The mechanisms he's going to be behind the times because he was writing in the 70s or the 80s or whatever the techno like the internet is something that. I think even people who were relatively pressing about it back then could not have conceived of like even foster. Wallace's description of the internet is and he was writing in the 90s when when darpa had already existed and there was a primitive email is kind of hilariously old-fashioned somebody's saying.

I don't understand the awesome power of the federal reserve. I think I do but but that's what I'm talking about oh. I should say there isn't just a perceived difference in there isn't always just a perceived difference in um. In the aims of like the small. The small bourgeois republicans who now are in charge of the political arm of the party and the like the finance directed ones. There is like. I said a general like capitalism is what it is people who understand the neoliberal turn people who had the neil or had the ned baity speech given to them in in the in the 70s. Like that scene in network everybody in america got that in some way or another subliminally jimmy carter might have gotten it. Literally. An understanding of like your understanding of these notions is limited by your age and by your expectations until now we are entering a new era and the democrats assimilated that the democrats are that party now and now there is a remainder of republicans who are turning that way. Now what they recognize is that there's only one capitalism so you can't create it while maintaining capitalism is exist. You can't create the kind of authentic structure that these guys want so they are more correct that the capitalism's broad long-term interests are served by globalism by globalization but for certain small bourgeois that them over some of the but not all of them. Some of them end up getting bought out essentially and assimilated into the finance structure and then the ones who aren't are in a position to be actually just destroyed exploited and destroyed by finance capital. But I mean that's the same sort of conflict within the bourgeois that happens in every bourgeois dictatorship and that necessitates the state. That's why the state exists to play referee and two sometimes pick one over the other when they're in actual direct material conflict instead of just like. I was talking about earlier kind of illusory ideological conflict. So in this case there is a direct conflict between small american bourgeois producers who still exist and the global market and and that's true in different segments of agriculture and other parts of the economy. But there is no but the powers that be have decided ideologically that there's no way to maintain capitalism's vitality not internationally without sacrificing those industries and those people are either going to sell out and stay among the elite or lose out lose it all and become poor and if they're poor middle class. Then they're out of the club anyway and we don't have to talk to them. So yeah. No there is a genuine I i I i want to correct myself because I was talking about ideology and in talking about it. I forgot to talk about the fact that there is actually a material conflict between different segments of capital but that the fed and the government exist to adjudicate those disputes and the one that's always going to win is going to be the most powerful and influential and that's going to be the one closest to the actual spigot of capitalism. I.e finance wall street is something happening in the chat people seem to be fussing into feuding. I wasn't really looking. I was talking what's going on here. What's going on out here in this chat room now is there going to be a ruckus. Now now I i hear our heart told that there was a ruckus down in the comment section and someone oh they got out the federal reserve guy well. I hope. I answered this question or responded to his critique because the thing is like. I always find those fed people they're either like. I don't get what the point is there's two points.

One point is yeah. They're they're the embodied will of of established finance capitalism or what they're the jews at a certain point. There's no difference in the way you're describing them you're not even describing jews. You're just grabbing specific people in positions of super high power and then you just want to abstract them to have the level of like supernatural beings because you are not materialist enough you're near analysis. You haven't squeezed all of the spiritual due out of the toothpaste tube because that's that's what you're trying to do when you're trying to make sense of the world. Is you're trying to squeeze the ideology. The emotion the the bias that comes from living at the that the level of symbolic abstraction which we out the map the symbolic map that we use to navigate the real world 

We have to use that but I don't know what kidnap capital means that's weird does that mean like kidnapping jerome powell or something. I gotta say it's it's kind of amazing that since q is established and since there's been sort of a rise in lone wolf internet adult right wing shooters how come no one has gone after like a real an actual place of power you know no one's shown up at the fed world bank anything like that even like the closest thing would be that dumbass who like tried to go to cnn in atlanta which makes perfect sense like you think it's the media because you've got a dog's brain. But a lot of these conspiracies understand the role of finance and all this stuff and yet none of them have ever been afflicted by real psychos and even with the pizzagate stuff and the epstein stuff. All anyone wants to really yell out are celebrities. They want to yell at chrissy teigen and not bill gates for some reason. I mean I mean the degree they want to yell no. They do want to yell at bill gates but that's because he's a famous guy. Bill gates is just another celebrity. I mean I'm trying to think of like the the finance people like lex wexner how often do you hear anybody talk about that. Funded epstein from the beginning staked him gave him power of attorney when his only criteria or his entire career. At the point that higher was he was hired by wexner and given a yacht given a pyramid scheme that got his partner thrown in jail and that guy hired him and he's and he's in charge of this massive modeling and women's clothing empire.

He cia front airline that moved heroin through the golden triangle and moved cocaine from nicaragua. In the 80s. He webster not chrissy teigen even if she's involved in like the child eating. She doesn't even know where those kids come from. They just come down to shoot you're not even gonna get anything from her just shows how obfuscating all this stuff is oh man deutsche bank holy. Deutsche bank is so does anybody know what bcci bcci is banco and braziano does that that ring a bell so bongo braziano was the vatican bank that was used as a piggy bank for the mafia and gladio during In the 60s and 70s. Roberto calvi blackfire bridge that whole deal I've talked about it and bcci was another bank that was discovered during the iran contra hearings to have basically just been a giant pass-through front for cia black money like cocaine for cash then for guns for whatever whatever anybody needed and I would say that deutsche bank is that now when you look at their connections to epstein cartel's russian mafia big time. I mean that was that was donald trump's job not being on the apprentice his job before he became president was laundering russian drug money courtesy of deutsche bank so that's another reason that this the the conspiratorial term is inevitable and that's and inevitable given our love of narrative and and our atomization. But it's so distressing because just leaves you to just who wants to talk about some boring banker when you talk talk about all the celebs on the tv. That you hate all the time and that you yell at when they're doing all their gay rights. Bcci was connected to robert maxwell yes. Maxwell was connected to iran contra and the promise scandal which if anybody anybody read the 50 biggest conspiracies of all time a classic book. Also a graphic novel they talked that's where I learned about promise the promise software danny colisaro. His investigation of octopus that led to his suicide in a hotel room in virginia. Now he was he was like a zelig of 80s spook and then he just fell off his yacht.

The lady gazlane man. I'm very interested to see what happens with the gizlane trial. My gut is this is all limited hang out. It's the only thing that really makes sense but we'll see. I just imagine her like taking a a plea deal to go to a spa prison in exchange for just tidying up. All. The loose ends and maybe bearing one or two guys who like maybe trump has a grudge against or something and then saying goodbye other. I just don't understand. I don't understand when they found her alive. I was like well. I don't know that's a whole level of the simulation that I haven't cracked yet and the funny thing is you can't even say well. They can't kill her because we all know in our hearts that they could because I remember saying they can't kill him on the first episode of true or not. I said that they can't kill him and then they did because what are you going to do about it to kill her. What are you going to do about it. What you're going to lose faith in the government. Oh wow we're terrified of that. What are you going to do complain about it on twitter go to a do.

I feel like ed. Tom bali. I just feel over matched. Now. I feel good. I feel fine. I'm vibing. I feel like a good. A not a a not not a good version because I don't think. I'm good. I'm that good but like a non-evil anton sugar right now because I feel like anton kind of was self-actualizing in a perverse way and I feel like. I'm getting closer to that. He's a psychopathic killer. But so what plenty of them around oh. Someone says they've been watching lodge 49 and loving it good that show rips. I recommend it to everybody. I wish you got just one more season though all right. I'm gonna go soon folks. One more question oh just thank you for reminding me smoked. Pork was very good. It wasn't as good as wills but I didn't expect that first time trying at all It didn't have like the crackling outer costs that he gets but that's I mean. I was working with coals and first time ever so But now it was. It was juicy. The it was there was it was. I had some marbling on the flesh went very well with the hoisin and a little potato bun. It was good. I was happy about it.

I talked about portland at the beginning of the episode. Worst transformers movie great way to end. It's hard to say any call any of them bad. You know it kind of misses. The point of a michael bay movie. They're they're not to be judged. They're to be witnessed and let me think the second one is universally considered the most incoherent because it's it was interrupted by the writers strike and they essentially started because of how much it costs to keep that production. Moving. They essentially just kept shooting without a script which you could definitely tell and so that's usually considered the worst one. The third one's pretty good it's the most like all narratively coherent. The the mark wahlberg ones are both pretty good. The whole thing of mark wahlberg freedom from texas is very funny. I really like cogman in the fifth one and of course the thing where harriet tubman was a secret friend of the autobots during the antebellum period that was fantastic I guess that leaves the fourth one yeah. The fourth one is also kind of annoying because it's a no but the fourth one has stanley tucci and he does a great job. I guess two yeah two is the worst one although two has its moments as well. There's a thing where they have a giant evil transformer that's made out of other transformers that are all earth movers and construction devices and there's these two giant balls like iron balls. They use to smash wrecking balls. Two wrecking balls hanging from from chains at the crotch and john turturro is trying to call in a an air strike and he goes I'm underneath the alien scrotum and then what's even funnier is.

They use that as a moment to show off a rail gun which they use to blow up this transformer railgun technology which is one of those massive that doesn't work and then they make propaganda movies where it's like okay yeah. This might seem like a big waste of money but what if there's a giant transformer trying to destroy one of the pyramids of giza so that he can create grab a telemetry tracker and create a giant space laser to destroy earth. Then you're gonna want a rail gun. They also put the f-22 in the first one what if we yeah sure there's no real fights anymore. Air superiority is beyond established but there's no possibility of dog fights but what if there's what if starscream is there and starscream remember he's he's a very fast jet. We're gonna have to be even faster than him yeah. Just literal propaganda railgun's also used in the film eraser where they have a handheld railgun that like shoots people through walls and man. Schwarzenegger really knew how to pick them. The man was just a talent. All right guys now. I got you got me thinking about all my faves you know me thinking about my transformers movies so thank you I'm feeling good bye bye.
