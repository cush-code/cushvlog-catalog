The land of the midnight sun brother thompson gum for hire. Fighting to be done. Deal was made in denmark on a dark and stormy day. So I set out for biafra to join the bloody fray 66 and seven. They fought the congo wars with their fingers on their triggers knee-deep and gore days and nights. They battled the bantu to their knees killed them when they're living and to help out the congolese roll in the headless thompson gunner. Norway's favorite son his comrades fought beside him and owen and the rest but of all the thompson gunners. Roland does the best so the cia decided they wanted rolling dead that son of a man. Owen blew off roland's head rolling the headless thompson gunner. No favorite son you can still see his headless body stalking through the night in the muzzle flash of roland's cubs and gun through the london flash of roland's thompson gun. Roland searched the continent for the man who dot him in he found him in mombasa in a bar room drinking gin. Rollin named his thompson gun he didn't say a word. No he blew van owen's body very oh hannisburg you can still see his headless body stalking through the night and the muscle flash of roland's thompson gun the eternal thompson gunner sees wandering through the night. Now. It's ten years later and he still keeps up the fight in ireland and lebanon in palestine and berkeley. Patty hirst heard the burst of roland's thompson gun and bought it.

I'm back folks apologies for the extended delay. I do not expect to do as many vlogs as I used to I'm gonna try to do one a week. That's what I'm gonna shoot for right now But I do want to you know keep my toe into the pool to Keep. You know things fresh to keep the conversation churning and also to get chris his hundred thousand you subs youtube subscribers. So if you're not subscribed to the youtube channel for the love of god do it. The man deserves his big pointy thing his big right click button that they're going to give them the plaque that's what it's called get chris his plaque not on his teeth on his mantle but also I finally now have a setup that works part of the reason that it's been so long since. I've vlogged is that I spilled orange juice on my computer and had to get a new computer and it's been a bit of a struggle figuring out without access to any kind of technological capability how to set it up successfully. So when I was in new york chris helped set me up and now I've got a system. Here I've got a microphone. I have for the first time an actual webcam got a dang webcam not just the one that comes with the computer but an ex a separate bit of machinery. So everything now is ready to do point and click action.

It'll be much easier to stream so how's everybody doing how's how many people have omicron. You all got that omicron pack that strong pack. I'm enjoying mine. I'm pretty sure. I don't know might have it. I'm assuming at this point everyone has it but that's all right we'll be fine. I've decided to become um. I've decided to become a optimist having fun yeah like there's going to be a u.s military utility vaccination that honestly more people might take because of the way people feel about the military like if they could just brand it as like the q anon. White hat vaccine that was created by the patriots and not by the deep state people would take it. It'd be very interesting to imagine what happens with trump and his new pushing for vaccines. it would take somebody with sack and swag and the republicans to do anything with it though so I think he's still going to get the nomination getting that omicron getting that omicron getting that omicron gonna get that oh macron very excited very excited to get the obaron spread it as we all will in this dark winter that we're headed towards but aren't they all dark now right. That's why I've decided to be not just covet optimistic but just about everything optimistic. 90 of the universe is dark matter which is just another word for we don't know what it is our own minds are effectively tuning into a global frequency and capable of literally creating reality through the projection of reality that makes up our lives. No reason to believe that anything that seems immutable is such. Things are a lot more porous than they appear. I mean there's a new matrix movie for crying out loud.

I've been thinking about some stuff but at the same time I kind of want to just do a chill hangout to get back into it before I like really commit to some new heavy. Just doing a little bit of vibes right now but I'm sure something will come up hope. Everybody is having a wonderful christmas time. The spirit somebody says beard is amish I actually cut it. It was way more insane when we were on when we were in new york and I did the buffalo show in the new york show. It was like I cut like a whole hunk off oh.

I cannot play any instruments thank you for asking. I have no musical ability instinct ability anything and I i kind of think. It's related to my inability to grasp math and numbers. My brain is a very lopsided pretty useless really in any traditional sense. Not a lot of applicable skills. There's a great sandwich place in la called 

I think it's called something like it's gotta be the bread something embarrassing like that. But gotta say the bread very good somebody's asking about the amish. The amish are very interesting because they were amongst those europeans who really got what the recon what reformation meant because the reformation unseated a social structure a religious social structure that was the entire basis for the social order as it had emerged and sustained itself in europe after the fall of the roman empire and it's kind of amazing how cavalier a lot of the pro reformers were about that about the implications of that none more so than martin. Luther martin luther honestly thought oh we'll just allow our earthly magistrates to to act as you know community leaders and as the sort of localized focus of of a new civic order around religion but one that had destroyed the connection between social acts and salvation that had been the entire bedrock of catholic europe in pre-reformation europe. Basically nobody was imagined to go to hell. Hell was reserved for like heathens really and heretics and the truly like anti-social the majority.

The vast majority it was understood of people would end up in heaven that's what that's what purgatory emerged to to fill in the gap of to say okay everyone's going to heaven but obviously everybody can't go to heaven because then where's the social you know the social reinforcement for the behavior. We want people to carry out and that's where purgatory comes in and then you have the the vatican acting as a bureaucracy basically an intercessional bureaucracy that is allied to the state and luther blew that whole thing up and made salvation a personal question and I think I don't think there's any arguing this. I think a big reason for the 

The flippancy of a lot of the reformers was from the fact that they all genuinely believed that the world was going to end it within their lifetimes that they were in the end times. They believed that and they believed that the things they were going to do to create a more purified church were going to help bring about the end times and then the end times didn't come and you know. We ended up having to reaffirm our social structure on a new literally godless foundation which is nothing that any of the protestant reformers would have wanted but it's all we were left with the market replacing god and the amish were among those small groups of of europeans who saw the real implications of what protestantism was going to mean and understood that reforming the old early. Christian communal social order was the only thing that was going to allow a faithful community to persist. We're going to maintain that fusion of acts with salvation by maintaining a closed community that does not rest on a basis of exploitation. That's the key part because class society generates conflict and alienation and that has to be processed socially and that's what that catholic bureaucracy was there to do in the pre-reformation era. The only way that a a protestant social order could be maintained is one in which exploitation is abolished and that's what they did. Also another group that tried to do that but with a little bit more a little less.

 a little more frenzy were the anabaptists and I think the real distinction between those two groups is comes down to class the the amish. The mennonites emerged out of groups of people who had buy-in from local lords local land owners who allowed them to basically play at society on their property. That's how all those cloistered religious communities began with the sufferance of some sympathizing noble who was willing to give them land or if they were wealthy enough to buy their own land to work in common. The anabaptists were those people who didn't have the money to do that the anabaptists are the ones who had no land and couldn't pro couldn't conceive of getting land and fittingly they all ended up coming to one city together munster where they were able to overwhelm the local government and take control john of layton and his followers and they tried to create a a true christian community where things were held in common but they had no means of subsistence.

They had no means of production. They were in a city and pretty. Soon they were blockaded by the emperor's forces which meant that it ended up sliding into sort of a frenzy of execution of dissonance and sexual licentiousness. A giant orgy to go out to so and meanwhile the vast majority of europeans without knowing they were doing it just marched into the oven of damnation which is where we are now are all roasting comfortably or not so comfortably so anyway as you might imagine. I'm pretty deep into the research for the 30 years. Warp pod and I gotta say I'm very excited for it. I was very happy with how hella presidents turned out.

But I know there are things that I would have done differently now having done it. I I i mean. I'm sure that's true for chris too. Although I honestly feel like he was much more crucial to the success of that show and and was more prepared for it than I was so. I can only imagine that he's what he's bringing to the table for the second one. But I really feel like can really knock this one out of the park. I certainly hope so are people calling it cringe points god damn it how could we have let that there how could we have allowed that to happen damn it we left ourselves open.

Now that's fine you can all you are only free in this world. I think everyone understands that now if you have freed yourself of the fear of being cringe because that is literally the the chain around our necks as online citizens. I'm reading simplissimus right. Now that's one of the ones I'm reading is is grimmelhausen's book about the 30 years war which she was a soldier in anyway. I I I've thrown my body onto the grenade of cringe. I will be happy help. The theme song for god sakes we're coming out of the gate with a song that makes you want to kill yourself. Cringe is life cringe is living like the idea of being of avoiding cringe is the promise of the internet which is life without living which is being a mind experiencing a world but without the consequences of lived existence without the good or bad possibilities that inform our decisions just to be a translucent eye. that is the that's the dream of being based of being un connected to the consequences of life cringe is a necessary component of existence. The man who cringes with me is my brother yay verily okay. I say I i put up a new a little while ago. I put up a new post. A new piece of art here next to giamatti but you can't really see it with this with the overhead which is too bad because it's something I literally found on the street in park slope. Somebody had put out in front of their place for free a framed photograph of some guys in ski masks like loading a a armalite with on a table with a irish flag on it and it says written next to it's like dairy 1972.

You can't really see it though how by the way so I haven't seen the new star super spider-man movie. Yet. I honestly thought I was free of marvel but a movie. This big now especially when you see it literally gobbling up all business and all these other movies that were released by the way jesse hawkin on twitter is 100. Right about this all those movies from name brand directors that came out the same weekend as spider-man and got eight are all released from by were all produced by subsidiaries of disney that was disney did that disney lined up all those guys to get annihilated to get blown away by spider-man because they're literally sick of humoring film fans they want to end it. They want all that stuff to go to streaming and they want to make sure that nothing is profitable theatrically that is not one of the big movies that they're interested in spending money on because the returns all that stuff is chump change.

At this point they would rather it just be part of their loss leading streaming service still sure you guys can all do your little and you can make your shows but you make them for streaming where we don't have to worry about distribution. We don't have to worry about about dealing with some exhibitors. You guys can make your stuff for streaming. We leave the theaters for the stuff that we know can actually get a billion dollars back from and that we can set ourselves up to have like a guaranteed revenue stream from the ip that is able to generate that kind of money and I have to say I will. I will confess this and it is tough for me. There's a lot of great movies right out. Right now movies that I really want to see and yet. I find even my spirit leaving my body my desire to make it a priority to go and see it as opposed to wait for the thing to be on tv.

It's it's bad. It's it's not what I want things to be. I gotta. I have to sort of intentionally push myself to try to see good things. I think licorice pizza will get me out soon inshallah and macbeth too especially since that one see macbeth would be tough like. I ended up. The first coen brothers movie since fargo that I didn't see in a theater was buster scruggs because it was on not gonna. Happen folks not gonna happen not gonna get drawing the line for now anyway I'll probably violate it later but drawing the line at apple which means gotta go to the theater to see macbeth.

The line must be drawn. Here was booty oh that is such a bad take unless booty is good. I don't know. I think it's bad sounds bad. My contacts would make me think bad because like butt. But I don't know what the kids say these days.

I think it's one of their best movies honestly because it is. It's their It is a coen brothers sample sample case. It's like this is what we can do. These are just little slivers of what we can do and I do contend that the the romance sub plot that they got in the gala got rattled section is really unlike anything else. They've had in any of their movies which to to kind of put out this pastiche of you know your tropes and then bring out a new register that you'd previously not hit in any of your work. I gotta say impressive scruggs did not have josh gad how in the theaters. I haven't seen last duel either. I will watch both of them though for sure I'm intrigued by both enough to see them which is more than I can say for most ridley movies. There was no gad how dare you put infuriating. Gad provided the grunts and squeals for muncher. I did see that in the theater which is killing me and seeing all this garbage in theaters because they kind of do have you with ghostbusters. It was more I dug my own grave. I had talked too much about about muncher to not have to see it. I I had obligated myself.

I would absolutely not go to the theater to see the new matrix movie. I will be watching that at home without without really a lot of self flagellation I have to though before. I watch it. I have to watch revolutions the third matrix movie which I never watched because. I was a guy who of course like everybody liked the matrix. I didn't love it as much as some. I remember having an argument with a guy who said the matrix was the best movie ever made and I was like slow down and then like everybody. I was excited for the sequel and I remember being just so uninterested in answering the rest of the questions that I never even got around to watching revolutions yes. I am the architect that's the character I related to okay can can we talk about dune for a second here. I understand why people wanted to love that movie. I understand how they're deeply motivated to have something big and spectacularly that doesn't feel like the rest of that crap that feels like there's nutrients. But I gotta tell you that movie. The the villainy of dune resembled.

The marvel universe approach to filmmaking way more than a lot of people seem to be comfortable talking about because at the end of the day this is ip that depends on pre-existing understanding of the material and I know some people say oh. I didn't know anything about the books and I thought it was. I'm sorry. I refuse to believe that the way they refer offhandedly to all. This does not clank off the ear of somebody who has no context for it and then of course. You have the fact that the most fundamental fact the thing that undermines all those marvel movies at the base is that they don't tell a complete story. It's literally an ad for the next movies. The only thing that's insulting is that instead of doing the lord of the rings deal where they shoot the whole thing simultaneously and then chop it up. They shot one and then said well we'll see if they make enough. We'll see if you guys like it enough to make another one and then everyone's like oh god we'll go see it oh. We have to go see it. That's like okay we'll make another one. I'm a kind of a truther on that. I honest. I deeply believe that when they shot the first this dune movie they shot a lot more.

Footage they shot a lot more stuff from a completed second script and that when they get together to shoot the second one it's going to be stuff that they needed to build out that they didn't already have built and ready because it would just be an insanely uneconomic move to tear down that whole production and then put it back up when you know you're going to make another one and I am. I am largely turned off by the muted color palette of the modern blockbuster that is used increasingly to symbolize seriousness in a way that is very unimaginative to me oh. We can't make it too. Colorful people won't know it's serious so I thought it was fine and there were some great visuals in there and villanueva is very good with scale and he's able to give you the scale of herbert's world in a way that I think is something that I think that's what people mostly are responding to but beyond that it just did not hold me as an individual thing. If I i I i kept finding how you know. I was giving it more honestly than I needed to then. I should have because of my invested connection to the to the stuff you know to the to the ip to the ip really and then there are some things that I think generally really do not work 

I feel the entire conception of the harkonnens to me smacks of just the anxiety of influence like the characters. In the in the book are these outlandish villains and lynch of course makes them outlandish villains in his movie but because vienna wave has seen the lynch movie and his movie is by necessity a response to the lynch movie well he can't make the harkonnens big larger-than-life cartoons. They have to make them menacing oh. They're scary because they're quiet. These are supposed to be the bad guys in the story you barely see them. They make no real impression. This undermines the dramatic tension why am I rooting for the atreides over the harkonnens because they're less sticky. I will say that the best single moment in the movie and many have pointed this out is the xenon salinda secundus or whatever it's called with the sardocar with the throat singing guy with the mass sacrifice that is a perfect bit of world building. You don't have to set it up. You don't explain anything you're like yeah. This is a planet where they train child soldiers basically to turn them into urukai. They're making orcs folks on slender secundus. They're making orcs and what would it mean to make an ark like that you would need a a religious ritualized existence to impose the values. So that's how you get the throat singing guy great not enough of it I will of course keep watching that garbage but I have to say that it really did feel like a lot of people were wishing that movie to be more than it was and to be diff more different than other blockbuster fair that it was because they want something with some vitamins in it. I haven't seen the card counter yet like. I haven't there's a million great movies. I haven't seen yet and it's like because I've just got a dick. I haven't seen benedetta yet for god's sakes oh maybe i. I think I'm hoping after the holiday whatever's still in theaters and hasn't been eaten up by spider-man. I will make an effort to knock out some of these damn movies. Somebody says the harkonnens aren't in it that much up to that point when the first movie ends well once again. That's a problem narratively with ending it there and also that means it's more imperative to beef them up. You don't have to give them more plot wise to do but you need to make them more indelible with the time that they have the precious screen time they have. I did like malignant a lot but really only for the turn the first half was pretty boring and and then that big turn really. It does a lot to redeem what came before but you know at the end of the day you're still watching a half of a movie.

That is it's the knock off of every one other one of these. That's a really that is a good comparison those two because they operate in very similar registers but with like different points of. View I feel like verhoeven is I think the difference is really europe and the united states. I feel like carpenter honestly is more optimistic than verhoeven. I feel like they have a similar jaundiced eye. But at the end of the day carpenter is an american carpenter came from the country that won world war ii. There hogan came for the country that the nazis overrule overran where they deported all the jews they could find including the most single most famous victim of the holocaust. There is anne frank and put a v2 rocket platform in his backyard. I feel like that's the difference between carpenter and verhoeven but they're both great hard oh man gun to my head. I gotta go for hoeven I think just because of what what robocop robocop alone was one of the most like integral pieces of my like cultural software. But it's a close one and it's a tough one and I love that they both are renaissance guys because obviously john carpenter is a brilliant musician musician right like you look at halloween. Halloween is a great movie. One of the things that makes it great is its score which almost in any other horror movie is done by somebody that the director of the producers brought in as part of the clad collaborative process of filmmaking but with halloween that was carpenter. So he's got. He's a He's a musical savant and then you have the fact that for hoven my favorite fact of all time is a amateur scholar on the historical jesus who has written on the subject and gone to like academic.

 seminars and and been peer reviewed amazing give it up for folks. Your verhoevens your carpenters. I did see halloween kills streamed it and man they just forgot how to write movies at some point didn't they like they either. I wonder what how it works like the fact that you get sugar cubes you get critical sugar cubes for just spoon feeding. To audiences has made it. It's incentivized people not writing like a thing where you'd say okay. This is the idea we're trying to convey how can we convey it artistically that next step is no longer being made you're just like no we got it. We're telling them. It's about trauma good kills though some very good kills like when the guy's eyes got popped out.

But I mean part of it is that it's clearly now like anything. It's situating itself as the middle film in a trilogy and those are the toughest ones to write. I'm very excited for the new righteous gemstones oh my god. I just rewatched eastbound and down and my god does that show hold up. That show's so good now. I firmly believe eastbound down is like the greatest protestant comedy ever made because the premise is basically what if somebody could will the world around them the way that american protestantism promises and that's and that's kenny powers. He is literally god's favorite son. He is he is god's elect and the world shows it to him by his pure. Sheer will and belief in himself which is of course then belief in god and everything else.

I know who norman bethune is communist canadian communist. surgeon who was a field doctor with mao during the chinese revolution and did pioneering work with blood transfusions. I believe this is fun. I like playing quiz yeah. More questions should just be do you know who this guy is yes. He also served with the in the spanish civil war and donald. Sutherland played him in a movie donald sutherland who is related to tommy douglas the founder of the socialized medical system in canada gregor mcgregor. Of course the famous fraud and mountebonk who fought for bolivar and then tried to sell non-existent parts of central america to rubes in europe. All right someone's got me on one kimon georgiev. I do not know who that is you got me on that one if you want to tell me. I would appreciate it. I don't have. I can't i. I don't want to look on wikipedia while I'm streaming. I'm assuming. He's a russian. I'm pretty weak on russia before the 19th century. I don't really. I don't know enough about the false dimitri's and such was it. Murad is is the murad the only marshall who was allowed to informally address napoleon lanai ah damn it people. Now people are all asking about eastern europeans now to own me of course.

The jacobite rebellion bonnie prince charlie smashed in the fields of colloden which led to the traumatic highland clearances. They were the ones trying to put the the catholic stewards back on the throne after the glorious revolution which was the leveraged buyout or I guess like corporate merger. I guess you'd call it between dutch and anglo capitalism and which gave us the modern world that's the thesis really the culminating idea of the 30 years war pod. We're going to do spoiler alert is that at all oh this whole crisis of the 17th century where the demographic overhang of the medieval war period that occurred after the black death. meets the little ice age and you see a the general crisis across the the globe really as different societies try to contend with this and in europe that meant the the failing feudal order which is now being racked by. Not only consistent agricultural shortages but revolutionary changes in social technology like the printing press and most and also military technology. creates this new scramble for power in the end and in the end out of this small and medium state competition. The the best practices emerge the best practices for dominating this contest. Not the best practices for humanity emerged in the low countries in england and in different ways with different expressions. But they were all bundled together as a force by by the glorious revolution which of course the spanish. The 

The jacobites attempted to overthrow to bring back the old religion and the old the rule by the old landlords as opposed to the new bourgeois. But it wasn't going to happen. They weren't going to turn back the clock. Although I do find it interesting and amusing that there is a there is still a jacobite pretender to the english throne they still have a descendant who is the legitimate heir to the throne from the stewart line and it is franz vittels. Bach of bavaria who is also the legitimate heir to the widows bach thousand-year whittlesbach dynasty that reigned in bavaria before being overthrown in world war ii or world war one at the end of world war one somebody's talking about africa kwame nakama. They asked about the revolutionary first leader of ghana. One of the key post-colonial figures there who was like a lot. Most of those guys of course overthrown eventually in a coup with western support so that guy that franz wittelsbach is the because the the stewards eventually fled to europe and they intervaried of course with all the european royalty and so The the stewards ended up marrying into the fellow catholic widows box so that guy franz bavar franz is the legitimate heir to bavarian throne. England scotland ireland if you want to insist and if you believe that the united states is legitimately part of the british empire.

 the uk us so let's let's do it. Let's put him in charge of all of those and see what happens. Let's have some fun someone says who do. I think lenin wanted to succeed him. I think part of the thing that made lenin's last year so miserable and nightmarish as he saw his entire project collapse around him and that I don't mean that he he had he was condemning the soviet experiment. I just mean that he thought he was part of a revolutionary moment that was going to overthrow capitalism worldwide and it was going to resolve the contradictions of ruling that he had inherited by overthrowing the provisional government and for a while. There they actually thought that like in late 1818 when you see the keel revolt in germany. lenin was like giddy because he's like this is happening and for a while it looked like it might but then once once they lose the polish war. It's really over and and he had to face the reality of that and he saw the factions and the groups and the people around him and they were all inferior to him and they they were not going to be able to do what he could do. Because none of them were as good as he was as as as a complete a revolutionary and as a visionary of mind and a will as him. They all had huge problems. They all had huge intellectual and character deficiencies relative to him. I think it's pretty clear that he didn't want stalin. He literally wrote a letter saying hey watch out for stalin.

He's being an to my wife. I I don't think he thought trotsky had it. I absolutely don't think he did I know some people say it's a forgery whatever. I don't. I don't. I think I think it happened The the bucharan was the one who understood the moment the best in my opinion but bakarin was no lenin. You know. None of these guys were and that's why the only one who won was the guy whose skills were to be found elsewhere to be found in the ability to wield power because by that point wielding power was the only thing that really mattered because all that precious theoretical stuff was out the window. They were now in a fight for survival and I think the center of gravity of the party was not willing to do what bukharan wanted which was recognized that the revolutionary moment had passed and accommodate the demands of the peasantry which were the creation of a a capitalist agricultural model because that's what an uprooted peasantry that's their interests that's what they want because russia was this backwater that they had not been proletarianized. They were still connected to the land and picard was the only one who was willing to recognize that moment but he couldn't get. I don't think there was any way he was going to get full support especially when you had guys like trotsky who wanted all the things they were.

They're the lady who goes to the grocery store or the man who goes to the grocery store and says as the bagger is collecting all their purchases. I want everything in one bag but I don't want the bag to be heavy. Trotsky wanted yes of course. We need to break up the peasant economy and communize it. But we certainly don't want to have to kill a bunch of peasants to do it. Okay. All right congrat okay you and that is why his fantasy was delay the question until a intercession of some world revolution that for a while you could believe in and they carried out the bolshevik revolution believing in it. But by the mid-20s it was no longer happening world revolution was not walking through that door and trotsky could not accept it. Because to accept it is to insist on doing something that is in some way a violation of your principles. You either go forward with collectivization and violate your principles of human rights and all that that you really do believe in or you make a deal with the peasants you step away from communism. You you create you institute a market economy from the top and you destroy your principles. Your belief that you are in the vanguard of a world revolution and the all the underlying assumptions that go into believing that and he couldn't.

He could not choose. So he basically chose his own exile and I that's why to me. Bucharan is the most interesting of those guys because he represented the most realistic strain of thinking the one that recognized okay even if we can do. This. What are we creating by doing it and people say oh. They beat the nazis yes but what else how what after did they solve the did they what they ended up.

Doing is taking the idea of communism the idea of a society that is not bound by class conflict and is not riven with the social dysfunctions caused by those contradictions. They took it from an idea that could be pursued to a concrete reality in a place that is essentially the least hospitable for such a revolution. You could imagine because there is no advanced capitalist capacity being have been built up as it had been in western europe. People were still wedded to the land in a peasant economy and a peasant doesn't want to work more than they need to because being a peasant sucks. It is tedious unpleasant physical labor. You want to do as little of it as possible so you will aim for subsistence. Then you aim for subsistence until the political order changes and you are forced into the market and and and especially as you are exposed to potential labor-saving goods and household consumer items that you might want to buy and that will motivate you to work harder but it'll never motivate you to make grain for somebody in a city so that they can work a factory that you don't get. A cut of that is why one of the that's why the fundamental function of capitalism is that it breaks that subsistence relationship between people and land which of course is a horrible violation of the natural order in many ways and is a thing that we lost everything by doing we lost our ability to relate our human project to a human to a natural.

Like feedback loop. We are no longer constrained by the signal sent by every element of the biosphere. We're part of because we now live in a fantasy pseudo realm of the market where we are where the decision makers where the structures of power are completely protected from actual feedback from this from the biological structure that we're part of but. It was also necessary to create the modern world. The modern social consciousness that could ever lay rational claim to the machineries of economy and distribute things rationally throughout a human biological system that is part of a global biological system and yes. It was started long before capitalism. Capitalism is the final culminative action that resolves the contradictions of social orders that pre-existed before capitalism. It creates an entirely new set of contradictions but it solves the old ones like for example. The netherlands and england were the first countries in europe to solve the issue of famine in their social orders. The the periodic emergence of famine conditions whereby people can't get food for any money. Any money money in the world where they cannot eat where the money where the food does not exist to feed them that was a cycle throughout all and all it is a cycle in all agricultural societies because again the peasant works as much as he needs to that means he's working for subsistence and he's not building.

A lot of reserve. Also to technology doesn't exist to maintain and hoard reserves to do anything productive with them most in in a low level of technological development. Most agricultural surplus goes to waste and what that means though is that if conditions change drastically as they did at the little ice age in the 17th century all of a sudden you don't have any reserves you can't feed people and they starve capitalism. A a cat. A free market in in land tenure in england created a mechanism that compelled everyone who produced agricultural goods to do it as efficiently as possible to create the largest amount of surplus because if they didn't they were going to get thrown out on their ass and that is a social technology that gets people to treat their relationship to the land not as one of nourishing the body from the efforts of the of the body but of creating a rational factory process that results in agricultural surplus and by doing that they solved that problem they solved the contradiction. Now they created an entire new exploding set of contradictions that if unresolved will destroy life on earth or at least be the radical malthusian check on our run out of control system that say the black death and the the crisis of the 17th century did to feudalism and and early modern hybrid. economy now somebody says what about ancient empires an empire is an entirely different story.

The thing that differentiated europe for the rest of the world at this point is that an empire could not dominate it. It was dominated by small and middle-sized political units whereas the vast majority of the rest of the of the globe was dominated by imperial structures that reduced internal competition and it's that pressure that internal contradictory pressure that generates the innovations of capitalism and the thing that has allowed capitalism to develop this far and to blow by past. Marx's predicted moments of full crisis is because of fossil fuels and the ability to use fossil fuel technology to reduce labor to reduce the amount of real physically unpleasant work that has to get done at least close to metropole close to and in proximity to like meaningful structures of governance and control. Somebody asked what about peasant socialism what about the sr's peasant socialism. Peasant socialism will not produce a industrial economy and and therefore will not create a political economic unit that can compete with the other ones that are looking at your territory. Like it's a sexy t-bone steak on a desert island because peasant communism as the srs imagined.

It is also going to be not unincentivized to produce massive surpluses for consumption in industrial cities. It would incentivize that sort of amish like communal agricultural economy that's not gonna give you a modern state and at that point modern states are not optional and this is one of the key things about capitalism is that it's not just compelling the peasants right. It's not just compelling the tenants. It's also compelling the landlords. It's compelling everybody to do things that they wouldn't otherwise want to do the royal houses. The the the traditional dynastic rulers of europe did not want capitalism. They all resisted it in one way or another to the extent that they could. Some of them got their heads cut off. Some of them made accommodations and what happened with a lot of them is somebody got their head cut off and then the guy who came in afterwards understood what the score was which is essentially what you see in your england. During this turbulent 17th century. One guy charles the first tries to assert in the face of this rising power that is empowering people who are not part of the traditional elite influence.

 and he says no then we don't have a monarchy and so they're like all right fine well. I guess we'll see who's more powerful. It's like oh yeah. No. It's us. It's the merchants. It's the city dwellers. We're we're better than you.

Fancy fault leroy asses with your big flu plumed hats and your peasant levees so let me cut your head off. Now turns out those precocious english with the wild accelerant of calvinism which took all of the crisis that were genuinely being created out of the conditions and made them vastly more. high stakes and vastly accelerated at a time table of conflict cannot stabilize into a democratic system without a overarching hobbsian figure and so you have cromwell sort of standing in the breach as this king who isn't a king. This uncrowned king but of course that means it doesn't have the the legitimacy of a monarch and tumble down dick by the way. If anyone wonders why logan roy calls roman tumble down. He's referencing tumble down dick cromwell oliver. Cromwell's son who was supposed to follow in his footsteps but who immediately lost all buy-in from the elites was essentially paid to off. He said good because I did not want to do this. This is too much pressure and the thing is that's what happens with royalty.

They there is degradation generationally because they didn't fight for it. Oliver. Cromwell came up from the minor gentry to to kill a king that is a meritocratic machine producing someone capable of doing that his son was his just. His kid did. Nothing didn't have it and that's true of all these guys. It's the institutions themselves that keep it going and that institution was too raw so they brought back in the stewards but then you know charles ii. He's really happy to just basically but then james you know after that whole experience you can see why the stewards are more sympathetic to catholic catholicism. Since it wasn't catholics who cut their dad's granddad's head off and so james ii first is catholic but by that point the protestant the new protestant landed and merchant elite aren't having it and they literally do a job interview with the k with the the stockholder of holland and he just comes on over and of course.

The the misery and the pain of working to make this world didn't go and it didn't go away. It was a lot of it is now being felt by the by the planet and that we don't have to feel those people but a ton of it is still being felt by people. But those people are no longer the people within those social structures that built capitalism. In its infancy. It has been offloaded. Capitalism came intern to every social order came knocking on the door. The local elites fought it and then eventually capitulated to it. The elites are bought off. Everyone else has to to accept the new terms and the terms get worse. The farther you get from the establishment of capitalism and the less the conditions of the place. The capitalism shows up ha have adapted to the have adapted to the capitalist understanding of property relations if you don't have a fully developed capitalist property relation. Then you are jwf your jolly well and that means that you get capitalism and you have a social piece that is dominated by those within the system who benefit from it. The compradors and everybody else gets essentially the continuation of the most savage imperial forced labor but in a condition where everybody is being invisibly motivated and compelled by the market and and although there's still social compulsion from the state. That's not what's doing the majority of the work. It's an ordinance of private compulsion that goes from the private compulsion of the weird little calvinist in your head. If you're a member of the american liberal elite or a gun in your face. If you're a cobalt a coltan miner or a shrimp slave on a on a barge in the south china sea or in the middle. If if it's a big old pile of debt on your shoulders.

Everywhere along the line there is some force compelling you and the abstractness of it intensifies the higher up. You get. It's much more concrete at the base. But we won't ex but life isn't experienced throughout all these sections that that gun at the head is so far culturally linguistically geographically from the centers of these systems that the real horror and the pain is literally imperceptible. It can only be imagined entirely fantastically. It can only be imagined in the mind and you get to choose how much you imagine it and a lot of other stuff is happening in your life. That's a lot more concrete and real and it's pretty easy to tune that stuff out okay.

I've gone over an hour good talk feel like we covered. Some good stuff had fun with the quiz by the way you guys like doing that by all means just ask people who people are because I do learn. I see some names there. I don't know. I'm gonna have to look up this teemo. Gragoyev guy. Nobody told me who he was all right talk. Later bye.
