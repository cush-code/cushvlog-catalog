The size of the entire universe man usually kinda smaller man a powerful man universe man. I think there needs to be a rule about people talking about the gamestop deal. The whole reddit revolt against wall street. If you can't explain the ending of trading places you cannot talk about it. You cannot have an opinion and you sure try now. I will say about myself that. I know a little bit about a lot of things more basically the skill of a conversationalist. You know the ability to to have a conversation about something but not to really understand it or and provide insight about it. And I know a decent amount about a few things and then there's a lot of stuff that I don't know anything about where I wouldn't even feel comfortable bullshitting and the stock market is one of them. I am a congenital peasant.

 the one thing though that I will say with confidence definitively is that this will not lead to some sort of proletarization of finance. This will not bring down the overlords of wall street. This is essentially somebody counting cards to casino and you can count cards at a casino for a while but eventually if they find out that's what they're doing. They just kick you out and there's nothing you can do about it because it's a private printer prize and they can provi. They can decide who gets to go in or not and they say get out of here and so whatever is happening. Now one the vast majority of the money that's being made is being made by the demon class not by redditers. That's what's facilitating all of this. That's where the running is really going high frequency trading and the like and two that if it does provide any like destabilizing element that will be fixed they will solve it. They've already put a 30-day ban at td price on trading. Some of these stocks apparently water robin hood is down. They're gonna just change the rules because they're the house. Some of these guys individually might lose some money here.

But once the this leak in the system leaking the machines the the ship is identified. They're gonna patch that they're gonna put somebody at water seal. On there has anyone seen the commercial for this um. It's a super sealant that you could use to patch like you could make a boat out of it. They did that in a commercial and the guy who does the ad who's like the billy mays r.i.p. To a real one hype man is the most philadelphia accented man on earth and he just says the whole time is the water seal watch the flex seal. That's it flex seal. Their water is never gonna get in there. We're never look at the water water's not getting in here or there. Because of flex seal. They're gonna slap that flex seal on there and that water is not going anywhere because they are in charge. This is the house that's the one thing.

I know that's a great philly accent shut up water ice. The the watching though every like every doomed business model every like jurassic web 1.0 ass 20th century like buggy whip ass place that has just been like has a target on his back for the last 30 years and is now a joke like gamestop and blockbuster build-a-bear workshop and not obviously you know new to the list but a very late and dramatic edition amc theaters just watching them one by one get picked up. It really is like irony has taken we have an irony based economy now and some people. Some regular folks are gonna make money out of this for sure. Some regular old redditors are really gonna make their nuggies off of it and if they do god bless a lot of them are gonna end up losing money though and it'll eventually be sorted. The the the bug will be found in the code and removed flex seal fixes. The water so.

I would say if anybody's making money cool but for the love of god walk away from know when to walk away from the table. You never count your money when you're sitting on the count but like just hit. The button hit the button and get out of there when you still can because there's no way anybody who is not who has not sucked at lord epstein's table. If you know what I mean is going to get any of this real money alone summer's evening on a train bound for nowhere. I met up with a gambler. We were both too tired to speak and wedding finished speaking turn back toward the window.

Oh that's the end never mind all right so I wanna post you can only talk about the gamestop thing if you can explain the ending of trading places all right. I'm only saying this because I always kind of have felt like I kind of get the ending of trading places and I will now try to explain what I think happened at the end of trading places and you guys could tell but from that how far I am from being able to talk about this stuff like how about that as the rule um because I'm sure somebody in here has enough experience with stock markets or the film itself to be able to explain to me if I'm right or wrong. And if I get a bunch of conflicting answers. Then I will assume I'm right and that you are all just either trolling me or bullshitting. So we know at the end of trading places. Eddie murphy and dan aykroyd have intercepted. The crop report that the that clarence beaks was going to give to the duke brothers which was going to say how florida's orange crop had gone now if and by the way let me just say it's a parenthetical as as someone who watches movies that are made in 2020 20 2020 and 2021. Now for a popular audience the degree to which trading places which starred eddie murphy at draenei was a big movie and was expected to have a mainstream audience the degree to which it does not explain almost anything about how that stock check stock works. It just assumes that you understand it is kind of amazing like the central premise that the duke brothers can corner the frozen orange juice market as long as they know ahead of time that there will be a reduced number of oranges and therefore the price will go up because of a shortage like you have to know that and it's never really explained in the text and then the ending is completely unexplained. I really wonder I mean I guess it just speaks to like the charisma of those two guys and how much people love them at the time and you know of course. Jamie lee curtis's boobs that people just like allowed that to just go over their head whereas now everyone is so obsessed with understanding movies and our understanding of movies and our criticisms of movies basically come down to whether or not we think the plot makes sense having nothing to do with like did we like the characters or the tone or the performances or if it's funny. It's does it make sense so everything has to be spelled out for you like your baby. It's kind of astounding. I just. I don't know what a young person who's weaned on baby food movies does seeing trading places and as I said trading places is not a like. It's not genius film.

It's a john landis. 80s knucklehead fest all right so the duke the the re first we have the reality. There was no damage to the crops. They're gonna have a lot of oranges which means that if you knew that ahead of time you'll know that the price is likely to go down. So they know that but they give to the dukes a fake report saying that the crop has been damaged significantly which means that the price is going to go way up. So they send their boy to the commodities exchange in chicago. I think because they take a train. I think the commodities exchanges in chicago not new york. I think a lot of people assume that the end of that movie is in new york. I'm pretty sure it's in chicago right am I wrong because the place they go in um in ferris bueller. They I mean they're in philadelphia. Originally you know like the duke brothers are in philadelphia and they take a train at the end of the movie to like that's when they get the money from coleman. They go on a train from chicago and they never tell you where to they it's amazing. And I think a lot of people assume it's to the stock exchange. It's not. It's to the commodities exchange in chicago and coleman tells them my life savings. Sir please don't lose it all and they don't explain what to what they want him to do with it. They never say in like a movie would now thanks coleman we're going to take that and buy a bunch of orange juice futures now before the the trading starts tomorrow. They don't say that they don't tell you that they go in to the thing with orange. Juice futures that they already own them and then when the dukes start buying to corner and other people see them buying to corner. They all bid the stock up or the price up before the announcement. Now of course they don't want that to happen but a little bit of it is necessary like when you when you fix a fight you're not going to get all of the odds because the fact that you put a bunch of money on that side is going to get a few people to go with you and it's going to. It's going to um inherently limit it a little bit and like that's acceptable but then what happens is when they find out what happened with the orange juice oranges oh. No there's tons of oranges the prices that no one's gonna buy oranges for this much. There's no way people are going to buy oranges for this site price because there's so many oranges and that means everyone needed to sell oh. I forgot while they were buying when it got to the top dan aykroyd and eddie murphy sell all there so they buy it. They buy they sell off and get the cash from this huge sale of all the all of the orange juice they bought the day before and then after it crashes back down.

They buy them back and then the difference between that is all the money they made and how they get on the yacht and they get the lobsters and crack crab for dinner and then the fact that the dukes were on the other side of all of that trading meant that they lost all that money because they were doing it on margin and that means that it would it. It's all on the assumption that you're not going to have to pay it back until you do and then they're ruined is that correct. It's 80 cinema thank you not 90s. I got it. What's so amazing is how much of that is not in the movie at all. Like. Not only do you have to kind of understand commodities trading and the stock market you have to understand the story through implication like they don't then. Elliott doesn't tell them that they are buying them early. They don't say that they are holding them when the trading starts just narratively. It's astounding that they wouldn't add that like that's extra stuff that I had to add to make it make sense and I'm hoping that that is correct. Because remember. These are futures so what they're basically doing is they're betting on what people in the future will pay for frozen orange juice and damaged crops in florida means they'll pay a lot for it. A bountiful crop in florida means they'll pay less for it.

It's not bad writing. It's if it's it trusts its audience because none of that stuff is dramatically necessary or funny. It's exposition. It's unnecessary exposition if you can just do some job work as a mouth. They've turned this on to terry shivo's just getting nutrient sludge of exposition and plot stuff fed into us and how many movies have you seen that came on the last 10 years. I would like to see a chart of how often the phrase as you know has been uttered in films over the years and I have a feeling. It's gone up recently because that dialogue when a character says to another as you know everything that comes after should not be in a movie. It's absurd. These people would not say this to each other. It's going to be totally dramatically inert. This is not a conversation that people would happen because they already know this you have to show them through other means there is no patience. There is no expectation that an audience will have the patience to do that. It's not their fault. They're not dumber. It's more than anything to do with attention spans and the way that we interact with entertainment essentially as we're watching it in a way that we didn't used to we used to give things our full attention not because we were more virtuous. But because there were less fewer distractions that's it and so. I say how dare you to anyone who says that's bad writing because if I'm right and you're telling me. I got it right that's all in the movie. I didn't have to go to wikipedia. I just took my understanding a layman's understanding of commodities markets and stocks and and applied it to the text and I assumed the stuff that was there well. It wasn't there and boom. It's there all right. They do explain that yeah. They explain how the commodities thing works but everything else about the end of it. You have to intuit like the fact that they bought early and that they're selling it again or they're buying it. At one. They bought their but they're selling at the beginning stuff. They already bought and then they're buying it back at the end so all right cool. I understand the end of trading places. Then I get to talk about it. But I will still limit myself to what I have any confidence saying which is one. I'm not gonna do it because I guarantee you. I would lose my goddamn shirt.

I am a german peasant through and through I am a good time party german not meant for numbers. It's not what we were there for the germans they had protocol. They had proto-capitalism as early as they had. They had proto-capitalism in europe before the dutch or the english around the same time as the italians and like the italians. They couldn't hold it together because they just like they like having too much fun they like partying. I'm sorry They're not shivering their ass off in the bogs and fens and morse and and living in literal lagoons. Prussians are engineers. Prussians are like romans like it's all about engineering. It's not really about about like manipulating finance which requires a degree of imagination that isn't really part and parcel of that mindset. Yeah. Prussians are artillerymen prussians. They're bridge builders like the romans um anyway and no background in it family. I come from that the people who came to the midwest to farm and then eventually settled and just moved into cities to get jobs and then thanks to the large s of the federal government through the new deal and were able to get home equity for cheap that that's and then like without having to gain like a advanced degree or to hold capital and so not a lot of stocks trading any of that stuff pensions that's your number one source of like finance capital that you're gonna have access to and of course the equity in your home. So I don't know anything about this stuff. I'm not gonna to do it.

I'm not going to try to become a billionaire even though the idea like my god if I put if I just put a little bit of money. I have a little bit on that. At the early stages. I would literally be a millionaire right now and I could become the joker which is the only reason anyone should want to be a millionaire is to become the joker and instead. I'm not but it's like no no if I had done it. I would have done it in such a way that I would have it up. I have. I said this on last chapter but I've done several parlay bets where I try to do. I'm gonna hey. I don't like a better bunch of money but I'd like to make a bunch of money in sports betting you can't you don't really have that kind of layout. You know like if you bet if you bet on like small differences you kind of have to bet a lot to get any to make it worth your while unless the odds are good and then you know you need to know and so that's where you put in your prognosticating and every time. I've done it not only have I done parley or every time. I've done a parlay football bet which is where you bet like 10 20 bucks or whatever on the outcome of three or more games or the stuff in uncut gems those are parley bets and like if any one of them doesn't work the whole thing the tickets validated. But if they all work you get many more than the like. If you bet them individually like the the odds and every time I've done it not only have. I failed it. I got everyone wrong meaning that if I had bet the opposite if I had hedged my bets by betting my exact opposite. I would have made a bunch of money. I have no instinct for it I like playing poker. But I'm a bad poker player because I worry about the money too much it gets in my head. I I just have never been able maybe. I could apply my renewed zen. I haven't played sports. I haven't played I haven't gambled in a while so and when I ha and so I'm pretty rusty. I don't know I like the idea of gambling.

But I'm just too sweaty about it. And I think I would be too sweaty about doing any of this stock. So I'm not going to do it as one thing. I know the other thing. I know is. It's all going to end up fattening.

The the the goats of the same goat sucking scumbags who are in charge of us and that if there is any government response it will be to make sure that right the one thing that happens is regular. People are not allowed to do this anymore because the whole point of this and the whole point of you know what literally the point of us fiscal policy since the civil war when we have decided to establish a gold standard when we decided to say hey because they'd opened. The the the united states opened the genie or opened. The the pandora's box rubbed the lamp whatever you want to say whatever metaphor you want to use. They opened pandora's box of fine of um of fiat currency during the civil war because there just wasn't enough species or species around to fund an army and so the us for the first time published from a central not from like local banks but from the central government published issued currency. They were called greenbacks and they were backed by the bayonet of the. Grand army of the republic thousand which of course is always the case with money. It all ends up boiling down to the confidence of the institution that is presiding over the transaction that uses it that is that is what backs all currency.

Everything else is a abstraction to mystify that relationship because the more aware people are of that fact. The more dangerous democratic institutions are to existing power structures and people say mmt. It is mmt but the problem with mmt is that it is right but beside the point it's georgism. For the 21st century you will not convince people to socialism. You will not convince people not based on class interest but based on truthness of a theory to change things. Material interest is the only thing that will do it. It cannot be theoretical so yeah mmt is correct. I'm willing to accept that it is a accurate description of how money works beyond that. I'm sorry. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do with this tell everybody about it. Yes people are dying to talk about this. Whether acab is um insufficiently radical or whatever the have it around good but evangelizing it which seems to be the point seems to be to be just. It's.

It's the same sort of liberal socialism that henry george invented like I've. I've thought for a long time from my first really heard about it is mmt. Is there is the return of georgeism only. It's even. It has even less popular support than that because georgism actually did have significant um appeal electorally among the working class. The henry george made an amazing showing as gov running as mayor of new york against tammany and the republicans on the labor platform and people exposing georgism made inroads in the populist party and made-up members of the knights of labor and I mean it was actually persuasive at the grassroots. This is you talk about on twitter. This is mean politics even if it's true so anyway to get back to the point so they had exposed the naked raw nerve. They've exposed the bone of money at the civil war and they needed to to defeat the rebellion. They needed to summon the yankee leviathan even though they were all all the rulers anyway. It's not like they were completely opposed to the like liberal ident like um identity concept that the jeffersonians who ended up creating their mutant conf like calhounite confederate society. It's not like they didn't share their liberalism their essential liberalism their idea of like property being liberty and a lot property being inalienable by politics and that any politics that threatens the to make property alienable is by definition evil. They believed that that was and in the republic and then it's just that in the south that was an articulation that came from the jacksonian democrats in the north.

It really was the whig party before the civil war. You could really say that even though the democrats were the naturally hegemonic party in power at any given time in congress thanks to federalism by the civil war you essentially the the war you had. What what essentially happened is that the conflict that immediately emerged between the federalists and the the jeffersonian republicans at the beginning of the foundation of the republic that we had a series of compromises that maintained a political consensus government that existed but in at the level of political economy. What they basically the way they resolved that problem the way that the constitutional compromise resolved the problem was essentially to say through the mechanism of the states. You guys build your political economy along jeffersonian lines and we'll build ours along hamiltonian lines and by the end of by the civil war you have a battle between the the the wigs by that point like the wig american idea that came from clay and was articulated finally and fully by lincoln lincoln who was a wig before he was republican and who idolized henry clay. The south was governed by people at the state level who had come from that jeffersonian small radical small government hostility to central banking and taxation power and expansion of federal money and the war happened because these things became unresolvable at the political level because the political level it was always a situation of kicking the can down the road until the material conflict between the two regimes became insurmountable which is what western expansion did. It made those insurmountable and it made the political system no longer able to accommodate it that in a nutshell is the civil war. What what made it happen and so what the northern whigs had to do was create this federal machine and they didn't want to do it. They did what they had to do to survive but those guys believed in the centrality of property and it's 

It's equal equal equation to liberty and that meant that they could not allow a situation where um the the mob the deimos could actually distribute resources to emerge. They had to keep control of the money and so after a big number of series of debates and arguments and splits between parties and within parties there was a consensus to move to the gold standard and grant started that movement. It took a number of years because they had to like one of the big reasons that the period between the civil war and world war one is so economically. Stagnant is that for most of it you had this deflation first. They were literally taking money out of circulation to equalize with gold and then they were just not ever putting in more liquidity whenever the economy would shiver to a halt which happened all the time and that's why that's why silver and and um liquidity like financial liquidity became the signal question of the moment and I would like to point out that if people want to understand why we're in a situation where yahoos are breaching the capital and politics is a spectacle of mine mind-blowing insanity insane devotion to to cartoons to a figure like donald trump. Like think of this a game show host inspires the siege and investment of the us capital that happens in this country and I know we can joke about it but in american history. This is a an insane thing that happened.

This is a thing that even 10 years ago if you'd conceived of you wouldn't have been able to get your head around it if you really want to understand why that's happening. I would say take a look at a similar situation economically for americans around the turn of this century when we we're seeing the promise of american manifest destiny small liberal republicanism. The the the model that both jefferson and hamilton strove to were both moving towards in different with different methods because of different cultural conditions that were reinforcing and all that it could come a cropper it had failed. It had failed the vast majority and there was this insert. There was a politics that embodied that dissatisfaction and what was it its form. It was form was the candidacy of william jennings brian. The man who would not see us crucified upon a cross of gold and his campaign was around the issue basically the single issue of democratizing monetary flow in this country by giving by by essentially taking injecting liquidity at the bottom that's what it boiled down to and that is of course what democratic control of the economy will produce which is destabilizing for many reasons and you can say it's bad too because it like it leads to waste and over production over consumption and it's like yes if it's unmoored to class struggle. If it's more to class struggle. It can actually be useful and and create genuine conflict like between the democratic entity and the actual powers within a a social order and and that was the debate. We're in a similar situation now of our neoliberalized deal our post and in fact not even that because we still think we still imagine we're living in the new deal era. We haven't even metabolized how much of that framework has been destroyed because we don't really remember it but we still think in those terms. We still assume this level of of like socialization of re of of wealth distribution of wealth downward and it's going away and we're seeing it fall apart in real time. What was the presidential debate about what did the two parties argue about was anyone saying anything. I mean the for what was it two thousand dollar checks right that's the closest thing did any of them even talk about that during that campaign did that toilet because that question two thousand dollar checks is already such a grotesque diminishment of democratic horizons on the question of the economy to go from we're going to go from having metal gold as our bat as our backing of currency to a bunch of silver to reverse the leverage relationship between debtors and creditors which was the driving force of populism was debt. Just like debt is the presiding fact of american life for most people and what would we get whether or not to get a check and that wasn't even one of the things. They actually talked about in such a thing when politics is so restrained but our lives are so bad. How are we not going to invest all of our energy in meaninglessness in whether trump is president of course. That's how our politics are going to be organized at all levels. This is just an example and of course there's social s fractures that not exist now that are recognized in politics in a way that they were buried by those politics. That's true. That's always the case but it's our failures then that set us up for our failures.

Now it's just been one long slide but anyway to try to get back to what. I was originally trying to talk about when they re asserted the gold standard. It was to make sure that control of where the money goes. Investment is concentrated in these banking institutions that these people preside over not in the hands of actual people and that was the goal of post-war monetary policy to keep the money where it's going because it was a giant continent that was just waiting to be inve invested in to produce massive profits. Yes. It was settler colonial expansion genocidal expansion of course but to the people within it. It was not that it was manifest destiny and they were they had the capacity within themselves to actually democratize investment can't have it and so in this current context.

If this is like the the that oh another one of those openings one of those apertures my god maybe we could maybe if it's maybe if the only thing we have is is market speculation. Maybe if moving numbers around on a piece of paper is the only thing that generates economic activity in this country which it is. It's a totally financialized economy. It is all not the speculation. It's it's a it's a minimal amount. It's a sluggish amount of real economy and trade on which has been stacked an infinite level of micro transactions and swaps and encounter swaps and speculations and futures bets and cdo's blah blah time not investing in the time it takes to get a thing from one place to another not any of the actual production of it. If that's all we have why why can't everybody do that why couldn't everybody be doing that instead of it being funneled through wall street so that all of this money all of the excess part. All of like the transactional element of it is instead of being concentrated. There distributed universally not equally but closer to and allowing people to invest in actual productive economy. Maybe around them oh can't have it can't have it and so it's gonna get the hook one way or the other oh yeah. Someone yes exactly like the thing that generates economic activity.

Right now is our collective consciousness. It is our memes it is our culture. It is our anxieties. It's us it is we are just the brain in the jar. The body is the rest of the world working and toiling to bring us things. We're just supposed to think about them. We're supposed to interact with them synthetically and interacting those things with things real things synthetically at the end of the chain of resource are of um supply that is the economy. Here we are just the neurotic consciousness of the world economy. We exist to think about everything else that is being produced to interact with it by buying and selling it and talking about it and spectaclizing it and turning it into social life turning transaction into social life and that's that's the actual state. That's what the american economy is which means that it really could be democratized theoretically but of course how could it be done.

It could only be insisted on from the bottom but if it was insisted upon it would be re. It would be resisted and that resistance if it did not succeed would eventually become hostile and you would have class war that's the thing that the mm tears and the georgeists and the the cod gramscians who think that you can march your way through institutions and then just flip them over fail to get is that there will always be a point of maximum conflict a point of genuine a point a point in a conflict when a existential question emerges. If this conflict is from the point of view of capital. There becomes a point where any further um any further submission because of course you will submit as much as possible because coming to final conflict is no good.

It's wasteful but you only do it as much as you need to and that changes depending on the force of your opponent like the new deal happened. Because capitalism had had to make a deal. It was not sustainable anymore in given how much popular organized opposition to it existed and so the new deal was it was set on the terms. It was an advantage to the working class as you wanted to buy by the leverage. The working class had in the situation when a new crisis emerged in the 70s that working-class leverage had been completely hollowed out and it was like termite. It was like they had a big siege engine. Just got eight by termites over 40 years and those termites were prosperity. They demobilized the working class and turned their politics cultural and so when it happened to happen behind the scenes and there was nobody even there to press the point and so we got this if we get to another conflict point. Because things get worse and and that fat and happiness that sedative of prosperity that we had been narconized with wears off.

There will come another point of conflict and within that you get up and within that context there becomes a point where if capital gives up anything else it will cease to have internal coherence and it will be vulnerable to actual threat and if that and that can't happen and so at that point real force is exerted and then the opponent the working class whatever you want to call it has to make the decision whether they can win that fight. This is why I said if the german working class had been organized the way that the bolshevik party was but of course they couldn't be because of how successful they'd been and how advanced the capitalist country. Germany was the bolsheviks succeeded because they were in russia not because of their ideas. Their ideas were perfectly fixed. Their ideas were perfectly applicable to the situation of the russian empire at that point but they were not transferable because the situation didn't obtain every there but there was sufficient organization and and counter hegemony within the german working class that if they had been aware of that they had reached the end point of the bernstein kowski road of reform by after which capital could no longer make concessions if they had been all aware of it. Then they would have been able to make that moment the final conflict and that point will always come and I would say that democratizing our finance industry which is all that we have which is the brain stem of not just american global capitalism that they're going to democratize the system of that.

It cannot be allowed and no amount of convincing people about mmt will get you. There only class organization and class mobilization and militancy will get you there somebody's asking about irish unification. I I talked about it a while ago and said that while I think it's cool. I don't really think it's possible but somebody dm me to say who's in ireland and and is following it closely and say this thing could actually happen that it's not crazy to imagine a unified ireland thanks to brexit which hey you know. What wouldn't it be cool to have a big thing happen in the world that wasn't just awful and depressing wouldn't that be great and especially if it's because the dup psychos were too psycho and we're like we can't just insist upon like adhering um psychotically to the great britain. We have to out blimp the blimps in our devotion to some pigheaded national economic nationalism. That's totally you know lost. It's past itself by date and then doubling down on it and then driving out all of the moderate reunionists just like in the exact same mirror way that our republican party is operating because the one place where reactionary politics are most similar to the united states is in northern ireland. The irish unionist community there is the closest culturally politically to ours of any right wing anywhere in the world.

I would say they are young earth creationist anti-abortion neo-confederate psychos. I saw when I was in belfast and I went to the shanghai chancel road. When I went to chanco. I saw one of the housing estates. They had a james buchanan on the side of a building and of course. All of the they had scotch irish generals of the confederacy but of course what's sad is that our left. Politics could not be further from nor that northern irish left politics because we're all settlers. We're all ulster scots we're all presbyterian psych blood drinking is an irish catholic. You are you're a hun you're a goddamn orangeman. We're all orangemen. Australia is pathetic because like they're clearly trying to be like us. They're like doing it on purpose. It's kind of self-conscious but the do you the scotch irish psychopath snake handling maniacs. They're not doing it for anybody. They're not trying too hard. They're just trying it. They're they're galvanized. They're not these outer wastes and you get to just get shit-faced and crush tinnies and flip-flops 300 days a year. Until of course. The place literally becomes uninhabitable in 20 years.

No no no the canadian right wing the american right wing are cut. Our australian right wing are cocked versions of america's right wing honestly. America's right wing is a cucked version of the northern irish right wing. That's the real steal the they were queuing on before queuing on ian. Paisley tried to punch the pope at the european parliament. I'd you know if you yeah did you guys everyone know that he had to be restrained. Of course. It was like hold me back stuff but he actually like tried to do a citizen's arrest on the pope that is some margaery taylor green. John paul the second for crimes against the people for tiddling allah's kids. I and pierce they place you john paul ii under arrest yeah. We're cocked versions of them man but no australians. Canada cut versions of us and the irish irish version of us is maybe the most cuck people on earth holy.

They literally almost destroyed your country do any of those of course. They don't they can't read but those ukrainian nazis should really take a look at aust plan which was herman goering's plan for ukraine and. Eastern europe after the war which was to redirect agricultural output in such a way to essentially enslave like 20 of the ukrainian population and have the remaining number die of starvation that was the nazi plan for ukraine. You take the holodormo whatever degree to which that was real and it was. There was mass death in ukraine after stalin took power. That's fact what it was a combination of a bunch of factors definitely including bureaucratic incompetence. And unnecessary violence national chauvinism. All the evils of a colonial administration that was continued even though there had been a change in government because you know colonial administration is colonial. Administration and ukraine was them. It was a minority within the russian empire and then of course though the main thing though was a genuine. Famine which had cyclically hit that region throughout its generation until modern ecological technology changed that agricultural technology caught up and changed that dynamic that was a step and that was the main driver of it but whatever degree the soviets were involved would have been a drop in the bucket to what they were going to do to ukraine.

If they won the war. They would have kept a few of people to be basically like draft animals in little neocon feudal. Like village castle grounds they were gonna recreate medieval like the old they were essentially trying to recreate the old teutonic knights domination of old prussia like that's what they were trying to recreate when when the when the when the when the teutonic knights went from jerusalem got kicked out after the crusades had nowhere to go didn't want to go home had nowhere to go to because they were all disinherited second sons. They waged a holy war against the remaining pagan population of eastern prussia and lithuania and that crusade was very successful and it led to the extirpation of the the of paganism. The replacement of it with catholicism and they were the it was essentially a confederation of like landed knights who had feudal estates where they had slav serfs and that would be what they were going to create in ukraine but it would have required way fewer hands than they wanted. Then they were way fewer hands and miles than it currently existed because they were going to intensify the surplus and ship it all to germany and so the easiest way to deal with that is just to deprive them of the food just take it from it way more systematically than stalin ever did that was the plan and it was. They didn't do it because they lost and these are out there waving nasty flags like I wish you guys had genocided me cucked but this is the thing there is nothing to respect about about any of these reactionary movements.

There's no the thing that people get caught up with a little bit. I think well-meaning people honestly you know ambiently racist white guys who might be persuaded to be more democratic or to be more egalitarian but like are just driven by their cultural context to you know respond to this kind of stuff the thing that is romantic about it and that speaks to people in a way that the left doesn't is that rootedness is that futile sense of a social reality that transcended the market and that no politics which all left politics are which is multinational. Multiracial. Egalitarian can maintain those local rooted things because things like race and class race hierarchy race racial awareness racial distinction. Those things are part and parcel to those local regimes of control and they are the things that people respond to through the echoes of history and they see the left and they see nothing there that can maintain those things and in fact it requires that all remaining bonds be dissolved. But that's the degree to which I can sympathize with any right winger who who comes to the right through that through that reasoning and some there's some I will. I will roughly say that that is an appeal that exists and I think that the question of who those people are and how to talk to them is one of the central ones that is dominated like the neurotic online left because so many people who are online are these people are these you know highly alienated but acculturated white men.

Those are the people who don't who have the time to sit on the internet are alienated enough to want to spend their time doing that and so they're considered up for grabs of course. The fact that they don't really stand in for any greater number of people and they stand in for people who by and large are at least connected to the productive economy which needs to organize before anybody else in order to really challenge capitalism that they are essentially irrelevant like we're talking fail sons neets and people who have office clicky clack jobs or fake jobs and those people no matter how much they feel real and feel like the sum total of like the political consciousness. In this movie. In this country they are self-selected and they are disconnected from the people who have made the conscious choice or unconscious choice to realize. Politics is and they just need to live their lives which is the majority of people who are closer to the bone who have less time to sit around and worry either behind a desk at work or behind a desk at home looking at a computer either way. They're online either way. They're whether they have a job or they're unemployed whether they're in the pmc or their Whatever they're somewhere there and of course this isn't all of them. Plenty of these people have like real jobs but their social milieu is going online to post about politics but the problem with that reasoning the flaw in it the reason that I cannot countenance the right on any terms. Even its most romantically you know pre-capitalist is that that doesn't exist anymore man that's gone. It's like salazar's regime that was built on top of a literal like the wreckage of a failed modernism. Like portugal was one of those countries that tried to keep up with the capitalism and looking at coins all day like some dutchman who lives in a face in and we're basically living in the ruins of feudalism. Oh yeah you. We can create some sort of integralist thing even though of course it wasn't even true. The guy's article is concentration camps. They tortured and murdered communists all the time they were insanely repressive and they were rage colonial wars on a massive scale which he also doesn't talk about but anyway.

Now that's gone man. There's nothing you would be building from the rubble of american liberalism into your imagined like embedded social organism that can like achieve homeostasis with its natural environment instead of being constant conflict with it. It's not exist. It's a bunch of boat owners and not just boat owners watchers. It's a bunch of it is de-culturized. Atomized. Consumers fully stripped beings who do not have any shared anything beyond their understanding of culture and identity through spectacle and then wiring it through their personal desires not through any alienated sense of spiritual connection to anyone outside of themselves all of our ideas about religion and place and race. All these things that are gonna that supposedly are going to hold us together against the storm of neoliberalism. They are on. The they are all embedded in the the quicksand of atomized neoliberal subjectivity. No matter what these people think when when the when they these guys imagine these ideas these rooting concepts. They imagine them being the thing that transcends selfishness because what is the question of politics right now on the left and right. Then how do we feel how do what we have essentially realized everywhere is that if we just let self-interest govern things through a network of you know facilitation of transaction. Selfishness will drive us to destruction because the al we will alienate ourselves from each other every day and the only thing that will be able to fill the space will be consumption and that is incompatible with the tap on the brakes here collectively and there's a bunch of ways. People say to do that just kill half of the third world echo fascism people want to say and then of course you have the liberal response how about let half of the third world die which will be less mean and require us to have a less core civic social order to facilitate that level of conscious violence.

But another answer is have there be something other than the market to determine our social activity for the love of god demarcatize. Some things return to us our unalienated lives to some degree and the thing that does that in the imagined societies these guys have created in their heads. Their their ideal idea idealized feudalism pre-modernism pre-liberalism pre-judification of world pre-sissification of the world pre-solification of the world. The thing that gives it is belief. It is belief in yes god but god is an expression of a social life that gives one meaning and purpose beyond oneself indulgence and that those ideas are invested with that and that's what gives it. As cohesion. It took generations and generations in the black death and a bunch of other to dissolve that and replace it with selfishness and self-interest as the soul presiding source of um self-direction. I guess that we can only be sincerely driven to self-interest. We cannot be sincerely driven to subverting to sublimating our self-interest into others because we don't feel connected to one another to put it bluntly that connection has to be built. Rebuilt reforged can only be done by continuing to move through the dialectic stages and contradictions of capitalism and gain the technological sufficiency and concentration of capital resources to solve problems of resource scarcity and to distribute and to relieve pain to relieve pain to allow people to live and to find meaning outside of transaction and consumption and that is the work of the left and the your most your most sincerely hearted neo-fascist of course.

He's racist but he's racist because like look he'll talk you for 20. He'll he'll talk you into it in 24 hours. Why he's not technically racist and in his mind he doesn't think he is and it doesn't matter if you're saying. But he he is. He's lying it doesn't matter you. There's no judge to say because you're right that means anything. He's still a force in the world. You have to contend with just saying. It's not. No. No you're fascist you're racist it doesn't work because they've worked it out for themselves while you're wrong just like. I've worked it out for myself when a right winger says. I'm wrong and I'm not going to change and that's that means that you have to be challenged and not defeated on the level of arguing someone out of these beliefs but in providing a context and a movement that can give people who would otherwise make that choice another pamphlet about joining the dsa. No if you're doing that you're gone. It's about what is what where are people being sucked and what is sucking them there and one thing that's sucking people off. In the direction of this reaction is the fact that they do have things in their social world that they do think that they that that means something more than the market. But they aren't. They're all are. They're all just symbols. They they don't signify the emotional connection of a pre pre-capitalist subject and so when people get to work just like on the left when people get to work the sum total of their work in the absence of meaning in the absence of spirituality and the abs in the absence of belief powering. It is self-interest look at the embezzle money from some fake gofundme. They were running or.

They were doing um. They're doing some sort of social media scam. They're all picking each other's pocket like frank. Zabotka said that's all of us we have to forge a new social consciousness not before we do anything but in order to defeat capitalism which we all agree must be done and beyond that there's a simple fact that you don't have the numbers chumps. The working classes only weapon is numbers and the fact that the thing doesn't work for now although the technology is being created to make this no longer true. That's the point of silicon valley. A material point beyond people getting their beat whack beak wet and keeping the money flowing. Silicon valley exists to make it so that in the near future they won't need us that's it and then politics can just be deleted from the program politics. As such there's just corporate relations. You have an hr director instead of a representative in congress.

Just they zero that line out if they can get that sufficient technology now of course the race for that technology is a race we're both in because if that is socialized if those technologies are socialized we could actually build the thing relieve. The pain relieve the source of the retreat to hostility and violence and othering the gen that powers these. This politics primarily and and makes it impossible to create class solidarity and your racist. It guarantees that you're only going to get white people or at least white people and a nice chunk of like assimilated into whiteness people that ain't enough and the same way that any like. That's this the that is that is black reaction. It's black reaction but we code it through a left lens because the way that race is politicized in america like blackness is politicized in a way that no other it is polarized. Black identity is left at a semiotic level so the black reaction is hard to see sometimes and and that and that whole thing is black reaction.

And it's the idea that we're going to protect our identity within this thing within this capitalist system and once again. The people who are actually mobilized are the people who have some degree of capital within it. That's who is able to be online. Those are the ones who have capital to invest in in media ventures and political ventures. The ones who are able to assess some level of ascension in the pecking order of capitalism. Even though they are you know held down generally by their racial category. You're going to get reparations but have anywhere near the the power to offset the advantage. The capital has okay did any of that make sense I hope so good yeah. I thought this was a good one. I felt like. I got some useful stuff out of this. I do I do hope we see irish irish unification. I will say one thing if there is people worry like will. The troubles start up again with like the dup and those guys pulling their guns. All the people who really care are our mega people and the guys with guns are all just selling fent. Like all those loyalist gangs. Just are drug dealers.

Now they're fat they're just too tick-like. They're not. They're not. Gonna have that they'll be a little bit though. But they wouldn't do. They wouldn't do the whole thing yeah. Marjorie taylor green is basically a dup member of parliament. She by the way could very well be that the if I don't know what's going to happen with trump like he seems like there's a very good chance that he might just shrivel up and die. He just was that broken by this but he could come back can't say but if he doesn't she could fill that hole. I think even more than bobert especially since she has a much more like incendiary record. Like all the shit's getting brought out about her and the thing about it is. The liberals are all thinking oh enough of this is going to come out and then she's going to have to resign. I mean I'm assuming that's what they think because or or what do. They think they're going to get the house to kick her out if they think nancy. Pelosi is going to expel a member of congress for stuff.

She said they are insane but even if they did it she would then be a martyr and that is what you want to be. If you got to become famous on the right. Becoming a martyr is one of the best ways if you don't have your own tv show already or she's gonna go to jail or something yeah. I'm sure we need to hold her accountable folks yeah. We'll hold her accountable by making her like the vp. Of my pillow guy. There is no chance that we can unite with the barons. The barons are our enemy theirs.

They're more committed to maximalist capitalism that their deepest commitments are to capitalism. Their essential argument is if the whole thing breaks down and we have to go to like a hobbesian state. I would rather build up from that and try to reassert like my my previous privileges under the magna carta then a seed to like my power slowly being attenuated by by a dot like the eventual assimilation into a global capital market they would rather. They preferred like none of them were going to get none of them none of the guys who all of the guys at the top of the confederacy all of the big landowners. I'm sure a lot of them were very leveraged and indebted and needed to keep you know. They needed high cotton prices and in order to sustain their incomes but a managed a managed end to slavery a managed climb down from slavery. The kind that would have happened if the republicans had been allowed to govern if the republicans had been allowed to govern if lincoln had been allowed to govern without the confederacy being created and westward. Territories were where the the the extent of slave territory in was defined that would have caused a collapse of some sector of like the the cotton economy if it had eventually happened but it would have been over time and those at the very top would have been able through increased markets. Increased increased access to to credit instruments and bonds and all the goodies that come all the investment grade goodies that come from a diversified economy and they could have climbed down but they wanted to keep it because it was more than just system of government.

Because these things become fused with our essence. They are inextricable based in superstructure. At the end of the day are the same thing when we talk about them as different things we're not talking about them as if they're occupying different spaces we're just talking about direction of action. It's like one big muscle fiber where what direction is. The is the impulse going that's the only thing that base superstructure refers to and so change happens when these moments of crisis come where compromise is no longer possible and these boat owners. These these barons.

Their threshold for compromise is lower than global capital because they hold tighter to the social element. They hold tight tighter to the social dimension because they are more socially embedded so they will never give up their power they will have to be defeated. They could be maybe utilized but only from a third angle not because once if you lie a lie with them you guarantee that your base will be reduced because everybody is operating in this cultural context and it is unreasonable to expect people of other racial categories to watch people ally with expressed people who express as part of their politics. A hostility that is racial that is that is xenophobic that's unarguable and people will be turned off by that you will reduce your number and I say it's not necessary and in fact not only is it not necessary. It is wildly counterproductive. I will vote for barron. He is the false dimitri who will true prove to be the true heir. One day he will emerge and set right that which was wrong. He will be our apologies.
