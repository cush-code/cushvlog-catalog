Metal band out of that or a couple of guys who've been friends since grade school one was named Cyrus. The other was Jeff time all that day. In Jeff's bedroom death metal band ever Denton never settled on a name for the top three contenders. After weeks of the day were Satan fingers killers in the hospital bombers last type of death metal band out of Denton but Kevin Cyrus believed in their hearts. They were headed for stage likes and leader Jets and fortune and fame so in script that made prominent use of a pentagram. They stenciled their drum hats and their guitars with their names and as Osiris got sent to the school where they told him he'd never be famous. That's how he wait Jeff and the letters he'd write to. His friend helped develop a plan to get even when you punish a person for dreaming his dream don't expect him to thank or forgive you best ever death. Metal band out of Denton will in time both our pace and I'll live you hail. Satan hail hail tonight hell saint hail hell. Hey folks. This is going to be a short one. I don't have a lot of time. Gotta record. Some stuff later squeezing it in because I want to get something in this week try to keep up a pace once a week because I want to do another book.

As I said that I have not yet decided on but when I get back from my Florida Florida next week I will pick one and we'll say what it is blurred yeah. First time in the tip never been to the tip never been to the sensitive glands of Florida before only the shaft I've been all the way in the middle of the shaft and up into the The hmm is the panhandle. Panhandle is not the scrotum right but it's not the taint either there's no scrotum. This is the problem what's the panhandle of it. See if it's the taint. Where's the balls. This is the problem I guess the root. All right people are keep insisting. It's the taint even though there's no balls between it and the rest it goes shaft. It goes straight to shaft.

Florida is absolutely circumcised. I mean I think that goes without saying if you know what I mean all right fine. It's the tank well I've been to the tank and I've been to the bottom of the middle of the shaft. The Tampa area and that Ben of course of course is an American middle American I've been to Orlando where else you're gonna go. That is your Hodge when you're from a lower to middle middle class family. In the midwest. The Hodge is Orlando foreign. I've never been to Jacksonville on the other side which is yeah. The root part the root of the dick up where it hits. The the abdomen seems like a real hell which honestly makes it interesting to me just like another one of those anti-cities that just decides to negate the concept of urbanity say. Hey you know how the whole point of a city is that things are easily accessible and close together. That foreign of course also is the fact that you know it's got a vastly higher crime rate than basically any of the out of control democrat-run cities in the country.

[04:25](https://youtu.be/D7MlcBVAJos?t=04m25s)

But again all you need is to have a public performance of of punishment. A public performance of of law enforcement and veneration for law enforcement and what actually the actual amount of crime you have doesn't matter because how the hell does anybody know. Nobody knows the only people who know are on an individual level. The people who individually are part of it are victims or perpetrators of crime for the most part are not part of anybody's understanding of the public and who can't speak with one voice so all it is is the filtered and then ritually reinscribed violence of crime or whatever the hell we mean by that and It's created a situation where people have taught themselves into believing that that they are part of a meaningful stand for like virtues if they sign on to a political project that acknowledges crime you can acknowledge all day long. Everybody is doing the same thing.

Everywhere. There's no radical alternative to America's approach to crime or any other social problem. Everybody's doing basically the same thing. There are there are um significant superficial alterations. Like the sconces. The escutcheans the the all that the wainscotting those are all different but at base. It's all the same stuff but poverty has been essentially criminalized everywhere but then some places decide to create little ornamental ameliorative rituals. To imply that you know we don't like that or that we want it to be otherwise as opposed to other places that just publicly reaffirm the virtue of that approach to social decline and then you get to vote on one or the other and wow you get to then participate in observing a a media invention of the relationship between the citizens and and their government and between the government and crime and and it's all chosen. What is what what becomes stories is chosen kind of subconsciously but also very deliberately to affirm some narrative that creates a meaningful like sides. But what is happening at base is identical so anyway. Yes Florida the tip gonna go to the tip gonna go to the glance Miami very interested. Very intrigued never been want to be.

There don't know how long it's got as a city. I mean forget global warming. The buildings might all collapse before it even gets to that point so that'll be interesting you know I kind of do. I am intrigued by this game Victoria three it does seem more in my wheelhouse. Than Universal you know use a verbal nornoval Alice Universal uniporealis Universal Europa. That's the one But I don't know I always get a headache. I look at the map. I look at the map and immediately I'm like I don't care I just can't do it.

[08:08](https://youtu.be/D7MlcBVAJos?t=08m08s)

There's something you gotta have that makes you like wired into that stuff and I just don't have it. Oh. I didn't know that the Mike Davis has a as a last book that he put out and what a shock it's called capitalism and apocalypse. I can't believe it might be a good one to dive into. I think I might read that pretty soon after the China book maybe. But I got to do a China book first see I'd rather just if I want to do a a counter factual history. I'll just do it in my head and then I don't have to worry about like clicking on the little screens and then I gotta move the knobs around and I don't know what any of that means it doesn't mean anything to me. It feels like doing homework. It feels like doing a real job like a real like spreadsheet job. No thank you I'll just I'll just let my mind do it. I'll just fall into my 

I'll just play. I'll just rotate the cube of the map in my mind and move things around and also I do think that the that there is something. Insidious about that approach like that the the Assumption of those games that there's like this Immortal spirit being you know that you are basically a god of the nation moving it in in towards a destiny like that is happening that happens in every nation but it is not directed by any one perspective because people are mortal obviously d . The only thing that is left is the structures that humans in the moments they're alive and animated by that Spirit create and then we all live within them and then build on to them during our times alive which ends up being overtime technological structure and what we are in. Now is a situation where the technological structure has fully suborned the humans who make up like critical elements of the circuit of it. For now they do anyway and so when you play a game. One of these games like your your imagined perspective is of the machine itself and I think that's the appeal of the game to leftists is the idea what if the machine had a different programming what if I speaking out acting on behalf of you know the the people the human race expressed you know through the self-knowledge of a class.

 was directing its energies rather than this this other thing this this Prophet imperative that operates it as we it operates it now and that dictates our reality and I guess that's interesting but again too much clicking too many clicks so anyway as I said this is going to be a short one. I got about a half an hour here. So I'll take some questions and answers. Maybe talk to some folks just chill and again anybody. I know any of their Chinese books throw them in there foreign apparently though in this new Victoria game you can you can abolish slavery very quickly like you could basically have the wigs take over in the 1830s which is a very intriguing concept. But you know obviously erases the question of how does Southern Society deal with that okay well never mind.

[12:19](https://youtu.be/D7MlcBVAJos?t=12m19s)

Apparently there is no last Mike Davis book I was surprised. I would have I thought I would have heard of it okay. This is a good one favorite 30 years old 30 Years War minor character. There are a lot of great ones. It's a Rogues Gallery. Some real entertaining characters I'm a big fan of poppenheim. Poppenheim was a was a Imperial General who had been born and raised Protestant but then converted to Catholicism. Joined the Imperial Army and then vowed to take a wound on his body for every year that he spent as a heretic and he put down with savagery a Revolt in Upper Austria in the beginning of the war and he got shot and killed at lutson right before Gustavus Adolphus and you can still find the orders that wallenstein sent him stained with blood So that's I like poppenheim a lot just because he's I've yeah Bernardo socks. Weimar is a character.

I mean they're all either Fanatics or complete sociopaths like that's there's there are very few you can't really even squint and find anybody remotely like to root for you know anybody to feel like an affinity for across history because those people had no part in this particular War. It's it's religious Fanatics and completely vacant sociopaths. Like the only exceptions are people who were essentially extraneous to the process and and in classical reading re-reading re telling to the story always come off like the biggest Chumps like John George of Saxony. John George was the elector of Saxony. He was the Paramount Lutheran elector in the Holy Roman Empire and he had no truck with Frederick V's attempt to take the Bohemian Crown.

He didn't want anything to do with the original this thing that sparked the war and so he was He was neutral until Gustavus invaded the swedes invaded and at first he tried to stay neutral even after the swedes had invaded. But after he proved his military power. He essentially was forced to side with Sweden which lasted until after let's send at which point he helped negotiate the piece of Prague and became neutral again and then eventually supporting the emperor. Now this guy is it looks like a feckless weenie like a no balls. Compared especially to Chad's like Gustavus Adolphus and like a guy like wallenstein who is not like a military genius but is absolutely a fascinating figure and and in his own way is a logistical and financial genius and he got this guy just flowing floating around with a tide but you can recognize at least I can recognize in John George. Like how I imagine I would have responded to the specific phenomenon of the 30 Years War. You know the defenestration of Prague and all that like the calvinist like that's the thing Frederick the fifth was a calvinist. The the the the faction of German Protestants who who started the whole thing by taking the Bohemian Crown were not even lutherans and lutherans like John George considered Calvinists as wrong and as essentially heretical as Catholics were so he didn't want to. Chump you know he looks like this loser oxen started oh. God.

[15:54](https://youtu.be/D7MlcBVAJos?t=15m54s)

There's so many good ones oxen sterna. I mean the mount the Mad helper stradder a Christian of Brunswick is fun because he essentially He was one of the few Catholic princes who held on after White Mountain and he ran around Europe trying to organize armies and get subsidies to fight the emperor all through the lull. Before the the Danish intervention and part of the reason he was doing. It is because he was incredibly horny for trevick V's wife Elizabeth the daughter of James. The first I do read fiction in fact I just finished the the latest George Saunders short Story collection Liberation day It's all. It's got all the stuff you want from a George Saunders book. It is amazing how how formally persist consistent he has been over his career and like you could say oh you know that's kind of boring over a while. But I think what's so interesting about him is how he's able to create these templates and then fill them each time with something that hits new and hits hits from an angle and and kind of makes things interesting like for example.

The first and longest story in the collection is called Liberation day and it's very similar in structure to the old. The Simplicity Simplicity girls I believe Diaries from the 11th of December which is the idea of like the using as a metaphor for like the relationship. The class relationship between people in a consumer Society a hyper-consumer society like America and and using the metaphor of like science fiction human instrumentality basically like you know how you have people at your command and an app well in the Saunders story that relationship is rendered visceral by we're getting rid of the the mediating element of the app or the phone and making it a direct explicit human domination.

So like in the Simplicity girls Diaries. It's a ornament that people could get in their house which is Little Orphan girls strung together on a like a laundry line and in Liberation day it is a basically a home. It's a musical instrument essentially for home use which is human beings who've been brainwashed at their own discretion because you know they signed the paperwork and they the families need the money or whatever. They're. They have consented and under capitalism and then strapped to their wall a wall in a room in their house where they can like recite sort of lyric prose about different subjects and then you can if you get enough of them up on a wall. You can interweave their discussions into like a sort of a word tapestry that people could come and watch so again.

[18:58](https://youtu.be/D7MlcBVAJos?t=18m58s)

It's the same principle but he takes that metaphor and he goes to depths with it that it never been before for me and it's maybe. It's it's I got to reread it. But it's maybe my favorite of his Frederick. Oh this is very just quickly. Somebody. Says wasn't Frederick v a nudist to some degree he did take naked.

 swims in the slavada what's the river in Prague. This is the thing that scandalized the locals. They really they actually the the winter King and their their Court were actually kind of badly received in Prague. They were very happy at first the people to be liberated but then they they they soured on them quickly and one of the things that didn't is that Frederick would swim in. The river naked the vitava that's it. But another one was is that his PR his calvinist court followers and his Court Theologian Abraham skultas believed that all of the ultraquist frippery of the cathedrals and churches of Prague that the ultraquists the hussites took very were very proud of because it was symbolized their nationalists. Movement against German domination that they had that had seen them successfully rest an independent church that allowed them to take water to take wine and bread at Communion. They were very proud of it and these. Calvinists came in and said yeah. This is all got to go these these Saints relics and and the stained glass they gotta go and the citizens were pissed foreign so anyway that's what I'm reading. He also has another one up in there about a crazy.

 a theme park of like you know since Civil War banded the Civil War landed bad decline. There's always a story about a wacky theme park because America is when you think about it just a really wacky theme park and it's another good one. It takes it adds more wrinkles. I'm not. I don't think it's. It's as successful as Liberation day. But it's still entertaining. It still keeps it fresh. So God I love that guy I hope he writes another novel though Lincoln of the bardo's great. But I'm also the other thing I'm reading right now fiction wise is I'm rereading I'm reading for the first time that Hillary manteel books which her death sort of inspired me too But also the fact you know I've been deep in the early modern period now and and it's drawing me closer to it and I want to kind of live there and she's really helping me do that these books are great. I'm about halfway through the second one bring up the bodies and they're phenomenal. I'd read the place of Greater safety before. But I hadn't read any of these books and they're great really loving it 

[21:50](https://youtu.be/D7MlcBVAJos?t=21m50s)

Somebody asks a good question back here and I want to find it. Oh. Somebody said what's the difference between prussians and party. Germans Prussia is not part historic was not historically part of Germany as we understand it It was not part of the Holy Roman emperor empire. For example it was part of that Westward or Eastern sort of liminal zone between the Slavs and the Eastern Church and and Latin Christianity which on its eastern edges was German and so you had the part of part the the the nut of the Prussian Empire or the Prussian. The the Prussian state that would come into being was the duchy of Brandenburg in the north central part of Germany they were the the the the Brandenburg was an electorate. It was a very important principality in Germany but it didn't become Prussia until it was linked to the former lands of the Teutonic Knights which was which were a group of Crusaders who after being turfed out of the Holy Land turned their Imperial gaze towards the old slobs of the northern Northeastern Baltic who had not been converted to Christianity yet and they did a holy.

The Teutonic Knights did a holy war that let saw them become the the feudal dominators of these of arrest of Arrested peasant population where just as serfdom is sort of dying out in eastern or western Europe. It is being essentially re-installed by the Teutonic Knights onto this area. Now that area gets chopped down by over time and eventually a lot of it becomes the Lithuanian the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth But I think one thing is very interesting is that the Teutonic not the the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights who is the mod who is essentially the the Monarch. The elected monarch of that chunk of of or that Colony that German Colony in northeastern Europe is the first prince of in the the pr the first prince in Europe to convert to Lutheranism to convert his Holdings to the Lutheran Church and it's because his position was being undermined. His power was dying and he sought to bolster it by gaining that percentage of his authority and revenue that was bleeding out of there to the Church in Rome foreign.

So you see this. The the Prussian land ends up becoming Brandenburg plus the this rump of the old Teutonic Knights Holdings and that becomes Prussia and then as Austria. Declines Prussia Rises because there is a vacuum is created in the German world that must be filled inevitably will be filled. But it's not going to be filled by those party. Germans I talk about the bavarians the the southern Catholics because there enjoying their Catholic Carnival lives in the in the rich Heartland of German. Agriculture and in this in the busy cities of Lutheran Europe or at Lutheran Germany rather nor the Northern parts people are making money. They're they're they're they're they're on that grind whereas this Remnant this this futilized powerful rural military Elite. This aristocratic Elite in Prussia organizes into a military State and Frederick. The great becomes the the sort of history history on Horseback figure who sort of gathers the energies within Prussia.

The the drive towards the a vacuum created by the decline of Austria and then creates this in incredible military machine but it declines quickly because it essentially extinguishes it has its chance. It makes its effort but it leaves it still relatively small in population and and relatively poor relatively to the other powers of Europe which are doing capitalism at this point which it can't compete with. It cannot gain the land necessary to make up for its weakness relative to capitalist economies and so that means that when the German State comes into being it is dominated politically. By this militarized aristocracy and then that that militarized their soccer season directs Germany into the machine of war that it became which helped ensure that the struggle for resources in the crisis conditions of the late of the early 19th century would create a war. Another War for Europe the 30 Years War was a war for Germany and then 300 years later 300 years of capitalist development you get another crisis in similar conditions but this time a unified Germany has now at War with the rest of the capitalist. The rest of um the capitalist states of Europe again so it expands into the whole continent and because these are now Colonial Powers it extends into the entire world and would have destroyed. Capitalism had it not been for the existence of the United States there to absorb all the contradictions of European capitalism and and neutralize them creating different contradictions that are going to explode in the long term but in the short term staving off.

It's inevitable annihilation we're recording the 30 Years War episode. We're almost done writing the seventh we have six in the can. Basically we got to do some editing but those are largely done and and recorded. We're gonna record. This one hope the seventh hopefully in Miami. We're gonna hopefully have it out early in January.

Why do you guys hate New England and never visit. We have played Providence Boston New Haven Portland Maine and Nashua New Hampshire. So we've been in New England. What's not the life about New England. It's It's. It's the most demon haunted part of the country because it's where the American psyche was forged. It's where the The Dread and horror of an untamed natural world that has not been rationalized according to the the religious and cultural and economic cult structures that that felt that made us feel more to reality like we were the these settled and formed European Minds were encountered a tableau Ross and of course you say no no. There are these natives. Here they had a complex civilization correct but its complexity was illegible to them. They could see it in its real in its outlines but what they saw was something that genuinely terrified them not because it meant an undoing of their realities and so then they had to reforge a reality out of blood and the thing is is that they were doing that in Europe they were forging realities out of blood but it was each other's blood which means that you're just setting yourself up for a re-inscribement of traumas to eventual Annihilation which is what would have happened and did happen. Europe was destroyed what prevented it from that destruction from destroying the structures that had led to that.

Conflict was the existence of the United States because the because those identities were forged as all identities are in blood but that blood was not their blood. It was the blood of another who could become the repository for all the sublimated alienations and miseries large and small psychic damages of existence in class Society that this is something that Calhoun John C Calhoun understood deeply that's why Richard halberstam called him the marks of the Master Class because he had a similar understanding of the inevitable creeping annihilating nature of class rule. He just he believed that the existence of a slave class diffused intra white class conflict which cannot be contained and he was correct about that that is why the the lid would have to be put back on the the Pandora's Box after the end of the Civil War because the reality of equality was starting to kick in and the thing is it could have gone differently. The conditions existed for there to be different results of that because again as I was saying identities are forged in Blood and the blood spilled from northern whites during the Civil War was entirely spilled by Southern whites.

There is a world where that experience reorients to some degree. A significant enough degree to move the needle politically and institutionally and move the the gigantic Ultra Starship of Earth Society of of the the psychic spaceship we're all living in in One Direction or another foreign but we didn't get that because we got Lincoln's assassination we got Johnson's disastrous Ascension to the presidency. We get the rolling back of the nascent land reform that was marking reconstruction and could have marked it more again not to create a Utopia but to change the terrain of future conflict move. The the goal posts change the conditions so that when a great War erupts in 1914 the American political system looks differently.

Maybe there still is horrible violence. There still is Indian extermination. There still is vast racial conflict and and oppression but it is being contained within a political structure that recognizes that struggle instead of wipes. It off the board which is what white democracy after the end of reconstruction did that means social struck that means political structures that are more able to directly address capitalism during conditions of Crisis and of course that would kick in that would create more resistance among capitalist social and political institutions that means conflict open and and and undeclared war. But that's the history we got. That is the history of humanity till now we just find ourselves at an exhaustion point that might be might have been others otherwise and all right I gotta wrap up here. We're almost yeah. I gotta start recording soon democracy.

Ending globally says use it well yes of course but again that's not going to be a real change for anybody's material conditions. I really don't think we're only talking about the removal of emblems. We've got a machine in power that has like some cool. Like decals on it to make it look like something else to make it look like a Transformer or something to make it look like your friend and neighbor the the government that responds to you. And it's just going to fall off now that's. But it's going to be replaced by something else. It's going to be replaced by some political spectacle that the people who are in some way or another perceive themselves to be wrapped in its bosom and not being killed by it which is what's actually happening being suffocated by it which is what's actually happening.

It's about. It feels like being to some degree cocooned even if you feel aware of that and guilty about it. You still feel deeper than political ideology. You still feel dependent on it. That's the word and so there'll still be some sort of demo democratic Terrain and only historically are you going to be able to look back and say oh that's not. That's when the Democracy isn't there anymore because it's it's a slow cooking. It is not some sort of what we want it to be which is a apocalyptic revelry revealing of what is real of what is the apocalypse is the unveiling right. That's what that means the uncovering of something and that is the the machine behind the mask of democracy. But I don't think we're going to get that because building the mask is what the machine does like generating. The mask like is is the whole reason that the thing exists to tell itself a story to so that we can all tell ourselves a story where we are the protagonists of all history and that our comfort is the only thing that matters in the universe. This that spectacle that it generates is the reason it exists so it cannot go away only with if the machine breaks down and the Machine will break down as it's breaking down. Now at the margins not at the center okay. All right talking to you guys next week bye.
