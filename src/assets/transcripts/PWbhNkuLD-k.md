Welcome to the chat room we got take some games. We got everything you want and where you find any meme you need. If you've got the tokens baby. We are your machine ah what's up guys. I'm back not joey's world tour though not yet one of these days one of these days. I'm just going to start housing snacks and explaining how they taste pretty good pretty good. It was very rainy earlier today and then it was windy apparently this part of some tropical storm and now it's beautiful humidity's gone. I don't know how long it'll last but I'm living a la vida loca. Currently someone wants a whoop whoop whoop.

I can give you one of those bra ah so. I wanted to start by closing my end of a hilarious online. I guess back and forth back in diagonal maybe back in perpendicular would be more accurate between me and someone on twitter who has been talking about me being a gateway to to nazism I talked about it a little bit. I read a tweet thread last time and couldn't stop laughing because of how funny it was and of course that led to fodder and another round of tweeting and I just wanted to say okay. This has been fun. I think it's been funny but now it's time to stop on my end anyway because if you can't know if you can't see how sterile and doomed any kind of engagement like that is. I don't know what to tell you. It can only provide the like the joy of owning and and doing mind combat. It cannot resolve anything so seeking it seeking to have it do that which a lot of people do online is a fantasy and I don't want to. I want to stop I know it's a work in progress like trying to totally disengage from online and it's going to take a very long while but one way for me. Anyway is to recognize a bad pattern and just end it but I did want to say something publicly though because I just wanted to point out how perfect an example.

This thing is of the way that nobody online actually is trying to persuade anyone of anything all they are doing is building heat around their persona like their professional wrestler and it's about pitching to a already established specific fan base of people who respect them. Maybe give them money for some sort of media endeavor or activism and and that involves conflict and that involves picking fights and that involves getting responses. So when I started responding that was heroin into the veins. I mean as much as the tweets might have been hysteric and oh my god look what he's doing doesn't. He realize that he's he's normalizing the honk pill and is going to lead to bash mass shootings all over. America doesn't he care but in reality she's thrilled to get a response that she can further used to further the the the illusion of a meaningful contest there but at no point is any of this stuff geared towards a as I mean. I read the I read the stuff and I talked about how just hearing it out loud was startling considering how obscure and weird it was and that just goes to show that the unengaged the undecided are not considered in this dialogue like there's no question about getting people who aren't on the team It's about people who already agree with you on all this stuff and that means that if they get if you get attacked back that's just more grist for the mill and that's and that's why you know.

I don't mind doing it for a little bit because I don't think it's bad for me. It's not like. I'm scared of oh. No. I'm get cancelled by her and it's not like. I even think what she's doing is like terribly terrible. It's honestly a fun diversion. It's like a nice little place to rift for most people or to get their like anti-fascist hysteric anxiety out either way. They're having a good time like a person tweeting about a person sweating over their tweets about who they're gonna like expose what what fash they're gonna dox in their war against fash every time they see a honk pill meme or they see me triggering their like the rube goldberg. Contraption that connects me to like a and fear is tinged. It's tinged with with pleasure and everyone who's making fun of these goofballs. They're having a good time right out there in the open. But they're both having fun and that's fine everyone's got to do something on the internet um might as well have some fun and I think this is honestly relatively harmless because the people who are wrapped up in this stuff give them a busy box. I would rather them have them be online trying to stop the fascists on twitter than doing something helpful which would undoubtedly be a massive disaster because if you if your ability to like sift signal from noise if your ability to distinguish things by like meaning by like a with like gradients of meaning if you if you're if you have any sort of faculty for observing reality and giving it some sort of 

I don't like a a emotional and and epistemic triage. I guess where you you. I guess. I'm just trying to say where you understand there's a reality. There's a difference between the internet and reality when you understand there's a difference between subculture online and politics then If you have that understanding none of this stuff is is makes sense to you and if you don't have that understanding you sure should not be trying to deal with people who can in the real world. It will be a disaster and so good stay there keep fighting the good fight and even you know hey patreons for fighting the fash go for it. It's a nice little busy box for people whose basic ability to understand the world is not sufficient to the task of activism because I just want to say one of the accusations that was thrown at me is that like I was playing dumb about the reality of the clown pill or honking or whatever like acting like it wasn't a real like wasn't a real thing. It wasn't a real subculture that was really out there. And it's like no. I know it's real. I've heard about it. Before this of course. I was extremely online for god's sakes. I know about the stupid clown world but not only is she asking an audience to take seriously the idea that that clown pill is a genuine gateway towards real violence in the world and not just in the proximate trigger of like well. This alienated psycho who hated everyone also enjoyed this meme. I'm sorry. I'm not buying that but that proximate trigger thing that's that that's how you got the the moral hysteria around video games and and films. And I know that's now it's now. It's actually hip on the left to talk like that.

But I I'm still holding out the good fight that no that's not the thing that's meaningless to the real questions of the structural causes of any kind of violence including isolated lone wolf murder. By the way it is interesting to me that these people are fixated on the concept of fascism right which is a which is in large part defined as a mass political movement that uses organized legal and extra-legal violence to assert power in a political arena. What what they have decided is the thing that they could actually like pull out of this as a as a general as an actual justification for why care about this stupid online is will. Some of these guys end up shooting up a walmart or or killing a neighbor or something and that's true but by fixating on that you've basically undermined any meaningful definition of fascism because if fascism cannot be isolated people doing uncoordinated acts of violence do you think the brown shirts were just reading the deutsche beerbacker and then one deciding to go out and punch a communist. Do you think they would have taken over germany if they've done that like your definition of fascism is just late capitalist anime. It's just it's. It's that means columbine is is fascism and the thing is is that kind of violence is a sign of a social dis of a society in decay at the level of its social fabric which militates against the idea that there's enough of a social fabric to to generate a mass political movement that would be fascism so they're already even at the beginning. They've in their own foundation by going with a mechanism for what fascism it is and where it comes from that is idealist fantasy that genuinely misunderstands not only the difference between media and reality but the difference between like fascism and just anti-social behavior and so that that's our they're off to a bad start there.

[11:17](https://youtu.be/PWbhNkuLD-k?t=11m17s)

 but not only do you have to buy that end idea. You then have to say that this honkler is similar enough to the grill pill to mean that if you listen to the my streams or you will be more likely to then switch over to honking on the hog pill and then maybe eventually because of the honk pill people going on to shoot somebody like that's how you allied the idea like the absurdity of saying. I'm going to cause fascist school shootings by saying no no matt won't. But he will get people to take more seriously the idea of the clown or the honk pill and that that's the moral contagion fantasy that is the the confusion of symbols for reality that happens when you have completely detached from a material understanding of the world. Once that happens you are in cloud cuckoo land. You are untethered and your analysis will only become more arcane and self-referential and self-justifying. It will get denser it'll require a greater greater degree of weird conspiratorial logic and and leaps of logic and symbolic confusion. Like this whole thing basically starts because two things have the word pill in them that's the essential thing. This is that they're able to take superficial symbolic similarities and extrapolate from that layers of meaning and that are fully fabricated in their heads and that is why when when gwen said matt's not antifa.

I said thank you I'm not. I don't the the entire framing of that the entire framing of this movement. The entire framing of this moment as a battle of ideas online between fascists and and and socialists is wrong and it's a misapplication of energy and I'm glad yes. I'm not involved in that good and of course. The double absurdity of that is that you're literally not even talking about any kind of group. I mean the only people who want to argue that antifa is coherent are its supporters and the trump administration so that they can claim it as a boogeyman equal to ms-13 or isis But the reality is that there's no or there's no coherence to it either just as there is there the anti-fascist are unorganized. Just like the fasch are because you are operating at a symbolic level removed from reality because the reality is is that people involved in politics to the point of caring enough to go rumble in the streets. About. It form a very distinct minority of americans that are that are generally classified along a certain age specifically specifically age and demographic groupings and geographic groupings and and that their influence on the political system is secondary.

At most. The real action is happening or at least the the the only way that the ship this ship can be steered away from its course towards towards apocalypse involves activating a number of people that simply will never be brought around by this sort of politics. By this understanding of politics. Numbers are the name of the game and the only thing that matters right now anybody wants to talk about fewer but better. It's like. We're starting from zero almost and we're. I mean the bernie sanders. Campaign was an attempt to build capacity and I think it did leave some capacity. Like all these all these waves leave some you know they they lap on the shore and they bring with them. Some sediment that like builds some foundational elements and they you know there's like there's some stuff that was left over after 2016 that wasn't there before 2000 and then 2020. But it's still totally insufficient and what happened to bernie in those in those later primary states.

Those less politicized primary states that had less like that have a more I guess a less engaged. I guess I would use the word voting group. I guess like less politically wrapped up beyond beyond the way. The people who watch fox news which is other millions of people still not a huge amount amount but more certainly more economically influential because of their advanced age and therefore their larger control of capital but still a minority but those people um those people weren't paying attention to any of this. The whole time like anything about what we were doing on our show like scared people away because we were too mean or whatever the hell to the poor warren supporters or anything else or the idea that like bernie wasn't wasn't He was too woke. Bernie was too woke.

He talked too much about trans bathrooms or something and that scared away the normals. No no one was paying attention to any of it at all does that mean when it came to come time to to vote. They just went clunk. Now some people were paying attention in that older. White suburbanites were paying attention to bernie and freaking out about it and and voted and mass for biden like 

That was a a genuine mobilizing factor. But there was no the thing is that was built in that was going to happen. Bernie was a credible challenge to the democratic party. He was going to arouse conflict not only with the party hierarchy but with sectors the richer sectors of its party base and so that was inevitable. But it was the only way it was going to be defeated was by engaging the vast number of people who were not involved in politics at all or were at a very superficial level and that didn't happen and if that didn't happen it is my opinion that stuff that's even more esoteric and even more fine-grained and even more nestled with assumptions and value like assumptions about reality assumptions about morality assumptions about politics and economics built into it that are not shared like that's why so many people like to assume bad faith. One of the big reasons people assume bad faith is because like I've said about people worrying like well.

[17:59](https://youtu.be/PWbhNkuLD-k?t=17m59s)

What do you what about murderers if it's if if you abolish police or abolish prison and people will say you know you act like no one's read about this plenty of people have written about this don't act. Like this isn't This is new you're just you're just pretending not to know about that so that you can be a a sea lion like I'm sorry. No no there's plenty of people who have not done the reading who are not have not assimilated. The entire concept either to reject it or embrace it. They're hearing it for the first time but ever but then not just that like on all sides of the of the online left and right.

There is an assumption that there that you start talking to somebody about politics and at some point you're going to connect there's going to be like a little latching on between your understanding and the symbolic language and metaphors that you use to describe it and their understanding of the world. Something's going to click and then like the theory of one of the big theories of behind socialism and marxism is that if you're trying to get that connection between people material interests are the best way to do it because it's the most because it's the least individualized and that it can be. It's. It's it's common among a wide swath of people that could hypothetically organize around that. But at this point even the way people are understanding and thinking about material concerns are now so abstracted or and and on the other side among people who aren't engaged with politics. Those ideas are so buried that now there isn't even a place to click them together.

There's nowhere to get the latch latching but all this stuff just perpetuates just it's people winding each other up within a within a subculture. It's a poli subculture you know. It's like people think about political subcultures and they say well what are political subcultures and they're like well. You got your tankies and your anarchists and your sock dems and your honklers and your. No. I'd say no no no no no. That is. I'd say that politics is the subculture. I would say that having investment in political ideology specif especially beyond a party preference which a lot of people have who are otherwise. Normal is a subculture and all that other stuff that people fight to the death about is essentially just shading. It's uniform so you know who's who like it is the the nfl and then the tankies and the suck dems and the clown honklers and and the proud boys or whatever they're the teams in the league who play and we're in the stands watching. We're football fans and I think the reason people make that mistake like obviously.

A lot of his comp is computer insanity and I think that's a real phenomenon that we are not talking enough about like. I've talked about mk ultra as or I've talked about like the internet is both like a continuation of mk ultra and also the lead in the pipes of the of the you know our version of the roman empire but that's not just it. I think there's other significant contributors and I think a big one has been the and of course. This is all facilitated by the internet but it's not only a product of the internet and that is the the the fixation on gramscian wars of cultural position standing in for material politics and I know a lot of people do that not out of malice but because that is what can be fought like what do you do about material conditions.

How do you engage that realistically in a de-politicized cis country with basically zero class consciousness and no unified working class to speak of either geographically ethnically anything so of course. The cultural firmament becomes the only place to play and I feel like one of the big misunderstandings of these critiques of of like the new of the critiques of the critical theory tradition from the frankfurt school to the post-modernists and all that and there's this there is a current of blaming them for the that cultural turn in in on the left and I don't really think that's the case. I think that the cultural turn on the left was inevitable as soon as as soon as the the the material war ended. Especially after that wall fell what was left but the cultural so that's I think the main contributor once again. The material driver of the cultural turn not not because people were reading stuff but I think the reason that those thinkers get so 

It became totemic and their concepts became used to build this. This tower of babel about um about culture is because they were describing how culture operates in capitalism like that was that was the the the the project. This is what cap this is how capitalism especially like 20th century 20th century techno capitalism. This is how it operates as a governing ideology in culture. That's what they were tracing and over time especially after that pesky material. Collapse of the left that over time turned into a um in people's minds. I think even not even consciously. That went from a description of this is what culture is under capitalism to a normative argument that like this is what society is always that that this is not contingent and more importantly that it's not just culture that it's not. It's not the way that the material relations form a culture. It's the way that culture takes over and becomes the entire terrain and that that's where the errors came in. I think that's where the snake swallowed its own tail but that doesn't mean that the insights are inherently wrong. It's just that you're talking about you're talking about the like. The the shadow you know you're talking about the shadows on the wall and describing the shadows on the wall accurately that has use.

[24:40](https://youtu.be/PWbhNkuLD-k?t=24m40s)

But it should not be mistaken for the totality of reality which is how it has become thought of which is what allowed people to turn all this analysis on its head and say oh you know the way that material culture creates all these racial and and you know gender oppressions and stuff well if we stop those that'll end up filtering down into the material reality somehow when in reality that's not what happens but then you get people but that but that leads to confusion on both sides because anytime. I see anybody arguing about yelling about feminism and saying that saying the making first they make a point that I think is totally accurate. They say look at what modern feminism as it has been culturally metabolized tells women about what their life should be. It should be a pursuit of career that that is and everything else should be subsidiary to that career fam family first or career first and family and everything else and that that's that's that's how that's how you actualize if you. If you do it the wrong. Way you'll be you'll find yourself at some point thwarted and they'll say but everyone's miserable. All these women who do that all these women who pursue their careers are miserable so what the and that's that's a very good point. I mean it's. It's a it's a observation of reality anyway But then they blame feminism for it. The idea being that oh the feminism convinced all these women that they needed to go get a job.

No the american economy stopped being able to support one family house one income households. That's what happened you used to be able to raise a family in fact for most of human history. You could raise a family on one income and for the first time in human history anywhere really that was no longer possible and then feminism becomes of course. The communism emerging from that copes gives you the the cope like that's what culture does it. It metabolizes alien the specific alienation and trauma that the soci that the material order creates and then it creates a mirror cultural version that attempts that is designed. I mean not designed but emerges sort of like as a what as a immune system for capitalism to transfer that alienation into some carrot on the end of a stick that you can go off. It's like yeah. This sucks but have you considered this and that's what feminism is. It's like yeah this sucks but if it wasn't for those that sexism that job would be better. It's not that work is alienating. It's not that no one should try to raise a family on two with both people working that's not ideal and it's it's it's not necessary I mean it's. It's It's it's it's inherently corrosive to to the like the the structure of a family. It is it just is. It's pressured pressure makes it human interactions difficult of all kinds and and that's why it should be relieved but instead of focusing on the fact that the one fat the one income household is impossible now for most people. People want to argue about whether it's feminism's fault that women are miserable in jobs and delaying marriage and delaying kids or having kids and then not being able to make it work or anything like that if you take away if feminism loses tomorrow if the the red pill takes over then people still aren't gonna be able to that they talk about about about the destabilized. Home life of late capitalist america is recreated and you could argue well yes but if we got rid of the feminism then you could get people on board with some sort of redistributed program that would have like a family friendly policy well. If you haven't gotten rid of capitalism then and in the moment we live in which is a a terminal crisis of capitalism and a a crisis of profitability that is irreversible There's no there is no room in the in at the end for any kind of radical redistribution. So any politics that inc that incorporates like the the conventional order is not going to be able to demand to make any demands other than superficial ones and then what do you end up having is oh.

You know divorce was banned or some alienation that you claim to have been curing but and the other thing is is okay. You've made your appeal to these people who don't like feminism and now you've got them on board. What's this you lost the people who are who do think that women should have that there should be a like a role for women in the workplace and that and that you shouldn't have to stay to have two jobs. But if a woman wants to work they should hell men should be able to stay home and that if women are in the workplace they sure as hell deserve to not have to face sexism in the workplace and that those are not that's a totally reasonable argument too and you could point and they could point to the misery of the the pre-liberated housewife which was significant and they're they're. They're right too and you're not. Gonna convince them. Otherwise is the important thing and so oh you got them and now you've lost them and that means you have a new political configuration. You have a new constituency and once again it's too little. It's too small you. It's like the esops fable where the the mouse the the fox has the grape in his mouth and he walks by the water and he and he sees it and he tries to get it. He drops. It opens his mouth and drops it in the water. He loses both of them that's what will happen either one of those like. We need to set serious about like setting the terms for the left of it being like radically hostile to religion and the family okay great. This is america. What do you think you're doing you are you're guaranteeing minority status but if you say on the other side no we need like an aggressively trad. Socialism well then you've lost the other the only way to to overcome that is to recognize that feminism isn't the problem one way or the other and that if you want to have it be a woman who works in the workplace or if you want to be a woman and stay home you should be able to do either because people should be able to live with without it being tied to a a labor because both are true.

The idea of all women should have a job is insane. The idea that all women should stay home is also insane but we went from tacitly endorsing one. Although it was never true for working class women working class women always worked to mandating it through the market so the so the coercion is invisible. We don't see the coercion so we just say ah it's feminism that made all those women go to work and get miserable of course. I'm talking about liberal feminism I'm talking about hegemonic cultural feminism. The kind people are always arguing about if you want to know true scotsman mean you can but you could do that about literally everything because the thing is people could say well like even liberal feminism recognizes you know choice and recognizing but that's not what the terrain of argument ever is. It's always on difference and the difference is always the most ephemeral and least connected to reality thing because it's because you're trying to find an argument. I'm not broken. I'm totally normal and cool right. Now. So that's just to say long way of saying half an hour long way of saying that that honk pill.

I'm done with it still still marginalizing voices though beirut I mean they say there was a bunch of ammonium nitrate stored at the dock and a bunch people have said it looks like a fertilizer explosion. So I don't know it seems to me to be maybe. It's an occam's razor situation things like that happen all the time they're gonna happen. More and more decaying infrastructure leads to disasters and catastrophes and there's a desire to see everything as geopolitical chess match. But one of the one of the fact one of the conditions of the great game is a steadily increasing amount of mayhem created by our decaying and destroyed institutions but man those videos were insane how the hell could have been a nuke. That's my favorite one. It's like hasn't everyone seen every like ocean's eleven. It's thought in it's like a nuclear bomb but without the bomb so hiroshima you're getting the ninth century. They have nuclear bombs have electromagnetic pulses that go with them and what they do is. They knock out all electronic equipment in a given area so if you're close enough to have recorded it like that and have your windows blow out. Your phone would have been fried thank you halifax halifax munitions. Dump blew up in halifax world war one. I think a lot of it is people just want people. Want people want everything to be the most it could be at any moment now because we've seen everything or we think we have and so if something's going to happen. It has to be the most and part of that is because how are we going to have a take. If it's not the most if it's just another thing texas city. We need some someone's I don't know where this came from. But I don't know why it abused me so much but someone in chat just demanded that we that we that what america needs is a former ghanaian junta leader.

Jerry rawlings very amusing to me. Rawlings is an interesting cat. I gotta say rawlings is not does not fit the mold for most like post-colonial um african strong men because he was sort of a cincinnatus type guy and that he would take a coup take over and then he would leave and that he would come back after everything got up again yeah like yeah like a reluctant dictator yeah. Now. I always have a soft spot for jerry rawlings. Also just because that's a really cool name he sounds like a like a 70s. Baseball player I got a jerry rawlings-rooking car ricky card 

[37:12](https://youtu.be/PWbhNkuLD-k?t=37m12s)

If the universe is infinite well. The universe isn't infinite. I mean. It's it's expanding so. I mean it's infinite. In that's everything it is everything but there's space dude. There's a lot of space and it takes a long time for light to travel through it a long long time and they're all over the place. Nothing is outside. The universe come on there's nothing outside the universe if you have to think of it three-dimensionally the universe is It's like a ball. It's an expanding ball. It's like say well what's outside the ball. It's like well. No. It's there's nothing outside the ball. It's just a ball expanding bests. No no the universe. The multiverse is not outside the universe. I think that the multiverse is simultaneous to the universe. They're all on top of each other. They're all happening in the same in the same balloon.

I don't think moby dick is about polytheism. It's about pantheism in the in the great european pantheous tradition of spinoza. But I do think that like black holes people say where do black holes lead. I think it's all internal. It's all and it's like. There are areas of of super density where there's if there is. If there is possible travel between dimensions. That's where it is big yeah. I am actually fully on board with the eternal recurrence theory big bang big crunch like a squeeze box but within that squeeze box are all of the squeeze boxes. All the universes all the earth's all the everything's squeezing but not at the same rate and the thing that and like all that and they say how I don't know 90 of the universe is literally a question mark. It's probably somewhere in there. It's like yeah. You know that dark matter stuff. That's just a big hole and they're like well. There's something there. So we got to call it something maybe something's there h . I don't know math enough to figure it out 

Somebody posted a good line from moby dick that I would like to read after pip the the cabin boy is thrown overboard during a whaling mission and he's on the water for hours before they pick him up and afterwards he's mad and and it's pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heave the colossal orbs. He saw god's foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad. I know that feeling you know what's really fun about funny about that chapter though or about the about the book in general and then that chapter kind of presages. It is that so it talks about yeah. Pip went crazy He was out there in the water and you know when you go out on there in the water. It's just you and god and and your brain can't handle it. You know when you come back and you're not you're not the same and and then at the end of that chapter he kind of says yeah. You know that that came that's that insight keep that in mind. Basically he tells the audience and then of course spoiler alert at the end of the book ahab or I'm sorry after ahab and the crew of the the peak water all killed by moby dick ahab floats alone on Queequeg's coffin for I think a day before before he's taken and that's like sort of the punch line of the book is that the book has been written by somebody who had that experience the pip hat.

I got to say it was really good. I know it's stupid to say nobody dick's good but I feel like for a long time. I didn't want to read it because most of those good books aren't really fun you know and I know fun isn't the only thing but fun's part of it. I think that's the big thing. I didn't realize like. I thought it'd be great and I thought it would be profound. But I didn't realize how fun it would be oh. It's so fun. It is one of the most fun books you can read in my opinion I kind of want to um stonewall. Jackson was an absolute mutant stonewall wow stonewall jackson. So I don't know how many people know about this particular weirdness of stonewall jackson. But among other things he was convinced that one of his arms was thicker in diameter than the other and that as a result when he had his arms to his side one of them accumulated blood and it would get heavy and so occasionally during the day he would hold up his arm over his head to let the blood flow back into his body He also sucked on lemons all day and was generally a word. I think he was probably on the spectrum. I would say he seems like a good candidate among civil war generals and I was going to say who's the most likely spectrum world war or I'm sorry civil war general. I gotta go jackson number one with a bullet. I think and I don't think it's close honestly He was also he was a prick him. He got killed by his own guys which is hilarious. I really I hope that it got out who shot him and then over the whole course of the war. They just got like bullied by the rest of the army of northern virginia like hey try to yeah hey when you want to shoot the yankees just think of stonewall jackson you. Traitors idiots.

I did see gods and generals in the theater. I have not seen the five hour extended edition and I do not hate myself enough to ever. It is genuinely terrible and it's not just because of the politics. Although the politics are genuinely wretched and honestly as someone who loved gettysburg as a kid and loved joshua rush chamberlain and loved jeff daniels as joshua lawrence chamberlain. His turn in gods and generals is a betrayal like he's not barely in it and his one big scene is he. He does a a shakespeare quote about caesar crossing the rubicon implicating the union army as the the military that is going to overthrow democracy and overthrow the republic. Why would chamberlain say that it's like yep the guy who said the guy who had the the senate and the republican bury democracy him. But anyway terrible performances awful beards But I think the worst thing about it is just how boring it is. There's only one fun scene and it's the scene where a bunch of confederate generals sit around the campfire and watch. Some fancy theater man sing the bonnie blue flag.

One of the senators by the way was sitting a virginia senator. One of one of the generals was virginia senator george allen who was on a fast track to being the successor to george bush and then he was totally destroyed by a political scandal that looking back on it. It's insane to imagine that it happened only what it was 2000. I think it was 2006. Yeah. It's 2006. Only 14 years ago it feels like something that happened in the like the era of good feeling. It seems like it should have ended with a duel like oh yeah.

He was on he was on. He was recorded on tape saying a a obscure north african slur for like a dark skinned person or like a native people had to bust out a dictionary even to make sense of the of the accusation and it still took this guy from the line to be president and he lost his seat to jim webb by the way to bourne fighting. Scott's irish jim webb but the worst part about gobs and generals by far is that like most civil war movies it saves on money and budget or I mean it saves on the budget and it saves on just ease of making the film by high bringing in real civil warrior actors to play the soldiers because they already have the equipment they know how to march and do all the lines the military formations and so it's way easier than hiring actors and having to drill them and equip them. But the problem is is that american civil war reenactors are fat suburbanites. They're fat middle-aged guys and you'll watch these battles and there's a line of confederate soldiers confederate soldiers going up and some guy gets shot and he's like a 300 pound. Butterball turkey. He's got like a red face. It's like is he actually does he have a does he have a is he wearing a larry. The cable guy hat instead of a keppy. The average civil war soldier was a real thin teenager or near to it. Anyway.

They're just big and they just stand there and they go bang and then they fall over and of course. There's no blood and I mean. I'm sorry. But the civil war was noted for its savagery. It was it was the first one of the first large-scale conflicts that took napoleonic tactics and married it to you know indus post-industrial revolution military technology which did not account for it oh no. The guns aren't supposed to be that good when you stand in a big line and you shoot at each other. The guns can only be so good and it's like no no we got rifling in the barrels now and you can shoot them way faster oh by petersburg by the end of the war but it took a while and that was one of the big reasons that robert e lee is such a and and I mean he. It's like people remember pickett's charge but that wasn't even his only dumb frontal assault. Malvern hill during the seven days was his first that was another ass kicking and he'd seen the union. Army get just its ass kicked doing full frontal assaults on entrenched positions.

He'd done it at fredericksburg. What the it is good that war is so terrible lest. We grow fond of it what a little what a sanctimonious prick nothing redeeming about that guy if anybody. If somebody likes him you can put them on the pay no mind list because there's nothing to like wildly overrated He got his ass kicked by mcclellan. Most of the times they fought and mcclellan was a and then the other wins he racked up. It's like he's like robert e lee is the general equivalent of a college football team that just racks up um racks up wins and point differentials by playing a bunch of like scrubs like barely barely trip You know barely top division schools and then as soon as grant showed up oh. Oh no what's this oh he's not able to do his tactically. It's like yeah sure. He's lost a lot of his army but one of the big reasons he lost so much by then is that he invaded the north which was the stupidest and most pointless thing what are you doing invading the north your entire advantage is that you have mastery of your area time is on your side if you were able to maintain like an internal interior. Like lines of control. You can bleed them out especially that early in the war before sherman had broken through in this in the west. What are you doing yeah play for time.

You're you had. They had guys trying to persuade the british and the french and the russians to to recognize the confederacy for and they'd been getting places. It was a close run thing honestly the working class of england is maybe. One of the most had more influence on the the victory of the the union than almost any other. Force outside the united states certainly is that because the leadership of of uk and napoleon iii and the tsar we're all in favor of I think the czar was was was not as but I know the france and england but they were on board to recognize the confederacy. They wanted it. Yeah give us give us the carve up carve up. The american continent break up that superpower you want that why wouldn't you um and the other thing that you're not considering is even if it's looking bad one.

It still took them two years so whatever reckoning you're like we have to do it. Now you didn't have to do it. They didn't have to do it look how long they were able to hold out even after spending their shot in going north. If they fought a defensive war. They probably could have lasted longer because they still lasted pretty long the idea that he had to go north or they would have like it would have collapsed. That's absurd and then he it up yeah no and then of course. There's the smugness just like that was so terrible that we should grow fond of it.

Shut up you freak sicko willitcher. Siegel. Willach come on come on come on theories on bohemian grove. It's it's a weird. Fancy dress party for pretentious rich and maybe they sacrifice people to malik. I don't know I kind of feel like. It's too on the nose to do it there. I feel like they do it elsewhere. I will. I will say that just as the last word here before. I wrap up that. I will recommit that. I will never kill. I would not kill baby honkler and now that gives me an idea for something which if I had photoshop abilities. I would do. I would get if I could get the footage at the very end if anyone has seen come and see the soviet movie about the the nazi counter guerilla war in belarus pretty intense film and it ends with this kid shooting this. This vengeful child sort of confronted with a picture of baby hitler and he can't he finds that he can't kill the baby you know. It's a classic kind of you know pre for plea for understanding and all that and I just imagine you cut that in and you just have it. You have the kid looking and it's just baby honkler instead like honkler with like an diaper on. I think that'd be pretty funny well. You don't even have to kill hitler if you can go back in time presumably going back I mean just take hillary and like take him to take him to the united states give like go to their house take the kid take a take a boat to the u.s and like drop him on an orphanage door. What's he gonna do what's hitler gonna do if he's like grows up a like a catholic orthopedic like with babe ruth in baltimore or something.

I actually have read mr lonely hearts nathaniel. Nathaniel west the guy who the guy who first had a character named homer simpson in the day of the locust what's wrong with christian yelich. That's a good question maybe it's just a sign that no one should be doing this and that's stupid and that they should stop playing baseball. I don't know I so. I don't have any hope for the brewers to win this year. But I don't know what if you're if you are a fan of a team that has never had a championship in your life right. Like I'm a brewer fan they went to the they went to the world series once when I was a wee baby and they lost in seven games to the cardinals curse them eternally. And you know that's really the only sport thing. I have any kind of investment in. I don't really care about basketball if bucks are good go for it all right. Maybe that's a good example or you're you know the indians or something or the mariners my god. If you won this year would you would it count would it feel would it feel like anything I kind of feels like it would be just such a massive asterisk that I wouldn't be able to invest. Myself does that make sense no asterisks on championships.

I don't know man when it's a 60 game season with a bunch of weird gim crackery in the in the playoffs come on come on. It would be a very mariners thing for them to do to finally win a world series you know in the coven season yeah. No. I think there's if you want to watch it for it's for soothing aesthetic attributes which I certainly favor all absolutely but one. I don't think this is very good baseball and two it just feels drained of meaning. It feels like the meaning of it is to deny reality. It feels like every game is just a thumb in the eye of of our consciousness of what's happening around us. It's an attempt to just drown us in a is going on and that this is not normal I thought sean sean doolittle said something really cool in a in his press conference when they were starting this up and they were already botching it and he said and this was before the season started and they said. Sports are like a reward for a society. You know like like something something as frivolous as a fundamentally frivolous as a professional baseball league that should be a reward for for a society creating a certain degree of functionality. Hey now we can watch baseball. We do not. We have not reached that we don't deserve it. I don't mean that in a moral sense I just mean that we do not we cannot afford it. Basically. We cannot afford the attention. We cannot afford the mystification of thinking that we live in in normal times because it's killing people. It's literally killing people and it's making it almost. It's making sure that it'll be longer and harder to deal with this than anywhere else god. I know it's cheap to say this and I know it's. It's. It's cringe and I know that it's blue pill It's blue pill hillary resistance coffee.

But you have to admire. I just admire the breathtaking irony of the trump administration spending its first year or so first first two years focused fully on heightening the social contradictions around the issue of immigration specifically who gets to come into america do muslims get to come into the america not on our watch. They're dangerous do mexicans and other south south. Latin american immigrants get to come in absolutely not they're they're they're they're killers. They're killers and now his term is ending and the american passport gets you into as many countries. As like north korea's you literally we can't leave. We can't put that out so we have to watch as other places figure it out better. Although seeing all those knobs in germany running around was kind of nice honestly it felt good to know that they're out there maybe not as many numbers as here but they're out there yeah. America america loved the carcerial state so much that they made the entire country out of the prison. I'm not starting cocaine thank you not much I'm taking legal legal cbd vapes. Germans are the largest ethnicity in america. It's true everett rummage. The host of american of age of napoleon has a theory about the the essential german soul being like warped and I know you know that's that's that doesn't sound very materialist but if you if you organize around the language if your organizers around german and you think about how weird german is and how rich with untranslatable mass multi-syllabic concepts and the way that being able to think that way impacts the way that you view the world. I don't know there's a reason that you know. German idealism is a thing and the pursuit of idealism in a material world drives people and societies mad in different ways depending on the conditions.

But it's inevitable adam. Mckay was cool adam mckay. You know people can say he's a lib and it's like yeah. People are fixed in time and place and but he's made. I think that he has adjusted to reality better than pretty much anybody in his social situation. I can think of. I mean because the incentives run so far the other direction that seeing anybody resist them is really awesome and knowing he's a fan of the show honestly is childhood. Dream come true because I was not bullshitting when I said that that. I knew him as a kid watching snl. Like I recognized his stuff and you know was a big fan of obviously loved. All the bull feral movies but you know his is is still in my opinion. The best the best stuff snl did in like the post maybe like pat since mike since michael donahue anyway but yeah so yeah that was cool. Mckay's cool I'd like to have mine again and yes shout out again to sylvester sloan who if you haven't seen in his performance in the orange julius sketch. It's heartbreaking. It makes copland look like It makes cop land look like over the top boom boom oh no sorry sorry It's it's cop land. It's if the orange julius sketch makes cop land look like stopper my mom will shoot there. We go that's better that's the funniest stallone name I samp.

I sent. I thought jim downey was pretty much well well established to be a conservative. I thought jim downey was like a republican. I thought that was pretty well. I thought. I thought that was pretty well documented. I mean. I don't know enough maybe not.

[66:37](https://youtu.be/PWbhNkuLD-k?t=66m37s)

I think my favorite for laughs per minute. I think someone's asking my. This is my last question my favorite. I think you could should leave sketch and that's very tough because I think they're the vast majority are really really good I think just like laughs per minute. The vanessa bear hog pig dick girl. Lunch scene is just so good but I think for longer more baroque ones. It might be honk if you're horny. It's really hard to beat honk with your horny. Hot dog. Sketch is also very good. I'll keep naming them if I keep thinking it's really good. I can't wait for a second season friday night and I'm thinking that we just might live together when we don't know who we are. This will be the end now to sing a song of the deceased don't know who we are now now. It's saturday and be who we are. I love you mom.
