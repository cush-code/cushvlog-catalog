Uh don't drink all of this. This is for fuddruckers oh well who else will survive. This golden age are just old ideas rehashed where of all all the classic. I used to say there will never be a classic again our repeats itself. I've heard a tale. There will never be a skeptic oh yeah cause there is nothing new. I've heard. It said there will never be a classic again. Our voice self doesn't tell but it pays to be a skeptic. Oh yeah cause there is nothing new where do we go from here. Where do we go from here where do we go from here. I've waited all my life to find a new age christ. It does not impress me what do we need. Right.

Now is a culture revolution I've heard. It said there will never be a classic again art repeats itself. I cannot tell but it pays to be a skeptic oh yeah cause there is nothing new that there will never be a topic again art destroys itself. I never sell but it pays to be a spectacle yeah cause there is nothing new. There is nothing new no more fuddruckers. No more fuddruckers folks. I've actually only been to fuddruckers once I'll admit it and really my pain now is that I never got a chance to experience. It again what if you could pick your own toppings on your burger. That's what it boiled down to if anyone has never been because it's not really a huge chain nationally. It's not um. It's just funny named and it was famously parodied in idiocracy where over the years it turned into butt. But as a as a brand as a concept I always was. I found it comforting you know just something so perfectly stupid hey. Here's a place that kind of sounds like a sex where you can pick your own burger toppings which is true of basically any pete burger restaurant.

The only difference is that they're in front of you and you get to feel like you're contributing. It's the perfect little fake little doohickey. A little uh like a hamster wheel for you to get out any a sense of like personal uh autonomy in your life. Like we've already constrained human freedom to mean the freedom to buy and they even but that gets limiting so you have to give people little micro choices within their choices to broaden their sense of autonomy which is of course entirely illusory. Because what difference does it make from saying give me a burger with lettuce tomatoes. Onions mayonnaise and some of the jalapeno sauce versus going and putting them on yourself. It's a sense of action. It's a sense of participation you're incarnating your will in action. But it's the same thing as just telling them what to put on it. It's just a little hamster wheel of of agency and it's called fuddruckers.


Ah god. It rules and it leaving really is. I gotta say you can kind of feel like the lights are getting timed one by one. I mean i. I don't want to get too apocalyptic because I genuinely don't think we're headed towards a terminal crisis anytime. Soon. I mean obviously anything can happen that could change that black swan events and what I mean we're in the middle of one and who knows what else could come on top of it. And climate is clearly going buck wild right now in a way that could be very unpredictable and lead to like almost overnight. Instantaneous changes in like distribution of water resources and arable land that are totally unpredictable. But I don't think there's anything to say oh we're in the end days other than the desire for this to be the end days which we all secretly have. I mean there's a reason we're obsessed with the apocalypse and have been since the 90s. It's because we've foreclosed any chance of a future as soon as the 70s ended and that tight and that  uh the windpipe of the working class got closed. There was no more future to imagine and so we imagine the end we imagine apocalypse instead because uh just anything to not be this anything to reveal all of the fraudulence because apocalypse just means to unveil. Some confirmation of the the sickness in your soul is not your fault. So of course we all want apocalypse in somewhere now and we get and now because everything is so dire.

We get to address that in righteousness and and in political uh um and most importantly for people who get a lot of online just uh satisfaction from building a political identity. A sense of being politically intelligent and politically uh canny like oh you guys think that this can turn around you fools you mount banks. You think we can go back to the 50s and I know. I said that yesterday but what I mean by that is is only that we can't return to a distribution of profit. Like we had in the 50s. We will have to overcome capitalism to return to a like a a horizon of a future for people but that's a process and it starts politically and in the meantime you can wrench things away. It's just it's going to be ha. It's going to have to be more uh militant it can't be. It can't be. We can't assume that we can get back to a transactional relationship with politics that's going to effectively bring about change. We're going to have to move through that level. Though that's why I have no time for people who say we need we need to like marshal revolutionary forces.

Right. Now we need to like go to the hills or arm people. There's not enough there's not enough people who even understand what's going on have any kind of political context for their alienation and their in their dis and their panic at the moment and there's no no reason to believe that if a crisis got deeper you would be able to channel anything because you don't even speak the same language. They do you have incorporated you have created an entire identity around a political self-conception that has a a private or at least a semi-private linguistic value system that is not translatable. We have to move through these dead structures and it's horrible to have to do that we're thrashing around inside a  rotting taunton.

But we have to do it because it's what we have. It's the only way to keep us us warm through this dark night of total like d socialization de personalization depoliticization. What we're in for is more the same but slightly worse as awful as that is to think of we're probably probably in for more of the same but worse and that means we have to deal with the structures we have and we have to work to resurrect a basic belief that we have any kind of control of our destiny and bernie. I think was the genuine start of that at this point though we have to move beyond bernie. I mean that's pretty clear. His his relevance is fading quickly that doesn't mean we grab new heroes that doesn't mean we try to turn aoc into bernie. Now it means rebuilding the sense that people can act politically and most people like it's one thing to get a re.

Once you're the big issue here is that a lot of people seem to think that if they can get people to understand that there's a political dimension to their pain in life and that that that that pain can be alleviated through collective action that they you can convince them. Once you've convinced them of that to skip right past any political uh uh electoral engagement in conventional politics to like full fully radicalized uh militancy and you can do that for some people. I mean that's how a lot of the people who feel that they are that political persuasion became politically radicalized. They just had a phase transition from apolitical to radicalized but the thing is that is that is a I would argue. A rarer occurrence than the more likely thing which is people have to be brought through stages personally uh of political consciousness. They have to first engage with politics and then be disillusioned with politics to move forward to the next level. Because the militancy people are imagining involves.

Significant physical personal risk and people only do that if they feel like it will have efficacy as we've talked about like they have to feel like they're stressed. They're fighting might be necessary and the thing is most people aren't going to be heroes. They're going to want to find the path of least resistance and for most people that means psychologically forgetting about arguments because arguments don't really convince people of things psychologically. Most people will say what can I do with this new understanding of politics that will be productive without risking my life and the answer will be elections and of course you'll say no no elections are no good don't you see and then you'll explain to them why but guess what they haven't felt it. They have not actually experienced a solution with politics so they're not gonna take your  word for it. Some of them might but again I am talking. The the the weight of like the prevailing psychology of the average person is going to move towards personal safety. They're going to reason around that and so that means that there's an alternative if there's a political dimension a political act axis of action that is an alternative to direct confrontation with the state that could lead with their imprisonment or death. Most people not all are going to take it that doesn't mean that they're going to stay there and it doesn't mean that they can stay there does mean they have to be brought through the process and one of the p and people who don't need that part are going to play their role in pulling them along. But they should not be trying to abolish this thing or like make some sort of pointless propaganda argument in favor of like mass radicalization that ignores the fact that people have to move through psychological steps of awareness. For the most part. Very few people can just flash fry themselves out of one mindset into another because reality intercedes the passions that made the moment dissipate and their sense of vulnerability. As a person is brought back into focus over time and then and that is only intensified by their int they're moving through a world of pain and fear and desire and their attachment to it.


Somebody is agreeing with me that lovecraft country is terrible man. That's a bad show wow if that's the standard now of a prestige show and I don't know if that's the consensus. I don't know. I don't read any of that stuff anymore so. I don't know what critics are saying about it. I used to I used to read all that. Av club stuff when I was trying to convince myself that prestige. Tv was the highest form of art because I didn't want to read a book um but do people think it's like a good show like a really good show because it's terrible uh. It's one of the worst ones I've seen that has any kind of uh like reputation and certainly on hbo which is supposed to be still a cut above the fillet of the tv genre as jeff daniels would say in uh squid oil. It's dog. It's very bad. I mean the fact that everything is cgi including all the creatures is very bad. Obviously. It knocks it down a whole letter grade.

No episode could be better than a b from that point but man it's like it is the worst case. It's the worst. I would say that lovecraft country is the worst worst possible scenario of the politicization of culture that we have had in the last like four or five years specifically under obama. But we're really intensified under trump whereby the only axis of value that a piece of art has is its political content because I think the argument a lot of people would make is. Things are so bad now and the need for people to both have their pain felt and to try to wake people up to the horrors. Around them means that the only real that piece of value art can have especially popular art is speaking to the moment and I must say my only rejoinder than that is watchmen but even more love and I thought watchman was bad lovecraft country even worse and even more an example of a program that only exists to be political to say something to make everybody uh good people to get all those white privileged folks watching tv to turn into non-ones and all the white people who are already feeling good about themselves to feel even better about themselves and my argument. I point to that show and I tell someone do you really think that this show is going to save us save a single person from a hate crime or bring down the level of police violence against minorities in this country or do a single solitary thing for anyone except for the specific black people involved in making the show to make their lives. Better do you really think that do you really think a culture of tv that uninspiring and flat and alienating from an aesthetic perspective is going to do anything other than appeal to people who already want to feel good about themselves who are going to like the show and watch the show to reaffirm values.

They already hold and everyone else is going to  ignore it because the only people who like that show I would argue are people who are getting a frisian out of it from like look at me. I'm watching the black revisionist sci-fi show look at me. I'm. I'm reckoning with the sins of the of of whiteness and the and the in the erasure of black the black experience and I'm correcting it right here and now there's no other value to that show. The performances are dog. The effects are hilariously bad.

It has no atmosphere to speak of incredibly flat and of course. Its political content is dog food served up to just a bunch of hungry slavering labradors. I knew that in the first episode when they scored they scored. I told them about this already after I saw it. I still blew my mind. They actually put this in the show. They scored a montage of racist incidents befalling a family traveling through the south in the 50s or 40s or whatever with. I mean my god if it had been like like a change is going to come by sam cook that would have been heavy-handed enough. No no no no we have entered an era where political uh content has to be so heavily loaded that that the abstraction of music is too far is to anxiety like oh. No they're not going to get the point they scored it with a james. Baldwin speech just him talking about racism well while watching it.


What like the whole point of  images and that are supposed to like go off of one another and produce like individual associations. That's like an artistic response. This is just layering  throat so. I say if this is art under that rubric. It's it's. It's a failed as on its own because it will not work on people because it's not good art.

And I don't even mean. I mean if you're if you're the type of person who needs to be reached by this. What's fun to watch about that show. What's fun. It's not fun you're not even gonna arg. You can't even argue that you're gonna bring in people who otherwise wouldn't want like have their mind expanded by by that kind of racial content uh because they're not gonna watch in the first place. So it's not. It doesn't even have even though it uses genre even though it uses genre which is what's supposed to be like the the thing that gets people in the door because it's plot focused and ex and it can exploit uh like horror elements and violence in order to keep people watching even with all that even with that hook. It's still dreadfully boring and uninteresting and I see people praising this program and I think this is dark man. You guys are just going to suck your own dicks in this cocoon of righteousness producing art to make you all feel better about being white or being privileged or if you're not white and privileged in making it getting to participate and tell your story finally and stand in for the exploitation of millions who like you and everyone else is going to be doing their own and it's going to be just falling down the mountainside. So I have no competent no no patience for any any culture first politics of any kind caring about any of this stuff representation in any way what's good or bad art it's dog.

Because yes yes the superstructure reinforces the base by giving us our ideas like imaginative framework that we carry out capitalism with which is crucial and changes the way we relate to one another. But it cannot be clipped at that source. It cannot be clipped at that source look what happens look what all that effort brings you to something that's just re uh recuperated by the structure which is funny because you'd think these. Pomo people would know that that's like a key like french puffs modernist uh take like. I think it's derrida or. I can't even remember one of those frogs recuperation. All this all this all this anything that gets brought up in like in the culture and gets turned into like a cultural meme is then commodified even if it's brought if it uh if it's motive.

Original emotives was genuine uh uh hostility to the capitalism and like you know the reason they used to call them. Exploitation movies is that rather than being art rather than coming from a place of expression of creative endeavor they were assembly mills where they would just take us. They would exploit a certain stock character or subculture that would guarantee an audience or or a indulgence to the audience. Like violence people love violence sex people love watching sex. Hey black people don't have movies for themselves what about if we see sex and violence with black people. You know there was rednecks plantation in the same era because there were a lot of drive-ins in the rural south. It was all over the place and there wasn't like national distribution of films. Back then there would be like uh distributors would go like on road shows with like a bunch of  uh films and and then show them like one theater and then move around the country that's how dolomites started being distributed um and so they would go to the south and they would blow these movies with like hillbillies shooting each other in the butt with buckshot and like there's a hilarious uh spot. On there on the back of their union suits and everybody would have like a jug but those were that's that was a thing that you could exploit in lieu of the art and this stuff this lovecraft country stuff. Like this it's like it's political exploitation. It's like exploitation. It's exploitation. The wokeness stands in for the art people talk about it and people watch it because they get to participate in a ritual that reaffirms their political virtues and and those of their friends and that and then there's and that whole and that fills the whole of the like actual art.


That isn't there did. I coin that because I wanted i. I said that I wonder if I heard anybody else say that I might have invented that I'm not sure. I don't want to. I don't want to say right now. I invented it but I i might because I might have heard it from someone else. But I think I invented that  but it's true just think of how much art uh how many things have you seen how many movies and tvs have you seen. And I think this is one of the things that this is a perfect example by the way of how and there's actually a sunny.

It's always sunny episode in the last season that dealt with this perfectly. There's this uh there's a there's one of the things that powers the really really stupid cultural arguments. We see is that I think the real. Motive for a lot of like the white male rage at like woke entertainment and video games. Yes a lot of it is based on genuine racial anxiety about and and gender anxiety. I'm not going to disagree especially amongst the most fervent people. But I would say that on the margins which is where most people are because few people are really committed to this insanity. Like this insane fight over culture they they wear their their cultural indulgences lighter. They mean less to them they're more distracting but but they still care enough they wanted to be good. I think a lot of like these white young dudes. They see this stuff that's. Now it's bad because capital has totally dissolved the artistic input on almost all art forms including our precious prestige television and what is filling. The gap is this easy lazy wokeness to give it cultural cachet and to give it like and to give it most of all a way for critics to say it's good hollow. It's yeah fine whatever like. I said a hole that's filled with wokeness uh and like how you look at the way. People talk about shows specifically critics do they talk about like art.

I guess somebody said about exploitation in gamergate well. That was the scent that was the uh that was the kernel of truth and the thing is there's always a kernel of truth to every argument or else. People wouldn't make it that's something people have a hard time with because they say no no no everyone. There's correct arguments and wrong arguments and people hold wrong views either because they're stupid or because they're lying and people on art and on the internet. Mostly assume that you're one or the other in reality they're a kernel to truth to both sides of any stupid uh. Uh sim simplified uh argument on the internet but you but both sides have to deny the other that that privilege of anything being true because it undermines the totalizing nature of that argument in reality.

The  and lovecraft country's a perfect example. But it's not because it's woke that it's bad something else would be filling that hole and it would be just as bad. I mean they might like it a little more because it was like more indulgent to their to their interest but it would still be bad. They just wouldn't notice the badness as much because they would have other elements in it that like satisfy them instead. Other people would find it worse and be alienated by it so like everybody's looking at this impoverished cultural landscape and they're seeing a mirror of their own desires in it so like the white male reactionary see. Art that doesn't cotton to his sexual desires doesn't continue his hierarchies of racial expectations and stereotypes and identifies that as the problem with it but that art to somebody on the other side is seen as a recognition of that person. So they don't notice the  as much as the other one does so when they're arguing. They're not arguing about the correct premise because they're arguing about whether like this representation is what's bad when that's not the reason it sucks just like if there's something that is more indulgent to uh to like white male tastes and hierarchies and racism and all that stuff it. Its badness is easier to be perceived by people who are alienated by that and so the white male guy says no this is the good stuff and the thing that's good about.

It is the hierarchies and the white maleness and all that  and it sucks yeah no like all that other stuff it's like. I said exploitation. Movies are exploiting the stuff that the lizard brain audience that at that point was mostly young men that's who went to the movies back then that's who went to the movies in the 70s. Those young dudes what do they want to see. They want to see blood and guts and boobs and they want to see uh like obviously if they're white. They want to see the racial hierarchies that make them comfortable reaffirmed and so that's what they gave them. But there was blaxploitation for hey what do young black guys want to see and they got that now it's flipped the audience who's getting pandered to has changed. But it's still pandering and the stuff itself is not is still as devoid as hollow as it was back then uh yes cultural marxism that is such a stupid concept you might as well just draw a giant question mark in the air and say. I don't know. It's like. It's like. Uh. It's like. It's like political economy dark matter. You're just there's this this thing. Here you know they're all in charge why because they have a plan why what is the plan uh. It's to make us less virile so that it's all  conspiracy theory. It's conspiracy theory. It is because otherwise there's no way to make sense of it.

The way to make sense of it is to say that over time culture becomes more accepting so that the uh pool of people who are in some way still like moored to some sort of political project right like it's easy to have a high. Like you have a a polity that has to submit in some degree to being ruled through a combination of coercion and adherence to a belief that they're part of the the world like part of the state part of like a a political a political entity and that they're like a stakeholder in it. So. It's a combination of both for everybody and the closer you are to power and and comfort the the less coercion is involved but it's a mixture for everybody uh and there becomes a time when in order to maintain like if demographics change. For example uh you have to become more culturally accepting to keep more people bought in that they're part of this thing called the united states. Otherwise it becomes unstable. It becomes ungovernable and you have to do that especially as the uh. The material benefit from being an american in the in the middle goes away right as as the as the as the wages of being in you know the american uh uh working middle class working class. Middle class go away uh and people get more alienated from a sense of political participation at the center of what used to be the economy you have to increase devotion outside of it in order to stabilize it in order to stabilize the system but what's driving that is the slow stripping away of of all people's economic uh. John economic lives as as as surplus falls and is the ability to distribute anything to labor of any race dissipates. It's purely a coping mechanism.


It's a way to blame something without going to the to the fundamental cause of all of this misery and once again you know there's no way to win any of these fights and it's yeah like that's what's so frustrating talking about this stuff and I'm very sorry because it is so abstract and it's so got. It's so hard to grab on to because at the end of the day it's just a it's just a it's a hobby for people to talk about you know yes. It's. It's part of our cultural firmament. But it's being reproduced at a level that is untouchable by any of us. All we get to do is argue about it and get pulled away from ourselves and each other by the by holding by by the anger and by the by the passion we put behind. These these pantomime battles so yeah uh yeah. I won't talk about that anymore. It's very frustrating because well because it's it's the most. These conversations are the single most perfectly compacted balls of inextricable false reading and and bad faith and and uh and libidinal like reinscription. Like this these are the opinions that where you seek out ones you disagree with to get off like stuff about culture man like that's where people politics sure but politics downstream from culture like at this level. This this is where breitbart was right like the culture of politics yeah. It's it's.

It's all generated at the symbolic level of entertainment and then it flows down to politics which is just a more concentrated form of entertainment that a few appeals to fewer and fewer people over time as it like suffuses and yeah uh as whopper said in war game. The only way to win is not to play so there's no way it's like. I'm not gonna go and argue about why lovecraft is bad on the internet. I'm not gonna write an article. I'm not gonna contribute to the takes smith. I feel like. I got this out of my system like once again. I'm a lot of this is me talking my way through like why what I think of this stuff. So I can see if it makes sense um but yeah it is not. It's not to be engaged with because it's getting everybody everybody is getting off on it. It's a bunch of perverts. I think squibs. I won't. I won't talk about squibs now. But I like the squib discourse because that's that's a little removed you know from like pure the purely cultural elements of uh of art. Like the culture war elements. There's it's actually got a kind of a material grounding. Theoretically everything else is just it immediately flies off like when you're trying to scatter donny's ashes. I didn't really watch the venture brothers that much I appreciated what it was going for.

But uh. I don't know at a certain point. I guess. I just kind of got the point rip. Though. I know chris is chris and amber and I think virgil are all big fans. I used to be into wrestling when I was a little kid. I liked wwf superstars and then I got into it in college again because of the rock but then I stopped. It's been a long time.


I have not seen the kaufman movie yet sinich dutch gg. What's it called synagogy schenectady. New york sinich joche new york that one's a tough watch man that was brutal. I saw that in the theater uh it's gonna be. It's gonna be hard to get me to sit down and watch that one after that one. But I probably will at some point of course. I've seen the righteous gemstones. We did an episode about the righteous gemstones. It ruled that's how the good lord work. I love adaptation that's still my favorite charlie. Kaufman movie written anyway people keep telling me that asked me to have a tenant review I I'm not going to the theater anytime. Soon that's for sure certainly not to see some  dishwater gray christopher.

Nolan movie ugh talk about. I mean just there's a slight digression by the way. I really don't take any of your moans about like the decline of culture because of the sjf just jw vacation of entertainment and like the dethroning of the white male auteur if you're sweating christopher nolan because christopher nolan is a perfect bubble head and the things that people see in his movies are purely just like a clockwork plot mechanics that they are elevating because that's where the heart should be and they're filling it in with that. I mean my god. The guy can't even really shoot action movies that well. That's our action scenes that well that's kind of crazy if you think about it. Like his movies. Almost all of them have been action films and he has what's a great action sequence in a christopher nolan movie. I guess what the the joseph gordon-levitt floating hallway thing i. I barely remember that like if you're looking at nolan and going like this is what we could have more of if it wasn't for all the uh all the women and minorities making woke movies now. Uh then sorry no thank you your your world would suck just as much and like most of his movies are action films and he has he has no memorable in my opinion action sequences nothing that has stuck with me. I remember being really impressed by inception when I saw it. If you look at my letterbox review.

It's very high but that's one of those things where I was. I was. I was cop like when I'm talking on here uh a lot of the times. I get angry and people think I'm yelling at the chat. I'm really not I'm yelling at me because I am talking always about myself. And if people find it meaningful. It's because my experience resonates in some deep way with theirs and that's it and I was in a state of mind where I thought that plot complexity and like this kind of stuff was serious art. It was like bridging the gap between mainstream mass culture and high culture. No it wasn't.

I just was a lazy  who wanted to see movies where the slow car was going and they're like oh. But that was his dream and then that was his dream and then that his dream was his dream and you get to marvel at this absolutely hollow mechanism um the battle of gotham you mean when the cops who had guns charged headlong and a bunch of guys who also had guns to have a fist fight and of course you can forgive that if it if it feels good in the moment enough but that's all I was looking at it was sterile. There's always there's always a risk when you talk like this that people are going to go oh yeah old man you're just bitter because they don't like make them like. They used to huh grandpa and the thing is yeah that's always an element of all complaints about people about the new modes of art that they weren't like initiated to at the right age. But there also is a steady decline in quality of average art as capitalism infiltrates and annihilates the artistic impulse that makes art. It's just a question of like what percentage is your critique one or the other and that's up for the other person to decide. I mean. I think I made a pretty strong case visa v my arguments about squibs and cgi that we use that in at least the the main like taking one genre action films examinating a concrete way that over time these movies have been made worse in a way that you can complain as just not being used to digital effects or you can see the flip side of that and see as a genuine difference that's for you to decide and then you ask yourself that and then you can answer yourself. How does how is it likely that that effect reverberates throughout all of our mainstream art art forms.


I would love to go on. I would love. People say go on red letter media. I don't get that choice. I don't get to do that. I sure as I'm not inviting myself on someone else's show. I'm not uh no. But if they had asked me. I would of course go no question. I would really want to hope to go wait till after quarantine though because I would really love to go to the studio and uh to the best of the worst around the table then do rather than do. Like this online culture like they're if you if you if you topped out at movies. You're less tightly wound than if you topped out of politics I think and uh they and then you can get really tightly wound and po on. Movies like say movie bob or devin ferracci or you can be nicely adjusted around movies online and they did that so they're much chiller they're way too chill probably never listen to us anxious politics dorks banging on about. So they probably have no idea who I am so but no one tell them that gavasan please please don't do that. I just please don't do that do not do not tell them to get me on do not do it. I will be very mad at anyone who does because I'm telling you not to.

I'm not winking. I will I will excommunicate your asses yeah. Exactly they just went a thing with went through a whole thing with william shatner because of some ogre eager oafs. Please please be cool please be cool. I would love to get felix on rogan. I think that that's fine because I think rogan might respond to that kind of thing. I have no idea how he how he works but somebody somebody should tell rogan to have felix on because I really think they could vibe no. I don't feel like. I don't think felix patrol rogan. I think felix would go in ernest uh fully confident that he had like a base of see that's the thing. I you know people get anxious about going on places that are like not ideologically uh friendly because they worry about getting rattled because they worry they think they would be insecure. They would be nervous maybe not even because they didn't think they could like deliver on because they really didn't believe their beliefs. They might be totally secure in their beliefs but they might be worried that just the thought of all those people listening and watching could get on them and and give them the yips. The only way you could go on a show that big would be. If you had full confidence that you would have like a base of a rapport with with with the host and prevent just getting off into into oblivion and felix 100 would go in there totally uh confident and I think would make for a great conversation.

They could just vibe on. I think they could vibe on uncles for a solid hour. I don't. I like. I think the the danger of like if I if I went on rogan. I don't think I would ever would but I mean I would if they asked me my god. But I don't think it's likely uh. I would be worried and it would not be about confidence of ideas and not even about being able to like connect with joe because I think I know enough about joe's. People like that show is insanely popular. So. I would. I would probably want to. I would. I would absolutely have to get high beforehand. I mean I i uh no question. I would have to definitely chew up but if I tuned up. I think I could. I could do do okay with with joe.

I know that we have a pretty decent audience but uh you know it's by this point it's self-selected. It's people kind of already like us and that and that in that vein you know we're able to find purchase. It would be kind of. It would be a little uh. It would be anxiety producing to imagine stepping out of that bubble and having to confront a broader group of people who aren't necessarily on your wavelength and have to like you have to translate it a different frequency. I would definitely go on mayor pete's podcast. I would go uh in mayor pete's go on mayor pete's contest podcast uh right before right after it taking like a huge amount of laxative and then just. My pants right there oh gwen snyder's podcast. I would do that one for sure. I mean she wouldn't invite me obviously that's a zero zero percent chance of happening but I think that could be a fascinating conversation. Uh biden hiring anita dunn is uh hilarious. I mean the entire biden campaign is just a ritualized abnegation and uh and and the fouling of every sacrament everything that democrats everything that liberals held holy every idea of inclusion and representation and uh and uh feminism profaned in the name of keeping the  upper upper tax bracket from increasing truly monstrous. Oh. I would love to go on gorka show too oh. I would love to talk to gorka i. I would get like uh.

I would go. I'd get really like nitty gritty like napoleonic war. With him like oh the boradino sir would you contend that napoleon aired you know that kind of thing all right today. I got to cut it a little short but thanks for the convo. I know I got a little cranky there. I'll try not to do that again don't want to alienate everybody but much love to everyone listening and watching and I hope. It's less fuzzy today than it was bye-bye.
