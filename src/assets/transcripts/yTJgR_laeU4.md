A little bit too much there too much chester rooney ugh all right. I'm. I'm on tv on the computer computer. Tv way of the future wave of the future wave of the future wave with the future wave of the future. Hey guys so in about half an hour apparently trump's going to have a speech. I'm going to do a react. How's that sound that sounds like fun. He's probably going to announce there's some experimental vaccine that they're going to like fast track which genius. It's. It is exactly what a really dumb guy would do in this situation. What would a really stupid person do tell everybody that there's going to be a vaccine. It doesn't matter if it's going to work or if there is one just tell them and then they'll vote for. You goes well with the hydrochloroquine thing and all the  patent medicines and snake oil.

They've been selling his whole career uh that's the thing about the republican party. Most of all is that they because they fully embrace the notion of the marketized self. The the individuated market actors the only moral node they have no compunctions about ripping each other off all the time I mean we saw it with the gofundme. Kris kobach is a good example uh ben carson and and and trump and all these guys selling old people medicine that will kill them even though they're also their voters that's one of the things that undermines rule uh capitalist rule is is. That is that at a certain level competition is mutually destructive and competition for for favor within a structure like the republican party.

Uh is also similarly self-defeating in the long run but in the short run it can be incredibly effective ah but that's because as I was saying yes the other day I was talking about how uh democrats are like. They're not just consume they're not just enthralled to this overpowering superego. I would actually say that democrats function as the superego of the american political system and the republicans are the id and the ego is capital and it has to be kept in check or else. The whole thing will destroy itself and the fact that the uh the very s the things within that suka superego model both as a party and this is the psychology of people who choose to become.

Democrats eventually undermines the superego's ability to actually check the id in any significant way leading to a death spiral towards oblivion. But this is interesting because the vaccine is like the third rail of all the queue stuff because people have noticed that one of the things that has made q expand faster than it might otherwise have is that a lot of relatively apolitical anti-vax people have grabbed onto it which makes perfect sense uh. I mean anti-vaccination ideology is perfect expression of alienated uh of isolated atomized alienation in capitalism right. We have people totally disconnected from any kind of uh any kind of uh even like mental conception that can get around the idea of a vaccine because in a in a society that is increasingly technologically uh complicated and necessitates increasing levels of technological sophistication.

There becomes a bigger and bigger uh psychic gap between specialists and the public. I mean we genuinely actually think that you can. Uh that people should just why don't you believe in science like. I'm sorry what are most people's interactions with science in their life. They got a combined 100 hours of instruction from a  bored uh gym teacher about about mitochondria that they do not remember because anyone who actually went to school will can tell you that the sh if you don't get continued exposure to something you will not retain it. So even if it ever stuck it was gone by the time you're an adult and then you're just told by this technological priesthood. To do this thing why you haven't you haven't ascended the ladder of of of empirical and rational thoughts that get from regular joe to someone who knows why you should have vaccines because we assume that science is apolitical oops.

Oh sh turns out. Nothing is damn owned again owned again by the political reality than the fact that that's what reality is. And so there's so and because the democratic party is you know the party of uh the party of freaking science and facts they're hostile to the anti-vaxxers. But the thing is is a lot of these people because it's a cross section of people and it's sort of a natural outcropping of different uh social phenomena. It's a reaction to different social contexts. A lot of antibiotics people do not have reactionary social views and so they don't really want to be a republican either until and then q comes along to solve the puzzle to to provide what no one really other had no one else was even trying to do which was a broader uh uh uh context for their specific alienation and what that means is that once and so now q has a bunch of people who aren't really along for the ride on trump. Specifically that came later vaccines were first a lot most cute the q people the original cue and like this is how this is how religions and political uh movements always splinter because you have one group of people who emerge uh to begin something or sign on in an early stage because they have fixation around the certain thing that that at that moment is represented by that movement but over time the movement changes as conditions and events occur and as people respond to it and join it bringing in new concerns and so you end up with over time. Sort of these these fissures along lines of who showed up when basically because that's going to influence what your what is what you cared about like q got all the they sopped up all the trump psychos very quickly because they needed an explanation for why things weren't changing why they didn't feel like they were winning even though and even though all the libs are being triggered every day. But that's something that a relatively apolitical anti-vaxx person doesn't care about. They don't need to square the circle of why epic. Uh mean trump is not uh pwning the libs. They don't think of things that way but they do care about vaccines and here's a movement that says hey here are the people who want you to be vaccinated. And here's the people who are trying to stop them okay. That's donald trump great. But if uh if he's really going out there going vaccine folks you gotta love it.


You're good bing bong and then you're better. It's like magic. I said it would just go away and it did. It's going away bye-bye by christmas. There's gonna be no more comment by christmas and we're going to be saying merry christmas by the way we're going to do it. We're going to say merry christmas and we're all going to be alive everyone. I'm talking to everyone who hears this will be alive. I promise because we got it that's going to  rattle the cages of the people who actually care about vaccines and that could cause a little fracture. Now if vaccine doesn't really show up until biden oh that will only solidify the connection between the gop. On one end. The the heuristic sort of the social heuristic uh of q in the middle and then anti-vaxx alienated sentiment on the other end just a perfect uh uh or the other way around. I guess. It's the perfect conveyor belt from from anti-vax sentiment to the republican party because now you will have uh the entire democratic party aligned around ending covert as quickly as possible so that biden can be as much of a contrast with trump as possible. Like people were dying like flies and now we got biden and there's a vaccine and so there's going to be. This huge huge democratic pressure to get epically uh down with the  owning vaccine and that's going to only compact the snowball even tighter and since there's a lot of native anavax sentiment because there's a lot of native alienated anti-technology sentiment basically neolithism.

Because people have no investment in these technologies they don't know why they exist. They don't know how they work and they don't even see the benefits of them okay so now that people are saying. It's a blood plasma treatment so we're talking about like a serum like at the end of outbreak like a synthesized thing of blood. Uh that might make a difference for some people. But I gotta say that most of your vaccine people might not like that. But that's enough of a distinction that it might be able to just like keep the keep the defection to a minimum oh my man and especially if it's all. And it never appears which it probably won't realistically then when we do get a vaccine under biden. You will have the perfect morality play of epic trump was going to epically save us with a real epic science and then the lizard people using biden as their puppet stole. The election and then instituted the vaccine you will see upwards of a 40 refusal to vaccinate. I would say you will almost have you would have something like that 35 to 40. Higher an income of course higher among the republicans. The higher the income the more likely you would be to just take the vaccine because the less you need q the less you need to reconcile because the better things are going for you and so if it's a choice between keeping the charade up and doing the  uh proofs and being able to go to uh to fuddruckers. That's not a hard call but as I have said and someone can explain to me why. I'm wrong about this.

If we get a vaccine say in a year and a half or let's say let's be optimistic biden gets in we get a vaccine within three months which is not wildly unrealistic. I mean it depends on who you talk to because there's people who insist anything less than anything younger earlier than five years. Isn't gonna happen but I've heard other people say that it could in this case you have so many  people out working on it that if you're sharing information at least you could expedite it much more fast. Whatever let's just say early early biden term right. After the 100 days say we get a vaccine uh so we get a vaccine under under him that will be telling them. They intervened to stop us from getting cured from the disease. They gave us in a way that would have stopped us oh no I'm sorry. I got off my train of thought so there's a vaccine that comes out like three months after biden that means people start getting it and I know people are worried well what if you got 40 percent who won't take it and like I'm saying it's gonna be 25 to 30 percent. Maybe 20 let's say 25. We're talking like the hardcore oh my god. Maybe 30. Uh what's is that a big deal other than to them you know like yeah. They're gonna keep getting covered and they're gonna. They're gonna be thinned out but for everyone else can't you just go back out because everybody you see will either have also been vaccinated or even if they have it.

It doesn't matter because you're vaccinated am. I wrong about this wouldn't you just be like oh. I'm vaccinated. Now. I can go outside like you wouldn't even need to have little bracelets to ensure that people were vaccinated because if everybody is vaccinated or they ha or they have it then what's the problem and I guess. The question is well. What if you have it but to that. I say there are only there are certain things you can do in certain things. You can't do and force back forcibly vaccinating that many people is a thing you can't do and still have a democracy. So. I'm sorry you're just gonna have to you're just going to have to work it out yourself. You know you'll either catch it and be cured or catch it and then get over it in which case hey you got anybody. It's great come through the party you'll catch it and die in which case that's too bad. But what do you want people to do about it uh or you'll eventually get the vaccine like what is the I'm not talking about if it works or anything like that. I'm saying hypothetically if it did if it was an effective vaccine would not what would the difference be about whether or not we could actually like reopen and try to reestablish normality big big lol on that concept. But what would what would an effect how would it affect how would the question. I'm guessing what I'm asking is and someone answered me now after I've clarified it. What would what is the actual consequence like in terms of what is the consequence of a mass refusal to take the vaccine on the project of reopening uh the public spaces and allowing people to go inside places and go to baseball games and all that stuff. What is what what is the what is them not getting it. How does that stop you from doing the other thing see people are saying well.

Some people can't get vaccines sure but that's not everybody if you're saying people are gonna die sure but how do you stop that okay. So everyone is basically saying it comes down to the poor unfortunates who can't get vaccinated and can't depend on herd immunity to which I say that sucks. But what do you do about it realistically if the because the only alternative I'm reminding you is some sort of coercive vaccination program on millions of people are you willing to do that and more importantly do you think that the political capacity exists for anyone to do that in this country someone says vaccine is not effective if everyone doesn't have it. If I'm vaccinated then. I can't get it right. It's effective in that way. What I'm saying is every person who's vaccinated now has a simplified risk calculus of going outside you're saying no getting vaccinated. Doesn't mean you won't get it okay. But it significantly increases the likelihood. You won't get it right. What is the percentage like if it's zero you have zero protection. What is the what is the uh amount that you would uh be protected. Someone give me a uh percentage like if I'm gonna get if I'm gonna get a hundred exposures to covid what percentage of those would be prevented from turning into infection by the vaccine 69.

That's funny. So it's not. It's not a guaranteed cure. But it is a significant prophylactic is what you're telling me. This isn't it's like you're saying you're acting like there's no like a distinction doesn't matter like you either. No no you could get it. Therefore it's as good as not getting one and you should act like you didn't get one and I don't think that's true.


I don't think you guys are assessing risk properly. You guys are talking about hurt immunity. I'm talking about individual person getting it. I need someone to distinguish. You're all throwing numbers around here. I need what are you talking about in terms of I get it how many times out of a hundred will. I not get corona if I'm exposed to it that's not. I'm not asking about herd immunity numbers. No they're not the same thing oh my god you can't know in. Advance is what they're saying but it's more than zero right. It's more than zero what I'm all I am saying is that you if you could get a thing that millions of people could use and would. I think millions of people would get vaccinated immediately wouldn't you just go outside wouldn't you just go to the ball game at that point aren't you tamping it down enough that everybody except the most freaked out people are gonna be fine with going out. This is all. I'm asking I'm not asking. I don't know the science is beyond me. I'm not that guy. I'm asking about the social psychology of reopening with a vaccine. Even if people don't take it. You guys are all like getting well. No no people some people yeah. I'm talking that's an individual calculus of someone who's incredibly online and focused on this  and filtering. I'm talking about regular people.

Hey there's a vaccine now will. They not just go out and could they not probably just go out until it's a sure uh until it sorted itself out. I'm only asking because are you guys who are fixating on these numbers and worried about all these people are you saying that we should forcibly vaccinate millions of people. This is what I want to know so that's what I'm asking. I'm hearing yes I'm hearing forcible vaccination okay. I mean if you think that that's the right thing to do a feasible thing to do or the smart thing to do. I don't know what to tell you. I'm saying realistically. What happens is hey everyone's freaking like I'm just saying is that there's this like oh. No we're gonna get a vaccine and it won't matter because people won't take it and I am saying no we will get a vaccine. People won't take it but everyone else will just kind of go along with it and it'll eventually sort itself out. That's what I'm saying and yeah you can have like an incentive structure. You can say like hey you get like a tax refund if you get the vaccine or something although that's a bad idea because then people who would get it otherwise just say we'll say they won't so they can get the money. He says. No somebody says eventually after another 50 000 dead no biggie you people. It's amazing how this happens all of these moral questions get cut off from each other and and examined individually and and say and through a lens of of total isolation like a butterfly in a  82nd airborne at vaccinating people. Those things have to be held at the same time in your hands. They're not considered individually. I mean yeah you could do. I mean obviously you do the thing of uh you can't go to kids can't go to school if they don't get the vaccine yeah. Duh. That's easy. That's not that's a no-brainer. But there's you think it's just gonna be kids. Of course. There's one app the other option and this is I guess you would argue the most moral option and that is you get the vaccine people won't take it. But then you don't reopen the economy and you don't let people go back out again and you keep things closed down because of that hurt immunity and those vulnerable people and that is another one where I think that is more morally defensible and in fact morally superior and abstract to either the other two options. But it is.

I think similarly inconceivable both as politics and as policy. So I just. Want to know like when people are arguing these things in isolation. I like to bring them back together and then ask people like you. You you want to make like these very strident demands of the moment. But that means that you have to be willing to embrace the implications of those and this specific instance. I'm referring to it's mass forced vaccination and now the virtues and advices of that as a policy uh. I'm not that interested in talking about because it's never going to happen. But I would just like to say that I think that they're pretty  complicated and it's not a no-brainer and it needs to be considered when you're considering other things. But uh if there's a blood serum. I don't think it will actually ever be released which is too bad uh because it makes way more sense to promise that uh he actually it's a kind of amazing the brazenness of it right before the uh right before the midterms. He said we're going to pass a bill a huge middle-class tax cut we're going to pass it middle class tax cut midterms happened it. Never he never mentioned it again he gets elected. It's like blood serums out the windows. He could just say all you'd have to say is we looked into it and it looks like the vaccine is gonna be better. It's gonna be better. We're gonna wait for the next seat okay. We're gonna wait. We're gonna wait for the back seat uh and if that happens then you will definitely see some stress within the q community over the over the question. But if it was real and they did actually put it out. There wow I would not take that that's. I would say that just right now. But. I would be very interested in seeing who did and what happened as a result and you know what it might be good. It might work but I would certainly want to wait and see. I would not want to be in the first wave or second wave of getting that thing so now. I want to speak uh wait a minute.

Somebody said I won't take the trump vaccine and that that's like the the trump people. Not thinking. This is not a vaccine people are saying that's the whole point is that they're saying. It's some sort of blood serum and that they're like pushing it through experimental trials or whatever considering what these guys like to put out as public. I would not take that and like. I said it doesn't even exist. I mean in terms of it being a real uh uh product that will actually be available certainly before the election. I mean the hydrochloroquine thing was just an earlier version of that find a thing that exists to throw it at so that people will stop freaking out about it and now my pillow guy has got another one which is apparently even more deadly to the to people who take it more poisonous than hydrochloroquine which is very funny. Uh yeah they don't care oleander right. That's it yeah. That's why mike lindell is my pick for the guy. Everyone says who's going to emerge from after trump and a lot of it depends on does. Trumpism survive intact or does it break up if it breaks up. I think all bets are off and a bunch of options come up. Tucker. Carlson gets brought up a lot. I think that's potentially true. I have less. I'm less sanguine about any of the politicians the actual political figures because they're such stiffs uh but they could grab. They could like pick back up a chunk like the people who used to be ted cruz people before they decided. Trump was the king maybe they could be weaned back towards regular politics. The the the people who are trump from the jump are not are beyond help so that chunk is going to have to be suborned somehow uh because they will only take the reddest meat.

But I think the my pillow guy you know. I think he's got it. He's got the story. He's got the just dumb guy voice and attitude. He's more authentically himself. I think than any of these other people including tucker  carlson who is as phony as a three dollar bill. I know these guys like him but come on trump lies more than any american president ever. He lies compulsively but he is also the most authentic president. We've ever had and I don't know and I think that's what they're addicted to. I think that the real trump heads are addicted to that and that's a lot of people now in the trump in the democrat and it's not everybody in the republican party. People say the party is trump. Now. It's like that's because of the array of forces like they like trump because libs hate him and and like it's a context if he's gone then. Their calculus changes. If there's another option their calculus changes. But that chunk man they're not going anywhere and they want authenticity more than anything and that's why they're never gonna. Holly uh. They're gonna need they're. Gonna need the real. The real thing just a person who even if he's lying to them is lying them from a place of sincerity if you know what I mean uh and that to me the only figure on the national stage right now who fits that is my pillow guy. What I mean by trump is authentic is that he is transparent. Trump does not have an artifice. He is naked raw need. He is naked raw agreement as are his fans. He reflects their experience in in a magnified fantasy version. He is them someone who has spent their entire life getting basically what they want and have been driven insane by it and so that connection is more authentic than the connection between any paul any president and any chunk of the electorate in my opinion my pillow guy putting money on him uh so.

I wanted to say something about the snyder cut which is apparently coming and I'm very excited. I'm glad. They got it and someone had a very good tweet the other day where they said because now there's the teaser toilet teaser a teaser trailer for it out and they said uh. They said that people hate the snyder cut people because they're the only ones on twitter who actually ever got anything done by tweeting and I thought that was very very correct and astute. But and that's why I can't wait to see the movie though because snyder really does represent culturally a very similar figure uh to trump in that he is such a a figure that has been fixated on at like a psychic uh libidinal level like at the level of fantasy at the level of identification. There's been a psychic infusion with the concept of zack snyder that is similar to the way people feel about trump and it's from a subset of people uh who are essentially the same sort of stunted manch child as most people of their age right. They grew up in the same culturally desertified america where the the cultural output was such that they never had any pressure to move towards anything challenging. Artistically. They stuck at the level of adolescent art but they're and that happened to a lot of people.


It happened to me you know. I'm trying to break through that. I'm reading. I'm reading again and I'm enjoying it but for a while there. I was just like turn my brain off just at the level of junk and I'm gonna critique it through a lens and that makes it smart. I'll fully cop to that and that's that's an endemic phenomenon. But there are some guys among that who are cursed with a specific alienation. A specific uh uh discomfort within the culture usually around some sort of grievance uh that makes them aware that they are enmeshed in a in network of kitty  and at a deep level dissatisfied with it. But unable to break out of it. They cannot transcend the thing because they aren't aware of the conflict. They don't know what why they're actually dissatisfied. With this cultural context. They don't know what their soul is really crying for which is something transcendent. They can't even see it they're they're like dogs as they said and dogs can't look up as they say in sean of the dead uh. They're unaware of this of the thing.

That's actually the engine of their dissatisfaction and so the way that they uh that they manage that the the the gap between the art that they kind of are aware dimly that they should be consuming and what they do is to take the garbage crap that we all consume and divide it into kitty  and adult real art. They don't realize though that they are already working in the limited horizons of the culture that they live within and that the real problem is that they aren't pushing through them. They aren't resolving the contradiction they're trying to to sublimate it and so that's why they hate marvel. I was like marvel is kitty. This is for little children now zack snyder that's real art and then they have to and because they know at their heart of hearts that that's not a convincing argument because they're not convinced because they're so miserable they're still unhappy with it. It doesn't work for them. It doesn't provide the sucker that they think it can't. They have to put off that extra energy onto resentment towards people who would deny the reality that they are the adults that this is serious art and so they they fixate on fighting on behalf of uh of snyder within the cultural realm.

If any of this sounds familiar by the way please let me know if any of this rings any bells in terms of the way the culture well conversations and political conversations are conducted and who's conducting them let me know and so that's why they demanded the snyder cut because the snyder cut is prestor. John the snyder cut is the resolution of the contradiction. The snyder cut is the movie that will finally validate their point of view. It's the movie that will finally give them the transcendent experience that they cannot receive from the limited stunted art that they consume but still believe is possible because it could be produced by sac schneider if the feminist. Sjws didn't stop him because they were too triggered by how awesome he was he's he's going to he's going to redeem them he that that's that movie will redeem them and that's why they fixated on so much. But within these kind of questions the worst thing in the world is getting what you want. It is absolutely the curse because and the reason they're not happy now like they won. They actually did it. They succeeded and they're still out there screaming at everyone who is even mildly disrespectful to zack snyder or to his the  trailer or whatever like why are you mad dude.

Why are you so pissed you won why are you so pissed. It's because they know deep down that it's not going to do it. It's not now that they have it. They're not going to be satisfied with it and of course when they see it they're going to be blown away. It's going to result. It's going to sit there for a while. They're going to have triumph in their hearts but it's never going to do what they want they're imagining it when they're defending it. The movie in their head that they're defending now is not the movie that they will see it can't be the movie they will see. It will be less than it will not complete the circuit that they think will because no movie like that can complete the circuit that they're demanding of it. They will then be left to start the circle again and and turn it and and you know what it'll be the argument will be.

I don't feel the way I should about seeing this because those  those marvel scumbags those sjw pink hairs. They didn't like it. They didn't recognize how good it was. They didn't recognize that it was great because the wicked flea would not pursue it. They know it's not great they know deep down. It's not great so the person reminding of them them that of people who are reminding them with every utterance that it wasn't that great will drive them insane and it will turn them towards the same cycle of resentment and there will be an and because as long as zack snyder makes movies. The next one can be the one. The next one can be the promised land. They'll be pie in the sky when you die and on earth they're just going to stay. They're going to be mole people digging through the cultural dirt looking for a nugget of  and screaming at everybody else because they can't reckon with the reality of the insufficiency of what they've been uh consuming and it goes the other way too. The marvel soy people who hate uh zack snyder uh they. I don't think they would argue that it's that I think they would they would be like you think i.

I don't understand uh that uh marv that comic book movies aren't great art uh buddy. I know they're not great art that's not their point of delusion. They aren't deluded that this is great art. This is adult uh entertainment which it does not. It is for kids and that's fine kids can watch it and adults can watch kids movies and enjoy them. You just can't make it your entire. Sugar. They're just eating uh they're eating the frog. The lucky charms all marshmallows every day for  somebody's poisoning them or something. They think the sjw's or something somebody or whatever poison. But the marvel soy people who like gesture towards higher higher. Uh higher intellectual expressions because they watch prestige tv they don't really read I mean and maybe they read a few books. They read more books than the snyder guys do but not that many more and they watch better tv shows so they would say yeah no I understand. But this is mass culture and we have to deal with it and it has its own values and I'm fully. But they fight the same war. But it's along a political axis. Not an aesthetic one. The snyder movies are problematic. The snyder movies are dude bro. The snyder movies are toxic masculinity and fascist and make people go on school shootings and make the world a worse place. Marvel movies are about inclusion. Marvel movies are about acceptance. They're about everyone uh recognizing uh the epic witness of diverse multicultural uh america and so watching them and enjoying them makes me a good person. The snyder guy doesn't care about being a good person. He's just  the marvel person. The soy man of the marvel world. He sees himself first and foremost is good smart too of course. But he has more pretensions there because he has in his mind has something other than marvel that he can point to even though it's not much better. Even though it's it's like oh wow you have the lucky charms with the uh. The the grain part for dinner every day much better. But it's enough for him to see a distinction and distinctions all that matter. The only thing that matters is that you notice a distinction. What they care about is being a good person and watching this  makes them feel good that they're good people and they're advancing good and they're making the world a better place by telling people to watch black panther. But they are and so the question of like well.


How come things are still shitty. How come the world sucks dicks through a straw. Maybe your actions aren't enough maybe what you have decided is your activism is hollow masturbatory  cider people they keep putting bad culture out there if we just had soy epic marvel stuff if that was all that was out there oh man we would have pie in the sky. When we die. We would have a just society and we would be the vanguard of creating one. It's these. And so they have to epically own the snyder people. But it's the same process. It's it's a laundry. It's. It's a cultural laundering of alienation and in this case alienation from the self alienation from one's deeper aspirations because of the suffocating blanket of cultural uh hegemony produced by a mass market capitalist cultural productions and I hope and I want to re re reinforce the fact uh the re-emphasize that that phenomenon that that the structure of that dynamic that's universally universalizable along every axis of politics when people are unaware of the source of their dissatisfaction around a part of their life. They find a a spectral cause that they can engage with uh at the at a removed level from the reality of their of their alienation and uh despair and then they are met by people who have a similarly uh allied uh alienation but find them to be this the the symbol or the their ideas or the phenomenon to be the symbol of their of their hatred so oh. The thing started all right I'm going to go on twitter here and see if anything's hashtagging oh they want to who's hashtagging who's trending who's trending in hashtagging.

I just started the august book shout out to david dixon who sent me a copy of his book. The book that I wanted to write back in 2014 but lacked the uh scholarly rigor or training. Uh language skills uh attention general brain power to do and uh when I abandoned it. I felt kind of reassured knowing that this story was so good. Someone was gonna  do it and I did an inebriated past about willach just so that something was out there uh and now there's a freaking uh a book by david dixon called radical warrior. That's the life of my boy uh david dixon and I would like to shout out to him for acknowledging in the very second sentence of his acknowledgments. How much of a  it is to translate froctor uh on old documents that's actually the thing more than anything else. I have very bad german skills. I took it all through college. I never got it in my brain. It's like math. There are certain symbolic orders that my brain cannot really process at least not in a way that I know how to like push forward without just giving up out of laziness and that is languages and uh are foreign languages and numbers. They don't work for me and uh so that really hurt. But I figured I could like  it.

I could like you know kind of squint at it and get maybe help. But it was trying to get from the fractured german to even. German could never do it. But I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. I'm just glad. Somebody wrote it and it's like. I'm. I didn't write it but now the good. Thing is is I get to read it which is more fun definitely than writing oh my god that sucks all right uh. Let's see.

Nothing's trending yet is this thing happening. None of the trending topics are relating to uh to eliminating to trump does. It have did they did they delay it. I'm gonna go to cnn here. I'm gonna go to the fake news media. I'm gonna go to cnn oh yeah. I gotta turn that off jumps coronavirus announcement convalescent plasma so is this treating it after you get. It is this a way to treat it. Once you have it or is it a prophylactic for it. Yeah see they're saying. It's been used to treat patients. But that's people who have it that's different like what people want is a prophylactic because nobody wants to get it. It's like hey. This is this will make you less likely to die if you get the thing that like permanently scars your  blood vessels. Yeah thanks yeah they're not saying if it's treating maybe he'll say.


Today. It doesn't look like he's out yet. I don't know um yeah. It's not good I mean he's just they're expedite. They're gonna expedite. It come on come on. You really think it's gonna. If anybody thinks this expedition. Uh is is consummated by november 5th. There's a couple of bridges in the near vicinity that I live in that. I could  sell you there's zero percent chance that's going to happen but it'll be a big thing that his supporters can wrap in their head as a reason that he needs to get reelected and it might work on a few saps but at this point if you're that big of a sap. I think you just already like biden you know or I mean sorry if you're a big enough zap to do that. I think you're already like on board with trump uh. I have no idea yeah. He's going to say we're going to expedite it and that's really interesting is that I was reading. The article is that they're saying that like this is stuff that's been tried in europe and fda or the fda is is holding off because they need more confirmation and of course trump. Just gets to say no they're doing it to stop me from winning. They don't want. They don't want a big win. They're doing it and it's like once you've exposed the meta that way in politics.

You are have ascended to god mode because you can neutralize anything. It's a question of getting 51 of people to accept that line of reasoning that's the problem if you just if that just satisfies his base. That's not enough like we're really in a question. Like this election really does come down to the planet middle right so you've got the two we're talking about the three balls of people right. You got the republicans and the democrats and you got that third floaty ball in the middle of people who do not feel not necessarily that they might vote more one way or the other. It's the more important thing is that they do not consciously filter outside events through a partisan lens the way that republicans and democrats do and these are the guys that are for the jump ball and they're essentially being asked to respond to one of two fantasies and I think this is probably true in every election. Two projected fantasies of reality uh one from trump that 170 000 people is a totally acceptable number of people to die during a thing like this. Uh it's all the chinese fault anyway and you know those state governors uh and what about fauci that guy's uh guys. He's very very very bad. He's very bad for me and the other who says joe biden writes his own speeches uh and actually joe biden.

Uh can fix all of this and that this isn't just a systemic problem that's going to continue until uh it like runs into either technology or calamity which is basically all of our problems. Now like there's either going to be a point where technology intervenes to to uh inhibit collapse or uh. It just keeps sliding off the  pool table uh but no no biden's going to fix it being's going to make any of this work. Those are two fantasies and I'd say the one thing that gives trump a edge there and I think that is the thing that you know. I'm not one of these people who say oh trump's definitely going to win or watch this horrible convention and say look at how terrible that is biden's doomed. I don't think that's true at all. I'd say biden's still the favorite uh. But he could absolutely lose even in this situation because that jump ball is being attested by these two fantasies. One is biden's gonna fix all the boo-boos and he writes his own speeches and he loves you and he loves ice cream and he loves america and he loves his family and he loves his dead family and he loves cars and did I mention. He loves you and your family. That's the other one trump loves you trump's stopping. The bad guys not even trump loves you. They hate you and I'm the one standing between them them and you and they're the reason. All these people are dead and they're the reason everything's bad and I gotta say that one has a lot more going for it as a narrative because think about how q spices that up like what is biden biden is trump. Bad naughty man uh cheeto russia good guy loves america jesus loves. You trump is cannibals want to eat your children. I mean how do you beat that as just like a brain stem narrative and of course the thing that prevents that from being the way the politics goes because if that worked everyone would do that.

But they don't because there's credulity. It has to be a credible thing. It has to align with the perceptions of a large enough group of people and that has generally been the thing that has prevented demagoguery from going too out of hand within the democratic system as we have it. But the problem is is that that's eroding credulity is eroding as the internet dissolves her ability to distinguish reality from fantasy completely and at a certain point people because of the stream of information. How fast it moves throw up their hands and grab for some epistemic life preserver to make sense of it and since it's all it's all flow. None of it is material. None of it connects to the world. It's just a spectacle then credulity isn't a question and cannibals want to eat your children connects. It does not have to go through baffles of wait what because everything is everything else. Everything is just the flow. It's just a giant river of  why would that matter. I don't care or he's bad and he's bad for people. Most folks aren't thinking that way that sanctimony is not something a lot of people center in their politics. The way that liberals do the way that liberals do they do in their own ways. But there's a specific sort of public sanctimony that goes along with the liberalism that liberals generalize and that is a mistake so which of the things am I going to believe. If I if if it's all the same. If it's all just if it's all just a way out of the maze. It doesn't matter am. I going to pick cannibals are going to be your children or joe. Biden writes his own speeches.

I mean my god at that point. Aesthetics enter into it and like pleasure enters into it and and what's more pleasurable than the idea of playing in a giant cosmic space adventure. I mean it's almost like scientology. It's like scientology was I want to take like the vastness of the jets age. This this world where god is dying and out of his rotting corpse brings this metal marvel of technological innovation that can end and and bring life anywhere at a moment and allows the idea of a god to be embodied in a man. That's tempting feels like anything's possible in that moment and hubbard was there to say it is and q is. Uh q is similar in that it's similarly totalizing out of the moment because of course. Now it's a moment of catastrophe that was a moment of triumph that was america transcendent resplendent america unbound. This is american decline q is scientology for an american decline but has the potential to because the client is much more accelerated uh and the social order is much more frayed so that  like crackpot world views have fewer uh resistance points to have to go through they'll turn into gamma rays and just pierce your ass it becomes more widespread but that was mormonism too 19th century. The amer the reality of the american frontier had an implication and it was of godhood for man and the mormons they were. The they were the most sensitive antenna to connect to that just like the scientologists were to that moment in the 50s and now q is in the current moment of crisis and reversal that's gone but the need for the narrative. The need for uh transcendence uh is that is everywhere and there's an alternative to it. There's an alternative transcendence to seek of course to the cue fantasy of annihilation and uh and the ragnarok. It's that good old thing socialism. It's kind. It's world communism baby. It's expanding the human spirit until it encompasses all into one self-aware being a world spirit. If you will. It's the only psychic alternative.

It's the only way to tac the only other way to attack your boat. Everything else will drift you eventually towards annihilation everything even if you think you're creating a third way well congratulations it might look good for a while your path might look good for a while but eventually the current is going to pull you over to obliterate obliteration and annihilation. Eventually you will resolve all those contradictions towards suicidal destruction or you orientate torch yourself towards the awakening of the world spirit that you might not get. There you might have a life of reversal because you can't control events. You can't control the tide but god damn it. You can grow your muscles as you  paddle and you can maybe get there and along the way you gain abilities to maneuver and to continue attacking towards righteousness.


If anybody is cute in the chat please let me know. I would be interested that's why the idea of trump never mind. So there's a number of people claiming to be cue in the chat darn how am I going to tell one from the other. Oh well talk about belarus what would I what do. I know about belarus how would. I have an informed opinion about belarus oh. I want to say one thing about that uh the I don't even remember the tweet about oh not voting in the elections like going to going to a restaurant. There's a bunch of things wrong with all those tweets like there's also the david sedaris one about if you're on the airplane and they give you two choices for a meal and one of them is chicken and the other is. In their kitchen. Maybe you should get out of there. Uh it does the specific idiocy of those metaphors is beside the point. Although it is manifest and manifold uh the react the thing that's hilarious and basic is that it's all viewing. They're telling on themselves.

They're subconsciously revealing that the reality that they see I mean that they see voting as a consumer choice. It is p. I mean the like add buster  ma when when when trying to create a metaphor to describe the voting process invariably settle on the metaphor of a consumer choice when you're pick when you get to things and the thing is they're not wrong about that. It is they think that's good that's bad that's wrong. They think that that is that means that that is a sufficient expression of like some sort of civic democracy. No no no it is insufficient as insufficient as consumer choices are to stand in for real freedom because if consumer choices can stand in for real freedom what is your problem with any what is your problem with libertarianism. At all because the libertarian idea is freedom is the freedom to choose as as friedman put it and specifically the choosing the market that's freedom that is libertarian notion. That's what undergirds neoliberalism if you uh if you think that's bad. Then you don't think that our voting system should reflect that same structure because you know it's not real freedom because if it is real freedom just be a libertarian be a republican. No I'm saying voting would not be a consumer choice.

Voter voting would be. It would be a culmination of one's political life not necessarily that you'd have to like be you know posting not that you'd be posting all the time but that you would have political investment in life you'd be in a union. You know you would be managing say some sector of your employment like I'm talking about should here. I'm talking about hypothetical say. We had a real existing socialism like you would be directing your work life from a position of authority of of co cooperative authority with the fellow workers rather than subordination to management. Voting is just an expression a bureaucratic expression of of of of those democratic structures. It's just a signal point within a corpus a social corpus that contains the economic and the political and want that is that is that is what voting should be and more importantly voting.

That isn't that cannot truly direct the democracy in a way that can that can that can lead that can create sufficient change for the moment. Let's just say that it can move things it will. It will absolutely move the flow in one or another direction but it cannot do it on on the timetable. Let's just say that the current moment requires in terms of urgency around certain questions of ecological viability for example and I think you could say well what about what next what next is the challenging part. But a lot of the reason that people don't go to what next is one. They don't really want things to change because they're smug right which rich liberals or they kind of know there's nothing to do and so they freak they don't know what else to do so. They clutch that thing that they think they can control that's why they fetishize the vote so psychotically because it stands in for a bunch of freedom. They know they don't have and the first step towards breaking from this mind. Control is to recognize that this consumer model for democracy is is not operative is insufficient to the moment not that you can't participate in it not that you can't run for office. The people shouldn't run for office and voting should happen but that it is insufficient as a sole basis for politics which is what it is now everything is a spook but the thing that sterner didn't get is that the ego is the biggest spook of all. The ego is phonier than the rest of it.

The phoniness and the fakeness and the and the delusion of the ego is what generates all the  social spooks in the first place. It's the it's the uh the containment grid that gets shut down at the end of ghostbusters and lets everything explode outward. That's why the only way that uh we could have a social order that allows for real freedom and to banish. Some of these most harmful spooks is to diminish the ego not to reify it as the soul uh aperture of meaning good lord. It's it is a it's a it's it is a genuinely counterproductive delusion. We need it in order to navigate physical space but over time it pulls us out of a social fabric and makes us able. It makes us create structures that enable the delusion of separateness are ghosts real. Maybe. I'm now fully on maybe am. I agnostic now on all para paranormal uh stuff. I if aliens exist. I would I would bet that they were probably uh extra dimensional rather than uh extraterrestrial well the extraterrestrial technically yes but not not distant in the current moment in the current universe. That's what I mean but maybe. I got the shrugs on all that because how the hell would I know. I just think of all that dark matter just sitting there you know. I think of all that dark matter everywhere all over the place and how the hell do. I know what's in there.

What's he building in there. What's he building in there. I do love uh that marx wrote more words denouncing sterner than sterner wrote himself which I find very very marks of him. He would have been he would have loved the posting wars. That's the thing but but but the difference is is that he existed in a cultural context when posting was praxis due to the emergent nature of uh of media and the still tight uh social bonds in emerging uh working class neighborhoods. He has subscriptions to those magazines he never waves when he goes by he's hiding something from the rest of us. What's in there what's in that there about dark matter. I think I know why he took down the from the pepper tree. He has no children of his own. You see he has no dog. He has no friends. His mom is dying if biden wins and things keep getting really terrible and q-related political violence. Uh starts spiking this is gonna be the song of uh 2021. This is going to be every every other every third crack-headed or just crack-skulled suburban q guy whose mortgages do maybe grandma died of kovid getting closer to sawing the end off of a shotgun and going to the local democratic party headquarters or papa. John's well no not papa john's that's the good the pizza of course.


There's also enough formaldehyde to choke a horse someone says second civil war second civil war. They say antifa versus on. I don't think so guys. I think that's portland. I think that's portland you can see it as a prefiguration and I think it is pre-figurative in certain ways certainly a way around the way that uh what law enforcement is responding. I think that is pre-figurative but the social element. I think might be specific to that context the specific social dynamic in portland between antifa and the proud boys and a prayer circle or whatever the  to me. It feels sort of sweet generous or relative or more like like a concentration of elements that exist in other places. But that in portland are so specifically uh condensed that they lead to the cycle that I don't know is generally generalizable. I don't know I am saying once again from a position of ignorance. I'm doing the shruggie as always doing the shruggie chiving keeping calm and chiving on stay frosty stay thirsty. My amigos.
