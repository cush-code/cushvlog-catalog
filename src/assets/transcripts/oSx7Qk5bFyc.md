Um so hi guys sorry. I'm just trying to make sure that I properly credit someone for the inspiration for the episode title today. I was I did a tweet last night about or this morning. I think actually about the debate and how the only message that either that was sent being sent. There was the bodies of the two people on stage and that the message was we're die and someone replied with the flesh screams for those who hear it and that stuck in my head.

And I want to give a shout out to appnubz for for replying to me with that because it's it's now the only thing I can think of when I think of that night which I'm gonna be thinking about a lot because for me let me finish this for a second for me it delivered on everything. I was hoping. It would be one second so I know everyone and I know I was saying beforehand. There's no way this thing's going to live up to what we want it to be or what I imagine. I guess what I wanted it to be and sure enough of course.

It couldn't because what are we waiting for we're waiting for some sort of fracture moment which will never happen because the system is embedded in will always normalize it which is why as the thing was happening as these two demented fossils had exactly what everybody said would happen if they ever debated a confused random ejaculation of of stutters and and um and placeholders and circular wording around nothing because their heads are empty because they're not there they're at the point of most people's lives where the doctors they just give you prescriptions for anything because hey let them have fun with it who cares it doesn't matter if they get addicted or whatever they're not going to run out of traffic they're at that stage they're at the let's have fun stage of drug use for elderly people and they're supposed to be in charge arguing about the presidency and it took me a while obviously to realize it and it didn't come fully to me until after I'd finished watching it. But for me anyway. This debate was that apocalyptic moment not just in the sense that it has given me now a a memory and a memory that I can even revisit by even watching one minute one second of the footage that will snap me out of the mental shackles of trying to invest the actions and especially the words of either of these two people and trying to ascribe meaning to them and trying to figure out what the future of this country and this planet and myself and the people I love is based on what they say there is nothing there they do not know anything they don't know where they are and the reality of that is too terrifying to admit so even people who were horrified by the whole thing how many of them in the aftermath of what we all saw decide to start arguing about whether or not donald trump was issuing a coded message to the proud boys to intimidate people at election sites to which I say did you just watch the debate. If you watch that. I don't know how you can imagine that there is any point to parsing the words that donald trump said in it or joe biden. There's no content it is meaningless.

They are syllables. This is dutch schultz's last words. There's plenty to be afraid about obviously in terms of where we're headed politically economically ecologically whatever you want to do. However you want to talk about it but they those two men are not going to be the authors of any of it. They're not going to think up anything and then make it happen. They are front pieces for systems much vaster more horrifying than either of them could be.

Those are going to bring us towards our if it happens some sort of apocalypse. But what is more likely is just going to be the slow continuing grinding and miseration of everyone over time which is why my main takeaway if you want me to get horse racy with it from all that is that biden's going to win and handily kind of make a joke of the whole thing like win by a surprising amount because when you saw that people talk about oh trump is alpha or biden said x y z. I think that trump is not out of his desire not out of his master plan because he is a figurehead because he is this figure of psychic energy that so many millions of people put their focus on either because they hate him or they love him. He will He has created a political culture now that is way overheated like given our decrepit 300 year old constitution and you know our non-functioning government and minority rule and all this stuff the checks in the bounces. All that beautiful stuff that worked when the government was just a fake little ornament for all the richest dandies who spent too much time in the library and needed some place to hang out while the real men did the work of conquering the continent like when that's when when when park congress was just this parlor game for the wealthiest in the country where the mass majority people were either too busy making money or making other people money to give a world destroying colossus at this point and and all of these populations that in the american the early american era under the early constitution were not even part of the political calculus like native americans like african-americans like women are now part of it.

All of that increases the cultural heat but what's driving the cultural heat is immiseration is how bad everything is for people day to day not just the cheeto in chief and not experience. It's worse for people than it has been in this country. For a very long time. It only gets worse and so trump is this figure who is like. He's the sorcerer's apprentice rising up these giant gusts of popular animus both against him and for him that cannot be contained by our rickety ass constitutional system. They are out of proportion. The question is really are they out of proportion to the crisis in the system or does. Trump provide a specific and I think we're going to find out on election day obviously forget about coup and counter coup and proud boys at the ballot box. I think the most likely thing that's going to happen is the rubber is going to meet the road and as many as as bad as it is for people in this country. It's still relative to everyone else in the world pretty damn good and now more than ever. We're no we know that we know we still have something to lose even the people among us who are suffering because you're not suffering as much as somebody waiting to get in this country on the other side of the border fence or somebody.

In a dinghy in the mediterranean and so and of course we have the fact that we've depoliticized half the people to don't not even see a political answer to any of these problems. I think that we're all going to look at ourselves and trump will be the option of keeping ringing the bell and keep it frenzy this frenzy of urgency and I think that a good enough people are just going to say no no no we're not do. We really want to because if we rail if trump's president we're going to eventually have to have a civil war like we're gonna have to have one forget. The material conditions trump being president will stoke us beyond everything and we will make that leap into action and violence and then people will see. Other people do it and be inspired and join and join and you actually could have a civil war. But I don't think people want one not the people who vote in this country. I don't really think they do and I think that sure you know obviously. None of this applies to trump's base because obviously it doesn't saying that point doesn't mean anything. I'm saying for the people who he needs to elect him. I think more are going to be like yeah nah. This is not my.

I'm not going to get a gun. I'm not going to stand in front of a walmart trying to fend it off from blm or whatever the. I don't want to do that and biden is the alternative to that and that's why. I think he's probably going to win and kind of maybe hilariously by a big margin. Like he's at the cuffs now in these pollings of going between like a clear electoral win and just a blowout now of course obviously polls polls anything can happen but I think that people just like ask yourself this question do you feel like we're in the material conditions to have an actual materially based civil war as in as in a battle over resources not ideas battle over resources in this country when there's still mountain dew coming out of the taps. Do you really think that's true or is the orange man screaming noises that we're all trying to listen to and make sense of but are noises. Animal noises hunks honks and utterances. It's like we made like a backyard and you all decide that he's a he's a learned pig and you're. Gonna gather around him and listen to his oinkings and try to figure out what he's saying and then he's going to be in charge and what he says is in charge. That's where we are with trump. I think people are going to say no matt yeah.

Let's just turn it down things suck and it's bad and corroded and all that but do I do. I want to get shot no and but this comes to the real like revelation point. I had after after this whole hap this whole thing happened is like when I say I think biden's going to win based on the debate. It's not based on anything that was said by either of them and there's no point in parsing anything they say that's that was my great revelations that I don't have to and I'm gonna try not to and you guys can yell at me. If I don't. I will try not to talk anymore in public or even as little as I can to myself and my own internal monologue about trump's statements about biden's statements about what they mean about what he's signaling about nope. The stakes are still high and saying saying that doesn't mean don't care about the election of course care about the election. The stakes are very high. I just said we keep trump in. Here we could push past the precipice just because of how hyper saturated with politics. Every fabric of culture became becomes under him. It could happen I'm betting though that there's still enough elastic there's still enough resistance in the band before the snapback in terms of material conditions in this country where you're never more than 300. feet from a taco bell or even getting a car to get one and as much as they're still misery in this country. The most deeply abject missouri in this country is felt by people who aren't involved in any of this and don't vote and don't aren't even aware of this president to hear the coded messages to his army of nazis or whatever.

So if you want to do horse race stuff you can look at poles and you can just take a temperature temperature check of where you think the material conditions are. You don't have to care about any of this and you can be entertained by it but you cannot try to pull meaning out of it and I've I and there is a distinction there because the moment that really what got me. There is that I did in fact do a lot of drugs for a fair fair. Carpet right now for the um for the debate because it did seem like this like this thing coming together. These two guys is so symbolically freighted that I'm like okay. I have to know what this is and it has to mean something to me. I have to get meaning out of this because if my life which has been organized around things like this having meaning like my professional life and before that my my my spiritual life. I guess you would call it before I really knew.

I even had one like my attempt to grasp towards politics and I got it because what I found myself doing in the middle of the debate was being caught between the the the totalized moment of these guys yelling at each other and chris wallace piping in from the sidelines and just having overwhelmed me the sense of like how how how hilariously fraudulent the entire terms of this are like this was an emperor's note girls moment of oh yeah. These guys aren't in charge of anything. These guys don't run matter what they say and that was smashing against my need to like deliver commentary and like respond and that would get me connected to like fact checkered brain and like trying to put these in rhetorical sex and like well who said that and who's going to benefit from that and imagining what joe six-pack thinks of it even though. I don't know who the that is and it's just me that those two things couldn't be contained in the same moment or I tried to. I held them in my head as long as I could during the course of the debate and then afterwards. I just had to sit with myself and be like okay. You can hold those two thoughts together as much as you think you can you cannot keep them together because you will lose the deeper realization because I could find my. I could feel myself getting pulled towards forensic dissection of this. do an autopsy on a turd and I said no no no oh that's just going to make this worse because you find yourself this anxious point waiting to try to figure out what's being said because you can never know you can't know oh He was signaling to the proud boys they're going to show up and kill everyone on election day. How will you know that until it happens or not you will have no way of knowing you are just done. You're you're shifting through that auspice and I realized as soon as I saw people talking about well did does he signal to the proud boys. I don't know. I think he was being mistaken and that was actually two different questions.

It's like that's cue that thinking is q and on thinking even if it's coming from people who are politically sophisticated and fact-based and reasonable and on the left like the actual like serious left not even the liberal left. That's q thinking. That's what the q people do and that's what we're all going to do all. The politically minded people do as politics detaches farther and farther away from material conditions. It becomes more and more a spectacle that we have to invest with. We will all turn into q if we keep our mind. On these ins. These things having semantic weight. These specific terms words and phrases having meaning that we have to decipher instead of there being just a totalizing reality because that's what q people q people are in that same box. Like they recognize the sham you know like they don't understand the terms of it.

They think it's satanic pedophiles or something instead of capitalists. But they understand the terms that this country that they think they live in is a nightmare and someone is making that way someone with power. Like they do recognize that there's power. There they just don't know where the power is because they're tube but they're also from that realization trying to get to truth through discrete decoding of the words of people like donald trump and so that's how you get them saying like oh everyone's. All the pedophiles are going to get executed in march 15th because look at the three letters that he misspelled three words. He misspelled in this tweet and how it spells out that date or whatever that's the same thing it's not as deluded. But it is on a continuum of abstraction towards just self-destroying hysteria to go through his phrases going through the sentences he said did any of them complete a sentence in that did anyone actually have a noun a thing like subject object per big letter at the front period. At the end did any of them have a complete sentence. In the entire event. There can be no meaning drawn from those things and that means we are no that means we have to disengage from it as as at this point because we're not really powerful. We're all waiting for election day. Basically. We're treating it as an auspice. We're treating it as a as like the the musings of like the oracle of delphi. After they got her hopped up on mushrooms. We're trying to hear the future but we can't know it from that we can't know we can't know the future. We can only know what's around us and the people we love the world we want to see and how we can try to make use all the things around us to make that happen so if you want to watch today.

I'm going to keep watching the debates. I'm going to keep talking about this election. But I'm going to make a concerted effort to remove it entirely from any kind of context of political meaning. It is entirely aesthetic aesthetic appreciation because I'm sorry people who are into politics aren't only into politics because they care about people not like those guys who like sports there's an aesthetic appreciation of politics just as much as they're in for sports and so if we can isolate it and use it in that way. Then we can engage with it but if we take if we take this these gibberish and we try to just rearrange the letters into coherence that is just being provided by our own neuroses because it's just a reflection of what we're thinking. It's not really there and we're not coordinating with anybody. We're not checking our work against one another. We're all making independent judgments and then bashing each others against one another so yeah. I was very pleased with it afterwards. I mean I tweeted right afterwards as a joke. I said it on the stream. I said the real winners of tonight. This debate were the american people because of how hilariously the wrong that was but um as you see people really freaking out after that debate being like oh my god oh my god hyperventilating one way or the other I think it really was good for The winner really was the american people just because I'm not gonna say it's gonna be you know. Some Some wake up moment for a lot of people but it was for me and just in the sense that it took something. I knew but only intellectually and now made me feel it which is all real knowledge is. It's not reciting. It's not having a dry axiom. It is experiencing that in your life and then associating it with specific feelings contexts memories that can then keep you. There. They can when you find yourself straying bring it back and that is what that debate did for me And if you were if you had eyes to see.

It did it for you too. I'm not saying. But I of course was in a very specific situation to be in that way. I cheated. I cheated. I did a bunch of drugs and that because I'm a cheater because I'm a bounder because I'm laosh because I'm a small soul bug creature over here of course. I cheated that's one of the reasons that drugs psycho psychedelic drugs are so dangerous. sort of like your long-term mental health is because what they essentially do in terms of your body in terms of your like body chemistry is they put you in a super advanced state of meditative focus. The kind that can be usually only attained by incredibly incredibly incredibly determined pursuit and it just pops you there like within half. An hour taking problem with that is that that deep meditative state that deep sensory awareness that perception of everything around you that happens at a deep deep level of concentration where you start noticing the porousness of all. These like perceived distinctions and and you truly feel the imminence you know god's grace. If you want to be christian about it or just the just that hum the universal hum of the of the thing that you're all always been a part of and you're going to return to and you're not even not part of now. And it's all an illusion you feel that now if you feel that in a state of that you if you get that from intense concentration which has been achieved through discipline you're in a position to do something useful with that. Feeling you are sitting probably on a mountaintop somewhere in a situation maybe monastic or some sort of pursuit of you know your personal study. It has integrated your life. It has made you live a life that has enough space in it for you to dedicate that much time to being alone and sitting and thinking and controlling your surroundings which means when you get that insight you can imprint it on the world as it is if you get that deep meditative state overnight like that without the discipline as as dr. Ian. Malcolm said the discipline necessary to attain it. Then you have that perception surrounded by what what got you there what got you to that moment. It wasn't rigorous pursuit of anything it was flight from this. It was flight from truth and so what are you seeing now with that deep. Meditative fixation of of sense you're seeing these screaming goblins in front of you. That's dangerous but it can be good too if you can recognize the goblins for what they are and not decide that the symbolic abstraction thing and and have that be adhered to to that sense that feeling of oneness that get that really does transmit knowledge because now instead of learning oh yeah. This is a puppet show you're learning though the puppets are talking to me.

I'm the only one who knows what they're really saying so all in all good debate had a fun time looking forward to the next ones. I think that pence and harris is going to be hilarious because there's going to be a ton of pressure to make that one normal to reassure people abnormality and it'll be funny to see how that plays out. I will say that people are mad at nancy pelosi for saying that thing about how we need we need a good republican party and you know what from her perspective. She's 100 correct. She's not saying anything wrong. What she's saying is that because we do not have two parties right fighting over power. We have two branches of a broader capitalist party whose conflicts are stage managed to avoid discussions of deeper structural issues. We cannot afford to have wild unstable polarization whereby people won't accept the division of government like the the see-sawing back for chinese moments. They used to call it in the 19th century spain that allows the pressures the social pressures to relieve oh all.

These democrats are pretty mad well. We'll get a democrat at the white house they won't be mad anymore. All these republicans are pretty. Bad don't worry. We'll get a democrat in there. That's that's the that's what keeps the the lungs moving the lungs of democracy moving and trump is threatening that he's legitimately threatening that he is raising the stakes emotionally for politics in a way that our system does not want which is why. I think that push comes to shove. He's gonna go and go quietly because he's a mitch. Mcconnelly probably wouldn't even say voodoo but again the answers to these things are not to be found in discussions of the statements of any of these gibbering escapees from a restaurant.

I'm sorry guys it's magic hour back here but it makes it hard to hard to poach. This is all right so. I hope now it'll be very interesting for me to try to watch. These debates with this in mind like with this focusing agent on mine that will allow me to avoid the temptation to turn myself into q by trying to pull meaning out of that. And the beauty of this is that even if it wasn't even if watching that debate wasn't like revelatory to you if you listen to what I'm saying or you hear. Somebody else say a similar thing and it makes sense to you hopefully that memory connected to the debate like the reality of that debate and the memory of watching it can provide at least a fraction of what it can that is provided for me in terms of what I hope to be a practice of avoiding going down this. It's all conjecture wondering what someone else is going to do who isn't you which you can't know it's none of its structure. It's all rhetoric remember we're not talking about we're talking about what is what are these words going to lead to other people doing that that's not at the level here that we need to be talking about um ah man. The sun is really pursuing me across this place. Here all right so. I don't know what anyone else's experience was but for me very very very good and I'm very much looking forward to watching these the rest of these debates through that lens and using my memory of the first one to pull myself out of out of the spiraling because it really does more than anything just make it harder like for me my job.

I do I do care about like being right you know because I care about conveying things that are helpful. Both you know in terms of entertainment but also if it's going to be practical in any way not wrong and every time. I find myself getting into these discussions I've noticed and this like thinking back on. I noticed even more even as it was happening was feeling the anxiety build up but I wasn't really acknowledging or understanding where it was coming from. It was because as I was trying to build up around these specific questions. I would keep bumping up against this insecurity in my understanding because it.

Was based on nothing. I was just guessing. I was guessing what other people were going to do and all. I can do but to do that. It's like well what if I was somebody else well. How would. I have imagined that what would that make me do you can't ask that question how can you ever ask that question. That's why you have to materially analyze things and and I just never it didn't occur to me how deeply that implications of that run because the implications of that really are that you you can't think about what these guys are saying along about what it means. But what people are going to take from it because you can't know what people are going to take from things and so I find myself. I would find myself getting agitated and like starting to wonder well maybe. I'm not good at this maybe. I'm doing a bad job maybe. I'm hurting people by giving them bad advice because I don't even know and it's because. I'm.

I'm wiley coyote running off the cliff with my. Legs blasting around not recognizing that the goddamn crown is gone and it's not that it's not that these guys words don't have meaning like trump's trump's stoking of like resistance. He's gonna get people killed one million percent. He is going to get people killed obviously. He's already gotten people killed. He will get more people killed when I say he will. I mean in the sense of yes somebody will hear what he says and yes he will use that as excuse to go do violence 100. I think that will happen but when I imagine that that's just because I still have to imagine someone else but the question. I can't answer is how many how many boils down to demographic questions. How many people are in x position to have y response when they get z stimuli in the form of trump's speeches and without that information. I cannot move forward and maybe that information is available but I think more realistically for me just cut it off get rid of it. Throw it in the garbage aesthetically appreciate it maybe but remove the the flush remove the flush of of consequence make it into a game and not war like material stuff should be war always and at war you are sharpest you know but but if you're war in this clouds you will you'll go mad so well. It's horrible to imagine violence happening. Because of these awful words of this awful man we have to ask ourselves what can we do about it. We can vote and if you that if that means seems consequential to you for the love of god do it. But beyond that all we can really do is help the people around us and see what those connections lead to where our abilities skills passions uses can be applied.

We can't know that from looking at the chicken guts and trying to see the flight of the forum someone's first episode of season four for fargo sucked gotta say agree not not looking forward to this season. Boy I will say that um in fairness. I don't think last season started terribly strong. But I do think the second half of the third season of fargo is the best the show ever was imo in the first three seasons. It just ended so great so maybe they'll bring it around but the first two episodes were. were a little dire um. That's the one we were running like you don't need me back here right. It's not because oh they're finally addressing race. It's the way they do it the way they do. It is the way everybody does it so it's boring there's nothing unique to it. There's nothing interesting to it and that's because clearly noah. Holly didn't care about this stuff. But it's now being imposed by an expectation culturally and now he's doing something.

He doesn't really believe in I think because it just feels so hollow and that means should there be a show about a mob war but involving like a a black gang family. That like involves you know the deep questions of america's racial history and hierarchy and like what whiteness is and all that stuff and how that like relates to the midwestern identity very interesting questions clearly though he's not the guy to ask though because it's not not because he couldn't in some abstract sense like he doesn't have the talent to it's clearly not what's interests him. It's not what got him into the project but that and that's why we get worse art as things that get more like woke. But the wokeness isn't what makes it bad. It's because instead of a lot a thousand flowers blooming like different creators of different. experiences and lived identities being able to create in an open marketplace well that's not what we have that's not our culture is and that's not how media is created. Media is concentrated by firms. Capitalists knows that city's gatekeepers and like all capital nodes is just a piled high with accumulated and passed down wealth from the first generations of people to take power there and hold it.

I.e white people so when the cultural winds move in the direction of wanting to see voices wanting to see alternatives and and the whole color of life instead of getting experiences from people of all. Those colors lives inflecting this. art we get the same old suits and the same old cottier of professionals with maybe a trickling in of diversity hires and affirmative action cases in order to like assuage everybody's conscience and feel less guilty about themselves. They're gonna tell those stories even though they don't speak to anyone with a creative spirit involved in the productions. At all. It's purely improper compelled from without it doesn't come from within. It doesn't come from those other perspectives that are supposed to be viewed because when we're watching marvel movies we're not really watching representation. Like yes ryan coogler is black. You know but the marvel machinery that made black panther is not black in any meaningful cultural sense and and and ryan cooler's specific blackness or the writer's pacific blackness or frank ocean's specific blackness.

They cannot overcome the corporate swill they're get. They get their their genuine passion for it which is real is deluded because they're cogs in a giant machine and so everything all the culture gets worse and it gets more inclusive and more cynically inclusive and people say see that and say ah. It's the inclusion that makes this bad no. It's not the inclusion that makes it bad it's the way that the inclusion is being infused into this capitalist edifice through compelled cynical utilization which is a greater sign of just capital accumulation strangling art more broadly because the stuff that the anti-awoke people hate or love in culture like guys being dudes and and exploding cars and ownage and all that. That I also dearly dearly love if that stuff is pursued in this context of maximal bottom line and maximal capital. concentration at the top and the need for like pg-13 as to be the sort of collective understood goal rating for every movie that's that has more than a few like dollars of pocket change committed to the budget up from a major studio. That's gonna suck too man that would suck ass it would just suck in a way that would be harder for those guys to notice but and I'm not saying that people aren't going to be moved by something like black panther. That's how bad it is.

That's how deeply entrenched racism is at all levels of culture and how little representation real representation. Any minority sees in this sunrise and no one. I don't begrudge anybody that I'm just talking about the general trend of everything getting worse and then being things being indulged in by the students as a way to get some people on board more than they would otherwise you're alienating some but you're getting others on board and the and the the market equation is in the long run demographically hey who are we going to make more money with catering to the rising diverse young people of america or white incels who make up like the preponderance of the cultural conversation online about media where are you putting your money as a capitalist edifice. This is a no-brainer that just means that preponderantly we're going to see worse most smoke stuff but as things are worse and worse for people. It's going to look more consequential to people seeking anything else to mean anything than the awfulness of their lives thank you for the thank you the haircut.

I did it myself. I gotta say it very at the beginning of quarantine. I was I think. I said it on an early couple early streams. I was like 50 50 At least already at that point that I was gonna shave my head at some point which I think is the guy's version of quarantine bangs and I was like I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna buzz this remnant. This for lauren hope here but I always assumed I'd get drunk and do it one night but you know. I stopped drinking so much more than anything really and I realized. I never got to that point and I'm glad. I feel like it means. I never really hit bottom. Even if things looked a little shaky from time to time or at least my bottom was higher than shaving my head. I guess it just means I'm blessed more than anything ah. I do have a square head kind of right. I'm a square head pretty. Much one time.

Amber found a picture from ellis island online of a guy in like a bavarian dude in lederhosen who would come in like the late 1800s through dallas island and she's and he was uncanny. He looked exactly like me. It was one of those nic cage time. Traveler memes I i gotta find it and post it some time again. She had it on twitter once but of course. Her account's been nuked for a long time maybe she has the I'll find it somewhere. I don't know if I can google matthew chrisman bavarian oaf and find it oh yeah.

I get to finally give my long awaited opinion on the gyro cake. Somebody posted a in the chat. A euro cake that I clicked on and it brought me to what looked like just three euros stacked on top of one another basically that presumably you cut into slices and eat instead of just wrapping. Around. I found it underwhelming so somebody asked if good morning sunday morning was q anon code to the left you know no but give it a few years like nancy stays in power state like biden gets in there and you know we get the lid on a little bit and we kick the can down the road a little bit more because that's just what we're doing. We're just pushing crises past the horizon and that's all it's going to be. That's literally what capitalism is from crisis to crisis.

There's no long-term plan. There can't be. It's just a value form annihilating all meaning and all life. Things are going to be bad enough that the democratic voters are going to get more so ensorcelled that they're going to have the same reverence and like fixated opinion on and analyzing of everything that one of their leaders does so yeah like when 95 year old. Nancy pelosi is still speaker of the house when it which has been like relocated to bangor maine. Because the entire eastern seaboard south of baltimore is gone She'll they will be scrying her words for meaning the way that the q people do for trump good morning sunday morning. I love that so much why why why what okay she's still a mystery to me because you know all those people are. It's all geritocracy. It's all just people losing their marbles and then of course there's bernie who would people point out is just as old but have you ever noticed that he's completely with it and you know why because he's grounded because unlike those psychos he knows he's going to die and he wants it to mean something and that's why he's not lost in in anywhere but himself because in himself his can he can't bear it. He cannot bear to be himself if you're if you're donald trump or you're joseph biden.

You can't bear to be yourself because you spent your entire lives focusing yourself completely and totally around acquisition built around an individual ego and the maintenance of and and reification of that into a world power. Global power that is at your fingertips and you've destroyed countless lives to do it on purpose. But it's going to end and even if you have convinced yourself you're immortal and that you don't think about death. That's just because you've crammed it so far down that it's driving you insane. It's driving you insane and that's what and that's what's pushing obviously like you know bodily entropy does a lot to it but there's something also driving it. There's something also pushing the play-doh through the the tube that like you know the grate to make it give it a different shape and that is this this fleet of this flight away from the reality of their mortality bernie. On the other hand. He doesn't have the ghosts that they do. He is not breathed by by like the the scores of You know the scores of victims at least not as many of course. Obviously you know. He's he's a senator he ran for president. He's got blood on his hands. The way anybody in power does. But he truly. I believe did those in a pursuit of a greater goal and I think that is what keeps him now that's what keeps him here. That's what keeps him on point because he doesn't have to flee from the moment where he's dying. He can stay in the moment because yeah he's dying so. I got stuff to do.

Neither biden or trump can be in the moment because the moment is death. The moment is decrepitudu. The moment is confusion fear dimming bodily failure and the terror that cannot be felt because it is everything it was totalizing its death itself because it's right there. Nancy and I feel like because I'm a guy. I think I get trump and biden's specific senile like flight from from the moment of mortality but pelosi because I think she's a woman and you know there's certain experiences that aren't known from one or the other of those divides. she ends up going good morning sunday morning but it's the same thing.

I think it's the same phenomenon but um yeah because you know we all think of the real horror of life is the knowledge that we're gonna die someday and that's not really it. It's the fact that we once again have two things that are true that we're trying to hold in our heads simultaneously. The one thing we're trying. We're keeping in our head. We think is true is the culturally imposed idea that we're going to die someday in the future which I believe is sitting on top of a deeper biological understanding that we all already died. Everyone has already died. This has all happened before it will all happen again. This universe that we're in has winked out of existence countless times. You have already your gravestone has both dates on it. All of ours do eternal recurrence baby and the thing is if you know that if you have that in the background the way that when you watch a debate you have the knowledge that this doesn't have any syntactic meaning to it. In the background.

Living becomes much easier and you know. It's like you're on flight 93 and it's going into the plane crashing and you dying. The only thing that matters is are you at the chair bashing your head in terror against the glass screaming your mind annihilated with a fear that you can't even comprehend or are you. This the actual flight 93 itself are you aware are you able to connect emotion and intellectual belief in symbolic order in such a way to believe the fundamental truth that you're not separated from anything and that there's nothing to lose there is no such thing as death but that's very hard to keep in your mind when you live in this world that insists you every moment of the day. In every interaction you have that strips you of your species being whips it from you tears it from you like your skin off your. Body like you're a flayed man of house bolton and replaces it with this. No you're gonna die someday you're gonna end. This is gonna be over which flees you which which leads you in the terrible skinner box where all you're really doing is fleeing from fleeing from this towards desire and away from or towards pain and away from pleasure or towards pleasure and away from pain which means you do not have any independence.

You are literally an automat. You are you're a mechanical symbol monkey and we all are ruled by that to an extent. I mean we do know. We're here we do know that when we end they're not getting any more of this. We know that that's true but the degree to which that matters is the degree to which we can live connected to that other knowledge and guys like trump and guys like biden have spent their entire life banging their heads with a ladle to keep them on the path of acquisition of power and respect and money and their dad's head pats or whatever they think heaven is instead of knowing that it's right there always in any moment. We're always right there. Grace is there the hand is. There you can fall you'll never land you'll always be held as you're falling and that's the realization that can that robs that robs the questions of our life.

What to do with the time we do have of their mystifying benefits. Things that make us make wrong decisions emotions clouding us memories of previous events that are going to guide us in an event that doesn't need that that can be answered in the moment but that's overwhelmed the task of building insane in humane society is building one where that that knowledge can be accessible to more people because the more accessible it is the more people will not need to be governed by an external authority like the market and value form lording over us. As like an actual moloch death god. It will be because we have stripped our days of the need to pile up and not be in the moment where everything is because you know we know for a fact that like when you cry. It's not because you feel sad you feel sad after you cry like we know that for a fact because of the delay of signal. It's inevitable. It's a quantum question. So we aren't actually in charge of any of this like we don't we can't operate from that perspective because we have to live but it's true and if we're aware of that truth it makes it easier to act in.

That is do what you should be doing and not try to bang against that destiny because you can move one foot in front of your other as long as you're looking down. But if you're looking everywhere else you're gonna. Wander off into the wilderness so someone's saying tell everyone else how to live. That's the thing I'm not telling anybody else how to live. The whole point of all of this is telling you that. I can't tell you how to live that you have to know how to live. We all have to figure it out ourselves and right now the only thing that makes sense to me to do with whatever I find myself with in possession of the of the moment. This this this platform this career laughably called such this skill set developed in the pursuit of those things what do I do with them right. Now this is what makes sense to do with them and I have to trust that if that feels like it's not true anymore that I can divorce myself from the need to acquire in the moment the need to dis to distort my vision of what's in front of me by the fear of lacking something in the future and then you can act as in act according to where you should do what what should be happening the the way the golden path. That's always there so I'm not telling anybody how to live for the love of god. The only thing I ever say is what boils down to the same thing. Every time I say about it and everything.

I said today about the election all boils down to the same dumb. Two words log off and I know hypocrite of hypocrites. I'm doing this. I know I know but you could not tell when you say log off. You can't just smugly say that's it because that is asking people to essentially withdraw go through withdrawal system. Withdrawal symptoms of. I can't even imagine the monstrosity of which I haven't been able to cut off the internet and I tell myself. It's just because of my job. But I also find an allure there. I also find find this this sinful dump of of emotional energy. I find that that that tantalizing and so I engage from that perspective like I try to sweeten myself. So I that's why it always ends up having to be turned into these longer diatribes coming at it from different angles to make up one great big banal truth. That is the whole sum of like the praxis of this. I'm gonna get dts for the next five months out of some how would I even be able to sustain the faith to keep going with that kind of hardship. You'd never be able to do it. I know I wouldn't be I know. I wouldn't be. That's all. I can say like you the faith the faith that's there has to be in some way rewarded or else the horrors of the world will overwhelm your defenses and will take you out of the moment and everything else is entertainment like.

I said so there's one big thing you get out of a thing like the debate and it's there's no meaning here. There's one. But then there's the the aesthetic enjoyment of watching. It play out and making fun of it and stuff like that drained of meaning. Same thing drained of rather drained of not drained of meaning if you you know take it but drained of import. It's play instead of war like I'm saying the war is log off just like the war of the election was stop listening to these people. Everything else is entertainment and if you find it entertaining and I think it's. I think it's probably better than yelling at people on twitter for an hour watching this. I think is better than yelling on twitter for an hour. I will I will flatter myself to say that and if you're going to do that instead of that. I mean.

I know that that's self-rational that's rationalizing to me rationalizing to people who do it but those sort of reward. negotiations with oneself are what give you the leeway to find oh. This isn't as bad as I thought it would be oh look. I'm rewarded in this way with this instead of just having this giant void that has to be filled immediately when you don't know how to do that. Yet you can work your way towards it. As we all do weaning ourself off all right did that make sense guys. I like kind of someone said kind of okay. I think that's what I usually end up. I mean that's what I'm aiming for perfect perfect. Understanding is impossible total gibberish. I wouldn't like that either that's self-indulgent kinda right in the middle. That's what I should always be shooting for because if I don't if I shoot for perfect I'm going to turn into gibberish. And if I just shoot for you know legibility over anything it robs it of any content. So. I'm gonna end up out kicking my coverage. On some concepts. Someone says see mikay's 13 assassins. I highly recommend that movie that was a really good recommendation for that person strong pick. I have never had carvel in my life.

I lived briefly in long island and I still never had carpel. It just never appealed to me. I've never been a it's not that. I don't like ice cream cake. If you give me an ice cream cake hell yeah. I'm going to eat it but I never crave it. I'm not going to get my own ice cream cake that would be crazy. I would be a different person if I bought my own ice cream cake does logging off me to stop watching kush vlogs eventually probably yeah. I would say yes when that comes that's an individual decision just like mine will add will end at some point with me stopping doing them like that's inevitable too. And we have to accept that like yeah oh this already happened. This already ended and hopefully. It ended because hopefully it ended because oh we don't need it anymore and not because oh he tried to crack the universe and you know ended up running nude on the atlantic um running noon down atlantic avenue or just like try to ignore the voice in my head trying to get things across and just indulge myself and try to attract myself and just end up keeling over after like an arby's gorge. I would not like it to end that way. I would like it to end on my own terms in the sense that I i don't need to make these anymore because some I have something else in my life that fills that spot and I have to just trust that if I earnestly and with good faith address the day I will know it.

When it comes does anyone know the score in azerbaijan armenia anyone know who's up on that one. What's the spread by the way all right. I think that was about an hour. Sometimes they really fly well talk to you guys hopefully soon we'll see and can't wait for the next debate. Honestly it's gonna be a real experiment seeing how I I get around to dealing with just letting it wash over me completely just letting it all wash over me. So it's just noises and then I can just distinguish the noises by amusement to me bye guys.
