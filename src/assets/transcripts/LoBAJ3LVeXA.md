Hmm um there we go. It's going. We're going. We're going. We're live. We're live guys.

I want to say r.i.p. First and foremost to the moon which has been really obviously one of the great uh bodies in the sky. You know things to look at one of the best. We've ever had one of the biggest or the biggest other than the sun and it's hard to look at the sun because it's so bright. So you could really look at the moon and have a good time control. The tides made our day slightly longer due to its gravitation he's a good friend good companion to the human race and everybody on earth and earth in general but almost all things must end and apparently the moon is done for r.i.p. Bye-bye boy 2020. Huh what a year what a frickin year someone should unplug it and plug it back in again. Someone should take the damn cartridge out of the machine and blow on it. Someone needs to get blown on the dang machine because the moon is now dead killed by tumblr witches if you'd asked me a few years ago where do you think I'll be in 2020. I didn't. I don't think. I would be quarantined from a pandemic while the moon is being murdered by teenage witches. But you know what that's the that's the joy of living at the end of history. Crazy shit's happening crazy shit's gonna happen ah nice day again. It's been a run of good days here. I've been enjoying it and it hasn't been hot yet. I guess. I should knock on wood when I say that. But it's probably going to be a terrible august and september if if past experiences are any indication but for now it's nice and I'll take it. I'll definitely take it if more dead. Moon means a nice uh relatively mild and adorable summer in new york.


I'll take it. I was thinking about something. I said yesterday about about ideology and how it changes over time and how certain parts of a given political coalition like the republican party is determined by it and and like held by ideology in a way that makes them not necessarily uh equipped to understand the world around them that they're supposed to be influencing the events in but the example that popped up to me reading reagan land was that it and and I had known this like vaguely but reading it and having the details of the whole. Uh debate spelled out really underlined how big a deal. It was when jimmy carter was negotiating a treaty 15-year long. I mean he was just the president when it happened. It's not like he started negotiating a treaty with panama to return the canal to panamanian control or hand it over to panama rather since we we created panama out of northern colombia in order to create the canal with uh like the connivance of the french company. But anyway it was no longer acceptable in the post-colonial world for america to control this giant stretch of the middle of this country. This tiny country and there had been years and years of agitation to get u.s. Control off of the canal and it was finally coming to a head under carter and there was a huge popular backlash among conservatives led by ronald reagan who had just lost the presidential nomination to ford and was looking to run against carter and 80 and wanted an issue. These people just went nuts about the  panama canal when was the last time anyone thought about the panama canal not being in american hands because 2000 was the year that it actually was was handed over officially.

I mean some people get freaked out that it's going to get bought by china as part of belton road or something but you very rarely hear anybody ruining the national humiliation of turning over the canal to panama. That's because it's a stupid thing to care about and there was like I was saying how there's these splits within parties. There was a split within the republican party between the people who were more internationalist in understanding who understood that the panama that the canal was essentially militarily pointless. It was too small to even move any of our really big uh like aircraft carriers and stuff so it couldn't even be strategically useful in the event of a war and there was the fact that it was becoming wildly unpopular in panama that we had that canal there and that after vietnam nobody really wanted the countenance the potential reality of sending in hundreds of thousands of troops to keep the canal secure as people got more and more mad. At it. There is no reason to keep the canal and guess what subsequent years have proven that no one gives a  none of the people who did it at the time care and that's the thing is that at the top levels the people who manipulated the panama canal issue didn't care about the canal ronald. Reagan became president just a couple years after this treaty was signed.

He didn't  head all over the country gnashing his teeth and he debated william f buckley about the canal uh he became president. He didn't give a  newt gingrich when he was still a college professor in. Georgia got his start in politics organizing a keep the canal committee and then that's that's what was his springboard to run for congress. He doesn't give a  about the panama canal. He didn't do anything when he was a speaker of the house to get the canal back for guys. Like that they understand it's an issue.

It's an emotional issue that presses buttons in like the the the lump and reactionary mind the the nationalistic uh that that's that whole the whole complex of nationalistic lizard emotions the idea that we have a canal and it's being taken and it's just after vietnam and the 60s and all the traumas and of course the material crisis of the 70s stagflation and energy crisis uh no no we need to keep the canal and so people voted on that  didn't care they understood. It was supposed to be red meat for the rooms now 40 years later the people who care about who do the equivalent of caring about the canal and not like the actual important business of maintaining capitalist exploitation and its machinery in tip-top uh fashion. Those people are now in charge and they've squeezed out all the old old hands who were like it's just it's a pointless vestige it doesn't mean anything. Now the canal people are in charge and trump is the head canal person like he had that interview with chris wallace today and his his understanding of issues is precisely as at the same level as all of the old people who watch fox news all day. That's why they love him and will never not love him because he is them and modern politics is about becoming uh about being able to identify with the person in charge. Not that they do anything that you identify emotionally with them and trump is them whenever chris wallace would challenge him on one of his assertions like where are they teaching us to hate america.

He goes oh you go you see the professors you know the schools were doing it. We see it every day couldn't put a gun to his head. He wouldn't be able to tell you a specific instance even and that shows you how far things have changed and how fast things have gone off the rails because of the speed of transmission of information. The way that everybody is just there's just this flow of information that nobody can check realistically and so you just develop a emotional response that you just channel everything through they're. Just like yes this is this this validates this val. This it's like running things over the the laser at the  uh grocery store. It's like a thing either gets you mad or. It makes you happy because it owns the limbs whether it's true whether it happened. It means nothing uh and so trump like like reagan famously always had like this back pocket uh filled with just so anecdotes about the evils of the welfare state and about big government. Half of them were completely made up. The other ones were decontextualized and half truths but he at least had them he had a narrative that he actually contained information even if it was fraudulent. Trump doesn't even bother keeping it none of these people even bother keeping it. It's just all that's left all they're left with is the anger some story about some college where someone said the flag isn't good.

Don't remember. The context don't even remember the incident just remember the emotional response. I had when I heard that and that's where they are. They're just pure ganglion response and they love trump because he's also pure gangly. In response they love him. We love him folks do we love him do. We love the trump uh yeah he's pretty amazing.


No. They don't talk about welfare anymore because it's gone. That was what reagan used to say in the 80s and then clinton fulfilled his  rube bait and they take it seriously that's why all the all the all the more uh data driven still ideological are their ideologues but their ideologues for capitalism as closer to as it actually exists as opposed to a norman rockwell fantasy version of it that they keep in their head so that they can still feel like there's a just re distribution of resources in the world that fantasy that they have to cling to so that their place on that totem pole is sacralized. They're too focused on that busy box of like nationalism to see. Like the actual force for the trees which is why now we finally turned it into a. It's always been the case that like that capitalist political parties are arguing over who could be the best stewards you know of the of the capitalist system uh not who will overcome it or overthrow it that's absurd that's off the table uh but that but what that means has been different and has been contested over time as the coalitions that are dominant within the parties have changed and now we finally have the dream of the clinton era dlc. A situation where the uh mystified small bourgeois white. The mystified white small bourgeois are culturally alienated enough by their the by the rent by the the the social signifiers that they cling to to become a rump party whose inability to absorb the reality of neoliberalism their inability to hear what ned beatty is telling uh howard beal in the boardroom. The the the wax of of uh of ideology of nationalist ideology is to stick thicken their ears to hear it. They're off now they're isolated into one party and capital clear-eyed capital. International capital has one has a party all to themselves and they get to use social liberalism as the unguint to keep the more exploited and still miserable people on board. It's the perfect situation.

It's what it's what the whole uh democratic right turn on economics was supposed to. It was supposed to do eventually by eliminating economics as a real field of political conflict because we're at the end state. We're at the point of permanent austerity where we can never turn it around because the profits aren't there to allow it. You'd have to crack open the bones and get at the gooey. Uh hemoglobin producing centers of capitalism and that's not that's not on the table. That's not an option because that's not the people negotiating these things uh. If that's the case then eventually it will break down. All politics will break down into culture war that's the only thing they'll be left to argue and that time is on the side of the echo of just looking at the arc of history. The way that increased uh uh capitalism increased. Atomization of capitalism increases social liberalism because it reduces our commitment to traditional values because it reduces our contact with the social institutions that reinforce traditional values. So over time you're going to have a more diverse country thanks to shifts and demographics and you're going to have uh a more more echo more socially liberal country because people are going to refer to one another individually in a way that makes all the old claims to like social hierarchies seem dated and quaint and and reactionary and and on none uninclusive of a people who of of a of a uh of a pluralistic society and if that's the case you're gonna win.

Eventually I mean there might be some shocks and some bumps along the way like trump winning in 2016. But now they they've turned that into. I think they've turned that I mean that didn't help the clintons but it sure should help the party. Now they're in the perfect situation uh they're about to. If this election goes away it looks like it would today you know if you had a at the poll today and we don't have some sort of breakdown of legitimacy due to coronavirus and right in ballots which is a huge huge. If but if all that goes relatively smoothly you're going to have a big democratic mandate without any kind of left-wing shape to uh the party itself. It will have swallowed the suburban uh upper middle class small bourgeois who went to college because right. Now.

It has this the republican party now is just the small bourgeois who didn't go to college. That's their main base. Every I mean. They have other people who vote for them. But that's the that's the core and the small bourgeois who went to college were split but the the increased neanderthalic presentation uh of uh of social reactionary views embodied by trump and his base uh in the current moment is no longer sustainable if you went through that etiquette that extended etiquette lesson of college and so that's that's like they're taking nixon's idea of polarizing a long cultural lines. He was the guy who invented it and pearlstein talks about that in nixon land because the whole idea was create break the country in two and then you have the bigger half and at that point he did but now the times have changed there's less of a base for social reaction outside of like white suburbs in white rural areas and so there's less the backlash is less powerful. I mean trump won mainly because hillary clinton managed to completely demobilize democratic voters and because trump was was a was a question mark and he was something new and now. A lot of those people have changed their tune on it at least according to the current models who knows what will happen in the future. So now we finally have the break the the the the final like in in the twilight of america. The the the partisan battle is finally between the competent administrators of capitalism and the mystified overly ideological uh uh snake oil drinking incompetent managers of capitalism.

That's it that's that's that's what we that is explicitly now what we're arguing about whereas it used to be that that whole question of competent administration of empire was sort of uh sublimated. Now. It's the actual content of the two political parties as expressed by their leaders like biden has made it clear that he will not be governing under any kind of expectation of significant change. Even since even he's he's done the olive branch to bernie and he's talking about being more radical now because things are so terrible but uh I mean we know who runs that white house we know who is in charge of that party right now or who would be in charge of the white house. There's simply no structural incentive to push them to do anything. Other than 2008 all over again re reconstituting the the uh. The um economy on the back of the most vulnerable people. But they will have uh to their benefit an absolutely insane republican party like if biden wins and he's able to take office especially if like there's write-in ballots in a bunch of states that get authorized by a court there's going to be a massive crisis of legitimacy from day one and that's going to keep all the sheep in line. They're going to keep all the sheep in line with just the fear of the slathering hordes waiting to retake power and it'll be scary. I mean brian kemp is probably gonna try to  secede or something but like if there's a silver lining there it'll just be that. I think the uh that there will be absolutely among the left you know such as it is among people with leftist sentiments. I think that there will be uh. There will be much less of that obama era. Uh stardust in the air to to keep people from immediately denouncing the administration uh and he was basically able to string that out for almost eight years even while he was doing the worst  on earth and I don't think biden has that obviously I mean after this primary and considering who he is as a candidate and even the fact that obama himself you know a lot of people remember him as a now as a  snake oil salesman himself which he certainly was uh is anybody.

Can name is anybody. A lie around. Uh a is anybody watching in a uh time zone. That's got uh where it's dark cause anybody check on the moon to make sure it's okay. I want to make sure that it's not yet falling out of the sky that's not dead yet apparently the scandinavian moon is still doing okay so maybe maybe it can shake off this uh this curse. I seem down. I'm. I guess. I'm a little uh. I'm mellow. But I don't think I'm depressed or anything. I feel pretty good. I'm just less animated than sometimes.


I'm vibing as always though as always vibing forever vibing that'd be good that could be a sequel to the vasiliy. Grossman book forever flowing forever vibing oh dear oh look. That's a large boy. There's a large boy just showed up vibing towards bethlehem to be warned. What is your favorite michael bay movie. I'd say that his most interesting movie and uh is obviously pain and gain which I think is a really really interesting film. I don't think it's good because he is uh. I mean he's trying to do something. That's beyond his abilities. He's trying to evoke uh like artistic not. I wouldn't say ability. He's a very talented director but his skill set. I'd say he can evoke certain things masterfully uh but but uh commentary intentional commentary. Uh not really his start for uh forte. I think I always think of pain and gain as a cohen brothers movie that's directed by a coen brother's character. If one of their own people could make a coen brothers movie. It would be pain and gain which is a very interesting thing. So I like. I like it for that. I should re-watch it. I haven't seen it in a while one of the one.

Wahlberg is not a very good actor. But it's one of his good performances because he's perfectly cast as a meathead. There's a scene where he finds out that in order to uh for a bank to honor by the document that he forced this guy who he kidnapped to sign that he needed to be notarized and he was completely. He's completely baffled by the concept of a notary and he gets kind of mad. He goes what the  is a notary. It's very good uh but of his spectacles of his big big movies like the ones that are feasts of carnage and mayhem uh ah let me think bad voice. Two gets talked about because it is so just horrifyingly over the top and grotesque in a way that he often only hints at with the corpses bouncing out of the back of the morgue truck getting splattered by cars the rock's very good too armageddon. It's the criterion collection for a reason you know it's just so so much that movie is so much. I have to say even though I've seen every transformers movie multiple times and I think that they're interesting in their own way uh it. I always kind of felt like that's a waste of his talents because he's great at action mayhem but so much of transformers is cgi nonsense. I mean the movies he made his bones with had a lot of practical effects that were really awesome like the char.

The car chase in san francisco when he uh connery takes a  uh a humvee and derails a cable car tremendous in short. It's uh. It's hard to pick a favorite. It depends on the mood. I will say that I was very disheartened to see that his last movie went to netflix because michael bay more certainly than  was premiered on netflix. It's like. I get it when scorsese goes down netflix to do a three and a half hour movie with digitally aged mobsters and it's all about regret and sadness and and failure. I that's not gonna that probably wouldn't have wowed him on the big screen in a you know in a huge release but my god if michael bay can't get a  movie with that kind of dumbass high concept what if a billionaire faked his own death and became an operator to to overthrow assad but just the fact that it wasn't fighting robots. I guess kept it off the silver screen that's why I was really that's why I really do think that covet might be the end of the theatrical film experience because it seemed like it was already on its last legs and now just pushing the  coke machine over so it's too bad.

I didn't really like uh 6 underground. It was too quippy because it was written by the deadpool guys and so that's not really his register bay. Humor is not whedon-esque soy banter. It's people's getting hit directly in the dick or robot a tiny robot pretending to hump something or someone farting that that it's chi. It's baby bright. It's not fake sophisticated bodenage yeah. It's interesting like what what I think you might end up. Seeing films exist on the margins. I think like big movies coming out every week and everybody going to see them. I think that might be over. I think those movies are now going to go to streaming services. But I think you will still have a a skeleton film industry. I think you might see drive-ins make a comeback but you'll definitely see. I think either like boutique movie experiences like a small small few people.

Somebody said like running out of karaoke room something like that with like food service like an even more boutique alamo for uh old movies you know for revivals or something and then maybe once or twice a year there'd be something that would get on like imaxes. Maybe christopher. Nolan would just make an imax movie every year but we'll see who knows. I mean people get are stubborn and uh. I don't and and there might be a desire to go back to the movies if it's possible just to assert our love of the before time and our refusal to accept that that uh there really might have been a cultural and economic bcad moment here with this bucking virus and that things might be different in a way that's qualitatively significant enough to no longer be the same thing before we enter the cool zone exactly and I will be bummed by that because I love going to the movies. I think it's fun of course.

I've seen mac and me come on but I would like somebody to ask newt gingrich what he thinks about the panama canal because these  are still around. I would really love him to explain like when did you realize it wasn't a big deal that we lost the panama canal and when you found that out did it make you reflect on anything at all oh no because you're a cynical  kumwad nah. Now. I remember now never mind. I do wonder how many people cut their teeth getting mad about the panama. Canal.


Now are 100 convinced that the cast of friends are all cannibal pedophiles because that's a hell of a trajectory. You guys ever wonder how more much more advanced. We'd be culturally and socially and civilizationally if we had embraced crystal pepsi because crystal pepsi was mind blowing crystal. Pepsi told you hey you know that perception you had your whole life. You know how you always thought. The cola was brown that's the color of cola. What have. I told you it didn't have to be. Here. It drink this. I don't understand this looks like a sprite of some kind some sort of lemon-lime beverage. No it tastes like a damn pepsi if pepsi is if if pepsi is not brown then what is it what is anything.

Maybe we would have been more open-minded as as the end of history turned into the charnel house of the 21st century. Maybe we would have been able to think outside the box maybe after 9 11 we could have thought hey if pepsi isn't necessarily clear. Then this terrorist attack is not necessarily the beginning of some civilizational war unless we make it let's not do that. I have no proof of this. I just wonder sometimes although apparently the failure of crystal pepsi was partially due to rat. Buy coca-cola coca-cola after crystal. Pepsi set the world on fire with its mind-blowing commercial debut after the super bowl using van halen's right now as its theme song immediately after that coke came out with their. Own crystal version of of coke only it was diet tab but they said crystal coke and so it tasted like crap. It tasted bad it wasn't. It was it was a diet beverage and one not even like their good diet beverage their crummy or diet beverage and so because coke is so hegemonic and because people don't really differentiate that finally somebody has a bad tasting crystal cola and now they don't like crystal cola. Coca-cola company kept our brains in the box kept us part of the mind control part of the mk ultra mind control making sure that consciousness expanding concepts like crystal pepsi aren't allowed into the marketplace. No. I don't think that would have happened but it's funny to think about mean and that goes to show that there's I honestly think there's something to the old argument that coca-cola made new coke on purpose made it bad on purpose and made a backlash on purpose so that when they brought it back and said this is the old coke.

Not only would people all want to drink it out of gratitude to have to be back. They wouldn't notice that in the interim they switched out the  sugar for high fructose corn syrup diabolic diabolical between all that and uh hiring death squads to kill union organizers pretty much a bad company have I read detroit. I do mind dying yes. I have drum baby the detroit revolutionary union move it. There's a good documentary about that too finally got the news about the radical black anti-capitalist union movement in detroit. Late 60s. Early 70s very interesting stuff. I mean who is it but who are you going to who who wins in the battle of evil uh soda companies you got coca-cola which of course has its record of bloodshed and then you've got pepsi which I think is does a lot of nefarious. Especially exploiting and like privatizing water sources in the developing world. But fanta literally is the nazi uh beverage. It's the nazi soft drink pepsi uh in the 50s. Pepsi made a deal with richard. Nixon went before he went to moscow to see the world exhibition there where he had the kitchen debate with khrushchev. The pepsi corporation made a deal with him where they he was able to arrange a picture of khrushchev with a coat with a pepsi in his hand that uh if he needed it at any point nixon could would be able to get on the board and after he lost the uh either the presidency.

I think the california governor's race. In 62 he became he went on the board uh of pepsi as payback for getting photographs of khrushchev drinking. Pepsi and I never got that because it's like he was the bad guy shouldn't he have been shouldn't. They have wanted him to be drinking a coke. You're like look. This communist. Drinks coke but I guess. I guess. Pepsi is like the upstart and they think that that's irony or something. I don't know and also pepsi bankrolled. Partially the production of the great william peter blatty film the ninth configuration because they had made a bunch of money in west germany. But they couldn't have it leave the country without a heavy tax rate so they funded this movie as a tax dodge. Basically the same way that you ebola movies got made for a while there because of loopholes in the german tax law related to money invested in films. There's one scene in the ninth configuration where they show somebody getting a pepsi out of a vending machine in the insane asylum. That's the film set in the our army uh army mental hospital. It's a very good movie and I don't think coke would have ever done that so advantage pepsi on that one. A coke wasn't dr strangelove and that's the one where they blew up the world that's not good you're gonna have to answer them in the coca-cola company more likely gop nominee in 22 2024 haley or hawley okay stipulation up front no idea what anything's going to look like by that.

I would argue there's a good chance that the front runner in 2024 will be whoever emerges is like the the john c calhoun of the neo uh nullification movement and that's more likely to be a governor of a large red state but not necessarily um. But if it's not that it's gonna be some carnival barker or trump hanger on. It's not gonna be some nerd like josh hawley. It's not gonna be some  wet blanket like nikki haley. They like the red meat the idea that what they're looking for is some sort of perfect ideological synthesis. Those are leftists who think that way because that's what they've been dreaming of the perfect secret sauce that combines political power with ideology with party building uh with mobilization just the secret sauce of everything and so they imagine that that's what everybody's seeking republican voters want someone to ring the dinner bell so they can  salivate like pavlov's dog and the argument that oh like a guy like holly would be able to do some sort of you know heron volk democracy where he promises all this social democracy for the uh for for the in-group where's the money for that coming from we're at the terminal decline phase anybody who wants to promise that is going to have to do it from outside the system because a guy like holly is too dependent on the media and on the party to be even known by anybody and so he can't piss them off. Trump was able to be a free agent because he was rich but more importantly he was famous if anybody is going to challenge that heterodox economic pop create a heterodox economic populist model that'll actually be different enough to get people's attention and do the thing that a lot of people are kind of fearing or dreaming is going to happen and create some sort of new right populism with a economic baseline. It would have to be from outside this the party it could not be some loser. Senator who's got to go around the rubber chicken circuit to get enough money to get people to get his name recognition about five percent. It's gonna be somebody who comes in on the outside.

That's why I'd say I'd put the my pillow guy ahead of any of these people. I'd say donald trump jr. But. I have a feeling that his dad would like to own him not endorse him. I think like a guy like dan crenshaw like the media cares about him. He's  dork is like these guys are all shadow boxing. They're all trying to be something that the media wants them to be and they never. They haven't reckoned with the fact. That trump was able to win by directly inhere defying all of the dictates of the parties and the media in how you run for office and no elected official will be able to grab that magic so. I don't that's why I discount anybody who is in office right now my pillow guy don junior uh depending on how like uh how much this like kidnapping people pops off. Maybe chad wolfe one way or another. It's gonna have to be somebody who gets trump's approval because one bad tweet about them and it's over which is another reason. I don't buy carlson because carlson is on the record as saying trump is out to lunch and he's not smart and doesn't know what he's doing and can't deliver on any of the promises of his presidency. He said that in an interview if any if trump ever finds out about that he'll just in one tweet destroy him. I mean maybe they decide to go back to normal politics but that seems weird.


I mean the reason people have embraced this. This tribal lunacy over any kind of principle or ideology is because things have gotten weirder and worse. They're only going to be weirder and worse in four years. I just don't see the mechanism that's supposed to maybe being out of power is supposed to snap them out of it. I don't know didn't really work that's not really what happened with obama as I say. I'll come back to this. I have no idea because I could not predict what the conditions are going to look like four years from now. I can't say what they're going to be four months from now for god's sake and I don't trust anyone who says they do elon. Musk has no political base. His base is like epic meme people. They're all democrats. Mostly people are afraid of trump not leaving.

But I i will say that if the courts if there is some sort of challenge to the constitution to the election challenge to the legitimacy of election which I'm sure there will be if it's decided in favor of biden trump will go because one of the beautiful generals will tell him it's time to go and at the end of the day trump is a coward do you know the kind of bravery it would take to say hey. I'm just even just like delusional uh like musk like frenzy of of to say. It let's be legends. Let's tear up the constitution so I can stay be president even though he hates being president um. He doesn't have the character for it. That's the thing about trump is that he is only negative traits. He has no positive traits and that means that he doesn't have the the basic uh um bravery to withstand disappointment that plenty of evil people in history have possessed in spades he doesn't have it. He's a coward and the idea of the beautiful generals turning against him is too much and so he would make up some thing in his head to justify how he didn't actually leave and then he'd leave and then he would just recrea because that's the thing the reason.

Trump's able to keep on trucking is that he instantly re-defines everything that happens to him to make it look like himself. Look good to make him look like a genius because of his insane mind-shattering insecurity. He is literally incapable of of sitting with failure incompetence sadness. Uh any kind of negative feeling and certainly any negative feeling about himself and so I just don't think that he's got the sand to what try to like call some other generals because I think the thing with the lafayette square shows that there isn't the commitment there to him personally to back him and biden isn't a threat. In fact. A lot of them have probably figured that biden is the solution that biden will calm things down and make things run more functionally but there could be fraudulent challenging of democratic ballots that then are uh and those challenges could be affirmed by the trump court that got packed over the last four years and then if the final word of the court is like it was in 2000 oh yeah trump won even though maybe he lost by five million votes in the in the popular total and uh you know was losing in enough states to lose the electoral college until they declared the like. The votes fraudulent or something and like threw it to the house of representatives to have them vote by state which means that even though the house is now pretty heavily democratic the republicans would vote for trump. If that happened then the military is not going to stop that from happening because it's official it has the official imperture of of the rule book which the absolute shouter-headed mediocrities of the u.s joint chiefs. That's what they care about yeah yeah.

They're all right wingers but they're also at the end of the day unimaginative. They take the stupid constitution sit seriously and I just don't think they see. I mean these guys all around these guys. All were around under obama too you know there are a few michael flynn types but what happened to michael flynn. He was like isolated and neutralized over the course of his career.

Because he was a nut case he couldn't  function and there might be some like and if there are reptile lizard type right wingers at the top of the military. They also know the way the wind is blowing and they know that it wouldn't be worth the domestic turmoil of suppressing of suspending uh constitutional government because as colin powell says you break it. You bought it and now you're responsible for this thing that you have no training for no preparation for controlling and most importantly there's a perfectly good political party made up of people who are by the very mass majority totally uh totally beholden to the exact same power structure that you are and are a part of why would you. Uh mystified by ideology. It you are if you spend like presents time in the presence of donald trump. You're not going to have any  be able to sustain many illusions about his competence and that's one thing when he is the go. He is the he is in power through. You know the connivance of of re of uh the press and the people to to to deem him the legitimate president which takes a lot of pressure off of you as the military to uh. You know maintain uh maintain authority because it's not popularly represented or. It's not popularly recognized.


You go from that to having a government that has lost its popular legitimacy overnight to a huge percentage of the population that's a headache. It's a huge headache but as I said if the republicans are able to like maneuver through the courts that they have spent the last four years packing a spiri spurious challenge to electoral votes for biden. And it's affirmed what is anyone going to do about it that'll be the ultimate calling of the bluff and I think that for the most part there will be protests. For sure. There will be confrontations and violence for sure but uh it will it will tuck her out. That's the bet they're gonna. Make is that it'll tuck her out that the momentum will dissipate and then people will have accepted the new reality to some degree to some psychic degree. They will now be operating in the under the assumption that this new order is in some way legitimate because they're sustaining it by their acquiescence. I mean there might be an insurgency but uh I don't know how sustainable it would be and that's the other thing like as illegitimate as it would be you'd have to be having.

People go to the streets to risk death and dismemberment on behalf of joe biden you who anybody want to lose an eye for joe. Dungeon to seat the man who doesn't even know what year. It is who thinks he's running in 1988 and that he really needs to catch up to dukakis. It would be funny though to see maybe like because obviously the democratic establishment like the other thing is is not only would you have nobody want to die for biden. Biden wouldn't be asking you to die for him. He would accept the outcome like like gore did he'd say well. I disagree strongly with the court's reasoning. In this case.

I respect their constitutional role as arbiter of these disputes and hope that we can move forward and help make uh help make the american middle class strong again or whatever. So how the hell are you supposed to organize in the face of a party that won't even stand up for itself. It would be funny though if there were a few true believer diehards who just snapped like near a tandem leads a guerrilla foco in the hills of northern virginia. That'd be pretty funny niro. Tandon has ambushed another police another police caravan killing 16 officers here. Tandon spiked the water supply of the district of columbia with xanax.

I don't think barack. Obama could be biden's vice president because I think I mean the point of a vp is to assume the offices of the presidency and I don't think that a two-term president can legally assume the offices of the presidency. So yeah you can't he couldn't be vp. He could be in the cabinet because they just skip him in the succession but he couldn't be vp because that's the whole point of the vp. So the old bungler could be like secretary of state or something for sure like madeleine. Albright wasn't eligible to be president because she wasn't born in the united states. But they just skipped her in the line of succession kissinger too of course. When he was secretary of state and this is big new brzezinski or no he was nsa who was not michelle. Obama would be the slam dunk. Michelle. Obama is the vp and the thing is over uh which really must tell you at least. It tells me that she does not want to be vp that she doesn't like politics like you. That has always been the rumor that she kind of hated it and wanted to get out of there certainly the way he's behaved obama's behave since would suggest that's true only working behind the scenes limiting his public comments and exposure and of course.

There's the fact that if she'd run this time she probably would have gotten the nomination relatively easily and now here's a chance to get it without even running to get. I mean she would be the next president almost for sure because I mean at some point uh biden's gonna conk out very likely in his first term actuarially in his first term. She must just not want it she just hates dc and i. I think after we after uh trump tore up the vegetable garden she was like. Won't even let me make your stupid kids less fat and of course. That's all you know that's a perfect. Her choice of that as her pet project is. Vp is so perfect such a perfect example of uh of just that neoliberal self-help mindset. It's like yeah. It's uh people kids aren't fat because of food deserts and and wildly anti unhealthy uh agricultural subsidies that that have a horrifyingly distorting effect on our diet and like what we consume and like the the the uh the shrinking of people's free time uh and the almost impossible lure of fast food as to fill a gap and processed food if not fast food. No no it's you know you're not you're not doing enough sit-ups with your kids and you don't have a  vegetable garden in your backyard.

Oh that's interesting trump couldn't run again if he was convicted of a felony and would biden allow that to happen. Oh. I got to assume that there will I honestly because there won't be any like because he was acquitted in the the mis he was acquitted in the impeachment. There is no. I don't think there's any criminal prosecutions currently going into trump. All of the crimina all of the things revolving around his tax returns and uh like lawsuits and stuff and the attempt to get transparency about his business dealings and stuff like the uh the scottish golf course where they kept sending the uh the air force so just the chintziest. I I think all those investigations are in the houses are in the are in the house and those are presumably all just going to end after he gets out of office. So presuming. He loses that's the end of the congressional investigations. There's no current there would have to be an instant initiation of an investigation and I just don't think they'll allow that to happen. I don't think the democrats the democrats would be so terrified of trump prosecution energizing his supporters and riling them up that. I think that he won't have to give him a a pardon because there will be no prosecution to to deal with and I think that most democrats even the ones who hate him with a passion will gladly follow along because they're just going to be so damn happy to be in charge again and they're going to listen to whatever  the dog and grover cleveland's the  out of this one it'll be some monster. It'll be my pillow guy. My pillow filled with goya beans on every front door in america oh thank you someone says they're enjoying hanging out I enjoy them as well uh just a few more minutes here if anybody has any more questions oh.


I just want to also put this out here that we might be expanding the format for these in the near future. Uh we might turn this into like a daily like drive time chunk wondering if anyone would be interested in that if that sounds like something people would want to watch and we would maybe involve more video. Some actual gaming too. I would want to play some of those map based strategy games. Those always seem like fun but I can't handle all the little boxes and the clicks it's too complicated. I can't keep it all straight. It would not be mostly gaming though the gaming would be like limited because I did not want to become a streaming gamer that is uh that is I but I think I can avoid that I always wanted to see if you could ever like uh if you could ever with with like the uh history ones.

I've always wanted to see if it's possible even in the game in a game to uh like do what charles v tried to do and have habsburg hegemony over europe in the early modern period or if the ottomans could have conquered all of the continent. I don't think either one of them could have been technically possible but it would be fun to try to see if you could get the game to let you do it. No that is true. The ottomans never really wanted europe. They were much more interested in in the uh conquering uh as much of persia as they could from the assassinates but and they were yeah. Europe was really about the trade the the water routes. But I mean mehmed wanted italy back. He wanted to take rome so there was there's some symbolic drive. Also I'd like to see if I could pull off and I know.

This is a later period but I always felt like napoleon really could have he could have pulled something off there. I mean it wasn't going to last forever but he certainly had a game plan for trying to maintain like a powerful hegemony there and in western europe by planting like local uh monarchies that the bud off of his like his family line and his he was essentially reseeding the aristocracy of western europe and that could have lasted I mean my god the uh the current. Uh royal house of sweden is descended from one of napoleon's marshals who was invited to take the throne you don't invade russia though dude why invading russia dog dog. I warned you bro don't invade russia but I do think that like the more sustained that the napoleonic you know era had been the more time that uh the s d surfing had been allowed to occur. I think it could have been it would probably have hastened progressiveness.

You know it would have hastened progressive forces in europe but it also would have hastened the arrival of the contradictions that led to the 20th century being one of the bloodiest charnel houses in human history. So everything is double-edged that's why it's so dangerous to open pandora's box and that's why anyone who seeks to change the world. Around them is taking a huge responsibility because there's a limited amount you can never know what you're going to do and there's going to be bad consequences of all change. There's no such thing as a purely positive uh of a purely positive shift with any kind of significance. The thing about the british is is that he I think there could have been some sort of viable at least medium-term uh stalemate with the british. But I don't think he could ever let that go. I mean he was a man of war and he and the idea of having an undefeated enemy. I think was too much for him but I don't know maybe not. I mean. It's a pretty. Uh it's a pretty wild thing for anybody to try to do conquer all of europe.

Only a few have tried none have succeeded because it's institutions in geography. Don't let it take it doesn't take yes. I do have napoleon on the brain though because I've been listening as I have for years to uh age of napoleon. One of the best history podcasts uh really really good you get a really good history first of the french revolution and the continental european diplomatic system and military tactics life of nelson. He's he's got. He understands the fractal nature of history and that things all like like you're talking about napoleon you're talking about a bunch of other things and he's always very uh good about contextualizing all the all the narrative. But it's good should have allied with law of attorney attacked haiti. I he said that was one of his biggest mistakes when he was in exile and yeah that was a huge blunder. I've talked about it on here before he could have turned the caribbean into a  french lake there before the louisiana purchase which would have countervailed uh naval or british naval supremacy. I think the way to go is just if you haven't started it just listen from the beginning. They're all good and they all build on one another all right. I'm gonna go bye-bye. R.i.p. The moon we love you we love you moon bye bye good night moon.
