Ah it's my party and I'll cry if I want to cry if I want to cry if I want to but you would try to if it happened. Nobody knows where my Johnny is. Johnny has gone away um for a while was he holding her hand and she's supposed to be wrong line. I forgot it oh yeah. It's my party and I'll cry if I want to cry if I want to cry. If I want to. We would cry too if it happened to you. She wore blue velvet Boom Boom blue and then velvet were her eyes and I still can't see blue velvet in her eyes. Hey folks who the very good question I'm sorry was there a was there a game ball happening that I interrupted I'm sorry. I'm sorry I interrupted your nerd Festival ah so yeah. The only gaming we're gonna be doing today is gaming the human brain. We're gonna be hacking its neurons and unleashing and dumping Into The Ether. It's secret treasures and candies.

Montreal is not sold out. We just said that because the stupid Master wasn't working for a while and people assume that it's not buy the stupid tickets you freaking Canucks you. I don't know we might not sell any tickets in Canada. I don't know I never understand why anybody outside of America listens to the show. Honestly. I mean it's just sick so whatever I don't care. I'll just eat poutine on the stage alone.

The Sacre blue indeed I do love that about French Canadians that because they're kind of stuck in the cultural model that prevailed in the 1700s when they got taken away from France and became impure British subjects that all of their swear words are directly related to the Catholic Church like if people were still getting scandalized in English by saying Khan sarnath or Zounds and I guess that's what happens when you get when you get you go from being a dominant culture to a subservient one is that the organic sort of development gets arrested because you're no longer have access to the the proteins the the the resources. The cultural material resources that develop a culture which is why they had to have that quiet Revolution and then also I had to have the emergency where French Canadians are running around. Murking State premieres am I a chemical access am I a quebecois separatist oh my god get over it. I did not understand at this late date what the hell people are trying to get a nation. National sovereignty for what what national sovereignty exists at this point. For I mean among the country when you when you look at like the Western separatist movements. Quebecois Scots catalans what you're just signing. You're already subservient. You're already part of a supernatural supernational thing. It's just resentment at this point. It's just you're not getting over the past that's essentially what it is. It's. It's just bad sportsmanship like move on.

We're all subject to the dollar for now and that is the National Imperial structure that we're. Within you want like different colored passports. I mean you get this they make you speak French in Quebec for the most part right like they don't they take that seriously so they get to speak their precious language. I mean honestly. Canadians tell me the truth here if Quebec did separate from Canada and became an independent country would not the biggest policy change brought by that simply be that they would have a much much stricter immigration. Standards than current Canada wouldn't that just be it realistically what else different would they do. But I guess you can say that's the point like if you're gonna have a nation that means preserving a certain National character and it's like yeah. It does so what do we mean when we talk Nation. That's what we have no agreement upon. Even though we're subject to these institutions and then we we have a big old culture War over it to allide our fundamental discon conjecture about like what we're trying to preserve by preserving a polity.

Better Call Saul is good. You know what I'm finally watching the sixth season and I am sorry. There is good stuff throughout the show but the way that the eats the rest of the show. As it goes along is just a missed opportunity is what it is to me the the promise of a better call. Shall. Better Call Saul show was a show with a different tone and a different theme than Breaking Bad. Not just the same thing over again from a different perspective that to me was like why do it why do a spin-off of a show that's completed to do a different and not just narrative angle but thematic tone aesthetic angle. But Aesthetics nobody gives a about that anymore. It's like no. This is what a hour-long show that I'm supposed to think is good looks like these are the themes of a show. Like that. This is the visual palette of a show like that like to me.

The ideal Better Call Saul is like a 70s Rockford style case a week show about Saul getting into schemes and shapes in the in the legal community in Albuquerque and you can say oh yes. But the show we got instead is so good 30 of the show is about finding out how the meth lab that Gus Fring builds and and reveals in what season four Breaking Bad got made holy. Just ate the rest of the show in the last season so you don't see. Saul become Saul Goodman till the very end of the of the last. color episode that's like I'm sorry the thing cool about him was that he was the character he was how does he become him. That's the Breaking Bad Arc and also it doesn't make sense for a guy who was a crook from day. One now righteous somebody says watching Rice's Gemstones of course. Now there's a program come on I just feel like people made break at every step since like Sopranos defined what a good show was meaning. A this is what I mean by good show I'm not talking about anything to do with quality.

I'm talking about a film that can a show that can fill a cultural space and that is the show that self-conceived self-perceived smart people feel comfortable debating and describing the ascetic merits of in public specifically on social media that is a good show. That's for my purpose. This is a show. This is the show that this is the model of thing that The Sopranos gifted to us at the dawn of the 20 20 21st century and that was a blessing because we were going to need it because the internet was going to destroy our literacy. It was going to destroy our attention span. It was going to destroy our interest in leaving our homes and what that meant is that the broad middle brow of of narrative art was going to collapse around stuff that you watch at home and then we were going to have our engagement with it happen in public in our social media which is filling the role of actually being interacting with other human beings.

No The Sopranos was not that down. I mean it was incredibly well reviewed. There was an SNL sketch at the time that made fun of the reviews of The Sopranos. In the first season. Just hyperventilating like the Messiah had arrived but like it did not become a phenomenon for a little bit and that's because people came to the lifestyle of at that time reading um at work at their shitty boring jobs sitting down and reading online. Recaps that's where this whole thing starts and then going in the comments about them. Of course. Not everyone was doing that very few people were literally writing the comments but lots of people were engaged peripherally in the in the discussion and that replaced difficult films or honestly anything outside of Blockbuster films and replace novels completely. It took away both of those things from like the cultural conversation and gave us a new thing easier to consume than those other things like literally easier to consume in that easier than a book in that you don't have to read.

You can just stare at the screen easier than a movie and that you don't have to leave your house to see it easier and this those that slot got filled by a show and that show changed over time and the thing is the show got worse over time. Now I would argue that there's like a moment after The Sopranos when the form kind of bursts up a little bit because like oh there's this new form everybody like Rises to the challenge of it and you have this crop of shows that are at least as good as the first Sopranos and some could argue better like Mad Men like Deadwood you can argue about the wire all you want. But it's It's role its ability to fill the role of the show. Smart people talk about was impressive but then it starts to fall. It starts to get less rigorous as time goes on as the format itself which is a mass extended viewership over years dominates over everything else because I would argue that element of Television makes it a lesser artistic medium than either film or novels. Easier lesser and keeping people watching makes the genre stuff that's like supposed to be the sweet to the Salty of the you know more mod like modernist character-based stuff overwhelms. The palette and Breaking Bad is really where that kicks in the Breaking Bad is much more genre than any of the previous good shows and as a result people had to work harder to make it mean something and after that fell off like the the economy of of television changed all in ways to make shows worse in general to make it so that the show that like Rises up is gonna be worse. They don't. We had Game of Thrones fill that spot which is of course like even more. I mean traditionally genre based than Breaking. Bad is more of a fantasy thing that Breaking Bad even is a crime show and like you can argue well. These are all good shows. I like them I love them in fact at times Gambo got me to read those stupid books which I never had before watching gambo and I was at the edge of my seat as I watched. Breaking Bad I mean they were effective but as a thing that everybody should sit around to talk about discuss from a a like a critical literary perspective absolutely not move on but there was nothing to move on to there's nothing else that everybody had experienced to talk about and so that's what they talk about by the time break Better Call Saul shows up.

It's the only thing with any connection to that era still around and over time it's need to remind us of that connection to a previous bellapock of prestige Television over welcome to everything else and by the end of the show it's a third. The salamancas versus Gus frame like just to remind you hey. This is the show that you really liked and then just watching everyone's try so hard to ring something out of the show. It was annoying honestly but I understand because what else is there to talk about and that's all we really want to do with. This stuff is talk about it. We're just letting it wash over us. The real work is afterwards hell half the time we know where we're even really watching it we got our phones in our hands.

Foreign took the turn towards being about breaking bad again and being like breaking Vatican in the earlier Seasons. even though tonally it's not enough of a distinct thing from Breaking Bad to justify itself which is really the question why are we making this if it's just another Breaking Bad season. Then we're just doing a reboot who cares the answer needs to be like there's another thing we're exploring here another aesthetic element of the setting we're exploring but that would mean making it no longer a show that reads as good. If it's a case a week comedy. Then it is no longer a show that we can all care about together publicly and talk about and think about publicly so anyway. That is my case against the show that's why it's so frustrating to talk about any of this stuff because you can defend the show on its own merits all day and say look at this and this this is so good and like yeah there's stuff in there that is enjoyable to watch but what it is expected to hold up to the scrutiny is expected to hold up to is unreasonable and only motivated by a desire for it to fulfill this role for people who desperately want to be seen as publicly smart because it's not about smart smartness. It is about a specific neurotic need to be publicly perceived as intelligent that motivates people to have these kind of relationships with these TV shows which is what tells us how good or bad it is that urge not anything related to the text itself yeah.

The relationship between Chuck and Jimmy is very good and could have been the engine honestly for a show to like even if you don't want to do wacky or you want to have more of a tragic Edge to it. But you you could have based it around a a less con. A less intensified but sort of more long-running version of the Chuck Jimmy Dynamic that could be like the drive of the show but like they had to kill him off because they had to make way for all of this Breaking Bad. Since somebody says I hated the Chuck stuff it doesn't make doesn't make me dumb no. It's all about as smart as the rest of it. None of it is smarter than any other parts of it. Some parts are just funner more fun and that's the part about these shows that gets totally annihilated the aesthetic element in their evaluation because this is all a calvinist fund denying exercise in the first place wanting other people to see your smart doing homework for free. That's not somebody who wants to have fun. That's somebody who has created a twisted perverse repressed inversion of fun calvinist in other words.

So don't they can't recognize they cannot. They can recognize it maybe by perceiving it. But they cannot recognize by positively re-describing and affirming it when they see it and man just as the last thing people who thought Lalo Salamanca is some epically cool. Villain I do not understand like what was. It was it the mustache like oh he's Jolly but also evil he smiles but then he kills people. That's so twisted like are you. This has been done a zillion times and more importantly. It's not done with any distinction. It literally just is he Chuckles and then kills people that's it. He's fun in a show. That is otherwise drained of Fun For No Good Reason. Like one of the reasons people like Lalo is because he's he introduces like this wacky element that should already be there in a show about Saul Goodman but is instead completely absent because of the serious Stakes of all this up. It should be funner than that to be more fun than this. This is a minimal amount of fun.

See I want to have like a review column about television where I just reviewed the meta context of reviewing television shows because I do have a lot of takes around TV because I'm as much of a neuter dork as the rest of you I gotta watch television. More than I absolutely should because I'm like what do I do with myself. So I'm watching this slop and I of course want myself to be appear to be intelligent. I'm talking about myself here. But I would like to just give some ability to deceive myself if no one else that I'm doing something other than that by not having to like talk about these shows as if they're good or not like this is sloth like For example Andor I've watched two episodes of Andor I I could see why people like it I will probably. Maybe watch it at some point in the future. But I don't know I don't have Disney plus and I don't really wanna I don't know how to torrent thing so maybe maybe not we'll see what happens.

But even if it's as good as people say it is. I think it is morally response. It is the moral responsibility of anyone who watches Andor to shut the Gilroy who made Michael Michael Clayton which is one of the best films in the best film decade of like the past 30 years 2007. and is like a proven film filmic pimp and obviously had plenty of ideas for his own work that he couldn't make because they would only let him do something if it had bleep. Bloops in. It is now being forced to make a bleep bloop show and the fact that it's the best bleep. Bloop show is totally immaterial to the fact that it is a crime that this should be where we're given what we're giving Tony Gilroy money for and now we're gonna cheer. This lack of Standards we're gonna Hoot and Holler and slap our fins together that is Criminal watch it and enjoy it.

If you think it's good for the love of God but keep your mouth shut keep your mouth shut eh and like the number of people this someone points us out say oh the politics are good so what that's homework okay kids so tomorrow you gotta watch Andor and then have a book report ready for a class about Why it's epically communist did I say something with a Wisconsin accent. It does come out sometimes it does come out on the vowels oh my God. You want some toast. That's my favorite. Part of the Wisconsin accent is the way they do o a toast what we're going on.

The boat. Also the a in in or the O in words like God oh my God I saw the Dune trailer I'm on record saying the first dune is bad and it's basically a Marvel movie and if you don't recognize that it's because your taste buds have been melted by comic book crap. It's a it's a. Not a movie it's an advertisement for another movie. It's it cuts the First Act out of a three-act structure and tries to trick you into thinking. It's a movie and the most egregious part of that egregious moment of that is at the end of the movie when they're just walking up the Dune and all of a sudden. This Hans Zimmer score just gets really loud right before they could cut to Black that's just trying to trick you into thinking that you just saw a whole movie and look again why is it good though even though it has the same dull muted refinement culture shout out. Lindy man aesthetic is that a you're a genius like the musin sound wow unbelievable oh Boomer energy you people yeah because you children have given up the idea that a movie should be a story apparently that that above the spider-verse movie that everyone's creaming themselves about that. I'm probably not going to see it ends with just a little of the middle of a scene. Cliffhanger is that correct okay that's not while you do that that's not how you do the middle part of a Trilogy has anyone seen.

 Back to the Future too you children. If any of you guys I love that I'm like arguing in favor of stuff that was considered slop in 1980s. It's like yes it was considered slap in 1980s. Now it's good compared to the slop. We have now that's just how it works take it up with the second law of thermodynamics. But that movie tells the whole story about Marty having to go back and oh I'm sorry Back to the Future one. and Back to the Future too both end with Cliff with invitations to watch the next movie. At the end of last of the future one they go your kids something's wrong with your kids and then they go away and then at the end of The third one you find out that Doc is in the old west and Marty's got to go back for him but in both of those they tell the whole story and then they introduce this next Link in the chain to a new story. They do not just stop the movie and then say come back for it again that's not that's not a movie that's not a film that is an episode what of television and clapping like a seal for it is clapping for the self for God's sakes so yes. I'm an old man complaining about the kids today on their dumb phones but who that's what I am.

That's where we all are we going to try to frantically dress it up in in like some of the Transcendent Garb of Eternal Insight. But the fact is we're all to some degree or another just reacting to the change in how we remember things at one point to how they are now and a lot of that just boils down to aging getting turned into value. But some of it is a real lived experience of the decline of institutions of all types including cultural production. Under this accelerated terminal end stage capitalism. The reason they call this late capitalism or or late stage capitalism. The reason I think that that is a useful term and that it actually does describe something is because it is totalized capitalism which is what we have. And that is why we are in a decline phase. Because once capitalism is totalized. It can only decline from there as all systems all systems reach of totalization and then their internal contradictions bring them to destruction. This is just the first one that is literally Global. This is the first order class society that has literally Global as opposed to just Global within It's like thermodynamic limit of expansion yeah.

It's all downhill so that is the late stage but that stage could exist for maybe ever maybe if they actually do figure out how to make the computers turn you into a robot. It'll be a post-scarcity. Utopian Singularity robot colony of like 10 and the rest of the world is a parched desert. I've talked about um before on this pod the stream what have you a while ago. Though I talked about a short story called the people of what the um and it's about it's about late stage capitalism. It's about It's about capitalism at its final development and that's just what we have now. It ends at a further stage of technological development but the the dynamic of the relation the internal cultural Dynamics. The Dynamics between human individual humans and the Dynamics between people and the environment and other living things is the same as it is now. So that's why you can have a late stage that could extend into the far future because of the The X Factor of technological development which is always interrupted. Otherwise. Natural cultural flows like there are plenty of points where our existing class structure should have collapsed a long time ago. What saved it at every point was a technological breakthrough pressure applied to a point of mental pressure. Collective like creative intellectual pressure applied to cracks in an edifice. You know technology is like the finger in the dike that then over time because of the breakthroughs involved in technological innovation and development create a whole new terrain that extends The Horizon out even farther but we're and and if and now though we it could continue indefinitely but not without the mass majority of humanity being extinguished and really 

The political question of for first worlders is how do you imagine integrating yourself into that process where are you going to be as that is occurring and of course for everybody hearing this and myself. I'm inside this machine but you know it's going to break down not according to like a static border. But it's going to happen within polities between polities is going to be a hollowing out and a collapse around protected geographical atolls. An archipelago of capital the the air in California is incredibly clean actually because there haven't really been any wildfires yet and a lot of that is attributed to the fact that it rained like crazy for early this year. It rained almost the entire month of January so stuff's a lot wetter. There's there's less less Tinder there probably will be fires but right. Now there really aren't any and that's the fun thing about. Like this climate. Disruption is that it is uncombined and uneven results and moving and shifting responses which means like the worst of it has never felt anywhere permanently. You just have these emergencies and that's why it will be managed indefinitely and I think technology will allow it to be managed indefinitely as opposed to the the full apocalyptic. Reckoning that a lot of people I think are afraid of but secretly yearn for because if that happens it.

Cleaves them of their responsibility. Their moral responsibility to assess their relationship to the process. Somebody says polar sucks. Polar is pretty good man. I think polar is good you're tripping if you don't like puller oh. So we recorded our show earlier um.

So we're not going to have anything about the affirmative action ruling on it. I don't know how much there is to say though like everyone I think knew this one was coming and also at this point. You've got to really wonder like how how crucial is this in like the broader sense when you considered how how few people like admission standards to selective universities refers to and also the fact that Roberts left universities the leeway to consider race but on an individual per standard which since they already have a black box admissions standard They can just claim that they do every time there's no enforcement mechanism so if they want to keep doing it they'll keep doing it. I don't think they're going to. I think that their their ideology there is protected and cocooned enough that they will keep doing what they were doing anyway It's very funny though because like if like a lot of white people were very happy right now but like if they really if they took this seriously which they won't if they took this all the way seriously all right we're getting rid of race completely. Well then guess what you're still not getting into a university. But it's because an Asian person took your spot. Not a black person congratulations foreign I mean and that right there is just good old-fashioned supply and demand in populations like there's a lot more. Asians with the resources and desire to have their kids attain a exclusive University degree. Then there are white ones and yeah like exclusive.

University should be bulldozed like I've discussed what I think there should be instead of universities. I think there should be Mana. I mean this is of course not like have them pass. This now have Brandon pass this now like no an entirely different government operating under different. organs of deliberation would have to carry this policy out but it would be national service for all kids for a couple of years where you go somewhere in the country that you aren't from meet other kids who aren't from there and work together on some sort of goal and then while you're there and then also when you come home. You will have access to locally available education in any subject you choose for free and for stuff that is more intensive and requires like intensive educational infrastructure. You would have centers for that where people who wanted to do that work could go but the idea of college let's get all.

These overproduced Suburban little Barons together and let them just chill when their hormones are at their ripest and all of them can develop a psychological political psychological neuroses because of the trauma of colliding with the rest of the world in where where they are learning that there can be nothing to do about alienation that we are all in Eternal Warfare with one another. But also we should be making heaven on Earth and we should get rid of all the bad things and the way to do that is to feel bad about them because there's no other there's no actual thing. We can do about any of them good. Lord anyone who defends this prop thing because like it creates liberals or something is completely deluded. It creates cultural schizophrenia and eventual Civil War like how about you come into adulthood hormones and all this going with a bunch of other people who are all working together on a common project holy. Maybe these aren't maybe our cultural racial. gender conflicts are not Eternal and un resolvable maybe.

It isn't a zero-sum game but that's what they're learning. And it's very funny to me the number of conservatives who think that they're going to destroy this thing that even though they are a product of it and their mindset is merely a refraction a reversal of the mindset that it's imprinting onto all those horrible Libs like you are Hostage to the same ideological fantasy and neurotic. um torture chamber. As the libs are like oh. We gotta replace the curriculum at Harvard with with Cicero and. It's like that's what it was for a long time and it still produced eventually a culture of liberal neuroses because that's what academics are going to generate for a very long time. Conservatives would complain about how all the universities are staffed with liberals or communists and for one thing that wasn't true in many of the disciplines like business and stuff. But more importantly conservatives wanted to make money. A conservative would come a conservative of like intelligence and drive. The person who could complete like a multi-year postgraduate course in any subject would rather make money than dick around and the quad.

What is to be what is what a value is to be found here values to be found in the market I'm going to go and fight in the marketplace. The entire idea of like we need more conservatives in universities. It totally missed the Sorting mechanism that puts people into jobs and the people who want to hang around. College are the people who don't want to go out into the market for one reason or another either they don't think they can hack it or. They think it's wrong to do so and usually a combination of both like the decision that oh it's immoral to engage in the market is often paired to I would be bad at it. I certainly know it's true in my case so you're going to create a cast of nervous anxious guilt-riddled nerds who just sit around and try to ritually discharge their accumulated sense of guilt to be in a system that they know is bad.

Now things are decayed so much that I think that there is something to the conservative demand for like conservative conservative conservative affirmative action in universities just in the sense that there's nowhere to make money people are like even people who would rather make money or finding like oh no maybe. The academy is a better option. It's a more stable job environment but of course. At this point it isn't the profession has been destroyed so there's nothing like the conservatives and the libs are fighting over like the future of Academia exactly as it's collapsing so all these questions about welfare about affirmative action and and tenure it's like and who's going to be teaching our kids. It's like the whole model is collapsing. It's all falling down right. Now. That's the only reason that it's up for grabs is because it's no longer valuable when it was valuable if there was a Structure to keep reproducing it and now it's gone oh and they had to dismantle it and how did they dismantle it well. They dismantled the new left which is mostly students partially by giving a bunch of them jobs in the academy you can't bring down the system but you can critique it and maybe the kids that you teach it teach their critique to will one day undo it of course that's self-serving.

But it's no one's fault because there was no alternative at that point like the historical energies that it guided the left through its institutionals. It's it's institutional power had evacuated and you have to still live are you going to destroy yourself like a bug bug zapper running Against the Machine or are you going to live and that's a question we all have to ask. And I honestly don't think that you can judge anybody who makes either choice because they're making them individually. A lot of people are going to make the choice to go along and the the best compromise they can imagine is I'll I'll get the same same quarter lot that my parents did that I thought was Bourgeois sell out murder but because instead of you know working at a factory or working on Madison Avenue and contributing to the war machine. I am on the campuses deconstructing all of the propaganda and and the systems of power and I'm teaching the kids how it works and all this stuff and so that's worthwhile work that needs to be done to oppose this thing without opposing it and that went for a while.

You know the financialized Boom. The the illusory boom that that went from like the mid 80s until 2008. the the home-based speculative boom that that was filled in for like a productive economy as we were dismantling ours but at the end of the century the bill comes in and this this system has to be destroyed like the idea of a bunch. A big pool of academics sitting around and talking to kids that's going away and you're going to be replaced by by proletarianized thought. Leader thought thought workers intellectuals who are essentially Uber drivers because they're taking they're getting paid per class with no benefits or guaranteed of employment. So who's going to do that who's gonna did allow this institution to be destroyed when these people care about it.

So much administrators which is that strata of people within this you know overproduced Elite who can be bought off and can convince themselves that the work they do is Meaningful and what you have to do to convince them is you need to give them way more money and lo and behold the more money you give people the easier. It is for them to pull some reason out of their ass that what they're doing is Meaningful and so the people who have detached who have destroyed this University system are administrators. Now some of them are like Dei you know inclusivity. People and those people have a ready-made explanation to themselves of why they're doing. But most of them are just just essentially academic bureaucrats and if you give them the power to do it and you give them enough money to motivate them. They'll do it just like if you give if you gave the people the former communist officials in Eastern Europe. After the fall of the Soviet Union you give them enough money and they will sell you everything that they used to think mattered in the world.

What's so exciting and terrifying about the moment we live in is that that regulatory element of maintaining capitalist stability. In the core. The ability to spy off a group is going away. There is no more like college itself can no longer be stand as like this this ritual that like it'll be fun and it might be annoying but it'll mostly be enjoyable and at the end of it you will be able to be one of us. And it's that's not a credible claim anymore for for basically anyone and that is one of those cracks that's emerging and what's going to fill it some combination of technological advancements. Social change and ferment are going to push us along a path and we're all alive for it and in it and it doesn't matter How It Ends. Our part in it is part of an eternal process so yeah. That's why there could never be a black pill. It just doesn't make sense you're alive all right at the end.

Here I'm going to do a quick quick set of Gulf War cards apologies to anybody who's not a fan of the Gulf War cards. I just find a lot of this very interesting. So the first one we got here is a military asset. The M1 the M1 main battle tank the. Good old M1 main battle tank and I saw this one and I thought is this a I think this might be a double. I remember we did a men battle tank that wasn't. The Abrams. Tank is that the same one and then I look back through them and it's like no. We did this one. We did the M60 main battle tank which I think is the coolest looking one and I was just like God damn. That's three main battle tanks. We got three main battle tanks what does the word main even mean. That's how you know you got a military Empire when you got three main battle tanks seems like you should have one main battle tank. That's your main battle tank through the words of meaning or not. So. This though is the M1. This is the M1 main battle tank which looks more like the Abrams to me and therefore less aesthetically pleasing oh main battle. Like there you use them in the main battle as opposed to the outer battle I don't know In 1976 the U.S army awarded Chrysler the contract for 11 xm1 Vehicles the forerunners of the M1 and M1 A1 Abrams. The first A1 M1 had revolutionary gas turbine engines and 105 millimeter main gun. The Fire Control System included Laser Rangefinder full solution digital computer and day night sight a later version. The M1A1 included a 120 millimeter main gun and an integrated air conditioning system wait a minute. Some of these don't have air conditioners. foreign manufacturer General Dynamics speed 45.1 41.5 million miles per hour range. 289 miles armaments 120 millimeter main gun two two 7.62 millimeter machine guns and 12.7 millimeter machine gun.

So there you go eight eight gallons to the mile. What a mile is eight gallons of gas holy. I already said something smart. This is the card time this is a very funny one to me military skills. Fitness folks don't we love it. Fitness of mine. Fitness of body is the slogan of the US military uses to encourage health U.S Marines upon graduation from boot camp set their fitness goals for 20 pull-ups 60 sit-ups in two minutes and running three miles that can't still be the standard right they have to have gotten rid of that. There's no way. There's still a military if they're asking a bunch of 18 year olds in the 10 in 2023 to do that and running three miles in less than 18 minutes no way. Marines train at least three hours a week in aerobic and anaerobic Fitness giving them strength and endurance three three hours a week in aerobic and anaerobic Fitness giving them strength and endurance. The US Marines and other services have intramural programs for such Sports as softball football basketball wrestling and boxing yeah good luck good luck with that 

So we've got here government. Congress. The clown car is is this is this Cirque du Soleil where is this building h . This is where they keep the clowns what exactly is. Anaerobic. Fitness is a good question I read that and I didn't really get it. The Congress of the United States is the legislative branch of government. It is bicameral divided into two somewhat equal parts or yeah. Not somewhat equal the the power of a single Senator versus. The power of a single congress. Person is is not somewhat equal organization the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has 100 members two from each state elected for six-year terms. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for two years At present there are 435 Representatives. The number allowed each state being based upon population with each state having at least one only Congress can declare war and yet didn't do you really want to bring that up with your Gulf War trading cards. Oh I'm sorry. They're Desert Storm trading cards. The word war is not used. Therefore it was not a war. Don't ask any questions about why we have not declared a war and yet we still have troops everywhere shut up.

No it said aerobic and anaerobic oh boy well check out. This dude check out the eyebrows on this Beast Admiral Frank R Kelso. The second this is the second Frank R Kelso look. At this guy. He looks like a late Soviet premiere. This is the guy who found version of deadness borscht following graduation from the Naval Academy in 1956. Oh yeah someone said Michael Aquino eyebrows very interesting Kelso served in the cargo ship. USS Oglethorpe wow cool before attending submarine School in 1958 and 1960. The submarine guys are mutants to me. I could not think of a less appealing thing to do than to go into a submarine for an extended period of time and even like one that you know isn't gonna bro implode. It's just you can't there's no sunlight. What's wrong with you you don't have to do it. It's all volunteer. That's the wild thing nobody gets assigned to sub. Duty these freaks are volunteering and I'm sure part of that is that you get high faster promotion because of that but perverts yeah they give you more money of course but you'd have to be a sicko.

 from January 1969 to August 1971 he served as commanding officer of the U.S naval nuclear power school in Bainbridge Maryland. On June 30th 1986 Kelso was promoted to Admiral and assumed the duties of commander-in-chief U.S Atlantic Fleet. He became the U.S Navy's 24th chief of Naval operations on June 29 1990. So this guy is in charge of sending the aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf to Just Launch. Those Bull Halsey over here you're Admiral Nelson just parking your floating shopping mall off the coast of Kuwait and that's having some guys and headphones. Press buttons amazing born Fayetteville Tennessee USA Tennessee man birth date July 11 1933. So he's probably dead right Frank Kelso probably dead somebody check on that education. University University of the South oh boy Sewanee Tennessee USA and the U.S Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland in 1956. A fine Southern gentleman with very impressive eyebrows dead in dead in 2013 well there we go so he made it to 80. Because he's born in 33. Yeah he made it to 80. Pretty good what branch would I go into if I had to maybe for sure but not the Subs I'll swab the deck baby Air Force is too much math no thank you I would absolutely do do very poorly on anything having to do with the technical elements of anything. Yeah Coast Guard would be nice following a family tradition I've said this before. But I had a very old dad second family type situation. So my dad was a World War II veteran which is wild and he he volunteered for the Coast Guard. He was like I'm not getting my ass shot off no thank you so now.

That's a tradition like none other all right geography we've got good old Lebanon Lebanon Good Old Lebanon. The Republic Lebanon has been racked by Clan Warfare for centuries. You could say that the action the factions include Maronite Christians Sunni Muslims interesting they do the Muslims with the o old timey Style. Drews and Shiite Muslims civil war broke out in 1958 and 1975. During the last year Syrian troops intervened and remained in Lebanon. Israel also intervened on two occasions three now last time they got their asses kicked. In 1983 the USA and other Western Nations sent troops to Beirut to enforce a ceasefire. An action on military installations resulted in the death of 241 U.S Marines attack on military installations rather and then we. It's very funny geographic area for thousand fifteen square miles population 3.3 million languages Arabic French English predominant religions Islam and Christianity Capital Beirut government type Republic head of government president Elias harani yeah yeah oh poor. Lebanon. One of those places with a lot of mountains that all of the non-conformists gobbled up whenever you got like an imperial religion. A religious Imperium it got it just absolutely dominates in low and flat areas. They're able to essentially administer the a homogenization of religious practice pretty effectively but once you get up into the hills and all bets are off. But that means when she tried to turn Lebanon into a westphalian state.

Post-colonial era not great that's like one of the very few times that the Irish have been deployed militarily in the world. They were un the two big like Irish military Adventures outside of you know the domestic ones of the 20 post-war period when they were like no thanks to World War II and then stayed neutral is they were un observers or they. They were U.N peacekeepers in the Congo in the early 60s when there was this attack by like the I think the katangan Rebels on their position and they did a Worx drift standoff. For like a week. They made a Netflix show about it and then the other was that they were peacekeepers occupying the area between the the the not yet Hezbollah. At that point Southern is Southern Beirut Shia and the Israeli occupiers yes the siege of jadeville so I'm talking about 1960. And then um yeah they had They had peacekeepers in in Beirut which led to a scandal where a Christian militia probably killed a Irish U.N Peacekeeper who went off base and then they kind of covered it up and blamed the Palestinians. At one point. I think they tried to blame this Shia. and The Pogues actually wrote a song about it about Billy's bones but other than that the Irish mostly just like to fight each other which very fitting military asset oh baby.

We all anyone from the 90s knows and loves this baby the a v 8B Harrier two. This is a jump jet anyone see True Lies you know what these things are capable of. It's hilarious because you think about it for five seconds and you're like that's dumb. We don't need that but then you see that movie and you're like you know what when it like just ripped open that entire story of that Miami high-rise that's pretty tight a truly versatile aircraft yeah. The U.S Marine Corps Harrier 2 is capable of vertical takeoff and Landing for either a carrier or a land base designed as a close ground support aircraft. It can hover over the combat area and direct its fire at artillery and placements or armor. The Harrier can strafe enemy ground troops at high speeds tiring machine firing machine guns and missiles or dropping clusters of fire bombs. I can understand the theoretical value to something like that like you need close air support. Fast helicopters are going to be aren't going to be as fast as a jet that could get to the side of the close air support and then hover like a helicopter. I get it but that also feels like something that you suggest you know just like the 15th hour of brainstorming when you have literally no chance. Anyone will say no to anything that you suggest you know those guitars that are like double guitars. It's like what if there was a plane that could just like go like that and they're like yeah. Let's do it. I mean now that we have instead is the Osprey which is just a way to kill to kill military pilots and passengers. Manufacturer British Air Aerospace McDonald Douglas speed 668 miles per hour range 541 miles per hour miles in combat.

Armament 25 millimeter guns Sidewinder and Maverick missiles laser guided or cluster bombs. A crew of one yeah honestly just worth it for the worth it for True Lies even if it never did anything else and I honestly don't know if it ever did has a Harrier ever been used in combat somebody tell me military asset here a Knox class frigate we gotta frigate guys. We got a frigate oh the Falklands oh man. The bloody oggies there are more than a dozen U.S Navy frigate operating in waters in and around the Middle East. The Knox class frigates are armed with medium range surface to surface and surface-to-air missiles. The Vreeland was assigned to the Roosevelt Carrier Group in the Red Sea and the Montgomery was assigned to the Saratoga Carrier Group Home. Port of both ships is Mayport Florida displacement. 4250 tons fully loaded length of 436 feet. Speed 27 knots knots. Array Armament Harpoon and San Sparrow missiles a sea. Sparrow missiles one five inch gun four fixed torpedo tubes and one I gotta get bifocals. One phalanx c-i-w-s a crew of 288 that seems like a good number to have you got a good group. There does. Us carry those aircraft carriers.

It's like a cruise ship. There's thousands of people and now we've got intelligence file oh boy. We had Judaism and now Islam oh boy. This will be awkward Islam Christianity and Judaism all believe in the same God who Muslims call Allah as well as in the prophet Abraham and Moses. Followers of Islam recognize Jesus as a prophet preceding M ammad. The five pillars of Islam are the statement there is no God but God and M ammad is his Prophet praying five times a day in the direction of Mecca Saudi Arabia giving regularly to charity fasting during the days of Ramadan and making a pilgrimage to Mecca if possible that's pretty true and not in there nothing there about it being blood drinking Maniacs or anything. They were pretty children that first Gulf War because there had been no. 911 beforehand followers 900 million at the point percentage of the world's population. 17 founder M ammad found dead six hundred six one one eighty sacred text the Quran and the hadiths and if you are actually a fan of Western monotheism as a concept. If you're down with the one God deal we all commit to one. God we we pick them and we follow him. We ride or die and we like put all of our human traits onto them and and all that stuff if you're into that then you gotta back Islam Christianity is cashed. It is. Washed Judaism still got some juice but that's just because of you know the existence of Israel and and the position of the the live the live nature of Judaism among Jewish Elites. Like there's no Christians with money you know what I mean they believe in themselves. They've turned Jesus into a pagan war god that represents themselves and capital is a is Satan from that world. Now this the reigning God over all and the only monotheistic alternative to that is is Islam. It's because it's a live religious Tradition at all levels of society or most anyway most certain more much more than Christianity. But I don't know I I don't think it's I don't think the future is monotheistic. I gotta say it just seems like a thing.

That's got. A got an expiration date one way or the other ah Spain Spain. In our hearts. It's been reading a lot about these thanks to the Spanish Civil War pod I'm preparing but these are some more guys who just sort of watched and clapped while we did the Gulf War located in southwestern Europe. Spain has coastlines on both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean because of its relationship with Germany and Italy during the 30s and 40s. Spain was not granted admission to the United Nations until 1955. That's a way to put it because they were fellow Travelers of the access because they were like a junior varsity Nazis. We were like no you don't get to be in the U.N you sit out they made him sit out man that must have pissed off a lot of the Loyalists because there was a feeling among a lot of the exiled Spanish leftists that when the war ended the project would continue and that they would liberate Spain. Now the U.S had no intention of doing that instant alliance with all the former Nazis against the Soviet Union and the continuation of the war. Although this is a very interesting fact to me some of the first units into Paris when it was liberated in 1945 were a tank. was a tank column attached to a part of the French military made up almost exclusively of Spanish Civil War. Veterans Spanish ones from the losing side who had spent time in refugee camps in France after the Spanish Civil War ended and then joined the free French when the war spread to the rest of Europe yeah but they never could never really pull off fascism. Like classical fascism. They did not have a dynamic enough Urban middle class for that they just instead of that. They did a leisurely d agriculture. A leisurely move from City to come from the country to the city under gunpoint but not through popular enthusiasm.

No thank you well. I mean these people say oh they're too lazy. Someone says too lazy. It's sunny. It's really really sunny all the time why would you want to be up and doing stuff. It's not logical. It's not rational and it does not serve the human spirit to go against that geographic area. 194 900 square miles population 38 9.6 million language Spanish what a shock They're one of those countries. That's got a whole language named after them which is always cool language Spanish. As I said predominant religion Roman Catholicism. They had got the Catholicism out of them like 100 years ago like the Working Class People were atheists in like the 1800s. By now this is like five old ladies and a black hair nets who go to church government type constitutional monarchy head of government prime minister Felipe Gonzalez Marquez yeah so there's Spain just just oh I forgot this part. for Operation Desert Storm Spain supplied Naval units okay cool. I'm sure they were very integral and here we go we got Poland. We forgot Poland. No we remembered Poland. We will never forget Poland after being a major independent country for three. I think I've read this one before you know. I'm pretty sure I did I literally forgot Poland. That's funny all right well. There you go no last one because it's Poland we already one of the worst. Flags by the way on Earth just very uninspiring honestly even if the color bands were like the other way it would be more interesting. I don't like the TR. I don't like tri-color Flags either they're very boring to me too. Those are those are Z generating flags all right. I'm gonna go talk to y'all later bye-bye.
