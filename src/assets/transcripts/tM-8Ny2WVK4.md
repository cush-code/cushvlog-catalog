Oh there hi guys sorry about that took me in a second to get the old internet could foo bling so hi everyone so today is actually a fortuitous day for the stream because I've gotten some feedback recently from trusted friends who say that they think what I'm doing here is interesting but that I'm not as legible as maybe I need to be for a general audience who's that good faith can't be assumed at every level. Hey. Alex how you doing and then I kind of need to reel in a little bit because you know bad faith actors could take things said in the heat of a discussion out of context and then you know becomes part of the arsenal of weaponry against Chapo and I respect and love. My co-workers very much and I don't want to see them threatened in any way so I'm taking that into consideration and one of the pieces of advice I got which I understood sort of as I see a lot you know as a theoretical point but which was hard to really commit to on the stream because I get excited didn't kind of fly off is to ground things in specific examples like I think the talk about Napoleon. We did yesterday where we talk about Napoleon and what he did visa. V you know directory and Haiti.

I thought that wasn't it. That was good. I feel like I made some I made some good points relatively and it and more importantly it felt like it was in a vocabulary that was communicable across planes of understanding to people and large enough percentage to be worth pursuing so. I'm keeping that in mind and fortuitously as I'm getting this feedback.

This is also the day when I realize a lot of people are saying Matz what is the grill pill match. Grill pail D what does this mean and I've realized now oh. This is a perfect example. This is a perfect opportunity to take a concrete issue and drill down on it and if every level staying applied to the material focus and not getting spinned off spun off into into the ideological realm. So let's talk grilling now. I started calling myself. Grill pilled a couple months ago basically as the campaign for Sanders fell apart at as the mummified remains of Imperia tour. Joseph Robinette Biden were strapped to a chariot and led through the forum and it was my attempt to express my. You know pretty much instantaneous disenchantment from the democratic election election because my reasoning in supporting Sanders was that a political campaign of that size of magnitude was the sort of short basic shortcut through the cultural firmament that we needed to get to a discussion of actual material conditions in this country and I feel like progress was made on that course. The Bernie Sanders campaign and its proximate goals was yes a failure but I feel like it progressed the ball down.

The court now did it progress the golf on the field long enough to be meaningful in in the coming crisis point wherever that comes that's a separate question and that's up to us. But in the moment I knew that the danger there and I could see it happening. As soon as Biden became the nominee is it a lot of people who had that how I Alanna who had that energy and had basically offloaded their sense of political purpose in life onto that campaign and the more and the more actual work they did for the campaign. Maybe the less like unmoored their emotions regarding it would be like people who were on the campaign volunteer for the campaign because they had put so much of themselves into it. I feel like they probably were a little bit more you know reasonable about what was happening but people who were just rooting for it online and investing all their energies in it and we were basically the cheerleaders like that was our job like amber was doing real work. But I know me I know Felix.

I know we'll at Virtua. We were we were cheerleaders and I think like that's good like cheerleaders have a purpose. I mean they they they improve the morale of your side and that's not unnecessary. I think I mean whatever but when you have all that energy and it's all at the struck at the symbolic level of the presidential campaign and it doesn't relate to your action. The danger is you're gonna want to replace that energy at a similar level of abstraction and spectacle and there's nothing comparable to the presidential Electress. So I could already feel my bye center of gravity and I could see it happening to others pulled towards.

Let's argue with Biden supporters until the election about why he's not worth voting for and get called 'russian bots for the next six months and I just saw it all happening. I just thought this is that would be honestly a perverse and monstrous results of the Sanders campaign. If people who were you know relatively attuned to like the material. Breakdown of this country basically ignored the biggest crisis that had ever seen in order to invest in owning people who like Biden online and I started doing it immediately even as I was grill filling like I grew I said I'm drill filled. It's not my problem but that was partially a weapon to be used against Biden supporters to say you're gonna lose now because we're not voting with your guy and suck it. It was your fault. It was just a way to own them in a different. I use I was owning them by winning by it by my guy winning primaries but then that that could work anymore there were no more primaries to win so now. I'm loaning guys virtually by reminding them that in the future they're gonna be owned. Like yeah. You owe me now in this primary but it's November you're gonna be owned by me and that's why I would just post the picture of Robert Downey senior from bull unites at every complaining liberal who was talking already preparing themselves to blame the Bernie bros that would be like that's not my problem. That's not a problem of course. The fact that I felt compelled to post this. Everyone I saw I actually at one point went hunting for buying supporters to post the guy at obviously. I think it's my problem and I know it's my problem because a Biden presidency very well might be the end of the American political the American political experiment like in Syria. In real terms I mean by a trump. A trump second term might be too but both of them are in a real. I could not think of two parties and two people representing two parties less able to deal with the coming situation whatever it turns out to be so. It's obviously it's my problem but the psychic cost of being sad that bite losses that's not my problem. But obviously I still have anxiety about what's gonna happen because now I needed a posted Biden supporters to own them and that's when I realize no I have to actually take that and so the grill pill was ironic.

[07:32](https://youtu.be/tM-8Ny2WVK4?t=07m32s)

You know you guys know the meme of the guy flipping the burgers and he says Klansmen racism politics. I just want to grow for God's sakes of course that was an ironic or appropriation because there's nothing I cared not nobody nobody talking about that cares more about what they're talking about that. Somebody who posts the the grill guy because you're trying to cover up for the knowledge that you are in fact mad and red and nude and owned and all those things that you spend. Your life terrified for other people to find out about rushing in with you my tongue okay and but it's like I honestly feel like the quarantine helped sort of break my rhythm obviously and made me sort of have to reassert where I was finding value where I was finding like enjoyment and I realized that grill pill is really an approach to the internet more than anything and as a as something like as a in general but specifically for younger people who find their politics and hone. Their politics online and the the essence of grill pill is to log off and grill instead and the grilling can be whatever it is. That's actually in your life that gives you a sense of satisfaction because all that energy you were expending and I was expending caring about the presidential election which like I said two terrible options like I said things might change if Burton if Jesse Ventura runs and gets some get some get some gas gets a little bit of tread in the tire and things keep getting worse pop but barring that that is a sterile investment you're not going to get anything out. Anything in your nothing in your life is going to get better by focusing on the presidential election so grill instead and by that I mean focus on something in your life that brings meaning to it but that goes beyond the inner that goes beyond just caring about the presidential election. It goes broader to caring about politics insofar as you're caring about politics is expressed by going online to talk about them to people and spend more likely to argue with people about them or to make fun of people about them and obviously.

This is in herre little areas coming from me because I'm one of the Pied Pipers that brought people onto these platforms. Now I think in retrospect I feel pretty. I feel relatively proud of my position because I honestly do feel like chapo was the opposite of a bash pipeline.

It was a pipeline away from alienated young white men from the the lure of the genuinely genuinely transgressive web right because when you're alienated and you're online and one group of people tells you that you're too stupid piece of who should cut your dick off for being a white male and another group is saying we're gonna make fun of these people who think you suck your commitments at that point which aren't very strong because you're just getting online they harden very quickly hello Blair. They harden very quickly and we were an alternative to that it's like you can still have fun. You can still do jokes. You can you don't have to be like. Obviously all of those are those rad libs that people hate they were getting the same joy out of the internet too. But their's was in policing their joy was in suppressing ideas. They thought they were doing a good thing by by making other people miserable. Those people being the white male assists gamergaters but of course for the white male 6.

Camera Gators their enjoyment come from annoying those people and that starts is just a desire to antagonize. But over times it gets rolled up with a bunch of other beliefs because you're in contact with people who are all similarly alived generally in terms of background and racial identification and gender and things like that and those gonna solidify arguments and that's what happened with arguments within the left and between the left and the right online. It was. It was this sterile contest and it continues to be and it can only be a sterile contest and the grill pill idea of that. I'm coming into understanding is that when you log online to talk about the Internet to press your political opinions to do what you're doing basically is you're displacing your material and spiritual alienation from the society. You find yourself in and sending it out onto the Internet to get resolved and everyone has some some percentage of material and spiritual alienation and they are absolutely inverse to each other so like the chapo fan or alt.

Right neat is a classic example who somebody who's not really materially is materially is genuinely materially deprived in that they can't really expect to own a home or start a family even if they wanted to work or new people to do it with but they have home because they live with their parents or something. So they're wildly alienated from the situation mainly in the forest. Even though they have free time way more free time that somebody who works a lot a lot of hours. They have all of their free time is alienated from Haley because they are judging themselves and hating themselves for being idle. At some level. They believe themselves to be useless because they've internalized the notion of work as worth and that uselessness has to get set plinth set somewhere and if some level you identify it as a political problem. If you do some people. A lot of people don't most people don't I mean all those people screaming about Jerry.

Dunk. Headphones on Facebook have the same alienation in different degrees and they're expressing a Jerry tongue for stealing and sense phones instead of the president because their relative lack of alienated free time makes them less likely to abstract away their concerns into the political realm. They're more likely to for them to be concrete. So you have people who have this perfect combination of alienation. They go online and they express their opinions and they think and they have some subconscious idea that by doing that they will alleviate their suffering in some way. There they don't necessarily think that out loud and in fact they might even tell you to your face and believe it actually.

[14:31](https://youtu.be/tM-8Ny2WVK4?t=14m31s)

No. I know I'm not doing anything. I'm nya list. But they're not. There's no such thing as a nihilist. The only nihilists are in the graveyard. They have some sort of belief and if they're engaging politically if they have a politically even like black pill people who don't say they want politics and thinks that like voting is a cope they are still gaining satisfaction from antagonizing a group of people who are who in their mind are political opponents and so that's what good that's what internet political or that's what internet political dialogue to be exact is the thing is it is inevitable and in fact necessary first step because that's how change happens in a society. A court according to or that's how change generally happens in in in the capitalist modernist context is that you get an overflow of alienated alienated free time among like the lower bourgeois in a society and then that alienated free time gets directed towards the purpose of making the political situation that made them alienated change. The material conditions change which allows them to reach more people who now are because say they all lost their jobs. They're not haven't. They don't have as much materially they don't have as much alienated labor time. Now they have more alienated free time and because in addition to that they have less resources because they're getting paid for fewer hours. They are more alienated in general and so the that time that the labor alienated are sorry um the time that the leisure alienated middle class they build up answers.

They bounce off ideas about what's wrong with the society so when more people are ready to listen they're there to hand it off to them that's basically like since. Since the basic sets the fresh revolution that's how social change has moved not always in a revolutionary sense sometimes gradually accommodated by the system but that's the move. So. This is a necessary first step. It wasn't necessary for stuff. The internet left was inevitable because those were that's where the people they used to stand on street corners and here you guys yell in Hyde Park. Then the economy got more abstracted. A communication and symbols got more abstracted and they listened to guys on the radio. They wrote. They handed out pamphlets and newspapers. Now they're on the Internet and it's all because they are trying to work out for themselves why they don't feel good even though their lives are compared to others even in their own country. City neighborhood okay cheerily thing is is that they have nothing productive to do because the economy is only based on profit and Psyche I'm sorry we have nothing for you to do you can just hang around even though we've created a structure of incentives and values within this society that means that you basically mean nothing and now you just have to sit with meaning nothing well.

If you sit with me nothing long enough in front of a computer. You're gonna put that out there Hyde Park and I'll in London speakers corner so that's that was inevitably gonna happen and then ideas got refined out of that. That's where you had like you know the rose emoji guy you know like that was a type of person who put computer in a political energy into a computer and then it like affected their behavior. They started going to meetings at ESA. Maybe they knocked for for Bernie and that and that was them trying to act more closely to their actual physical situation. Because that's what the feedback loop is you start off with a vague sense of alienation. You put it out in the world and try to make sense of it. Other people talk to you about it. You refine either through conversation or public media or social media which is the latest stage you refine it into a belief system that convinces you enough to change your behavior. Now you're ready to knock on doors. Now you're ready to do the the Bernie Tyler now you're ready to to actually just and and guarantee you that everybody who did that felt better about themselves while they were doing it than they did on the computer and now bernie is gone and people don't know where to put the energy especially.

Since most a lot of them are either working 80 hours a week at jobs. There could kill them or kill their family members or their buttoned-up with nowhere to talk to and nowhere to put anything but the internet and so my advice to everybody who's feeling that like dislocation of okay now I got to find meaning again but the thing is now that thing that gave them their meaning. It's all been. It's all frozen now. It's all reified. These categories are completely fragile and I mean these these categories are completely. They're fragile if they're hitting a certain way but they're completely fixed so there's no more dialogue to do. All you can do is bang your head against the wall make other people feel bad and then feel for a second slightly good about making them feel bad and then that and but it'll get worse. It'll get less and less effective over time and you'll feel more and more misery and you'll have to put more and more of that physically into the internet and that'll get you less in return. The hedonic treadmill. You're doomed but the thing is there is still something for you to do. You fled to the internet the first time because you didn't know what it was and now you're going back to the internet. Now you went to the Internet the last time and found it. I know I did or something closer to it now now going back with the same conditions. Nothing's really changed everything's been hardened. There is no more growth there. There's only slow decay of your interest in politics. Like at the end of that hedonic treadmill you are black belt because it's like I don't get anything else out of this. I don't get anything else out of caring about politics and the only way you're gonna fight.

But the thing is is that when you hear get off the internet it's terrifying because you still don't know what to do and so what am I gonna do sit here with my thoughts oh my god. I'm gonna go insane well that is where the grill part comes in. I don't mean grill like in the sense necessarily of a Weber or or whatever I mean look around you find something that you are good at in some combination of talented at but also willing to keep trying and without willing to keep trying is is the closer something is to you the easier it is to get you to do it like somebody says hand me a pencil you don't even think about it. Somebody says help me move you have to think about it for a while because physical exertion physical existence in space-time is wearing. It wears on you if you are not centered basically and yet the way you center yourself is do something that you want to do like it's easier to move than it is to help someone move because it's your apartment and it's easier to move the pace and the guys getting paid to move you. It's harder for him because he's not doing what he wants to do you got a move. It's your place so that is less alienated time and it's all about getting closer to your actual conditions so you might be terrified that you have nowhere to put all that political energy that that sense of identity you've got from being a person with politics that were expressed on the Internet. If I can't express them on the internet. I don't have these politics well even when you were expressing them on the Internet. You really only had those politics to the degree that you acted on them off the internet and so what you do is. You take that energy and you essentially have to depoliticize it.

You have to recognize it as a drive to be to feel useful to yourself not to society and not to your boss or anything which is like the micro propaganda version of the need to create to yourself first and so find something that is enjoyable to do but takes concentration and do it. They could be group. It could be grilling delicious meats whatever it could be. I saw a guy today is building. He's rebuilding a a arcade cabinet from the 80s whatever it is. It needs to be something that you can put you can focus your attention on completely in the here and now and get better at or complete.

[23:51](https://youtu.be/tM-8Ny2WVK4?t=23m51s)

Something Gaming is the opposite of that Gaming is just more on. The Internet. Gaming is more offloading your need to be directly addressing your needs that are in front of you into a psychic realm where they could only ever fall down. The hygienic treadmill like your belief in politics did now gaming can't be done in the right frame of mind to be useful to be you know practice. But it cannot be like the fact gaming existed is a place for people to put their that alienation is one of the most counter-revolutionary things about American society like in broad structure just the fact that there with the internet and with computers and with gaming there's so much place to dump your excess and unexamined alienation that it really undermines your need to address the alienation fundamentally by asking what do I do and so you start by focusing on the here and now and if you're still have political views and you still believe in them. Then they're soaked embers.

A reason you believe in them and now that you were closer to the bone and you're not purely trying to work back because what you're doing by going on the internet to find out what to do. Next is you're trying to work back from in symbolic levels back to reality from abstraction. There's only so far you can go before you're going to get knocked off course by intervening events. In this case the very structure of dialogue and political communication on the Internet. It's gonna push you off course you might get there eventually. But it's way too inefficient and in the meantime you're just getting older. You're getting more alienated. You're getting more aware of death you're getting and it's harder and harder to focus. The only way to do. It is if you're working in both directions that is what creates the signal that brings like you can still throw stuff out there on the internet and like think out loud but only if you have a day-to-day in-your-face practice of not even abstract political belief.

But belief that doing this thing will make me not happy in a distracted way that like masturbation and gaming does but in a genuinely constructive sense that you feel like you are building something now I guess that could be gaming. But I would just say most people do not approach gaming. That way. I would say that if you get mad gaming you don't approach gaming in a way that would make gaming a construct. Basically it has to be a thing. You can do that doesn't make you upset or that makes you upset in a way that just read that that could be read channeled into the project like I've seen too. Many videos of guys to get their computer turned off and throw the remote into the screen to think it. That is a that is a regulated emotional distribution so but once again like you could through if you're if you're true to yourself basically if you aren't lying about what you want gaming can be it and the key.

There is that if you do something and you don't like it don't stop doing it just stop doing it and certainly don't try to see like well. I'll do something else too and split your attention. Don't do either of those things say why is this upsetting me. Why is this irritating me what should I do in this moment to make this project. This activity meaningful and like you might have been struggling with an issue related to like I don't know learning to play the guitar or sculpt and you got frustrated because you weren't willing to push past your confusion and that's because you didn't need to. There was somewhere else to get your put your energy into temporarily. But it's always gonna grind away.

The only thing that's sustaining is focused attention on a project in front of you now while you're doing that while you're learning what you care about you're learning what you value and how you much you value it and what activities you're going to most easily be able to maintain that sense of being on the beam of being where you should be of actually doing what you want to do in a deeper way than you could ever tell yourself that makes it way easier to figure out what to do to express your politics because you're focused on the here and now right in front of you so all of a sudden maybe like a birdie alright. Bernie lost electoral politics is done well. No no no nothing is done until it's no longer part of the political structure you know like elections are.

There people are gonna put their energy into them you just because you say they're irrelevant doesn't mean. Everyone else is going to agree with you but don't do electoral stuff if doing things like calling people's houses knocking on doors if that is too hard for you to find meaning in don't say actually. Electoral is really say that isn't what I should be doing to make things better if you do it like do that stuff if you worked on the Bernie campaign and that stuff gave you a sense of purpose and you found that you enjoyed it time flew fast. It wasn't a scary thing you thought it would be well then find a campaign closer to you closer to your concerns closer to your actual literal physical area all politics is local as old Tip O'Neill sent but like I said maybe you don't like electoral politics specific and it's like you might have a theoretical reason. You don't like electoral politics. But you also have to examine yourself how much of your hatred of internal politics or of electoral politics comes from the fact that you don't want to knock on doors. The fact that you don't want to call strangers and talk to them and if and if and if that's it then you're like well. I have to re-examine my my priors. If that's not it. Though you still have to reaffirm that by testing theories out in the real world and seeing what brings back to you a sense of purpose.

And so while people are I mean I'm assuming if you're watching me on Twitch at six o'clock in the afternoon. You're probably not an essential worker and if you're not take your time take this idle time and be bored for a minute don't do two things once that's the big one because the real tip to getting off Twitter is actually Twitter is actually very easy to get off of and it's very simple. Don't do anything else don't have Twitter scrolling while you're watching. A movie don't have Twitter open with a bunch of other tabs. Just scroll Twitter guess what will happen it'll get boring pretty quickly. I mean they're very short little things. There's very little content to them how many really great tweets do you read in a day even and you'll get bored and the thing is is that maybe in the past you hit that boredom and then you just got mad and decided to troll someone put put. Some epic memes out there to get people mad now you're now you're interested again. Now you have new songs coming back to you from the computer or you turn the TV on or you do something else to leaven the sort of deadening monotony of these little dumbass things coming in so when that happens try it. The next time you're on Twitter just focus on Twitter and when you get bored ask yourself why what is it boring about this and I think you're. Gonna come to realizations yourself about the limitedness of that platform and of course the thing is you. These are things that you've told yourself a million times. Twitter is a waste of time. Twitter is stupid. Twitter doesn't matter but you're still on it so clearly at a deeper level. You believe it does matter because it seems serves a deeper emotional purpose for you. It gives you validity that's that stuff about it not mattering that is psychological cover to allow you to be vulnerable there to be potentially observed in your own state which is of course our nightmare so that we say to ourselves. It doesn't matter. This is stupid. It's actually a stump so that we can protect ourselves from the thing we need because we're so vulnerable with the need. So if you would like ponder Twitter after sitting with it sitting with the boredom of it.

You'll realize oh that stuff I used to have mouth about it being a waste of time that's not just. That's literally true in the sense that if I keep doing this I'm just gonna keep getting anxious and bored and I'm not going to be able to be too leaven that anxiety by expressing it elsewhere it with different distractions so you put it down instead of just instead of trying to multitask. Now what do you do well. What do you want to do what do you really want to do and if the answer is something like what you know you know it's like it can be anything I want to eat a bagel go for it but eventually like keep it keep it like that like well. I want to eat a bagel I want to read this book I want to watch a movie don't go for it just do that just do that but of course. Eventually the alienation is gonna creep back in you're gonna just the alienation of the fact that you're off up and he's running for re-election against the senile Lummi who promises to do all of the same things. But Trump is running on a 911s worth of people dying every day until Election Day and Biden's amber said this on the show we recorded. Today. It was very funny a-and but Biden's Titans bid what do you call. It finds raise that that bid is how about 9/11 every other name.

That's a nun that is a horrifying situation an unconscionable situation and so you want to fix it. What to - you're gonna want to run to the computer. Don't do it. Sit with that discomfort sit with that alienation that this world this country is barreling towards apocalypse. No one has any conception of how to stop it at all but people are gonna have to be there to pick up the pieces and what are you. Gonna do to make that possible and you're not gonna have an answer is the thing you are not. Gonna have an answer and that uncertainty is what used to send you off to the computer. It's what send me off to the computer but if you put if you just say like if you just basically take that feeling and incorporate it into whatever meaningful task that you have invested attention in you will eventually start to realize the political contours of the world around you and what you can do about them in a positive direction and I can't tell you what that is and you can't tell you what that is now. You're only gonna be able to tell you that yourself that weeks from now maybe if you truly refuse to give in to the lure of the spectacle of online politics if you choose to grill basically now for people who are off of off there who are listening to this who are actually essential workers. I I mean I genuinely am thankful for you. Although I understand that the real motivation is not. It's not some sort of a hollow notion of patriotism which is the same scam we pull on the troops. It's it's so you don't lose your job. It's so you don't lose your house. So you can't eat you know. Someone says grilling cost money. Don't it doesn't have to involve anything. It could be learning to draw it can be learning to to like to hacky sack. It could be doing slack lighting.

The content doesn't matter. The content doesn't matter but what matters is the practice of focusing on what's in front of you in order to ground your political beliefs and make your action towards them more effective and the more effective. It is the more you'll want to keep doing it and the enemy of all that is just offloading your your your sense of alienation onto the Internet letting it dissipate there but then the thing is it all curdles back into more self-loathing. It all comes back as self-loathing because you just kind of displaced the feeling for a few minutes or a few hours and now it's back and now you got to sit with it again well. If you're sitting with it and doing nothing that's what I felt for years and years I was absolutely paralyzed because I didn't know what to do with myself because I was thinking at a level of abstraction. If I removed from my in my actual life. I distracted myself from the question of what to do by jacking off by going on the internet by wasting my time like in a literal sense and being miserable for long than I needed to be and I look back on it and it's like Jesus Christ is an alienation just oppression. It's a facet of depression. It's alien a depression is a facet of that degree of spiritual alienation that comes from your degree of idleness that you do not value like leisure. Paula fiers talks about this guesswork leisure without without the constructs of a wage based society is a blessing but the thing is we don't have that we have a little bit of it. You know the weekend and stuff where you can you can relax and not feel guilty about it. But if you're not contributing generally to the economy you're gonna feel guilty about it and that guilt turns into paralysis and the paralysis leaves you totally focused on what's in front of you.

Like that's. The thing depression is like. I said only seeing the first foot in front of you. But the thing is that's only depression is only seeing the foot. It's not invested in where the foot is going and what the foot is doing or the hand or anything you have to invest your surroundings with meaning through action and doing that will make it easier for you to channel that rising anxiety that oh I don't know if I'm gonna be able to live in this country for much longer. I don't know who's gonna be able to live in this country for much longer and connect it to an a useful practice and the thing is how do I know it's useful. It's very simple. It's useful if it doesn't make you feel bad and when I say that it's not doesn't mean that like negative emotions won't be related to it. It means that the negative emotions are external to the practice like if somebody yells at you while knocking on doors. That's gonna make you feel bad for a second but that's from someone else. If it still makes it feel feels right for you to knock on the doors. It's right and you might say well yeah but you might be what you might have reasoned wrong in like what politics to support that's true but you're not gonna find out. They're like the idea that you're going to reason your way to it is a trap that keeps you locked in. Here you can't reason your way to it reasons part of it but you. Reason down while acting up well-well-well doing things up and then they meet in the middle at some point and then you were actually h you're on the beam alright. So does that sound legible does that sound less levan with with like translation errors and feedback than previous stuff. I don't know all right good thanks I'll take some questions time is it. I don't know how long I kind of get in his own I hope he shift. It's been 45 minutes. See I literally felt like five minutes because I was completely focused.

I was completely focused on this task because I think getting this out here is consonant with my political beliefs and I feel like doing this in the moment trying to express this to you guys. At this format is the closest thing I can do right now to my political beliefs and you might say oh that's easy for you. You're a hotshot podcaster that's true. But that's just because I happen to be in a position where I can bring in consonance politics and behavior most people because their jobs aren't political don't have that level of of like material connection to politics to descend from and that makes it a harder task that makes it a harder task but no more no less necessary a task basically because people get mad and say you're in a better situation in you. It's not fair that you're closer to this than I am that's like no nothing is fair. We're trying to make a fair society. We're trying to make a society where material conditions don't determine your degree of alienation and misery. But that's the only gonna happen if we all work towards it. Not if we get mad at each other.

I would somebody has said who's better cinephiles or bibliophiles. I think that's a pretty funny way of putting it. I would say that the distinction between them is the level of abstraction involved in the art that they prefer and that means which like basically which world it's from like. The written word in novel form is not really a 21st century American art. You can still do it but you know it's like. There are still people who perform classical music and there are people who still perform jazz. They are curios they're there. They're there essentially in amber because the social forces that created them have been expended and that's true of literature. The social forces have created that bringing together the idea of literature are gone. Doesn't mean books are gone. Doesn't mean novels are gone. It means that they are in a certain sense sterilized our film is on its way to being there honestly film is on the cusp of becoming irrelevant but it's certainly a more relevant to late 21st century. America political economy than the novel. Both of them are worth exploring and useful to the degree that you approach them in good faith which I would say is the one problem with the cinephile. Because cinema is captured more by late capitalist discourse. I hate to use the word discourse but it's really it's useful in some ways. Sometimes I hope I didn't lose anybody by saying that awful word it means that people it means that and because it is more capital-intensive like film is film is less suffused with individual artistic insight by definition because more people go into it and that can make things better cooperation increases in on some axis cooperation increases outputs but that capital that means that it's now a market product to a greater degree than a novel could be because there's more capital invested in it which means it has to appeal to more people and the thing is something that appeals to everybody and actually appeal to everybody.

That's a great work of art. But it appeals to them at a lower level at a lower resonance level than something that appeals to a smaller group of people because it's more concentrated and less suffused with capital. In its production they could both be equally good. You know like if you were gonna get outside of them and describe them. But it's different because the situation is different because the capital the capital base for the construction of the art part of the superstructure is different and the problem is is that film is sort of artistically attenuated. In that way it still can bring you to great heights but it's just harder to focus and get to those heights because so much in a film is about audience expectations and not expressions of the artist and that's fine.

If it's part of I guess I would say a balanced diet of artistic endeavors where your chew your reading things your watching things your chill basically what it comes down to is you're challenging yourself like when I said like you say I say put the computer down. What should you do what do you. What do you feel like doing. I'm gonna read a book okay if it's a turn your mind off book. You're gonna get bored too eventually but the thing is you also get bored if you read a challenging book for different reasons at both. At both points. You basically have stopped being able to make to make looking at this interesting anymore in the case of simple stuff. It's because there's really nowhere to dig anymore and you're just like you're. It's all just. It's what it is. It's like looking at a at a dinette set or it's too hard and when you're reading a book that's difficult and hard to understand most people close them because you're - because I mean before a quarantine put us all up in here like chickens and COO you're - you were you. Most people were significantly material alienated in terms of their labor time - other than like fail sons and needs like your. It to exhaustion or you've to distracted if you are somebody who spends all day distracting yourself on the internet because I know they made it hard for me to read books what it boils down to is.

You hit a level of legibility and then you just fly off that you bounce off of it. I'm saying just try to understand it because the thing is there is something to understand. There. There is some truth to be mined from every piece of art but you have to check you have to meet it up on its own terms and be willing to keep pushing if it pushes back and the thing is is that only really works have concentrated genius. Push back films can push back but for the most part they don't because if they push back people wouldn't want to people wouldn't like watching them because they're not they're not watching them. For that reason they're watching them for entertainment which we have horrifyingly split from the craft of you know engaging with art in a way that makes our our understanding of the world whole. We've totally said nope because now because of the concentration of capital and the abstraction and and you know the commodification of all discourse. Now it has to make money if that means films are less likely to fight back but people don't read because of the internet and because they're tired they're not gonna read a book to challenges them what they're gonna do is watch a movie and that movies not going to challenge them. But that's gonna create boredom and they have to deal with that part of some how and the way they deal with. It is by investing in motion their own sense of identity into the work of art and that is why people get so mad if you say the movies they like are good. That's the real reason because in essential level when you say someone's stuff that they have invested their identity in Star Wars. Star Trek.

Better call Saul I certainly heard that you're saying that they're not good. People like you are saying that because they have invested their personal identity in the film because there's because they have to put it somewhere and they're not getting it from the car in the text itself because it's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to keep them watching and keeping them watching means not challenging them means yes anding them into an abyss and that's the problem with prestige. TV thank you for someone referencing that and this is the thing I didn't really understand my objection to prestige TV. I knew there was something off with the concept. I knew it kind of grossed me out the whole discourse of it and I wrote an article and I never really got to the best and I talked about this last week. And I still don't think I got to it and now I feel like I kind of understand greater the degree to which television can't be what prestige television claims it is even the good ones. Even Deadwood I'm gonna say it. I'm sorry even Deadwood. Even Sopranos. Even the wire shows I love have seen multiple times and think are great. But their greatness is attenuated. It degree to which it can challenge you is attenuated by the profit motive that's locked up in television production which is more and it makes sense. The TV came after movies because of every level they get more capitally intensive art.

Get art. Forms get more capital-intensive and their artistic input gets attenuated by the input of capital and then and and the way and specifically the way the capital operates with it. Like with a movie you can challenge people a little bit maybe at the end sneak. People sneak around and get people because because you know you buy the ticket if you don't like the movie you're probably not getting your money's back. Most people don't get a refund if they don't like the movie if they get that they're like taking a risk and so you know bad word of mouth hurts it but you could still get a decent chunk and if TV show does work that way people keep to have to keep watching people have to keep watching and the thing is an ideal art. Project at some point confuses you or bores you which is just another version of the same feeling and then you have to push through it. TV has all the incentives of television are the other direction to bring you in challenge. You a little bit but only enough so that you can get it immediately and make yourself feel smart ah see.

That's a symbol that's symbolism. Now. I'm smart. I'm a good person. I don't have to read that book that I can't concentrate on because I've destroyed my brain on the internet so prestige TV once again if you want to watch it. That's fine but you should be reading and doing other things too but people aren't they're too tired. They're too alienated TVs right. There. The episodes keep going as soon as they end you don't even have to press a button. So we have to invest emotional energy instead to make up for that lack and so entire the entire rhetoric of prestige television which is of course reinforced by another subsidiary market because it created the so you had the cultural product of like better.

Television informs the Sopranos. It creates its own new market of jobs telling people. These shows are actually really good and you should keep watching them like although remember the Golden Age of recaps. Nobody was like cracking the code some deep level they were pointing out the stuff that everyone else saw and you read along and nod see like I got that I got that once in a while you won't get something and you're like oh. I didn't get that and then you think that the writer is smart and you're gonna keep reading their reviews but then guess what but the thing is the thing they got the only reason you didn't get. It is because you were on your phone and so that's all prestige television and of course because these things are all reproductions of its. They're all reproductions of each other. Like even if the content is different basically all prestige shows are The Sopranos. At like the DNA level you can say anything you want about the content they are in terms of like shows like The Sopranos set the standard for what we're looking for it.

I'm not talking about quality cuz. That's subjective I mean tone I mean look I mean camera styles and if you watch any of these shows that the way that they have similar general senses of character development cinematography and editing it's because they're all copying each other and they're all copying the model of flattering the audience enough to keep them flattering the audience giving them a left curve once in a while to just keep them interested enough to keep watching but not challenge them too hard that's not a knock on the shows. They can't be any different. They are constrained by the structure and the profit motive and the business model of television except that and then when these shows leave you wanting more don't go online to defend your love of them and defend your the time you spent watching them do something else read something watch something that does challenge you like I realize like I for my whole. Life said I don't like David Lynch and the reason is baylard very simple. I watch the David Lynch movie.

At some point it gets confusing and boring and I stop paying attention well. There. You go because I realized today thinking about The Sopranos and how the Sopranos really is like the model for these shows and how they didn't ever like The Sopranos use of dream sequences and I always thought they were a narrative cheat you're trying to get inside the head of a character who you otherwise don't know what they're thinking because it's a show and not a book and that and the dream sequences are basically an attempt to smuggle in the narrative complexity and like reproduction of stream of consciousness that novels do through the but through very obvious and empty symbolism that anyone that like sub Freud levels symbolism that anyone could do and I realized that's true for The Sopranos. That's what those are there for but you take a guy like Lynch's home movies or dream sequences.

The difference is is that the dream sequences in a soprano show in a pianos episode are the dreams of Tony Soprano made by a room full of writers to character to keep like to basically let the audience know certain things about his character as he through the progression of the plot. David Lynch movies are also are basically just giant dream sequences but for the most part the dreams are his now. They're collaborative at every level but they are more singular than and and have different profit motives because the David Lynch movie doesn't have to make a lot of money. HBO demands that it shows that they spend millions dollars on our long-term investments and so it's not snobbery to recognize the material constraints of a certain art form which is what the prestige TV people the pop Thomas in general say and all that pop team ism is their excess personal emotional investment. In this these limited these commercially limited art forms that they refuse to reproduce somewhere else by engaging with genuinely challenging art. So that is the answer I hope to the question of byblos versus cinephiles.

Also I kind of got off on a track talking about the essential workers being sent out because they're gonna. Start clapping soon sent out to their deaths. If you are one of those people I I mean solidarity obviously to this pathetic degree that I could offer any and there's a good example like I think about other people out there working jobs. And I think that's disgusting. Here I am talking to my phone and they're out there risking their lives for minimum wage what can I do about it well I could go. I could there's a bunch of things I could do that I know I'm not going to do because they're too scary or just uncomfortable or or more. Importantly. I don't think they would do any good like you could go out there and set yourself on fire a Grand Army Plaza.

If you thought it would do any good or you know you would totally released your ego and you were a Buddhist monk or something but as long as you still have ego attachment to this planet. You're not gonna do something self-destructive or even unpleasant unless you think it's gonna do good and the thing is all the things I can think of to do to help this horrible situation right. Now right now would not actually help anyone and so I'm can't motivate myself to do them out of anything other than guilt so that's what this is. This is the small thing people can do. The problem is a lot of them use it to replace that feeling can cut suppress that feeling completely like they do this and then they suppress that feeling or they turn it into you know watching Matthau or putting up refugees welcome here sign a further apartment or whatever this has to be the beginning of a practice and like I said I am still at the stage where I don't know what mine is partially because I'm living in this frictionless cube world where I'm literally not supposed to leave my house like I'm not supposed to like. I think it's technically illegal for me to be out of my home and around other people. I don't even know at this point. But I do say thank you to you guys and I want to make I want to make in a world where you don't have to do that and we're we don't have to sit here like. My friends are but I'm gonna have to work towards it and I have to have faith that my actions day to day will help me know and recognize the moment when it comes 

Alright thank you guys round of applause for everyone watching. I hope you had a good time.
