Um ahoy. I'm assuming folks are there. I don't have my computer out here yet so. I'm hoping that uh that I'm being received here. I've exited host mode. I don't know when I can never tell when but I know now that I have exited host mode. I've exited post malone hey everybody. I'm getting my seasonal allergies on this time of year. Around september. The ragweed rises up and I start sneezing and getting uh and getting a little. Uh stuffed up happens in the spring too uh and as folks can see I am back wearing my strap suit because it's finally kind of chilly. It's kind of fallish and I gotta say this is very rare for new york. I know half the country's on fire and we're tumbling into a climate apocalypse but man last month or so in new york math and half has been exquisite. I've lived in new york probably five years between two five six years now between two different times living here and I gotta say this is the absolute best august. I've ever encountered and the best september because new york september is usually very muggy here even if the temperature goes down and you don't get crispness until like october at least my experience. This is already crispy and it's not even the 15th yet oh. It's fall baby and I'm loving it and here I am. I'm wearing my  tracksuit and I love it. I love it.

Someone tells me the stream's quiet. I've been told this before. I have the volume entirely up. I have the microphone next to my face if there's another thing to do. I do not know how to do it so at this point. Telling me won't help because I do not have the ability to interfere with this now as we've said we're going to do more stuff at the office with chris. We're going to try to do a stream. I think on wednesday. We were going to do one last week but he forgot the microphone so we will be in the office. I will have the microphone and it will be louder but until then it's just me here and I don't understand any of this. I don't know how this works as remember how long it took me to even get from twit to twitch which is like a thing of a platform that we have a uh an actual like deal with to broadcast content and I was doing it on instagram because I didn't have twitch on my phone. I don't know how any of this works you guys know when you can get me on this because I have no power over it.

It makes me worry that people don't know what I'm saying I am a boomer. I've never said. I wasn't. I've never claimed to be anything but a boomer ah because if you think about it the boomers were the last generation. I mean we talked about axe millennials and stuff. But the boomers were really the first and last generation because they were the defining generation. There really were generations before them that's all retrospective all that stuff about the silent generation and like the greatest generation. That's all post hoc nobody thought in those terms back then. The first generation is self-consciously think of itself.

As one at least in america in the 20th century was the  accumulated capital that that got piled up uh during the labor piece of america's post-war hegemony that is now slowly dwindling away. They still have the lion's share of it which means they still direct culture. They still direct politics. They still rule the roost and they still I mean there's going to be a movie about the chicago 7 directed by aaron sorkin coming out next month on netflix. Sorkin is a  exer but he's still making a movie about the chicago 7 and about the  68 convention and and all of his characters and all of his stuff harken back to that remember uh. Jeff daniels monologue at the beginning of newsroom where he talks about how we were once great and we won wars and we uh uh and sure he's talking about the greatest generation. But then he's talking about. Like going to the moon and whatever it's all in the context.

Those are the dreams of the the greatest generation or the boomers that was the stuff. The boomers saw that's what they grew up with and that's what he's enraptured by even though he was older younger than that or if he wasn't. He should he shouldn't be that beholden to it and now the millennials. They're. Just it's all just a different deformation of boomer. It's all that self-conscious like. It's the idea of a generation that sees itself as a generation right. There you have boomer mindset so every generation that thinks that way has boomer mindset. So we are all boomers 100 boomer. Even the even those terrifying zoomers even the children uh are are basically boomers. I mean they're zoomers. It rhymes. It's boomers all the way down so. I will say it at least. I'll admit it. I burrowed through the levels of of mystifying ideology that make me think oh no. I am this generation. These things mean something other than just a culture talking itself to death while it slowly sinks into oblivion unable to muster any uh uh opposition to a neo-liberal dissolving of all social and ecological uh uh foundations. I have to say though that I replay these and they sound fine so.

I don't know what the hell your problem is I've never had a problem listening to them either played back on youtube or twitch so you guys might have the problem. This might be a yp not an mp. What are all these emoticons. Why are we getting about emoticons what's going on. There are many emoticons. Some of them are of me. There's one of uh alex. I think loan option on there oh emote only because everyone was giving me the business about the uh about the sound well. I'm fine now. I'm not now. I know that if anyone's doing it they're doing it uh as a as some sort of trolling so. I will disregard oh no oh no god damn. It pomo got it out there again that there's a picture of me without a beard and there it's a terrible photograph. It's. I think it like it's on some alt-right websites. I remember you people would sometimes reply to me with it. It's a terrible photograph. It was for a brief period a couple years ago when I shaved my beard because I was getting too much uh beard dandruff and it was too itchy and I know now yeah you need beard oil idiot. So. I take care of it.


Now there's not going to be a rogan debate come on. We're barely even going to get an actual debate. It's going to be puppet show they're going to do race banding models like conan o'brien. It's gonna be stage managed. Somehow edited. It's gonna be boring sure. Not gonna get four hours in uh joe rogan's weed garage getting top contact highs while rogan just blows smoke in their face. I am grilling tonight thank you for asking. I'm gonna make the uh. I have perfected a recipe for a korean beyond burger where I put kimchi and that sauce that I have on a beyond burger fried uh cook that puppy up and of course some some glizzies. Nathan's the best oh god thank you someone reminded me of this. I want to talk about it so today trump was in some sort of conference with people in california and of course. He's doing his usual thing about forest fires where it says they didn't.

They didn't sweep the floor enough you gotta sleep the floor why don't you sleep with the floor. You've got to sweep the floor uh. He's said this for years. This has always been his argument. I mean he's a. He's a he's a great. A idiot accepted being famous and they were he was talking to some california officials and one of them decided he was going to get his name in the paper and so he gave trump a little dressing down about how he needed to under accept. The climate change was real and that he needs that the science needs to be confronted or else. We're not going to fix anything and the guy and trump goes. It's going to get colder you watch and the guy goes. I wish science agreed with you and he goes well yeah.

Science doesn't know that is at the heart. I think of q of flat earth of the entire like new like folk politics and religion that's emerging in the current moment out of the sludge of trumpism. Uh it is a total disbelief in all objective uh measurements or systems. It is a it is a reptilian rejection of authority outside of one's zone of tribal affiliation. So things like the media and things like science any way you define. It are not just not to be believed they are to be instinctively disbelieved. Anything they say is a lie you have to believe the opposite and that's because this is what happens when you have replaced the concept of politics with personal ego gratification to the point where you were just projecting a fantasy. A schizophrenic fantasy of politics where you're a participant uh as like an eternal essential being battling against the enemy not not negotiating with other people across like the marketplace like liberalism says and we're all participating in liberal democracy but further more and more liberal democracy is untenable and this is replacing it and that's one of those things that makes trump supporters love him is because they think the same way he they he does and so they don't think science is real and you can say but what look at all the evidence how does he say it gonna get colder.

It's been the hottest year every year for the last 20 but here's the thing in a couple months. It is going to get colder right even if it's not as cold as it used to be at the same time of year. It's going to be colder than it is now right. Those fires are going to go out right. There might even be some snow. There might even be a snowstorm or two and he will be in that moment then being like look. It's cooler crazies then that's what's wrong with them and of course. All the nerds are gonna yell but neck but but but this is just the winter and it's not even as cold as it used to be and it's going to keep getting warmer but right then it's cold and then next summer if there's another huge fire season. And it's you know bigger than this one and it's more acres burned and it's more people displaced and killed and you point to it and you say look. It's terrible.


He'll go yep it'll get cooler and he will not have him. He will not even remember last year. He will not be able to think of last year because every moment is just that moment but not in like the zen centered sense of there is only the moment everything within it is flux. The only constant is change and therefore you are free from any fixed position. Any any damage like you cannot be hurt if you really believe that because there's nothing to hurt you know you're part of a you're part of a whole. A hole you're part of a flow a flow of his space and time and that centers you and can give you a sense of it can detach you from your pain and detach you from your anger and detach you from your resentment and hostility to others and fear. But he doesn't have that kind of sense of the moment. It is only the horrors of the moment it's only the pains and desires of and and and and thwarted dreams. The fantasies that have always been there just out of reach like remember trump has been driven mad by having everything he wanted his whole life which means he has never been happy because he has always been seeking more which means he is always moving towards this like this light. That's just beyond the his reach beyond like this gauze of reality and he's been pushing at it his whole life and it's made him in every moment miserable. So it's the same moment of misery and so in the winter hey.

It's cold what are you talking about global warming and in the summer when it's hot you're overreacting. It's going to get cold and that's a mindset that is now dominant where the enemy is. These things like science and the media and the political parties specifically the democrats hollywood any all the edifice. All the edifices of the of the fantasy world that we now inhabit that replaced our reality because our reality is fixed. Right. Politics can't have anything to do with real human conditions because real human conditions are fixed. Our destiny is made by the market. We are frozen in amber. We are going to be turned into pace one way or the other by the system but we live in a fantasy world. We live in a world of heroes and villains. We live in a mythological realm and we get to participate at the level of visceral identification with one side and that's what the new politics will be. And it's the only politics we can have.

That's why q is the leading edge of a generalizable phenomenon across politics. It includes democrats like there's already like this russiagate and like the weird fixation on uh like and paranoid relationship to trump and bernie bros and the creation of this like meta-narrative about a conspiracy within like the inter russia and the democratic republican party and the media to like elect not the fascists by propping up a fake left. Uh. That's on the same level of like delusion and it comes from the same level of cognitive dissonance and the same sense of powerlessness. But it's just less intensified now because those people are more wedded to more more parts of this system. Like they still believe in the media. They still believe in the democratic party.

They mostly still like hollywood whereas the the q person has already been widely alienated from all of those things which puts them farther along on the edge. But it's the same process and that's just the language that it finds itself being generated by the democratic like ideologue and uh this allows me a chance to talk about something. I think I've brought bought men mentioned in part before but I've never. I don't think brought together into one kind of idea and that is the way that q fits into the history of protestantism in america and how q. I think represents a third great awakening of american protestantism like a new emergent relationship between people's spirituality and their politics and their like citizenship and it goes like this. This is my basic outline is that for the first premise is that protestant american protestantism is in essential ways a different beast theologically and spiritually from any pro any christianity that came before it anything in europe or the levitt or anything else uh. It is not.


It is its own creature. It is an offshoot and the main reason. I say that is because the united states project that settler colonial project created a relationship between citizens and christianity that essentially removed the spiritual element i.e. The social element from the entire endeavor of religion and made it a purely transactional relationship. A purely marketized capitalized religious tradition where like because religion because it is the opiate of the masses in the heart of a heartless world. It provides sort of a it it. It ratifies uh uh existing social relationships but it also gives rise to a language of uh of just of pain uh a language of uh hurt a language of alienation that was exploited by things like the monster rebellion and  I gotta one second I gotta pop off I gotta text somebody something uh but anyway so yes one second as we're leaving off with protestantism different. Now we will say why am I on can you guys hear me am. I back on can you hear me all right. You can hear me okay good. So christianity is not just doctrine. It's lived experience. It's lived it's a social practice and that is something that you have to remember when you're talking about religion. It's not just doctrine. It's a social practice. The social practice of european christianity through up until the reformation was one where uh one sense of place in the universe in one sense of one's relationship to god which is necessary for anyone to feel like they're participating in a religious tradition.

If you can't feel god you're not really part of it. I mean you can mouth it but you're not there uh and the the way that that was reaffirmed was by a social relationship. You were a member of a great chain of being you had a place and you that place was reinforced and daily ritualized almost be interactions with everyone around you. Other people in the great chain of being family members uh you know a clergy. These the lords whatever it is wherever your relationship is. It's embedded. It's socially embedded and those that creates a sense of our understanding of god's will because god cannot be totally inscrutable. If god's totally inscrutable we have nothing to go by if god is totally inscrutable. There is no reason to have any code of behavior or any any social obligation to anyone because what's the what's the uh what are you going off of god is explicable to the sense that we know what he likes and so by seeing people interact. Socially. We see who rises and falls and we see who's happy and who's miserable and what causes that misery. We see the sense of god and yes.

It's heavily inflected by the feudal system and it says oh yes rebelling against the order. That's a bad thing and and uh you know it normalizes and ratifies that exploitation system. But it does it in a way that has a deep sense because of the lack of technology and the lack of social uh alienation uh uh uh it has a larger degree of built-in uh um uh built-in legitimacy built in uh consent. I would say because people feel obliged to one another and that's part of what religion is but capitalism changes that capitalism destroys our relationship with one another removes. The obligations removes that sense of of a mystical tie and replaces it with a transaction of goods motivated by self-interest strangers in a marketplace. That's how we're supposed to see each other and part of it is because you as as capitalism accumulated society gets more complicated.

More people are born more people live closer. Together they go to cities and stuff and it pulls at that social fabric. The social fabric gets torn as people move through the economic engine as it as it tightens its its grip and that means that it creates uh alienations and they have to be channeled. Somewhere and protestantism is one way to re reframe one's relationship to god in a desacralized space. Protestantism says no social practice is not. The basis for a virtue. Doctrine is individual belief is because if you're carrying your soul around by yourself all day and interacting with other people who might try to take it as opposed to being socially embedded where your soul is also a little bit part of everyone else's soul that you know because you only know a few people you know more people you're interacting with them as strangers you're trying to exploit them you're trying to get more from them than you're giving that has to be metabolized. These these people don't just snap more fingers one day and have new ideas they have to be resolved. These contradictions have to be resolved and protestantism helps resolve that contradiction by replacing that social soul with an individual one and replacing works with beliefs but that proc so that once that process starts it would inevitably unless something intervenes.

It would inevitably overtake all of european christianity but it was hyper kicked into gear by the fact that as this new emergent social for ideas is emerging this idea of a protestant liberal self as the locus for like religious meaning uh as as a way to deal with the dislocations and alienations of capitalism. Just at this time europeans start going to the new world and seeing it as virgin land. Seeing the people who inhabit it as somehow other religiously inscribed as others so that anything can be done to them and their land is takeable. Their land is exploratable but that means they're coming apart from different places and they might all be christians. They might like that like the the people in new england they might all be christians you know and they but they all come from different places and are strangers to one another.

For the most part you had some families coming but the vast majority of immigration led to strangers coming into contact with another one. Another and creating cities of people coming together uh without a social framework at all coming from a feudal understanding that was not yet fully like shaken loose from social formations and relationships in europe so that had to be filled by something and the first great awakening that happened during the colonial era. I think was that society's like uh inflection point at which they realized a new understanding of their religion and a new understanding of their relationship to god and protestantism and calvinism specifically provided them for the context for this and provided them for the language with the language for this and it was how can we know god's will right. We used to be able to know god's will because we were connected we were all tendrils touching one another in a social fabric. We were we were we were a seamless garment I mean not obviously this is for when I say this this isn't speaks to all the alienation and misery of life. Under feudalism. It was miserable it sucked but all of that misery and suckitude was channeled into this affirming social uh network that didn't require a lot of how could there have been mass coercion. There was no mass state you had people the serfs if they wanted to leave they could. For the most part the misery was massive but it was unalienated. It was shared by most like even rich people still had to like they  twice a month and they and their kids died of the cold and they lived in drafty castles and they got to eat meat until they were constipated. But their lives were largely the same and their lives depended on each other.


Now you're in a new world where everyone's a stranger how do we know what is god's will and how can we act according to it and the answer became because this is a blank slate. This is tabula rasa and we can rewrite anything onto it through our personal will driven by our personal souls. Then god's will is the sum total of what we do to this continent what all of us acting. According to our souls rights on the continent is the manifestation of god's will and those who prosper are prospering because they held in their heart the true faith and the true spirit and are true christians. Those who fell those who failed to inscribe themselves on the land uh profitably on the landscape. They are. They are sinful we pity them. We don't we. We hope they find jesus but there clearly cannot be real believers or they would not be so. Poor and. That works for and that reinscribes christianity and rea and it gives it a new basis to a framework to act operate from in people's minds uh during the course of the settling of the country.

But then by the mid-19th century a new system is emerged now we still have the frontier people pushing it forward and trying to grab and write. Their like write their fate write god's name onto the land but the people out east the people who are either relatively recent immigrants or people who have settled in the less especially in new york in the northern tier. The less uh the people who became the yeoman farmers like the where the citizens actually lived and upstate. New york was where the the second great awakening was most intense the burned-over district. It was called also where mormonism emerged from and that is because I theorize. It's the deary canal destabilizing that that rural idol and introducing the market because the market is another challenger to our our uh um our fixedness because like we can inscribe our name on the land but then what if what about what the banker shows up what if we have to get a mortgage what about what what about what our our goods will get on the market or what if I have to sell my labor what if I have to go to the city and I have to sell my labor and I'm not even able to direct my own efforts the way I could on a farm.

I have to go on the barges on the erie canal and see and see tavern keepers like what how am I to keep my how am I to know what god's will is there and the answer ended up inevitably becoming because that's what the wheel of history was grinding us towards with our consent or knowledge and our brains trying to frantically keep up was what god god's will is what is inscribed in the market so not necessarily the land but if you can get the land good but if you can't well what can you. What can you sell. What can you sell them for how much what what what kind of trade can you learn and what kind of shingle can you put out what kind of fortune can you make for yourself. Fortune can you make for yourself and succeeding in the market becomes expression of god's will failure or god's favor failure. God's disfavor and now we've reached the terminal end point to that cycle because the market has just as our frontier eventually became no longer. Malleable couldn't be the place where god's will was inscribed. It became fixed. It became autonomous same way that happened to the market because now the market is totalized which means the winners and losers are fixed. There is not even an illusion of agency. People are just driven by the skinner box uh uh desire uh a fear uh external coercive mechanism of the market. The debt and and bills and um and hospital costs and health care and um and lower wages and more flexibility and maybe you got to move you know. But none of it feels none of it.

I'm talking about in a spiritual sense. None of it feels like it's anybody's uh. It's anybody's will certainly not god's and instead of accepting a world where god is dead. We have to find a new place where his will can be found and now we have a new frontier. As another frontier closes a new frontier opens the frontier of the internet. Yes. We are fixed here in in the cycles of of deprivation and uh and and fortune and and you know uh uh labor alienation material alienation precarity. The word that defines all those words but online we can seek god's favor we can scribe through. We can put an effort into to truly just believe in something and so that's where cue comes in I think and so this is the new. This is the latest cycle the new intensification of the cycle of uh christianity. American christianity whereby now god's will is discovered online and we find we use things like q proofs and memes and the q clock like. We use a a biblical codex or the or the talmud to find meaning to to find the kabbalistic code within it and q is the thing that brings all of it together and now is going to include all of this mystical rejection of the material world and its structures that have failed at every level to provide the sucker that uh our understanding of the country we live in and the god who rules over us would make possible and something has to explain it. Someone has to answer for it and that becomes the shadow form of this like cyclopedia deep state which of course exists and is capitalism but these people are too captured ideologically to get beyond that level of abstraction and I don't know how much hope is for them honestly. I think if you get there it might be too late. Also like you might be deep into an epistemic grunt and nothing could route you out because how can you really convince anybody of something.

At that point. It's the way I say you can't convince anybody on the internet anymore that means the more you believe on internet stuff. The less you can be talked out of it the way you can talk someone out of a religious belief. They have to be stopped from converting in the first place or you hope that they fall away from it but that's going to happen regardless of you. You're not going to talk them out of it. Discreetly. You got to  cut it off and you got to get people before they can get it and that's the race against time the left has and I I'm not terribly optimistic yeah. The whole thing was a joke. I mean just was the trump campaign. The trump campaign started as a joke. It was basically a bit he was doing because he was pissed obama. Uh told him he was he couldn't be president the problem with trying to get q people to acknowledge capitalism as the root of a problem is that they believe capitalism is in.

Capitalism is part of the fiber of the christian like when I was talking about how protestantism is like a spiritual expression of capitalism. It's a spiritual practice that can be compatible with capitalism. Uh that means that it's that they are constitutive of each other. You cannot get capitalism out of it. You would you just you'd have to you'd kill it and and and yeah like that's. That's how you would have to do it. But it's also means that they're going to have more defense mechanisms against that than anything. They're going to like any any criticism of capitalism is if they understand it as such like if they understand it in a spiritual sense is like a live wire challenge to their very uh exis existential conception of themselves and that means it's very very difficult to uproot.


I'm drinking a schweppes black cherry seltzer. I have to say I used to not like seltzer I used to prefer soda because I thought like the the unadorned uh seltzery taste was too overpowering. I liked it sweet but I've basically waterboarded my mouth with enough of the  that now I like it and it does most of the job that uh that coke used to do oh. I I wrote a letterbox review invasion of the body snatchers. The philip kaufman 70s version and I just said that that if they did one now with this sort of same vibe it would be about tick tock and it's just. I don't know. I wasn't even really thinking about it uh the movie's okay. I didn't just really have anything to say about it. I guess. I just meant that uh that that movie very much takes uh invasion of the body. The body snatchers are a metaphor for like uh.

I think it's supposed to be a metaphor for like self-help culture in the 70s like as as the 70s were turning into an insane asylum and as like social cohesion was going out the window and as uh as the economic foundation was crumbling around everybody and society felt like it was like on the verge of some sort of a tipping point certainly economically when you talk about the oil embargo that there was this movement to soothe people out in a without religion but like with spirituality like a um new age or or um radically like self-accepting psycho psychological essentially uh snake oil like all that stuff was snake oil. It's just it's the same it's like it's all dianetics. It's it's all all of its l ron hubbard stuff like someone who is charismatic or smart enough to construct out of like real real pain and real alienation a quick fix remedy that incorporates enough truthful scaffolding to hide the empty inner core and that stuff just proliferated and now we don't even have that we just have social media entrepreneurship. Like the only hope for the pros is that you can do. This you can do being on the internet good enough that you can avoid the perils of the market entirely like I did. I mean. I'm exhibit a of this and and now it was podcasts you know for a while. It was uh like you get a book out of a book deal out of a twitter account and now it's being a tick-tock oaf. I didn't say it was set for life if I said if I said several eleven hours.

I just mean you don't have to you don't have to worry about becoming a totally alienated. Uh lay capitalist subject just running on the hamster wheel. You can you can disengage from that at least for a while and uh that's the only dream left. That's the only american dream we have and q is a part of that. Q is that expression politically like you can solve the codex. You can you can solve the da vinci code and it'll unlock the the  seal gondor and the light will shine through and there will be no death and all shall be well and all shall be well and all manners of things shall be well and prester.

John and his righteous armies will come over the horizon to redeem mankind the revelation. These guys are apocalyptic very much exclusively. They're like this whole trump unveiling when all the all the deep state pedos get executed that's the apocalypse in their mind in the sense that it is the endpoint. This is the new expression of end times uh. Uh uh um christianity remember at the turn of the millennium and the  uh left behind series and it was all going to be the rapture you remember the rapture the way that was a meme until like 2008 during the bush years that all the all the yahoo. Christians thought that one day all the all the righteous would just get spared like they get sucked up to heaven before tribulation began because as the most costed and and uh physically pampered people in history. People who believe that their amount of physical and social suffering is the sum total of like their uh like their uh suffering for them would be to be out of god's favor like to suffer. It all is to be punished by god to for having done something wrong so they can't even conceive of suffering through uh a tribulation. No no they will be risen up but they get to watch you don't hear about the rapture anymore.

You're gonna hear about q. But it's the same impulse just farther along accelerated farther along and made more insane by a more insanely uh disorienting social matrix i.e social media yeah. I really do think it was a  post to begin with and then I think it was probably taken by those um those youtube. I don't know if people read this but there was an article that had a little. I had some it looked pretty persuasive proof video of these two youtubers who were making money and this is always the big question about q why would you do it if there was no money in it because like I'm talking about the whole. The only dream left is the dream of of seizing god getting gaining god's gaining god's favor in the in the cyber sphere why would you do it for no money. Why would you do it for no recognition and that's why uh uh you couldn't you. That's why it had to be an insider right. That's why it had to be someone with real insider knowledge and they had to be anonymous because there had to be it had to be for the pure desire to see good done. It couldn't be for social media clout but the way to get around that is if you're the person explaining it if you're the person if you're the priesthood if you're the digital priesthood if you're. If you're the uh. I mean and then you get you know the communion and you get to keep or you get to keep the uh the collection plate because you're the priest of your own religion which is what everybody wants. So. This is sort of l ron hubbard deal basically well then like mormon got mormon uh mormon heaven too uh and you get to collect the the gate toll for understanding q in the first place and there's video of one of these guys accidentally logging on to queue while they were streaming live in one of their well-trafficked and renumerative youtube channels and now it looks like. At some point it got maybe they sold it. I wouldn't be surprised if they sold it and honestly if they did. They sold low to that pedophile. Psycho 8chan guy but honestly though. I think that if they did sell unless they really needed cash fast. Uh they blew it because this could really be like an apple type situation but the thing that could stop that and it might be too late honestly is that because q has posted so much less as q has gotten much more popular.

His contribution to the whole thing has been uh denatured. He is less integral to the process. Most of the stuff that's really important hugh cannon didn't come from directly or even like through a direct inference from a cue post and even if he wanted to change the direction or or or like seize control of it for some specific ends that were not that were against the momentum that was being built. Socially. They wouldn't be able to do it. It'd be king canute trying to call back uh hold back the tide. Now.


I know american christianity isn't a single tendency but I would say that that is that there's a basis for that americans like and I'm not talking about the way it's experienced by non-traditional people. I'm talking about the way that it is practiced by practitioners of religion like people who go to church or even people who have a very very deep um self-conception of them as christian as a subset of greater group of people that you could even you could still call christian uh that there is an american protestant uh cosmology like a materialist christianity where god's will is seen on earth. Heaven is on earth hell is on earth and who is one place or the other is god's will because we are all driven by our own souls towards light or darkness and that's and obviously not everyone thinks that there's plenty of people who don't believe that. But I'm talking about like the the the unders not just the way people. The majority of people understand themselves but the way that their understanding expresses itself in politics and culture. I would say that that is american christianity this protestant evangelical conception and that even catholicism at this point for the most part uh accepting like maybe immigrant communities where by the way pentecostalism and evangelicalism is making a big uh inroads. American catholicism is essentially now a a subsidiary doctrinally distinct but but tributary uh faith within that greater tradition.

Like prop. It's like episcopa. You got your uh uh presbyterians your methodists your baptists your pentecostals your catholics and that's all like on the same level of distinction and a lot of this didn't just come from those puritan. Scotch irish holy. And if you want to know the difference between like scandinavian uh christianity and uh american christianity. I think the fact that they didn't have any scotch irish might be a big part of it. It's a  ulster protz man some of the oh and there that's why ulster protestantism is one of the very few european uh religious and political traditions that is similar in like even specifics to american like. They also have like creationists and they also fight the same culture war and if you go to the uh the protestant neighborhoods in belfast and see the  murals. They are. They embrace this connection. They've seen one of a stonewall jackson. There's one with james buchanan. It says scotch irish president.

It's like yeah the worst one we had congratulations you. I saw. I famously saw I remember seeing a picture of a uh of a wall of a like a udf clubhouse and it had a bunch of flags on the wall and it had uh the red hand of ulster. It had a south african apartheid flag. The rhodesian apartheid flag and the confederate flag and they're also like global warming deniers and you know what fanatically anti-abortion in a way that like the way that reactionaries just aren't in mainland europe. How long we gone now. I gotta what time is it anybody. I I only. I don't have my laptop out. Here. Does anyone have the time not the length of the stream but the am pm type situation 6 37. All right great all right. I'm gonna wind down pretty soon cause. I think no wait a minute. Now. I got like 10 minutes left. I think all right or longer.

I got 15 minutes 15 minutes what's scientology's relationship to american christianity. It's essentially the the uh the the scientized. It's the grad student version. It's american christianity where the uh where the experience of like of living in the technological innovative moment and us also this the uh the spiritually destroying moment of world war ii the atom bomb in the holocaust you cannot accept god as a supernatural conception. The way the british students can in those services in that uh in that instance if you have a certain frame of mind if maybe you have a certain education. If you approach things from a more empirical a more grounded a more secular perspective and that's going to be a product of your upbringing your brain chemistry. All these things out of your control and if you end up on that end of the spectrum one answer to you know what what is the good now in this in this madhouse. That is that shows got that that humanity has almost limitless power to do evil but what about good and it is a it is a science based a science replacing god but having the same purpose the idea of giving people a ability to write themselves across the world and into outer space and see gods xenus whatever will reflected in the successor failure of the venture do.

I think jordan peterson's daughter is trying to kill him. I don't want to get sued for making claims without basis but I will just say this she certainly doesn't seem to be treating him with a lot of care and I'm sorry it might be a cheap shot but you do have to wonder how much of that is his responsibility as a father. I'll just say that but it does look like his  pandemic after feeding him. Game meets for five years might not. My is that's all in his best interest yeah and now she's uh. She's with the with the sex trafficker allegedly yeah good good work good work there. Jordan really knocked it out of the park there. I am not on the all beef diet. No. I'm trying to reduce my beef intake actually. I'm de-beefening making like. I said I'm making beyond burgers with kimchi and my beloved gochujang sauce. But I do think I might want to try it. I still want to try to do a brisket on my birthday though or before my birthday brisket for my birthday birthday brisket. Oh one other thing about trump saying you know it'll get colder.

You watch is that that is that is his essential con artist nature. I mean because his entire career has been like him pursuing well him pursuing fame yeah. It didn't mean that he was good at business and he's in a lot of ways was very bad at business but it didn't matter because of how good he was at fame. He kept getting bailed out because his name was too valuable. So in a real sense. He was a good businessman because he never lost any money. It was always the dumb ass investors who had to take a haircut to keep his name valid and to make keep him a brand and more importantly to keep him a  thing. I mean for at least the last 10 years before he ran for president his entire real estate uh uh his entire real estate. Uh empire was just pure ass dead ass. No cappurino uh uh money laundering for like russian mob guys uh and but that's all because he was famous so he he was so good at being famous. He made him good at business. Do you want to say hi to the people.


Uh are you on your stream yeah. You want to say. Hi particularly okay. I'm going to line up in a second here. Brendan james folks brennan. James he's going to grill with me. Today he doesn't want to talk to you pigs though and I don't blame him because you keep giving me the business about my damn microphone always listening to his music listen to the music. Brendan did they talk to you yeah. I I see them talking but uh it's just their their writing. It goes very fast you are reaching jim jones level. Uh set up here come on my babies come on my babies. Lay down boy an outfit yeah into a little screen yeah in your like in my lair. You're my compound layer. No. I'm feeling jonesy. I'm jonesing today come to me my babies please. I started these streets doing uh jim jones. And now I'm back okay.

I'm being unoriginal then. But I couldn't help no no no you haven't seen any of the streams so you don't know how that's the exact right thing to think immediately. That is what I see uh. I was gonna finish this thing about trump uh money laundering for russian yeah that he's just he's famous. But he's good at business because he's good at being famous oh right. But his actual business dealings were just kicking. The can down the road until somebody bailed him out and scamming people into giving him more money and bridge loans and  and so it would always be just you watch it'll be worked out. He goes he goes to atlantic city hey uh what about junk bonds. No you watch. We're not going to use any junk bonds and then nothing but junk bonds and so he can say he's hey what does it matter to him. He's only president for another four years. He can say it'll get cooler you watch and if it doesn't what difference does it make he got out of that moment. That's all he meant to do all right guys. This is a good one today bye-bye.
