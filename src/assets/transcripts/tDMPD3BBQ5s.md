Traveling at the speed of I used to run it. I guess oscar goldman got mad because I got loose circuits so loose with the mother goose with the air that seems to be fun. Hey yo pack my bag cause. I'm outta here. My mama don't love me and my mama don't care read the papers. The headlines say bust up rapper got sold. Let me go please a light clover no good nothing so give me some  beats. All the teenage fans are heat who's saying all my dudes so what comes next let me use my forehead. So let me stop stalling because everything I do is like falling hey folks hmm.

So tonight biden is doing a joint address to congress as many will nerds will point out uh. It is not a state of the union in the first year that's not a state of the union that is uh a joint address to congress the state of the union doesn't come until uh the second year. I guess because you know you gotta you're giving a report and uh there hasn't really been enough stuff to give a report on. I have a feeling though he'll say that the state of the union is strong and I get even though it's not a state of the union address. I wonder what they're going to put them on. I mean obviously they put him on something for these big events because there's no way they would leave the chance that his brain is just going to go off because he has had some pretty astounding mental lapses just in the last couple of months. A number of times where he just gave up now he'll have the teleprompter but you know he's still old as hell. His brain is clearly going and it's going to be in the evening.

So I'm guessing just straight up adrenaline shot to the heart pulp fiction style five minutes before he goes out and uh. I will predict this that you don't see him in public for at least a couple of days maybe a week after this speech and that'll be fine because that's the thing about biden he was. His pitch to people was put me in there and you all have to stop caring about politics so much and it really seems to have done. The job isn't that interesting we got to the point where everyone is cranking each other off freaking out about the imminence of of civic conflict last fall and of course it bubbled over into the into the riot and uh on january 6th. But since biden's been in office it just seems like the air is slowly gone out of the political balloon and of course. That's just me from you know that's just it.

I don't ever know. I've been alone this entire time. I mean. I don't have any interactions with people. I don't know what's actually happening and even if I did that would only be a small little keyhole into the interactions of other people. I'm only ever trying to grok a vibe from from the ether and it really does make me think to what degree that is all a self-hypnosis like getting yourself into a uh into a frame of mind uh and sort of without even knowing it convincing yourself of a state of affairs that is fully uh fabricated.

But it certainly seems like biden is in the figure of biden is sort of the is truly the opposite of trump in that he whereas trump's every statement every action inflamed the political discourse and raised political temperature. It seems like biden is just a black hole. He just absorbs everything and just holds it. None of it gets reflected and reinforced and I don't know. I honestly don't know what to make of it. I think that trump promised a politics that we were just simply not able or willing to embrace and it would be nice to think if that this is people redirecting energy in their lives towards more productive uh vectors than than politics certainly presidential and national politics and maybe. It's just reflecting the fact that I personally have trying to detach from politics and I'm just responding to my own conscious and subconscious reorienting of my attention. I don't know it's weird everything's real weird. We have this really interesting dichotomy where uh the domestic front the democrats are if only because they're being forced to by circumstance.

Uh go full keynesian post keynesian and and just completely drop all of their uh their deficit  uh while internationally turning the screws tighter everywhere on every front from sanctions to military interventions to uh intellectual property protection. When we talk about uh. How the two exports of america are weapons and intellectual property that's hollywood movies that's tv shows. It's also things like vax uh pharmaceutical patents which is the real uh nut of the whole. Uh uh controversy about releasing vaccines to countries like india. I I would be surprised if you see a big charity uh shifting of excess vaccines to india and other countries that we then get to take credit for. But you'll never see a violation of the uh patent regime because the patent regime is what keeps the whole thing going. It's what circulates what uh ned beatty talks about in in uh network about how the you know the saudis have taken millions out of this country and now they got to bring it back. The thing that brings them back is uh uh real estate and copyrighted material that they we we make people pay for on. Our terms. Supporting are supported by our hegemonic military and our currency. So it would be interesting to see if we get this situation where america does slide towards a haphazard ubi to keep people consuming uh meanwhile the uh like the iron fist of uh empire just tightens its grip even more around the world. I somebody. I remember about that israeli general who says that uh that aliens contacted the governments of what the united states and israel see that's how I know that didn't happen because that's the kind of  alien species. I would not contact any government eight government in this. On this planet the the people in charge of this of this uh world are like the the 57 millionth copy of a absolutely duress. Just a uh a decadent cruel ruling class that has nothing to offer anyone even on this planet let alone extra. Terrestrially.


I gotta say that I do I don't. I don't have a lot of patience for the whole passata stuff. It seems like a lot of uh. I mean it's like anything. It's fine if it's a meme. But when you decide to try to take it seriously you're uh you're missing the point which is that it's just sort of a humorous thing to play with. But I do believe with. I do basically agree with his premise that if we there were aliens that were sufficiently advanced to contact earth they would be post-capitalist uh communist even or beyond that beyond any kind beyond economic economics as we understand them because there's no  or would have technology that wouldn't transcend those things but of course that doesn't mean that they necessarily would have ideology as we understand it. The ferengi aren't real I hate to tell you guys that 666 viewers right now hail satan I do think it would be funny though if the aliens came to earth and they said they said take me to your dealer because I love to get stoned on weed.

I can't write. I'm not a writer. I've realized this like you actually have to have done. Some you have to have like a a practice and a craft behind it to  write things down I i try to write and my brain stops. Me. I honestly realize that all I can really do is talk because it's the only thing that gets past that that gravity there's like a gravitational pull that just like pulls me away from being able to get anything on paper before. I just destroy it with uh um with self-doubt and I can overcome that but it's gonna take long. It's gonna take a while so don't expect anything uh in the near future where I'm like sitting down and writing  is the thing. I have no real abilities talents skills. I just I got very lucky. There's always an excuse to do nothing. It's true and and and therefore I won't no. I'm going to try to get something down. But it's going to be like. I said through talking and then editing not through sitting down and I had i.

I think that was always uh sort of a more hope than than will to like sit and write somebody wants to hear about robert owen god bless those guys. The utopian socialists of the 19th century the first the first attempt to opt out of capitalism basically and the whole history of the 19th century and the 20th and now is how is over time that option being reduced just just literally being wiped off the map and uh. And I think that all of our examples of attempts to to try to opt out of capitalism while still living the capitalist system are going to be undermined because the uh because you can't produce you can try to produce without profit but your the the rest of the world isn't and that that  crank is just gonna pull. But I you know. I don't blame them. It certainly looked like there was a lot more uh options back. Then it really when you look back at the 19th century. It really is stunning. You can say all you want about marx and you can say about what he got wrong or how he was a dick and how he was a lazy hypocrite who cheated on his wife. Whatever he wanted or he was racist or whatever uh all that true to one another extent.


He really was the one person who saw what was happening as it was happening and saw more even than what it was what it was going to be and he saw that it could not be uh negotiated with. It could not be uh gotten around it cannot be competed with. It could only be transcended. It had to be worked through and transcended because it was going to become totalizing and he looked around the world and he saw the the power of capitalism and he saw the absolute rustic uh. Uh flaccid uh corrupt weak structures that opposed it and saw yeah there's only one way this is going nothing outside of capitalism no system no structures outside of capitalism will be able to withstand it. The only hope will come from within it as people who are de-territorialized by capitalism come into a new consciousness but at the time very few people got that and honestly. I'll always say that like marx's interpretiveness and and awful hostility and nastiness to the people he argued with can kind of be understood when you just see when you really reckon with how much he saw compared to what everyone else was insisting upon people. Saying no we can defeat capitalism by by competing with it and displaying the superiority of cooperation as though by that late date was going to compel the mass of humanity was going to be uh was going to be an an example or a word or anything beyond the  ideological and physical rifle to the forehead of uh of capital but that was not obvious at the time how to most of us to most people there hell half the smartest people of the 19th century were convinced that all of it all the stuff that was happening was due to skull shapes and and like temperature variations and  but yeah. I don't really know that much about the whole new harmony deal.

I mean. I've never really studied the those people. It's like all those 19th century eccentrics well-meaning uh uh good-hearted but just fundamentally not reckoning with what was in front of them. But you know what none of us are none of us can all of us are creating a model reality to live in where where agency still exists. Mario andrew cuomo is going to legalize heroin now to distract from the new information about the nursing home deaths. It's just gonna be like look. What will it take to make your people go away uh fentanyl out of uh vending machines. Fine great yeah maybe they'll uh yeah because they're not going to legalize any more drugs but maybe public drinking because that is a real drag about new york that you can't  drink in the street the thing though one of the things.

I think that will always make capitalism beat anything that's competing with it as opposed to like I said being transcended from within is that power in the capitalist system is never located. It's always somewhere else. The real power no matter how influential or important the individuals are in a room. The real power is something in their head and it's something that they cannot bargain with or change. Not like you know a medieval uh council where these guys all had to uh answer to god. I mean god is just their self-interest plus their uh sense of duty. Whatever that is it's it's internal capitalism. Is is it is a compelling a compulsion beyond uh. It's a compulsion beyond human personal coercion. It is uh frankly kind of supernatural oh boy.


I look tired. I'm sorry. I guess. I'm just feeling kind of. I don't know at sea because I should be doing. I should be being more productive and I'm I'm guessing. I'm having a bit of a crisis of confidence like jimmy carter. But you know those come and go. It's all cyclical. I just got to uh breathe through it vibe my way through it where uh see for something to hit. I think what I really need is just for this like slow motion uh uh d panda uh pandemification and what I've really realized is that like there is no going back to normal. I think that's obvious that it would be undialectical to imagine otherwise like there is no post pandemic that's like just like it was before. But I think these last couple months especially as vaccinations in the us have increased has really reminded. Me is that there will whatever is coming after like this stage is going to be a intensification of the uh ambiguous uh uh sort of de-socializing uh like. I think I worry that uh that there will be a permanent uh mark left in our ability to to engage with the world. I don't know once again.

I just feel very siloed and very unsure of what anybody uh is is thinking or is is gonna do. I do know that that whatever I think I or anybody else was hoping for uh which is some sort of cathartic moment of reasserted uh uh conviviality and and uh. I don't think. I don't know we'll see if it comes it'll come slowly like like uh like uh feeling coming back to a limb that's been sat on for too long. But I think the ambiguity of it at the moment is getting to me a little bit. Just this not knowing where it's going to land and how long like we're playing. We're on a plinko board moving through space yeah.

You can't really get more of us uh sobering uh this ex sobering uh a sobering model example of what the rolling catastrophe of the 21st century will be from then this distinction between the us and places like india right now where you're getting to things opening up here you're getting to a flattening finally of the curve uh and some sort of tentative reopening. Meanwhile what there's thousands of hundreds of thousands of people a day uh in india. And I think that that is something that a lot of americans who worry about climate change uh tend not to focus on there's that and I think that's why people like to think in apocalyptic terms about climate change they like to imagine hey. We're all gonna die you know. But I think we're seeing with this. That's not really the case you know some of us will die uh. But the majority of us are gonna stay in the pool. You know in the human pool in the citizenship realm where you get all the privileges of being in americans and elsewhere. Huge numbers of people will die and we will be separated from them by distance and by walls that will build and by technology that we'll use to enforce it. And I don't think that is something that a lot of uh. I think what people who fixate in america about we're all gonna die.

I think why that's a wish like somebody once said uh uh of course people like dr strangelove who couldn't like a movie with such a happy ending and it talks to the that that that desire for instant annihilation not slow decline. And I think that is really the the death drive as we understand it like howard ratner in um uncut gems subconsciously setting up his own death. So he can die at his high point rather than to see all that he enjoys and all that he values about himself slowly uh removed and nothing but death to be company. I think a lot of people they take especially if you're on the left self-consciously on the left. We take our idea the idea that we're good people seriously. We take the idea that we do the right thing seriously. We do. We take the idea that if we were in some other more vital historical moment like nazi germany or antebellum america we would be on the side of right.


We would be so sophie scholl or john brown and we can pre uh. We can pretend to ourselves now in the situation that we live in that we're not really quite in that situation and that what we're doing in our lives to exhibit a political perspective and to exercise political uh. Uh political subjectivity are all if not as most as much as we can do enough to validate ourselves. The future that we're all really headed towards and for the most part spokes afraid to even name is one where most of us are going to stay in the bubble not all of us. But the thing is say some chunk of america gets like wiped out by by a natural disaster and the people who were in there in that zone were up until that moment part of america once that happens they're no longer there. I mean if they die obviously they're off the books but if they're on the other side of the uh border that we struck create other side of the of the tent. Cities that we build. They are now off the books consciously too because their contribution to our understanding of uh the american people uh will be eliminated so most of us are going or our descendants or whatever are going to be in the bubble which means we're going to be watching through the bubble. The rest of the world slowly microwave for our benefit and that is going to mean we're going to be in the moral position that we imagine about the past where we would have did the right thing and I think a lot of us understand at some level that even if that's happening even if we live in that world by the time it happens we will have accommodated enough. We will have created enough mental uh baffles and justifications and rituals of purification to uh imagine that whatever poultry ritualized pseudo-politics that we've landed on is sufficient to the horror of the moment.

I know that's true of me once again everything. I say is just me. I don't know maybe that's not true of anybody everybody else. But it certainly makes it it certainly seems like it'll be the case because the alternative is okay say that I'm not going to let that happen say that I convince myself. I am not going to uh just slowly uh a uh expiate my own guilt from being par party to this planet murder uh well. What what will I do that answer is never clear because everything looks pointless and as things get worse.

The options are going to get more. Limited and they're going to be more dangerous. They're going to involve actual potential for significant suffering and death and imprisonment and who will do that who will do those things if they don't think that they can work. And that's where I keep banging the drum about spirituality even though. I understand that it's not something that computes and it's certainly not something that can be scaled. All you can scale. Uh you're not gonna stop anything you're not going to save anyone. So it can't just be uh. Hey let's let's have a new religion that's silly but people are going to have to uh care more care more about other people than they do themselves and I don't blame anybody for not having that. I don't really have that to the degree that I i think I should but what would build it.

I think cannot be anything that we find online it can't be anything we read. It has to be something we experience directly and that experience has to be with other people and that is I think where I'm finding myself sort of at a crossroads because like I'm talking about and I've really convinced myself anyway and you know that's all you ever are going to do is convince yourself of anything. The rest just flows from that that that there is no practice without action as the basis for it. There is no uh there is no meaning outside of social existence. There is no. I don't mean that like your life is meaningless if you're not social. I mean the things that the generation of meaning that you carry with you throughout your life including when you're by yourself are found through uh mutual experiences that that create realities that like create new structures of of meaning that are stronger because they're shared. But my in this weird nebulous realm nether realm. I feel very unconnected to uh other people so it's left me feeling a little uh trapped oh.


Someone asked about late victorian holocausts. It's a very good mike davis book uh and it is honestly. I have no interest in in uh defending the soviet union uh. I don't really care. I think that the those arguments are perfect examples of arguments that exist to be had that are unconnected to any meaningful question and that you do so that you feel like you're participating uh but just as a historical question the whole the whole the the responsibility for communism for the uh. The excess deaths in the 20th century in uh in russia or in china is really settled and rendered absurd by the reality of late victorian india and the british empire when you saw patterns of what happened what happened in late victorian india.

The raj the british who were operating the entire uh subcontinent as a giant money funnel to uh to the uk disrupted all of the existing um communal structures for uh agricultural preservation resource management that had literally since the dawn of civilization in in india been used to mitigate famine and uh and natural disasters undermining and destroying food supply supplies. They they rationalized agriculture. They made it into a business just like they did in ireland and the result of that is that when famine came thanks to el nino uh temperature variations in uh. In the late 1800s it meant tens of millions of people died and that pattern of disrupting uh traditional agricultural uh uh methods and rationalizing them which then and therefore leading to massive depths in the countryside. When uh economic when uh ecological conditions change uh is the story of capitalism conquering the world. Uh it's it's it's the inevitable once capitalism has has won and I think it won in 1920 or so uh once capitalism is one.

It's uh it will systematically as it over as the earth uh alienate people from traditional agricultural relationships with the land that will lead to massive death and transference of calories from the countryside to the cities and in what you have in russia and in china is a situation where you had these uh communist movements made up of self-conscious marxist-inspired revolutionaries uh who in 1917 made it. Uh made a analytical throw of the dice that they were in a position to light the spark that would light the match of worldwide global revolution that would defeat capitalism and overthrow overturn or overthrow capitalism from within um and it didn't work. It came pretty close. It wasn't a it wasn't. I don't think it was a uh. I mean the fact that I would point that as like when capitalism one just speaks to the fact that there was still contingency there there was still possibility so and when you consider what the situation was in russia where the likelihood of a fascist of a proto-fascist military reaction taking power from the delegitimized central government was almost. A foreign conclusion absent a communist revolution that they made the right call but uh it it failed. The revolution failed to ignite and as a result that communist government in in russia is forced to compete on capitalism's terms on capitalism's economic terms in order to survive and that means mulching the  peasantry and that's why I think let's call it here.

I'm going. I won't say which book. It is this week. I'll I might tweet it out. Later. I will. I want to do uh a book next about the german revolution. There's a really good one that I've heard about don't remember that the author though uh. It's like the classic text from like the uh the 60s because it was always supposed to be germany. It was always supposed to be germany. The place where the language and the and the where the development of capitalism was uh was most conforming to uh the marxist concept the way that it created a working class movement the way that that working-class movement expressed itself politically and challenged for power and then when it didn't happen. I really think that we're we we entered a new phase I i think that the cold war was was a war for resources uh between capitalism and all of the all everything that uh opposed it in one way or another. Uh and that war was much less was much less close. That war was uh never really in doubt. You can argue about some contingencies that if they go the other way things go differently. But it's hard to. It requires a lot more dice rolls going different ways than than any period uh during the late during the po immediate post world war one era when the air was thick with possibility.


I did see mortal kombat uh the cgi blood actually didn't bother me as much as it usually does just because I mean it's  eight 16 bits or whatever uh and there was some cool violence like when the lady got cut in half with the hat that was pretty good. Kendo was honestly kind of uh kind of charming not gonna lie uh like he was doing banter but it was not soy maybe just because of all the  all the swear words. But it just it felt less uh cloying than whedon. I will say though absolutely baffling how they structured it. I guess. This is an example of of the uh of the new normal of every film. Having to be the first in a franchise is that there literally isn't a goddamn tournament in it.

All of the fights are the one side trying to kill the other guys before they can have the tournament what the  man when are we gonna get to the fireworks factory movies are dead correct uh because I really do think that the concept of the film the theatrical feature film is determined by the context of uh uh seeing it in the theater. I I don't think it's movies anymore if they don't go to theaters. I've said that before I really think it's true we are not we now have like. Scorsese said we now have content and I don't think marvel destroyed them. I think marvel is just the symptom of capitalism destroying them. I mean. I know that's a it's. It's easy to say that because it's the answer to everything but you really do see as as uh money just swallows the industry the it changes the economies in such a way that that the amount of investment the amount of return on investment required is so astronomical that artistic considerations cannot be priced in not entirely but over time more and more and I mean people say marvel but you guys know what year iron man came out right who knows the year the first. The first I know it was that's not like the effort the first official mcu or something that's. I don't know but the the first one that like starts the thing was iron man 19 or 2008.

Anything else happened that year did anybody know us about anything else happen in 2008. That anybody remembers because remember the way that the uh 2008 collapse was uh responded to as opposed to the great depression which was responded to a huge uh increase in uh worker leverage direct employment massive increase in unionization uh and therefore purchasing power at the basic at the at the level of of the consumer through labor share of income. How is it fixed in 2008 all of them they just took the governor off of money. They decided. Money doesn't exist for banks. They and of course money never existed. It was always a fraud but it was a fraud that they all pretended to believe in to some degree or another and 2008 taught them. Oh okay never mind like we have reached the final stage here like there's nowhere else for this money to be invested in there's nowhere to profitably invest money. Apple is sitting on what 200 billion dollars in in just dead capital that they that they aren't investing in anything there is nowhere for them to put it. There is no I mean my god. Crypto is literally just running a  uh car in the garage. It's just doing the uh the externalities of an economy without any of the productive part.

But what that meant is that the the uh the cheapness of money at the top meant that it that changed the economics of all these industries and it made it so that so much money needed to become come back to these companies at the top end like disney that nothing but guaranteed products with built-in uh multi-year marketing structures could ever be worth the financial the initial investment and when iron man was a hit people wanted a superhero. They wanted a hero they were holding out for a hero. The model was born and now everything has been trying to be that ever since I mean my god. They tried to turn the damn universal monsters into a frickin extended universe. What is the productive part of crypto besides moving illegal uh  penguin in the head that's it that really does to me sum it all up is that there is money has so far outpaced the real economy and real productivity uh and real scarcity. Like the reality of this is when you look at this insane system is that clearly through technology through the creation of systems of trade and exchange we have solved and uh and agriculture and we have solved scarcity but the only way to do that is to the only way to actually apply that is to take all of that uh all of that excess. All of this productive capacity that is just taken and held and and move it back around and redistribute the technology uh and the mechanisms of exchange well and remove the profit engine.

We could do that that's possible like in terms of we have the there's nothing physically stopping us. Only our structures only are our embedded assumptions only the mechanisms of control. But there is no uh. It's so far past a real economy that the only new avenues of investment are ones where all you are doing is expect as the non-productive element of production. The externalities of production because there has to be something it has to be measuring some activity but this is not the creation of value. This is the creation of  carbon that's it and so we're going to suffocate like someone turned on a car in a garage because there is nothing inside this system that will stop it from doing that because the damages the hurt the exploitation the misery are always concentrated farthest from the points of power.

The closer you get to points of real leverage and power within this system. The more insulated you are not just personally but psychologically from the reality of capitalism and of course at the very top. You've got literal demons but you've got plenty of people who are for the most part human who are able to continue performing. They're part of this like we all are because they have uh. They really don't know what it is. They they truly have had it abstracted away from them. It means some it means the opposite to them of what it really is because we imbibe a culture where all of the misery and pain and horror of capitalism are turned into all of the good virtues uh and values and all that is good so of course living in that breathing that vapor we we will continue to carry the system out until it's too late until we're at the other side of the bayonet until we're on the other side of the cage. But by then there will be no way for us to stop because we're outside of it and once you're outside of it. You can be and will be annihilated because you don't have the proximity to the technology that allows you to confront capitalism.


Someone says crypto isn't all mining. It's three coins that do that you mean the three ones that people have and you mean the three ones that matter if there's ones that don't use uh mining fine. That's good but is that where the money is. It's very interesting though to me that bitcoin has a finite limit to how much could be produced right. It's 90 someone says it's 90 mined and of course what happens presumably I I'm assuming once it hits a hundred. The value goes to zero right can somebody who knows more about uh. Crypto explain this to me like the v it has to go to zero if once it's been 100 mined and if that's true it's very interesting because it shows the way that libertarianism uh is is is delusion.

Is a is a self is a self-conscious self delusion because you create this thing right this new new money. It's better than old money. It's it's superior to old money. It's got real value and you still even though you believe in an economy capitalism that is dependent upon endless growth continual and endless growth that's the necessary condition for capitalism which is why america is just a giant ponzi scheme. Uh your ideal currency has a  finite amount that can be produced of it. You don't even see the contradiction there but that's because actual currency. Not legal tender fiat currency is at the end of the day actually enforced by uh the system that produces its viability. The the the uh the technological and social capacity of the state that's what actually undergirds currency and that is that exists as long as the state exists or to the degree that the state exists. But because the the libertarian crypto people don't believe in the state.

They have this hard wall and then what happens when you hit it. Oh. We'll figure it out because the assumption is always because well because the reality is. This is never meant to be a currency and its value isn't as a currency is as purely as a speculative. Thing hits 100 there'll be something else. The good old state with its old fiat currency which we've been actually converting this to the whole time. Uh is gonna be there to pick it up to have another con for us to run if you if somebody makes a cryptocurrency that is an actual stable source of value and not speculative and that allows for transactions outside of uh state control. That'd be great and doesn't involve just spewing. Carbon in the atmosphere that's fine that'd be great are there any of those I'll have some but I mean. I don't really need any because I don't need to subvert legal transactions. Right now seems like google and amazon are getting away with a lot more planetary destruction than crypto but no one gives a  about any of this who are you talking about like 90 of people of descriptions. It's amazing.

I wouldn't say 90 I guess but it's amazing the number of debates uh online about politics that boil down to why do you care so much about x and not y when the reality is nobody actually cares about any of it. It's just what they want to emphasize at any given moment for an emotional high point to an argument they're making to avoid having to deal with their existence. I should know I've almost perfected this. Like we've we we're bothered by this stuff. That's real we're bothered by it. But it's it's like the grit that we kind of have to chew on to like make our guts work.

You know how like there are some animals that like eat rocks to put in their stomach like chickens. I think the rocks to put in their stomach so they can grind up against the food that they consume that's what our our concern our care. About any of these issues boils down to is. It's it's grist and like even the anxiety and and guilt that is produced by group by chewing on. It is uh in some sense psychologically satisfying because it propels us into rituals of uh absolution that then make us feel cleansed if only for a moment. And it's the seeking of that cleanliness and that's the cycle of feeling implicated and uh and soiled and then seeking a uh a baptism that keeps us moving and again.

There's no buddy to blame for any of that. No one is wrong or evil for making these choices. We are all just trying to uh live from day to day as no humans ever have as as alienated as any humans have ever lived and we are just trying to make sense of a world that has at every since our most of us. If we're listening this. Since we were uh conscious has. Uh existed solely to atomize us to convince us of the immovable deadness and disenchanted uh mechanistic soullessness of the world. The the centrality of our own pleasure as the only antidote to that as the only uh as the only goal to seek in this dead. Landscape and then try to make sense of the world that we live in and of course. This is what we're going to do but these atoms that are banging off of each other you know. Eventually some of them are going to hit in a way that was unanticipated and explosions are going to occur whether they're sufficient. Whether they happen in time is a different question but whether there's going to be something for people to do at any given moment that might help lead us closer to that point. Uh is also very true. There is there is always as long as there are humans. There is there is hope it's because we all have the ability to transcend our understanding of the world. It happens all the time we've either experienced it or we've seen it in others where people come to an understanding that changes their relationship to the world around them to the people around them changes their values and therefore changes the trajectory of their life and that is where free will resides is in the the possibility that we have at any given moment to jump the track of our programming but what does that is emotion. What does that is a feeling in a moment is a contextualized experience that opens a new path it cannot be reasoned to. It can be reasoned towards but the actual catalyst can only occur in the forge of human interaction. Free will resides in the balls. All right folks bye-bye where's this gizmo.
