Welcome to the chat room we got fun and games. We got all the memes you want but you better come here today. We've got the posters that you'll find whatever you may need and if you've got your pepes we got your disease welcome to the chat room welcome to the chat room won't you bring me to you no no So. I don't want to. I'm sorry that I felt. I started this stream so irreverently considering the the day it is. It is after all 9 11 which is a very important date and of course a very important day for the city that I live in my adopted home of new york. It was on this day that hillary clinton puked her pants and fell into a suv and the world was never the same the day of outdoor summer hoops. Man that was a moment wasn't it when hillary fell over we. I watched that we interviewed the guys who made the pepe documentary and I watched that segment where they talk about how this felt like they'd memed it into reality and I gotta say that's certainly how it felt at the moment. It felt like everyone.

I know of course those freaks like to take things proprietarily because they suffer so much for being online as in you know. Their lives are so miserable outside of it that they they essentially deserve credit for creating all concepts because they spend the most time on here but sorry it doesn't mean you're good. At. It just means your life sucks anyway. I really feel like that was a groupoff group project not even on our part. willingly just the idea that she was wildly ill and hiding it was just very funny and turns out. She probably wasn't even sick because I mean honestly if you would have would you have asked yourself back then 911 2016. Do you think hillary will be alive in 2020. I think most people be like no unless they find her in a robot body. She's gonna conk out but here she is because these people can't die. It's one of the many evocative like mythological elements of q anon that like rings true why are these evil people.

Essentially immortal and adrenochrome stands in for the excess the excess the surplus value that they keep on to themselves. It allows them essentially to stave off death by the intervention of technology and you know it doesn't even necessarily mean you. You don't even necessarily to have to have that much more than other people to live unnaturally longer than them because you're not affected by the things that kill tons of americans like you have the time and money to avoid the costs of of unhealthy eating habits or alcohol or anything else you can offload. Those you can pay to have them dealt with instead of having the problem create more problem and more problem and and bring you into an earlier grave and of course. They don't expose themselves to the hazards of life that kill so many americans and they're never going to have to worry about having their lifespan shortened by excessive use of drugs because they don't need drugs. Power is their drug and adrenochrome the idea that there's a chemical in brains that is emitted during fear and pain that can be consumed ritually and that will extend life that speaks to the reality of life lived in the very sight of these people doing this while we're all suffering woodrow.

Wilson said that he was terrified of the automobile when it was introduced because he thought that the fact that now poor people would get to see rich people driving around in these vehicles would cause them all to spontaneously declare themselves bolsheviks and overthrow capitalism. He was genuinely afraid that the ostentatiousness of of this iron chariot whipping around and running over poor kids was going to make people so sharply aware of class distinctions that they would have overthrown capitalism. Now there we've we've seen that this country has particular bafflers built into it to withstand any overflow of radical radical activism. It's got it's got so many bafflers and chambers and venting ports that it's been able to disarm popular misery no matter where or how much it emerges basically since world war. Ii.

I got the sun in my eyes here. I gotta move. I know. It's I know. I look very heavy oh. This is what I do for you people man. I got this post here is the only thing that's stopping me from getting sun on my face. This is annoying hold on a minute yeah. I'm sure this is a lot of fun for everybody watching me do this. I might have to go back to the gross wall that everybody hates because there's no sun here so sorry if it looks like. I'm in sorry if it looks like I'm waiting to get executed with nick berg or something but all right here.

We go this ought to be all right. This is fine you get to see the freaking the the what do they call those transmission boxes. I don't know. I don't understand math or engineering cable box transformer. I think it might be a transformer fuse box whatever it is. I don't know. It's some sort of technology that keeps me from dying of exposure. This wasn't even talking about 9 11 something oh hillary falling over yeah that was really funny wasn't it. She comes out wearing those glasses and goes. I feel great never really got better than that. No there's never a funnier day than that never a more unalloyedly funny day of this whole thing than that.

It's funny now that the left has gone around to thinking 911 was an inside job right because right after right after 9 11 9 1911. Trutherism was a sole province of the radical left that was it like alex and that's why seeing alex. Jones's trajectory is interesting because he started off in the national consciousness anyway after being an austin goof-up before that on 911 and becoming a conduit for left-wing disillusionment with the status quo channeled into the narrative of trump bush doing 911. And then I feel like there was a pushback led by people like matt taibi where they say who got called left gatekeepers who they said look you're ignoring all the realities of power and the contours of power in this country to create a passion play about these evil bush people when the real the reality of american politics and geopolitics and strategic strategy is that things like 911 are the inevitable outgrowth of american policy and are then incorporated back into american foreign policy as an arborist. It doesn't require intervention from the state and now it feels like we're back to the smart opinion being that 911 was an inside job now though as an expression of like a deeper awareness of the absurdly basically as a way to explain the failure of the left to generate any anything like there was no real left in in 2001.

In america it had basically turned into nothing. Like the the last you had um you know. People can point to something like the battle in seattle but I honestly think minus 911 that would have turned into a like a last gasp of something it didn't really build to anything. It was like that anti-globalization movement. It reached the point of like highest conflict with the state and then because there's no higher way to go. There was more there was no higher level of conflict with the state that they were capable of or willing to carry out it dissipated and so 911 kind of like helped build like even a self-con conscious left in this country first around being anti-war but then within that there was the hardcore who used 911 as a narrative to like construct a story of american malevolence that explain the horror of this thing that had happened to us saying no no. I know this is awful and it should and it should make you mad but don't be mad at them be mad at the people in charge and that's that was in the context of the bush administration a left-wing position. The wright pretty much loved bush especially right after 9 11. And in fact for a while 911 truth was used by people who wanted to during the obama years especially who wanted to both sides stuff like birtherism.

They would say yeah republicans believe kooky stuff like that. Obama wasn't born in america but lyft leftists believe it 9 11 was an inside job and it was considered like a synoquinon for that like left position but it was left coming into its own. Now the left has failed to achieve liftoff at a time of maximum crisis a crisis that makes 911 that dwarfs 911 that is in the aftermath of 9 11. And it has like renders mine 11 in a day-to-day basis smaller and smaller in the minds of people who at one time had it consumed their entire identity and so an answer has to come to why hasn't the left succeeded. Why hasn't the left succeeded considering how bad things have gone and if things getting bad don't make people act better than what hope do.

We have you know that was what got us out of the depression essentially without rev becoming a barber as a total fascist country was. That was the was the effort of people who experienced the great depression and wanted to take control of their economic destinies and funneled that into things like sit down strikes. Wildcat strikes massive labor organizing of the uaw and the and the cio the radical cio communist movement. The communist party which was at its zenith of influence and membership organizing and and and creating locus of of radical power within every node of government up to and including the democratic party and now we're in a similar crisis or the beginnings of one and there's no nothing even on the horizon of of even the ghost of those ideas and I think people have a desire to want to explain that and I think the idea of of inside jobbery now of of being persuasive as as a thing that could happen hypothetically a thing that could realistically happen in this country like a cadre of people within the within the government carrying off a massive attack on some citizens staging elements of it and in order to carry out this agenda in the middle east. If you think it's possible to do that then the failure of the left to make any kind of inroads makes sense. It's explained within the greater umbrella of that meta explanation.

Now this is not me saying one way or the other would I believe anything about 9 11. I don't really know. I'm agnostic about it like I am with the kennedy assassination. But I just think that the reason that that's that that. I have noticed anyway and people could say. I'm wrong about this. I feel like there's been a kind of a shift towards more credulity towards trutherism than used to be considered on the left and I think it's because it's not necessarily any evidence because the evidence has always really been there and I think some of it is very eyebrowsing and brow raising and incredibly persuasive not stuff like tower seven that doesn't get me but you know the connections between saudi arabia and and the hijackers you know stuff like that and the like the the the at the airline shorts the the the amount of money that was made by people shorting airline stock that right before 9 11. but anyway like I'm saying. It's it's an interesting case. There's there's stuff that's very eyebrow-raising about all of it. we know that a lot of the stuff that they say is lies like they lied about I mean according to their own version of events. They lied for a long time about whether or not there'd been an order to shoot down flight 93 or not and whether dick cheney had issued it without any authorization from the president to do so. So like that we know they lied about and obviously there's there's like the degree of saudi arabian government involvement is is at the minimal funding without with by some elements within like how far it goes up whether it was directed from the top of the of the saudi family royal family that is not proven but minimal minimal but much more likely to the point of handling as if they were intelligence assets and when you consider the american relationship to saudi arabia in terms of creating radical islamic terror groups in order to subvert the so first the soviets and also secular leftist movements inside the middle east. It raises eyebrows like.

I said but I think what changes which shifts over time is what people's are looking for and I think for a while people wanted to appear smart. They wanted to realize no. I understand that this isn't about the bushes like after obama gets in there and just wrecks everything and just destroys any momentum that left might have accumulated by by by by hijacking it and then and then dispersing it to the winds. They're like no the system it's bigger than bush and since it's bigger than bush he couldn't have been the the guy who did 911. Like he's he's just another aaron boy. For this this systematic despoilation of the planet but now this farther into the and now with another crisis looming. I think people need an explanation for well why if we see this every day why is nothing to being done about it. Why are we not getting farther. Why are we not doing better but like I said. I don't really spend a lot of time on that. I don't spend a lot of time on it because honestly my assessment of the situation is not much much different if it happened any way that people say or not you know. I guess. I do resist the idea that bush was like. We're doing 911. I guess. I always am resistant to that level of conspiracy conception but I could definitely see. I could. I could accept as plausible any number of things from it being allowed to go forward after being discovered by the government to government making another step towards like paving the way and allowing to go at the operational level as part of a broader strategy. But it doesn't really change the way mustard tastes. Either way. We still know who our enemies are and we still know what mechanisms they use to control and maintain this fan this illusion of consent so. I don't know I am I'm hesitant also to investigate it too much because I know I could definitely go down a rabbit hole. There's so many fascinating elements to that thing.

I think there was doesn't wasn't there just recently declassified information that made explicit the degree to which there was high level knowledge of the 911 plot in the saudi government oh man. The anthrax attacks that stuff will make you screw your head on the other way. Around anthrax sent right after 911 to major media figures and politicians. With this weird block lettering saying we have anthrax death to america allah whatever and it's discovered that the anthrax was 100 percent milled in a u.s government biological weapons facility specifically the one in fort detrick maryland which is the the headquarters of america's chemical and biological warfare division. It's the unit 739 731 for the contemporary america and they never found who did it. They accused a number of people one guy. They eventually kind of had to half admit that they'd pulled a richard jewell but the other guy that they accused last. He kills himself and then they essentially closed the case they go well. This guy probably did it. I mean that's I mean but at the same time you're like okay. The us government used u.s government. Anthrax to make that looks like muslims did it why would they do that exactly. I don't understand it. It doesn't even make sense that's its own terms. They couldn't find some anthrax that couldn't be directly traced back to the us government. They did paper clip japanese scientists. Japanese scientists who conducted monstrous medical experiments not on foreign jews like in europe on american servicemen on g.i. Joe got brought to the united states and had their criminal records expunged in order to get the secrets of their tortures. But I have no idea about any of it.

I try to I try to spend more time thinking about the current situation. The current the current crisis just because there was a rabbit holes that if you're doing a greater project I think are worth investigating like if it's part of a greater project but I know for me. I think it would end up me just burrowing farther away from legibility. You know I want to I want to take this opportunity now with a little old to to make a little mia culpa here on something that I've been saying for a while pretty confidently and then was proven wrong on recently and that is when I said of course they're going to understand. They're going to extend unemployment and stimulus at the end of august at the beginning of august of course they're going to do it. They're not crazy and people said look well. They didn't do it and yeah you're right but thinking back on it. I think my error came because that question never came by itself or like my my somebody asking me about that never came as a as a question of like hey what do you think about unemployment. When unemployment goes out. In august it was always framed as hey what about when the goes down in august what about when the wheels come off in august and I think I subconsciously took too seriously the assumption that just because this threadbare system and this massively teetering economy got the legs kicked out of it would result in some sort of generalized social crisis and I think because I assumed that I said well then of course they're going to do it because they would have to fail to recognize the necessity of it to the maintenance of the system that they were providing presiding over. It turns out. They had better either either more cut off to even not even be registering these questions and I think some of them are others of them.

I guess had better data than me on knowing that there is no limit to our debasement. At this point they have nothing to worry about tom. Tillis is running for re-election right now in north carolina which while a southern state is at the presidential level kind of a swing state and it has a democratic governor. It's certainly not alabama or mississippi one of his chief. advisors when told asked by a woman who had cancer about what was going to be what she could do about getting insurance that she could treat it. said well you know when I haven't got want a fancy dress shirt and I can't afford it. I just don't buy it and then she says well. I need insurance and he goes or I'll die and he goes well you better get it. Then. I mean you said that to a constituent anybody see ghostbusters too you know. I'm a voter aren't you supposed to lie to me and kiss my butt. I mean that's the minimum we're asking of these people to even look like it remember when john john kennedy that yahoo from louisiana when asked about more ui said about people want more money in the in the pandemic said people in hell need ice water so maybe. I think a lot of it is just they are detached from the question but I think either because people higher above them with more influence are aware of it or they're just soaking in reality in a way that people who are paying attention to this meta conversation aren't and they just at a basic level understand things they know it doesn't matter. They know that they have this thing rigged. They know that that there's nothing we can do or will do. They it doesn't matter if they lose an election and honestly. A lot of them have a rig where they'll never lose elections. Now they've have picked their voter pool. Basically they've winnowed themselves down to the ideal voter and now they're going to be able to decide basically when or when when they or if they ever lose a race and they might lose a race one or there and it's fine. They still have their positions of power and they can keep it keep and hey maybe even if they lose. This time they can come back stronger while watching the democrats fail to do anything so the fact and I'd say that right now it's happening here where with an election in november and neither party stepping up to offer any kind of broad.

 redistributed demand or some sort of insistence on massive stimulus at the demand level in the form of money to people the fact that neither party has wrapped themselves around that like obviously they both say they're in favor of it. But then it's all just this procedural. Isn't out there and trump isn't out there with any kind of demand or insistence or even like a stunt to get people more money in an election year that means I think partially that they know there's nothing we will do but honestly. I feel like they don't think that they could do it if they wanted to in in the sense. Sure they could sign the legislation and they could like let that money out. But in so doing they would be destabilizing the relationship between employer and employee in this service economy. In a way that is not sustainable to the system it would be. It would be like. We have starved the roots we have starved people of money and made them replace it with debt to effectively control them so deeply. That that's that mechanism is now. The main way that we manufacture consent for this system beyond any cattle prod up everyone's ass and if you give more people more money you are literally reducing the wattage that you can blast up into their taint and that mean that's and in a moment now when when when when when it's asset stripping time when there is no the timetable right now is strip the assets sell the copper get the pipes out of the ground we are not distributing.

To anybody the government doesn't do anything. The government doesn't do anything for you just get that through your mind the government exists for you to own your enemies with it. By getting people you don't like either shot killed. It's suffering in some way triggered whatever afflicting scouring somebody else. That's the promise of our elected officials and if we give this money then we are breaking that promise and we are changing. The elect that we're changing the game and capital flatly in this situation will not allow it to happen now because they need that liquidity at the top now.

I think the main thing to draw from this is that the idea that there's going to be a republican realignment where the republicans become a heron volk. Democracy like tucker carlson leads us into this sort of populist huey long thing like from kaiser reich where huey long is the like the national traditionalist president or whatever the there's no money in the till for this not in the sense that they couldn't do it but in the sense that it would be too destabilizing to the system to let it be done so that means that nobody's going to be able to run on a I'm actually going to do what trump promised to do platform. It could only be culture war. Now that doesn't mean that the democrats are going to become more more populist and the other opposite. They're going to be stuck in the same thing because these parties are still controlled by the things they're controlled by like trumpism could have broken into become a third force in politics. The way hitlerism did under it hypothetically could if things have gone differently and most importantly if trump wasn't who he is if he was somebody who had the actual desire to do that he could have because his control over the base of that party is absolutely larger and more unified than the control. The piddly control of the party machinery itself but because trump didn't care to do that and was too lazy and stupid and uncreative to even think of it. It meant that the party took him and so what that means is there's nobody in the pipe. There's nobody with trump's hand laid upon it who has articulated a more robust version of national socialism or or ethno-nationalism or hair involved democracy whatever you want to call it.

There's nobody who's been ordained you can say tucker carlson but he does not he will i. Don't think he will have trump's ability to be independent of the political process when he runs because yes tucker. Carlson is very pop very famous and very popular on the right wing of the republican party but does he have the name recognition to run totally up independently of a party machinery that like I am telling you right now will not allow for this heron volks. populist turn will not allow it it means like if josh hawley runs. It's going to be on nukes nuke china that's it nothing else. It's going to be. We're going to get all of our all of our angst out about how bad things are and about how we refuse to help you by smashing the out of the chinese that's going to be the hair and vote democracy is hey. We're going to have world war ii but just in terms of a massive land war in asia and like I think tucker will be able to run. But like will. He have the entire united trump base behind him.

No not unless trump were to anoint him and trump doesn't care to do that you would have to have a coherent organized principled ideologically driven core at the top of a trump movement that would then be able to seize control of this mechanism through the body of trump and trump's personal relationship to his voters that has not happened. He is still in control of the same globalist they always was steve. Bannon was the one guy who could have made this project happen and they kicked him to the curb five minutes later why not because he was like too smart for the room or too much of a danger because he was a dumb. Reach was exceeded his grasp the his his his mouth was bigger than his stomach. His nostril was bigger than his bag of coke or whatever and he of course got instantly turfed out by the united. Like the entire um um immune system of the republican party kicked in at the institutional bureaucratic level which filled in all the spots that bannon couldn't fill because and was filled by because trump just signed whatever rights gave him like. Bannon lost the fight as soon as rance priebus was made chief of staff.

It was game over and bannon got iced out because what the project he was doing needed somebody smarter than him to do it. So the fact that he noticed the moment doesn't make him a genius. A genius would have been able to actually make something of the moment but because trump is the guy we got like this deformed short-sighted slow-witted distracted cripplingly vain buffoon who could not seize the moment and like redirect the ship. Similarly bannon is just too thin just some political genius. That's the people we produce in this country just mediocrities or worse everybody in washington.

I realize this reading this absolutely insipid review of of henry kissinger's lattice book that hillary clinton wrote where she says it goes from sun tzu to tacitus to twitter and I just think these people are so stupid they're so dull and what they've done is that they are. They all of them confuse ambition with intelligence. They think that because people are driven to the top in the battle of wills against other mediocrities in a bureaucratic stew they're the ones throttling their legs. The hardest it makes them the smartest or the best at it. No it just means they're the ones the most pathological because none of these people have anything other than tomato bisque between their ears. Now of course yes they also can they also confuse ambition with virtue like do. I believe good things well. I want it really bad so they must be good things to want if I want them that bad so. This is why I don't think unless things break in a very unpredictable way like.

I said like black swans you have to account for them the trajectory right now. I don't think they could get it off the ground even with tucker carlson as the as the pilot or as the as the spruce goose or whatever um. But hey I've been wrong before. I have no idea. I still put my money on the mypillow guy and it'll just be pure like hey wasn't wasn't it. wasn't cocoon a good movie that'll it'll just be pure last stage. Alzheimer's like just a return to a soothing past where of course also all demon. Pedophile.

Democrats are being executed on tvs at all times. But I mean if you can see three months from an election. Neither party stepping forward. It either means that neither of them really want it. Neither one of them want to win. They're throwing the ball back and half. It's hot potato or they just can't do it.

It's outside the realm of the possibility either because capital is explicitly vetoing it or because the effect of capital on the political process has has so transformed politics to being the state of like of the market. It's so marketized politics that they can't. They're as incapable of acting together as the bourgeois is loca I think this actually might be the explanation. I think this thinking it through. I think this is why it is It's because this is why things aren't working. It's not. Even the capital is saying no we can't do this stop it. It's because so marx described the gov. Like a government is the executive committee of the bourgeois and the idea here is is that there is a general thrust to capitalism. There is a capitalist social order that na that has to be maintained through like structures of coercion and consent to create a market that can then be used to transmit goods back and forth that accumulate capital and that needs to be maintained. But the thing is is that individual capitalists are not acting according to the best interest of capital as a system.

They are acting in what their perceived short-term best interest is because that's all they can afford to pay attention to that's why these are. This. That's why this is a terrible way to organize society and has to be done away with because of the massive waste. The energy just destroyed in these blind clashings of organisms that think they're separate but are actually one part of one thing like working. This out of the system is what gets you to a point where you can actually apportion surplus rationally and morally which are the same thing when you have a a a a a a consciousness that expands to the to the level of like a a society. A society or a species or something but anyway individual capitalist firms act like individual capitalist subjects in their own short-term interests and what that means is that they will often end up in situations where they competition is inferior to cooperation. But they're not aware of that like this is game theory stuff and then they mutually destroy one another. Like.

John nash won a nobel prize for talking about this stuff and this is the state of the market without some force that is outside of the market to coordinate it to do traffic signs. The same way we do with what the liberals think is the necessary state like the police and infrastructure like government like the government. The political class is the infrastructure of the like. The the mechanism of that regulates the market it has the same function it is. It's the police it's the roads. It's all the minaricus stuff and and that organizes and synthesizes. The will of the collective will the collective best interest of capital away from the individual interests of actors within capitalism and that means that some are going to fail and some are going to be hurt like the last 40 years has been huge hugely beneficial to certain segments of this economy and has made them hugely pop wealthy. But it has destroyed others and those decisions about which winners like that's why it's so funny. When republicans talk about. We don't want to pick winners and losers that's literally what government does like.

In the 70s. The volcker shock and everything else that went along with it essentially shows the winners were going to be shareholders and the losers were going to be workers and there's some overlap there because these are not all you know absolute categories so but what has happened in the last four years is as econo economic. The hegemony of neoliberalism destroyed the the the even the zone of action for economic policy like it was off the table economic policy is determined by the fed basically. It's like the interest rate determines everything that is the only real involvement the government can have in the economy. It does regulation at the level that the gov that is acceptable to industry and then it does minimal oversight of everything else and it collects some taxes to circulate money in the system really more than anything else and in return what that means though is that the zone of actual politics gets smaller and smaller which means the people who decide to become. Politicians are less and less aware of what they are even doing. They're less they didn't.

They weren't there when the the conditions were set. They've lived in the conditions and now so they think the only thing that matters is. The politic is the cultural that they've been arguing about for the past 40 years and so that means that they then become like and then also parties. The party system dissolves in favor of people rising and falling based on you know their ability to be a spectacle of themselves you know you either get a nice gerrymandered seat through the party system or you become a political entrepreneur like the tea party clowns and donald trump and instagram thoughts like dan crenshaw and alexandria ocasio-cortez like they're all part of this new celebrity structure and what that means is that you've rep you've turned you've turned politics into culture as you've turned culture into politics and that means now everyone is just only fansing their way and instagramming their way through the politics which means you've recreated the market in the political area when it's supposed to be the one. That's outside the market so it's operating by the same me first rules so they're so nearsighted. They can't even see the election three months ahead of them.

I think there might be something to that there's a siren oh yes. I know. I remember this I forgot you could hear it from here that's the that's the friday night shabbos siren to let the hasids know and the orthodox know that it's time to get indoors yeah or maybe. It's the 911 siren. I was with chris today and we were walking down the street and there was and he noticed that there were some cops standing around he said is there more are there more cops out in the streets. On 911 do you think and I think yeah. They probably do it as a show of force thing. But maybe they would say to stop a copycat attack.

But it's amazing when you consider that the the amount of real estate that was kept that was occupied in the average american's brain by anxiety about terrorism and how that's completely gone like it's not of course. The terror zone is bigger now and it contains more things but terrorism has gone from this giant lobe of fear to this little sliver. I think part of the reason for that is can you imagine being an al-qaeda guy and bothering blowing up something in the united states what so that you could get like a trending topic for five minutes and also what are you gonna do like you're gonna set fire to a are you gonna throw what I mean. It's like you're gonna dump. This place it sucks what kind of like p what are what are you gonna be able to pierce us with with like oh you blew up a building first of all we've seen that already it's just terrorism defined. Our response to the 21st century defined our economy define doomed us you could argue in many ways to not like not necessarily to apocalypse but to to less than we would have could have had otherwise and now it's. It's a afterthought. What has been spawned out of. It has been just this nightmare whirlwind that is so much more monstrous and and oppressive that we can't even muster up the energy to concern ourselves with the empty shell. The husk of terrorism that used to fill our minds yeah 911. One of the most successful terror attacks in history depending on who did it not.

I mean it doesn't matter if it was mossad or george w bush or the saudi royal family or it was al. Qaeda. Like that was a thing or it was it was or it was a prank. It was. It was a somebody was trying to get punked. It was just four really shitty pilots who just happened to have all started work on the same day oh. The official story of 911 accuracy zero zero percent chance officials. I mean the official story is never true. I mean just for epistemological reasons but you're not even getting closer any government thing like that any any any anything that deeply involving matters of state is basically never more than half true and that's like at the far far far end of the spectrum. I'd say that that the official 911 story is probably more than 75 false. I'll just say that but what's in the 25 is a question and that's what I don't know and people say. The thing about the passport is like that is genuinely wacky that his passport just floated down out of the thing that is just kind of comical in ira eyebrow raising as I said but at the same time why would you do that why would you bother with that is it like they're not going to piece it. Together there isn't a name on a manifest it just seems like. It's such a on the nose move.

I'm scrolling through an article in the daily meal the 101 best pizzas in america. I'm going to see if. I've had any of these and if I have if they were any good. I could go for some pizza. I have to say. I wasn't. I haven't had dinner yet and now. I'm looking at these pizzas man. I could go for one.

 zollies never never been to zollies keep that in mind though best pizza I've ever had was a couple places one rome. I had it was just a random place on a corner. It's phenomenal and two san francisco. There's a there's a neapolitan. I usually don't like neapolitan pizza. I will admit. I don't like how wet it is in the middle and how poorly like the sauce and cheese adhere to the crust and I don't really like the big fluffy crust anyway. But that one in san francisco is definitely the best. I've ever had I forget. It was just like a guy's name oh. Zafiro's from in milwaukee severoz is really good. Safiro's is great. You can get it at movie theater. It's super super thin crust oh. It's like the best. It's the best frozen pizza you've ever had which in my opinion is a huge compliment. Does anyone know frank something's. It's a name. It's a guy's name. I would like to try comic ping pong. Sometime. I can't feel like I'm kicking myself. Frank pepe is in new haven and it's very good um. It's in the old italian neighborhood north beach yeah. I think it's tony's yes. I think that's it you know the thing is.

I'd really like a frozen pizza. I should always get frozen pizza oh. I just realized I'm talking about pizza here and people are going to think that this is proof that I'm a part of the cabal. I really just enjoy it and that's one of the reasons that I i kind of try. That's that's one of the ways. I pull myself back from falling too far over the brink of the whole. You know the whole epstein brain thing is yeah. People talk about pizza a lot but pizza is like really good and cheap and it's a thing everyone eats. It's relatable. It's gonna if you start looking for pizza. You're gonna find it a lot of places. It's not like. It's foie gras oh bar in new haven. I had that it was really good. My favorite pizza topping has traditionally been pepperoni but I think I'm getting to the point where I really like minced garlic. I do love gelato oh it might have been. It might have been It might actually have been modern in new haven.

My stomach is literally rumbling right. Now no tat no no capparino wait. A minute somebody is saying mandela effect versus totinos versus tostinos. I'm afraid not for me. It was always tortinos and people who said tostinos were wrong. It was clearly wrong yeah if you thought it was tostinos that's your fault. I'm not going to validate your your your delusion. I do like anchovy sometimes. I'm not gonna not gonna lie. It's de fara. I've had once and found it very very mediocre maybe. I just had a bad one.

Hey tony's pizza neapolitan is number 29. I mean at least it's high on the list. Roberta's is okay. I actually prefer speedy romeo's to roberta's when you're talking like high-end fancy. Pizzas speedy. Romeo's my favorite of those patsies. I have not had it's right near me though. I should go to patsy. Maybe do. They deliver. Maybe go to patsy's today yeah. I might do it all right. I'm getting to the number one slice. The number one pizza in america john's on bleecker. I've had and it's pretty good. I don't know if it's number three. I honestly don't think it's number three but john's on bleaker is good. I had it once it was very good but I think I'd say that san francisco one's better p quads that is number two here and that is felix's favorite. We tried to get peak pods when we were in chicago in 2016. In fact the famous picture of me dressed like a baby in front of a baby who is also dressed like me. was taken while we were waiting to get into pequod's but sadly it was too big of a jackasses were in there so we had to go next door and have you and I'm disappointed because I genuinely am not a huge fan of chicago style pizza. He insists it's the best. I would give it a shot and then they got frank pepe as his number. One pretty good pretty good.

Those are I'd say those are. Those are all fine and I would love to try pequod time and find out how it is. There is no good pizza in ireland that is correct. There are no good tacos in ireland. They do a few things well you want a lamb stew. They're your people you want some mussels. Those are pretty good fish and chips. I know it's english but they do it good too some sort of pud pudding pie. But they're not. They're not good with pizza. Some of the best pizza. I've ever had actually was in sao paulo brazil which has a large italian population but apparently rio pizza. I never had but apparently pizza and rio de janeiro is criminally terrible like surreally bad. Someone says p quads is not good at all shot fired. I mean. I don't really. I don't credit felix too much with with gourmand taste. He basically just eats beyond burgers since he's gone vegetarian. He just eats beyond sausage and burgers on different different like buns and I bet south.

Korean pizza is bad. I would not think of them. I mean they know they are the dairy asians but I don't think that they could really get pizza. Although I've heard of course very terrible things about swedish pizza something involving bananas is this true is this are those sick mutants putting bananas on pizza as I am hearing happens and like curry banana curry pizza and then they put a bunch of weird like vinegar cabbage on it call it. Pizza salad mutants no wonder. They decided to just stoically accept corona death. They're eating that kind of they're all praying to get corona. They call a lethal corona of diagnosis winning the lottery in sweden because who would want to eat that god forsaken garbage. I like I like detroit style. A lot of people were exposed to detroit style without knowing it because I think that the p the standard like what they called what hand taught what was it hand tossed or deep dish. I think deep dish like not like chicago style deep dish but they would they but the deep dish style pizza hut was essentially a new york style pizza it didn't. I don't think it had the the sauce on top but it had the same crust so people would get that and not even know it was detroit style back when back when pizza was the nicest restaurant in many midwestern towns. What I could really go for is speaking of chicago style. Pizza's tavern style pizza that's super thin super thin crust with a little slice the edges on the sides. Oh that's the stuff. I have seen the trump pizza commercial he did He did the pizza commercial where he he goes. I made a deal. I eat the pizza the other way. I beat the buttercress and then he did of course the mcdonald's commercial with grimace where he did a job interview with grimace. What a country h the best chain pizza. I think it's the extra thin crust dominoes that is really good. Extra thin crust dominoes is a pimply choice for pizza fans anywhere among among you know nationwide chain places yeah.

I'm in the tatinos universe you tostinos people meet amongst yourselves to get figure out how you're going to get back into the rift because honestly if I if I would thought. I was a testinos person. I might decide yeah. Let's find a rift maybe in tostino's world. 911 never happened you know maybe in tostino's world we didn't get this monstrous trajectory. We we kind of took a breath and a moment and and recalibrated our our desires. I mean obviously. This is highly unlikely but maybe the tustinos universe figured things out a little bit not not perfect things are still probably pretty bad in a lot of ways and they probably have no idea how good they have it. They think things are critical but we look at them and we'd be like my god. They're so much closer than we are so yeah. I would try to find the testino's universe if I thought there was one but if there is it's not mine. This is my universe I am lashed to the mast of the sinking ship of the totino's universe yeah. Bernie is president of the tostinos universe but and he's been president. He won in 2016. And we we are on our path to climate amelioration and every massive. superstorm is met with huge reconstruction projects and green technology all over the place and transfer of green technology to emerging nations to cut down cooperation at the level of governments to mutually draw down the way that we mutually drew down nuclear stockpiles.

In the 70s somebody. somebody asked if I to get seth rogen on the show. I don't know what we would talk about. I would I would maybe. I would tell him that one time. I had an idea for a movie with him and been james. Franco you know pineapple express style and the gimmick would be that he would be. He would play and james franco would play lennon or not lennon. Not ingles and the only thing I had was a scene where they were at like a meeting and jonah hill shows up as bakunin and they start busting each other's balls like it's a judge apatow movie judge apatow judge reinhold and judge apatow and I had one like joke where rogan mark says hey hey mikhail. How's the secret society. Going you guys got dakota rings yet and then bakuna goes no you're totally right marx yeah. You're going to have revolution by writing a long division. But I think that that would that's more like a funnier die sketch than an actual movie. It would be way it would it would it would drill itself into the ground within five minutes. It would wear it wouldn't even it would get over long as an snl scad.

All right guys. I I'm up on an hour here and I gotta go because I gotta get pizza dudes. Pizza dude's got 30 seconds. Anyone know what that's from anybody 100 years old. Teenage mutant ninja turtles correct well done kudos user all right this. this thing's getting wobbly so I better sign off peace and chicken grease.
