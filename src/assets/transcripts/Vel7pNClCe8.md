So he dresses in black oh. He'll never come back. She's dressed in black oh dear. What can I do babies in black and I'm feeling blue baby oh. What can I do howdy folks. We're back. We're back.

We're talking capitalism globally the making of it if you say. I keep calling this book by the way the rise of global capitalism probably because I've been poisoned by marvel films thinking everything in terms of heroic narrative arcs making here's just talking about some sort of you know inert structure. Not not a heroic character. How am I supposed to relate. I'm. I'm a pinheaded american. I can only put things in totally personalized terms so that I can imagine myself going through that same journey because of my poisonous and totally unchallengeable narcissism. So I gotta say the rise of global capitalism like it's the planet of the apes although in many ways it is if you think about it but yes the making much more boring much more rational marxist materialist making of global capitalism the intro in the first chapter already reading this book.

I have a feeling I'm not going to go as forensically through it the way that I am with the way that we did with dawn of everything a lot of it and that was largely because of how much of the information in that book was so. Completely new to me and how little I had context for it. Whereas I can already tell with this book well. We'll see as we go that this is basically taking a story that we all kind of understand. But we all know the basic structure of and certainly the major events within and applying a a new interpretive model for it as opposed to the the grab girl book which is trying to just blow up received ideas. This is more of like a inverting some self-conceptions about stuff. We already know the main thing from what I gather from the the intro in the first chapter that panic and gidland are doing pandan. We can call them keep right keep doing books by two dudes one of whom is dead and died recently for that matter. So someone says they love me oh my god. I don't get enough of that. I gotta say that's nice thank you their main argument.

Here is that you can't you cannot conceptualize the emergence of global capitalism as a structure that dominates the world if you imagine it outside of the specific state. Institutions of the united states that the united states after world war ii imposed global capitalism as a state project and that is meaningful that's conceptually a significant distinction from the way a lot of people imagine it where where capitalism is sort of flowing through the american state and then using it up and and tossing it aside and you know. I think I thought I've thought in those terms briefly when I in the past we'll see how much they're they're going to challenge that idea. I mean. I honestly feel like we're now in a point where and we get hit a point in like the turn of the millennium when the usefulness of american estate institutions doesn't go away but what does change is the incentive structures of political leaders within the united states and I think that is why it looks a lot of way a lot of the time. Like There is some sort of native resistance to capitalism like within the reactionary element of the united states political class because you're talking about people who in people in their positions post-war lived in a in a case lived in a situation where it really was the case that what was good for general motors was good for america that the the job of expanding capitalism to an international to to create an international standard that was based on american jurisprudence and and property rights.

That's the big thing had the benefit. It was what what they're saying here is. It was not just for american narrow economic interest. It was in order to facilitate the creation of a global trade network where american industry could thrive i.e get the resources it needed at the prices required to do the capital development within its borders and there was a period there. The period that everyone politically is still stuck in in their minds because our political leaders literally are almost entirely made up of people who lived through this and had their politics and their understanding of the world and their values and that everything shaped There was a broad-based growth that this you know this cold war of military overthrows and assassinations and gladios on one hand but on the other hand the hand that pandit are talking about the bretton woods system and the gold and the international pet the us petro dollar.

After the gold standard collapses those things and then institutions like the imf that spread off of them and those things are all battering the disparate. You know social formations of the globe into one form which is the the nation-state ruled by its like. National bourgeois connected to this world system of capital circulation where the main the drivers at both ends were american industry on one hand american manufacturing labor on one hand and consumption in the other drawing resources into america to manufacture them then shipping them outward and consuming them domestically and then using the The money made through that export to consume even more domestically and that meant that aligning yourself with like global capital was good for you as a politician because it put money in the pockets of your constituents starting with the 70s.

Of course. The the structural adjustment that begins with the vulgar shock really more than anything to discipline labor and to to stabilize the system by reducing labor power. In the in the center. It starts a rot that buy that takes a while to kick in but by the turn of the century and then accelerating even more rapidly afterwards there now is global. Capital has actual noticeable effects now of course it always had bad effects even when it was putting money in people's pocket. It was also stripping them of their life. It was alienating them in a way they weren't even aware of but that's the point it was not being processed as a political material reality. It was just the spirit of the age. Now. It's been materialized in a completely destroyed manufacturing sector in huge chunks.

This country that are just not economically viable and people process that as a political problem which means that a huge problem now exists for the political and bureaucratic ruling class like the actual planners and administrators and they're they're elected puppets and I think that's how that's the only way you can explain something like the invasion of iraq because now we're in a situation where having failed to you know establish a formal empire after building and really creating a model for informal empire. That's another big thesis of the book. So far is that the united states was an empire. But it was a new type of informal empire that took over for the formal empires of the european powers who showed in world war one and two that they that in world war one really that they could not be trusted with pursuing a national capitalist interest that they had to consciously at the level of politics subsume that into a global capitalist project. They couldn't do it. Europe couldn't do it. There's too much blood.

There's too much soil only in america where we've synthesized a way of many of the deep cultural contradictions that happened when you impose capitalism on the The mudbound peasants of europe were synthesized out by free real estate and free labor that was not categorized as human the same way that you could not escape in. In europe. There was like a holistic conception of like a people there that meant that there was a limit to how much you could exploit one segment of them without a coalition of them including sympathetic people in the middle who are horrified by people that they recognize as fellow citizens being exploited by capitalism. They're going to organize against you in a way that really threatens your power in america. A lot of that. I mean that that conflict still was hugely powerful. In america. We had the most militant labor movement. We had the most violent suppression of labor movement in the world in the western world certainly but in addition to that a lot of that social conflict and contradiction and tension was sublimated onto exploiting people who just weren't part of the equation which means that when capital comes to this huge shuttering halt in the 30s the the crisis of capitalist overproduction in a context where you don't have global markets and you don't have a global flow.

You have these these remnants of nation states these these remnant nation state structures directing things in competition with each other while all possessing the most advanced military technology that that kind of capital concentration can sustain can't do it. They showed that they almost blew up the world 30 a second 30 years more but this time america honestly like after the last 30 years war. America was there to take on the job and to redirect the flow of of alienation like the the westphalian settlement and the imposition of you know anglo-dutch capitalism on europe that did not solve any of the contradictions that had led to the 30 years war and the revolts that wracked the entire continent and world during the crisis of the 17th century. What it did was it gave vent to them and the crisis word now is that there is no one for to take the davitan from america and honestly even if they did it would have to be in the same context. That america took the baton from europe after massive destruction of capital huge apocalyptic destruction of capital. The difference being now the sort of world war that sort of cleared away the dead wood and cleared away all that excess over accumulated capital that had caused the crisis in the 30s that would now inevitably lead to a nuclear war that would kill all life on earth so that's fun but once again we've talked about this who knows.

But anyway panditch proposed that the the creation of global capitalism was a project of the american state that american state capacity created it and sustains it and that this goes against a a mythic tradition in american historiography of the weak. American state and the thing is is that there is truth to the to the narrative of a weak american state in the sense that the constitutional order does make governance actual governance significantly more cumbersome than in other democratic countries and that that leads to loggerheads and and these like pools of stagnant political energy that cannot be directed and that like democratic distribution of of state power is actually much very weak. Like there was a big pond of human right behind the white house until almost it's a civil war because nobody wanted to fund fixing it but the thing is is that while that was happening something else is happening and this is what panditch is really emphasizing and said the u.s was standing up a machine. A state machine capable of exercising domination over the vast majority of the most valuable land on the north american continent and then being able to project that power where it was no longer able to actually assimilate because because the united states assimilated its territory as it went it differed and created a different structure or branched off from european colonial projects and and created a completely different structure to european colonialism that could then inherit power after world war ii that was like sufficient to do so because once america hits its boundaries you know oh. We can't we can't take cuba.

We can't take all of mexico we can't take canada. I mean the american manifest destiny project is a failed project when you consider the dreams of its founders like they all imagined a united states that probably encompassed at least all of north america and certainly for the confederates for the southerners. For the ones who needed to imagine an almost inexorable and a turtle can continuation of slavery and expansion into new territories where it wasn't occurring under american aegis. Then you're talking the entire america western hemisphere. They didn't get there. They couldn't they they they topped out. They tapped out at the the breadth of of that middle strand of north america but the territories surrounding them.

They were able to very quickly gain something approximating a colonial relationship to and another and this is another place where panditch are departing from traditional narratives. Not because the us was looking for new markets for their goods that is the story of america's turn towards empire. After the civil war is that oh no we'd close the frontier which meant that we did not have any new markets for our our stuff and so we had to export them which is also the narrative the leninist narrative of european colonialism that it is an exercise of finding new markets for surplus to prevent the sort of over accumulation. Economic crisis that is endemic to capitalism and panditch actually say that's not even true talking about europe certainly. Not true of the united states that what they're really doing is they're trying to create norms. They're trying to create the sort of trade network between countries and between areas that will allow capitalism to develop broadly which will then of course advantage individual capitalists within the united states so you have a situation where there is an alliance of interests alignment of interest between american capitalists. European capitalists and the broader project of creating these trade networks under european rules of property that those european concepts of property rights transcendent of all other rights are imposed elsewhere that's how you trade for the stuff you need not so much so you can sell the stuff you have and with the with the weak state thing this is not it. It is really more than anything just a difference in emphasis. You're just turning the geode and looking at a different facet of it because for the individual capitalists and this is why the reason that this myth exists about what colonialism was is because many of the people who were actually advocating it and proposing it and carrying it out thought that's what they were doing that was their that was their proximate motive but the beauty of capitalism is that it its very nature creates out of disparate interests a unified interest. The reason that the work the bourgeois is dominates the worker even though they're numerically inferior is that they are able to without trying live in capitalism and express meaningful class solidarity in social or political action. Their political action is organized around a single point in a way that the unorganized laboring classes cannot do their their political action is dissipated.

It's spread absent a organized movement and that is what we had for that brief period. From the from the 30s. To the 70s you could argue that the It's only really a live movement until the early 50s and that that taft-hartley and that really put a dagger in it and of course. The second red scare culturally. But it's it sustains it persists. There's like there's political. There's there's organized working-class political power that also creates working-class cultural power and I think that is the most important thing and that is what a lot of people. This is why people get confused about like who are the elites and what is power and they decide that like whatever is that like whatever is considered like cosmopolitan cultural values. Are are necessarily being like advocated as part of like some conscious capitalist brainwashing project or something you got a period where when you have broadly shared prosperity. Thanks to this demanding coordinated focused political project that the american working class is able to exercise within the structure of the democratic party.

Opportunities within the economy open up to people on the bottom and so the people who make culture are going to be literally diversified by class so you're going to have working-class people making movies working-class people being reporters and writing news working-class people becoming authors working class people creating culture not by themselves but as part of this class coalition that produces culture now what we have is a situation when because those chords have been cut because those opportunities have been erased that baby makes everybody making everything that everyone consumes is the child of the middle class. The home owning middle class forget what the parents jobs are. They didn't experience life as a member of a working class. Ever. This is the important part maybe their parents had a working-class job but they grew up first as a child on a suburb with it with a house in living class middle conditions living conditions that were basically indistinguishable from their neighbors. Their friends whose parents had white collar jobs pmc jobs or whatever the and then they went to college where you know these this world view is solidified and now go out into the world to seek opportunities from the safety net provided by the post-war prosperity and the people who succeed are the ones who can stick with it long enough or the ones who can access favors and networks which will always be the people at the top. So now we have this culture that yes it is cut off from like actual struggle in this country. Its concerns are the neurotic concerns of guilt-ridden rich people even though the people doing it might actually be precarious personally. You know working for free freelance wages and but knowing that their parents were there to take it it robs the arts and culture of their vocational aspect and this is not.

This is not anyone doing a project. This is not anybody trying to stand up like do run interference for woe capital. It's just a a value system and a order of priorities that is organized around guilt and the the public atonement or cleansing of guilt. What you don't have is the resentment. What you don't have is the anger you can still have like anti-capitalist work anti-capitalist satires but they're for the most part going to come at this from a position of someone who feels guilty about their contributions to capitalism. Not somebody who feels angry at their exploitation by capitalism. Now that is a different that's a different energy in a different has comes to different conclusions because it has different priorities right now a grievance of capitalism because so many of the cultural artifacts that we associate with global capitalism are politically are considered progressive and are are actually progressive. Resentment is reserved entirely for white right right wing reaction which is just the s the children of the same home owning petty bourgeois but ones who for one reason or another have accumulated a sense of resentment rather than a sense of guilt that's the only difference between these two groups of people and so that means for relatively apolitical people who have not had their their political because the thing is most of the people that talk about politics. One way or the other are our pref are like our native. Um sympathies are over determined.

They have been mashed into us by so many overlapping so many overlapping contingencies all coming together that it was never going to be any other way and we can't really pick and choose. We're destined to be or to be based. You don't really get a choice that's why the the most unseemly spectacle you can watch is somebody trying to publicly like shift sides to try to publicly like purify themselves of their previous allegiance. Their instinctive allegiance to to cringe ideas versus based ones or whatever the. But the people who are coming into politics now because culture and politics are totally inextricable and conditions keep getting worse. So people who might have thought they didn't need to worry about politics now decide that they have to pay attention. They're coming at these debates orthogonal to the sort of deeper commitments that the people fighting with them have and then they all they see is the thing where okay one side is a bunch of weepy. And the other side are a bunch of people who are righteously angry and the reason that we keep having the same arguments the same things and it's just everyone banging. Their heads against each other is because we are utilizing extinct frameworks. Politics doesn't work the way it used to but we still only have the same political structures to work with so getting back to the book.

The first chapter is a description of the sort of america's contribution to building global capitalism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. So this is them going through the process whereby american capitalism is built in america And then exported and how that is at every level a project of the state adding capacities to carry out these necessary projects because the reason I keep saying that this book is just like like shifting a perspective seeing catching. Another facet is that their insistence on the centrality of the um of state power right as the thing that makes capitalism is really just a shifting of emphasis away from saying you know state capacity is built by capitalism. Both of them part of the greater unified truth that there is no distinguishing capitalism from the state. There is no distinguishing the nation-state from its economic structure that is a fantasy that is the necessary and that is the necessary magical incantation that the english performed on the land to say that there is a distinction between the they split the atom the social atom and they said that instead of there being one world created by god that is then lived by and for humans there is the social world of humans and then there is this thing called the economy that the economy has laws and rules that humans are bound by now that is not true.

That is a ideological really. A religious belief that replaced the It replaced the unstable firmament that was left by the destruction of the catholic church. If you once you when they cr. They destroyed catholicism. They left this riven land because how can you live as a christian without a unified church. How do you mediate different beliefs. You need a neutral space and that neutral space is the market and if you can't anymore know what if god has saved you if you're going to go to heaven or not because god dammit. It's right there in augustine. God knows everything therefore god knows if before you were born if you're going to hell. Therefore you have no control over that how do I live with that knowledge well. I can't know for sure but gee if nature is favoring. Me nature is favoring me god can't be too pissed at me right. Why would god want his favorite to really suffer too much you know now of course.

It starts off fetishizing suffering but once oh once the real benefits of that free real estate kick in because again this is all stabilized in america it couldn't in england. It caused the king because it could not be stabilized in england yet. But at the same time that was happening there was this huge venting of people to the u.s who were able to stabilize that relationship by explorating during the crisis of the 17th century. The only europeans who were eating good and gaining gaining weight and living longer were in north america. Everybody else in europe was eating each other during sieges and famines and plague outbreaks. They were eating good in the neighborhood and why because they weren't cheeked to jowl jostling over the ability to meet out of subsistence in a world where every square of land had somebody's name on it somebody who had the power to enforce their title to it. It was a bunch of people who they could easily dispossess if they wanted to because of their superior technology and the fact that they were all reeling from a devastating biological attack.

An unconscious biological warfare program that america that europeans launched just by showing up so there in that land all of a sudden suffering comes more remote becomes more awful to contemplate and what fills in is instead god favoring you by blessing you with his natural abundance that is what nature has given you the market. The economy and libertarianism is just the final materialization of that spiritual politics because eventually that abundance kills god the people who live in it don't even know it but they're killing god and eventually god dies. We kill him he's dead. We throw him on the pyre and then we have to rebuild ourselves in a world where the material is the only reality that we can consensus we can agree to and so that means that the market becomes the closest thing to a supernatural force because it is the only thing that we cannot see. It is the only thing that operates outside of our will. I just watched the devils. It was awesome but yeah. None of this is in the book obviously but I'm just saying that what seems like a a attempt to like correct the record by by panden here.

I think is better understood as simply a reversal of emphasis because you can't since you can't separate the state and the economy you're still going to have to talk about one or the other. Like that is the challenge of living dialectically right is that everything is is always both of the things you're talking about but you could only ever at one time talk about one thing so when you got somebody saying like capitalism builds. American institutions and the american state is weak because market forces kept it that way it's because you are focusing on this market relationship. Because yes this is all all those market actors. All the robber bears and everything they're operating in a context that is determined by state structures obviously but they don't talk about it. That way they don't think about it. That way. They don't act that way and nobody else does either because we're all in on it. One way or the other consciously or subconsciously. We're all in on this fantasy. So if you want to talk about those things you end up building a narrative that under emphasizes the state flip it over and you talk about the state.

Then the market area shrinks. But both of these things are happening at the same time and they are not separate from one another and that's why like you only never really get anywhere trying to like think through things. Like this like historical questions. Political questions is by trying to inhabit that space between the two poles instead of focusing on one then building a narrative where that is the only that the the the structures within it are the determining structures and that then the other pole is somehow a falseness. It's it's like a it's. It's the devil. It's wicked no. It's the same thing. It's the same thing get rid of the judge. You just have to purge yourself of the instinct to rank and then judge. Like this is why.

I think that anarchism fundamentally is wrong is because their allergy to hierarchy doesn't recognize that hierarchy is only bad because we assign values to the ranks beyond their function like if you need people in an order of operation to facilitate a collective endeavor. The authority that rests with that cannot doesn't necessarily have to come from exalted social status. It can come from just examples of just the fact that it works and that there is a unified project that everyone is working towards and they know from experience that this is the thing that works and that's also why the state cannot be opted out of the state has to be grasped and worked through because it is the only structure that can administer a state or that can administer an economy self-consciously or not of The kind of size we have that is beyond subsistence like grab. Girl wanted to talk about how oh like they had all this These. These features of of complex societies but that they didn't have hierarchy or anything like that and that means that you don't need a state and it's like well yeah when you have an actual connection to the environment and I don't mean like a spiritual one. I mean knowledge based. I mean you have a set of understandings of the world around you forgetting any a mystical connotation that allow you to live in it but to allow you to live in the world instead of living in the fake.

Bubble world that we create by dividing ourselves from nature but once you're in that bubble and you live in a society where everybody is where those remaining links are. They have no social reproduction you got basically hobbyists and cranks at the margins. Then you can't just go no more state because then the whole thing crashes down and then you have what is fundamentally would be indistinguishable from the sort of mass death that people are terrified is going to happen if capitalism isn't take overthrown. Now you might say that's going to happen anyway and I might agree with you on that. But those people in the wreckage wreckage guess what they're not going to all of a sudden all together learn to re-establish those connections they're going to still need. They're still going to have lived through their lives through the same mediating institutions and technological regimes. As everybody else. They're not going to magically turn into pre-capitalist subjects which means they're going to have to use the stuff around them not just the technology in the physical sense. But the social technology like the state. What does knotters mean what is happening here okay so people are nodding along cool all right that's good is this is this. Is this a is this a twitch thing or is this something. Young people are saying now or is this specific to the chat yes okay.

Together and for the first time created a central bank structure to allow the united states to be a reserve currency because before that even though the dollar was you know an incredibly important global currency. Nobody could trust it because it did not have central bank mechanisms for dealing with monetary crises which were most glaringly obvious in 1907 when a monetary crisis was only averted because jp morgan got a bunch of bankers in a room and told him they couldn't leave until they agreed to bail out wall street and then everyone realized it can't be up to one to do this so that's when you get the movement towards central banking in america. Although our central bank structure is more it has more fake levers of um of democratic accountability. It's more phonely decentralized in its structures than the european one but that's just masking the function and that is I think the best way to understand the weak state of the american 19th century is that it was it had plenty of capacity. It just had to be motivated to use it and for the most part because of how little input the most miserable most how well political influence and power the most miserable. The most exploited americans had they were either literally enslaved or they were urban.

 urban paupers who were basically politically dominated by corrupt political machines that were just patriotic networks that had no interest in in in challenging the state's priorities as they existed just getting more money for specific members of their networks and even the people who could hypothetically be the most you know the most resilient challengers of pet capitalism from within the yeoman farmers. If things got too bad they could always go somewhere else and get some more land and try again. There was always a economic escape from political crisis so the state lay fallow where there was no pressure on it but where there was real pressure on it. From coordinated capital. It was building these sinews that would erupt first during the civil war. Okay. No more win this thing but then also in the in the progressive era when the social element of that state capacity was too fallow in the face of too much working-class mobilization.

 too much political threat you had the populist movement you had the the strike waves there needed to be some sort of synthesizing that and externally this is a key thing you have that pressure internally but instead of it being in conflict with the the global strategy of american capitalism. There are those motivations are aligned like during the post civil war era. One of the big reasons that the us failed to respond in any meaningful way to the crisis of the 1770s and then later the 1890s is because we were pegged to the gold standard and the gold standard was held by the bank of england england imposed gold on the world and the united states being part of the world that wanted to trade with the world pegged itself to gold as well so that it could attract european investment and so when we had these periodic crises we could not put money into the economy because that would have violated the gold standard. Instead. We just had we left we had a deflationary economic policy that prolonged these crises but then turn of the century a little bit later we're seeing the emergence of unstable regimes in south america the ones that replaced european colonialism oh no.

It turns out that setting up these little tin pot dictatorships ruled by a tiny pre-capitalist elite and not allowing any kind of real political. Culture to flourish doesn't create the most stable structures politically or economically and the united states. They weren't going to let the european colonials who are slathering slapping their chops anywhere near that and so there is a motivation to create these concentrated capacities of state power to regulate the economy to regulate internally You know production and also too by gun boat and by the dollar impose property norms on latin america first and then once the europeans. I mean we're getting ahead of ourselves but they're setting up the structures that will be then used. The the the keratin sticks the carrots and sticks that will be used after war two to export it around the world.

So that's chapter one. We'll do chapter two next week. I don't know I'll do as long as I keep reading. I'll do at least one chapter like. I said. I think this is going to be a little more informal.

But we got up here to the creation of the federal reserve right up to world war one and during world war one is when the u.s balance sheet shifts when the u.s goes from a debtor nation to the european powers to the creditor. Specifically the bank of the allied powers during that war which inverts the entire relationship and directs american state capacity towards the project of extending capital institutions. Capitalist institutions modeled on american property rights everywhere they could why wasn't william jennings brian ever president because he had his best chance was 18 1996 when he first got the joint nomination of the democrats and the populists and had the single issue of the of the silver standard to unify the entire. The entire populist coalition because obviously the democrats were much more tied to capital than the populists were they were not down with a lot of the populist. Ideas like their nationalization regime and stuff like that but they could agree on the by 1896. They could largely agree on the silver standard and that was a real that was what stood in for that was the medicare for all basically of 18 of the 1800s because at the time there was no vocabulary to talk really about you know doing fiat currency or or the sort of keynesian pro prime pump.

Priming that fdr would do the the the free market. Lazy fare nostrums were so thoroughly embedded at the political level even though you know common. People probably didn't give a but so what they still had to vote for democrats and republicans. Largely they still had to read the same newspapers all of which set like the hate to use the word but overton window about these things so the only acceptable answer to what to do about this awful. Economic depression that has been persisting since 1892 and which none of the the federal government has done nothing really to to ameliorate is what if we put silver into the into the stock species that we use to set the baseline for us currency and pump more currency into circulation inflate. The economy reduce the because inflation reduces debt in in absolute terms.

If you're a debtor and the currency inflates then you owe less money in real terms than you did before and the massive america. By this time the mass of american farmers who it's supposed to been who had supposed to been this who were you know conceived by jefferson as this army of totally independent citizens who could exercise total political control over their lives are now debt peons and also hey if there's if there's money to be given to people they could spend it in the economy and stimulate it and of course we now know that that's what you. That's what a capitalist economy if it actually wants to do something if it wants to intervene it can and that's the interventions it can take to stabilize itself.

But at that point the organizational capacity at the political level at the level of unions level of ideology even did not exist to seriously threaten challenge. The prerogative of unrestrained capital which at that point completely controlled both parties all they could do is get. This broad coalition together but it was never. It never had the cohesiveness of the the democratic party like in the 30s. For example and it was against them were posed a completely unified capitalism around mckinley and then you had this figure of mark hannah who was the political fixer who basically scouted mckinley and backed him. Karl rove always fast imagined himself in the role of mark hannah to george w bush's mckinley and he went around the country getting every single newspaper publisher every financed man of any level on board not only with propaganda but with money vasha lindsay in his poem about brian's 96 campaign said rallying the roller tops rallying the bucket shops which is a name for like like stock broker back.

Then. I think it was a bucket shop and just big big stacks of money taking around the country and money. That's the one way absent solidarity to organize intent and that intent was enough to make brian to the good middle class people of this country look like an unacceptably radical option. Mckinley promised the full dinner pail and he got it and so what we got when when when it came time to like really reform the government towards you know doing things like injecting liquidity in times of economic crisis and things like regulating securities to prevent stock or runaway stock speculation. It's not done under the aegis of a brian led broad populist movement that is you know and antagonistic to capitalism. In some way it was from within the two parties among sections of educated middle. Largely middle class elites who college professors and political professionals and media people journalists saying okay. We know it has to be done here if we want to exp keep american capitalism expanding if we want to be able to trade internationally if we want to be able to get raw cheap resources from latin america and if we want to prevent a socialist revolution.

Then we need these new structures and brian ended up getting the nomination two more times But he never he was never even close again. I think and then as a consolation prize for all of his hard work woodrow. Wilson made him secretary of state but then he resigned very quickly because of the wilson administration's bellicose foreign policy because he was a peace candidate. He was anti-empire like a lot of the populist types were. He was also as you'd imagine super racist so yeah. Brian loses mckinley presides over the first formal extension of american empire in the filipino. America the spanish and filipino ins wars gets popped replaced with the the golden boy of progressivism colonel roosevelt who presides over this new efflorescence of american power that is once again just the the these imagine american state capacity as like a pair of lungs. The lungs are always there they're just either rising or falling but that doesn't when they're falling. It doesn't mean they're gone.

It doesn't mean the capacity is gone. It doesn't mean they are inherently weak it just means they are choosing to retract and so in the next chapter presumably we're going to be talking about the inner war period which will be very interesting because it's a time that we think of as this like neo-isolationism. Like no we're not joining the league of nations. We're gonna stay out of european business. But it's also a time when we were at our most busy invading and overthrowing governments in latin america. I mean caribbean of course so that'll be interesting to talk about that. Next week. All right folks. I'll talk talk folks next week peace out. I might as I said. I might do more than a week next. I might do more than a chapter. It'll basically be how much. I feel like is in the chapter and if I don't think it's enough. I'll I'll do more. I don't actually expect anybody to actually read this book. It's just me talking about a book. I read you can if you want to. I don't care. But I try to to do these in such a way that it doesn't matter if you've read them or not because I know some people say. I wish you'd stopped with the book. I'd like to just watch them again. Honestly. You don't have to read the book. Nobody should have to read if they don't want to my god. What kind of cruel demon would impose such a thing on people. All right peace.
