 . What's going on here oh. All right. I'm good right oh boy all right. I'm assuming I'm good. Hey guys I'm not looking to get top no. It's a joke anybody remember hacks Headroom. He was a guy hello hello I am speaking as he drove the man. The floating head the floating head from your dreams. The floating head that has floated in every head Matt Frewer remember them Matt Frewer he was Max Headroom. Iowa's was a big fan of Matt Matt Frewer. I thought he was pretty good hello everyone. What's going on with you folks what's going on with the fine folks of the internet'. TEDWomen I don't know enough about Alfred McCoy to speak one way or the other about it.

I'll admit that sorry talk about the left 16 trot in the 1960 19 project. I think a couple days ago I've got a knee braided passed coming out today about Upton Sinclair in the 1934 New York governor's race which is genuinely an amazing sort of pre sequel to the harp or a harbinger to the Sanders campaign in a lot of ways and it should be fun to talk about we'll see what you guys think the left is a mess. It's a mess folks and I can't believe it such a mess by Eddie. Oh yeah. You know what that's a good idea. So I'll tell if people have questions about Sinclair the campaign that they want to talk about after the episode comes out so yeah by all means bring them here. I'll be good to be like a reading a little reading serious or a little like a study group or whatever you want to call it. So the degree you want to do that I'm vibing with it whatever you guys are putting down oh yeah. Kierkegaard yeah. He was a fellow traveler for sure yeah. Now the leap of faith I now understand is literally like the engine of all thought yeah. No I'm vibing hard on. Mr. Kierkegaard well done Sauron somebody wants me to consider using a simple up voting system to solicit questions. I don't know what that means I don't know I'm afraid I'm scared. It's RBG dead or not. I mean I probably I think she's probably been dead for a while. I think that the DNC budget that hasn't been sent towards killing people in the primary has been spent keeping her alive in like an animatronic State. I think she might be a puppet. She might be an actual puppet I feel like chicken tonight like chicken tonight oh. No don't tell me I'm breathing heavily again. Don't tell me I'm dying I can't handle it.

I started thinking I'm Gandolfini in a hotel room in row. But I'm gonna pitch forward. I mean I'd be okay with that. But I'd rather I'd rather have a little bit more time so please. Dont trigger me that way if we run out of burgers man that's gonna be the real oh boy. I've been thinking about this like the degree to which we have pulled back social tensions in this country by rapidly ratcheting down people's quality of life. When that's the only thing we have to exchange for the rapidly alienated lives like we have spiritually and materially alienated everyone in this country to a monstrous degree. The only thing that is compensated for it is a regime of absolute perfectly imagined convenience. It might not be real. You might not always have perfect convenience but there is a dream of fully realized convenience and and then people get some percentage of that and it makes them sort of okay with the system as it exists and there's a real chance that this flywheel might be broken and if that's the case there's not gonna be anything holding back.

Just the snapping of these tensions one after the other and it's gonna I predict I predict bad news just even if things stay stable and like a geopolitical sense and the economy technically still exists and you know it's like. It's sort of like 2008 but worse. But otherwise things are basically stable. You're still gonna. See things start snapping at the social level because things are gonna get coarser and coarser and one of the things that's going to make that happen is we're probably going to be habituated to be okay with thousands of people dying of coronavirus and us not really caring about it because if we care about it then we can't participate in the economy and then we're back into a collapse which means we're all gonna end up blaming ourselves to some degree for all this death which means we're gonna have to start just to not to think about that. We're gonna de humanize the dead which means we're gonna do humanize everyone around us. And I think that those those social bonds are gonna start snapping like rigging in a in a sinking pirate ship and you're gonna see some uptick in violence and stuff. It could be bad but the thing that might stop that from happening is that the u.s. Still is the consumer of last resort for the world economy. The u.s. The US economy is the only place where excess demand goes if excess demand doesn't have somewhere to go you have a buildup in the system and at this point it's a world economy and a bill demand that can't be expressed in the economy or a buildup of supply. Rather. A buildup of supply in the economy that cannot be accommodated is genuinely catastrophic you're talking about a world depression so there's every interest in the world to see the US bailed out of this in the short term. So they're gonna bail money into us like crazy. But we're gonna be pumping blood out of an aorta and the question is at some point the body's gonna unless we patch up the wound. The body is gonna start expiring but if it doesn't the good news is we have time I think because they're gonna start pumping in a lot to try to stabilize this thing.

In that time we can like organize as much as we can to resist it to resist. The new lines is there. Word. I don't want to get to do mer because I honestly feel like at every level. We have agency we just have to be aware of where we are what we can do. We just have to be conscious. We just have to be conscious man. It's really true and for conscious every moment we can strike where we must Olaf Palme assassination. Ooh. That's an interesting one. My gut is that it was boss and my gut. It was the South African apartheid era government. The ones that blew up Ruth first they were known for espionage. They were known for extraterritorial assassinations. Sort of the African version of Condor and Palme was considered a threat to a lot of interest there but also in the Middle East. I know that he was I know Israel but the thing is Israel in South Africa worked hand in glove in the 80s so that could have easily been the pipeline. I don't know it's a very interesting case the new inebriated past today. Today it will be released. It's about Upton Sinclair's 1934 run for California governor I think it's gonna be a good one -oh just dropped boo yeah yeah.

My single is dropping just dropped boom check out my my new smile. I'm trying to crown things don't don't try to tell me to talk about Gnosticism because that's the kind of thing that'll get me off the beam I'm trying to stay grounded trying to ground everything and as close to a material observation as possible to stay connected. This is all about translation so yeah. Let's ask things are a little less obscure than that please but I do love talking about Gnosticism. Oh no don't. The beam you must seek the beam you must walk the beam that is your goal in life that whether you know it or not the goal of your life is to walk on the beam the beam is us but we must be aware of it.

Yes oh yes the type II rebellion. The tight and rebellion really is really interesting. This is one of the biggest like modern Wars in terms of casualties and number of people involved in it since since the development of gunpowder in the West. It was a huge massive conflict as well. We're thirty million people died but it's almost never talked about outside of presumably China. But I don't know how they even contextualize that presumably as some sort of like peasant precursor to the Chinese communist revolution and therefore they're the good guys. In their version are the Taiping and the bad guys are the empire which I think is honestly kind of broadly true and I feel like it would have been better for china in the long run if the taipei and one I feel like the the the king should have ended then or however the hell you say it that was when they should have ended and honestly the reason they didn't end is because of Western intervention because the Western powers which at that moment were trying to carve up China and we're in the process of fighting the opium wars to export their their their surplus from their mouths from their trade in India to China and the second India opium war happened in the middle of the rebellion but they eventually provided direct aid to the the cause and that helped sort of push them into victory. And I think I think that was a bungle for world historical perspective. Chiang the Ching ya know that that was their time they had lost all legitimacy.

But I really think that's another interesting thing about the so. It's this incredibly powerful and important event in world history. This hinge point and you could kind of think of it as a thing that happened that didn't because you kind of think of everything is determined but then you can stop back and like look at well. What could Reason listicle II have happened here that didn't and you're like wow there was a lot of there was a lot of given this. We could be much farther along in like progress as a civilization but we could also be much worse case much worse shape. You know we don't know but we can see how how the contours of things shape up and that is right one of those like you. They almost knocked the Coke machine over and then it knocked back on his heels but then a couple more times and bang. It was over but the whole thing started basically because a guy failed his SATs that is what caused the death of 30 million people in mid 19th century China a dude flunked his finals and I don't know there's something very endearing about that because in in that in among the like the peasant class in in in Ching China there was basically no social mobility outside the bureaucracy. If you were a member of the landless peasant class. Especially the Hakka migrants in the south to migrated generations previously from northern climes that had never achieved any sort of claim to land the only way. Neither getting out of a pretty dreary. Peasant life is study for the damn. Imperial exams to become a bureaucrat because they sure as needed a lot of those so. These kids studied and they studied that they studied they study. They cram the hell out of it and it was mostly rote recitation of classic Confucian texts. It wasn't even like logic problems or anything. It was just cramming things directly into your face so that you could regurgitate them in the testing area. It was an incredibly friendly rigorous thing. It was like one percent pass rate and you could retake it. But it cost money and it took a long time between tries and the dude who started the whole thing he gets lost. He he failed too many times and he wit. He went.

He basically had a fever he broke into a fever. He was in in the kind of a comat coma state for a while and when he came out having read a bunch of Christian pamphlets that had been left at his village by Western missionaries. He decided that he had visited Jesus in heaven and discovered that he was his brother and so he launched this peasant rebellion that spread through central China and eventually almost overtook the entire empire and looked like. It really honestly should have and then they just kind of made some mistakes. They were trenched when they shouldn't have. They wait there and then there was the divisive decisive Western intervention. But it's a very interesting story and it really does tell you you know you got to give kids a chance that they can't have to. They can't all have to be that dirty you know you got a lot of skateboard sometimes relax and it's interesting because you could kind of evaluate the the process of the of the taipei rebellion and then map it. Then. After the like you look at typing and then you look at what happened after culminating with a communist takeover. It's sort of like a refracted version of itself sped up through by technology because what you had with the typing was a a stultified a situation where you had like an excess of landless peasants. Too many miles not enough land. No efficient exchange things were all built up. There was no legitimacy to the regime the fact that it was a conqueror regime didn't help certainly that there wasn't Han Chinese who made it up and this a figure comes out using a Western concept. This idea of like millennion or christianity to like create a state of urgency to create a people who demand change in the here and now because they're gonna make something spiritual like out of matter which they're getting directly from the West here in the form of important Christianity which then causes the whole thing to erupt and shatter and then like I said forces probably would have eventually resolved with the the Taiping at least taking over a huge chunk of China. Instead they were defeated with the help of the West and then that rickety old empire that che Empire eventually knocked over by the nationalist rebellion with sun yat-sen but then then basically breaking up into an empire into anarchy because you know you can't just take over that height of power and expect to hold on to it. When everything underneath it is destroyed and then if you think about it that the Chinese Communist rebellion is then a sped-up a more successful technological replay of the type pain where you have the same situation you have mass numbers of peasants well. More than there are land hugely exploited rural peasantry and then you have this Western idea of communism to rally them to which then turns them into an organized and self-motivated unit too. Just to attack the rotten status quo which they then defeat because it's not like mouse was the genius who thought hey let's get.

The peasantry involved. I was just enough of a person removed from Dogma. The dogmatism at the heart of like Soviet what Marxism which at that point was basically a religious dogma on par with like you know the Inquisition's Catholicism. He was on he was uninvested enough in communism as a concept to think well so just recognize well. We've just got our asses kicked in the cities. There is no more working class to organize. They've just got massacred by the Nationalists. There is this big chunk of landless peasants so why don't we go to them. It was just recognizing the reality of where the social pressures were and so then it's like it's Maoism. If anything is. It's about adaptability you know because it was itself an adaption to the conditions on the ground. Using Marxism is like the basis. It was just a recognition of conditions and that's all we should ever be seeking for is to recognize conditions through the lens of our ideology but not determined entirely by our ideology hopefully by trying to honestly engage with the world around us. In addition somebody asks why is there a tendency towards Ella tree among subaltern resistance groups.

I honestly think what it is is like you start involving yourself in a left-wing movement you know in a in a in a resistance movement with the hope that you're going to immediately as possible overturn the conditions of your misery. Because that's what you want. You want this thing that sucks to stop but the thing is is that that fight takes time and it might take longer than realistically you could invest in believing things will change and so that means that you either have to give up because you you either give up because you know that it's not worth the additional pain of depriving yourself. In the name of you know the revolution or you get more benefit. You put all of your emotional investment in the cause itself and so all of your pop. All of your emotional energy goes into imagining the pop. The the the party. The thing you're working towards the thing you're working through as like the the repository of all of your emotional energy and so that means that you get super super strident on details of like ideology because it doesn't attach the real world because the real world sucks in the real world you're doing nothing you're in misery. You're eating soup in a safe house in your head. Though you're fighting it the most deep levels of like historical minutiae that have no connection to reality. But that's where all of your emotional energy is because if it isn't there it's here now and that sucks I will definitely say that I have never I'll admit that I never really vibed with David Lynch but I should definitely give his films. Another look someone. Just said here that he is gril pill and even with my limited exposure to his work he is 100% gril fill. He is clearly vibing at his own frequency moving with his little friction through the world as possible and I need to respect that by giving him worth more more about focus Yamma who cares if he voted for Reagan. What difference does it make did he elect Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan won in two giant landslides what did David Lynch's two votes for Donald Reagan Ronald Reagan in two elections do to make anyone's life worse how much did his films do to make people's lives better which one are you weighing more heavily where is your emotional energy in the real world or in a fantasy realm where you're sorting people into good and bad and then having them fight each other like your your your GI Joes your childhood GI Joes your PO gays Monde folks we have a Cheeto in the white house.

I don't know if you guys are aware of this but there is a god damned it cursed by God himself cursed to live in this world. A human mind embodied physically in the crumbling corn starch and corn syrup creation known as a cheeto a disgusting orange globule sitting in our White House and the people's house itself defiled by cheeto dust cheeto dust. Thus the dust mites the size of frisbees. My god. We'll never get that color out it'll never be the white house again. It will be the orange house. It will always the way that it's only the white house because they burned it down in the war of 1812 and we've rebuilt it with white paint. It's now that it's now going to be the orange house for all of history because the curse of cheeto resides there the cressid orchards cheeto. He defiles my mind. He's a damn cheeto folks and I'm not a fan of him. Those are jury toes by the way you people are putting Doritos in the shed. He is not a Dorito. I think that I think our Latino friends would say that's racist. It's gonna be the orange house. It's the orange house. I'm telling you do you think we need a big grill. A type you know that's what I've been thinking about is that the thing is. That's why I was thinking about Jesse Ventura because I honestly don't know how you can like break up the the kind of ossified ideas around the parties. Anymore I feel like Democrats Bernie needed to run as a Democrat because that's where like the the eyeballs were but like he needed enough people who just are never gonna tune into a democratic a race because they've rightly perceived the Democrats as a scum bag party of capital even if they don't think of it. That way so a third party with somebody who is largely known and charismatic and had the importer of like the left but also a pop culture buy-in to get past people's dislike of politics which is what Trump used by the way cuz Trump remember red is a celebrity. He didn't run as a rich guy. He didn't run as a Republican. He ran as a celebrity and you if you could take that energy that spectacle energy with and feed it into some goddamn like actual left. If political infrastructure and some ideology to like buffer it up into a real boy it could be something damn it. But I don't know if we have anybody like that like even Jesse Ventura honestly isn't like the perfect vehicle but he's better than a lot of the alternatives and now sadly it doesn't look like. We're even gonna get him so once again okay you're on off with the ball the presidential. Because at the end of the day there's nothing you can do at that level anymore.

It's gonna be. This disgusting nightmare display this these two zombies lashed to the mast of the sinking ship. At this point all I want us to baits just give me debates. Please I want to watch the debates I want to get blitzed out of my mind and watch the debates. That's all I want out of this world. Aliens can destroy the earth the day after the debates. I don't care just let me see the dang into debates between these two senescent monsters. Sons debate to please for the love of God give me a sons debate that one seems like it might even happen because the thing is is that if a hunter is in any way under the sway of the party like if if Tom Perez has like a body man on him who's keeping him marked up and doped and you know under surveillance and not in trouble which I gotta hope. They're trying to do because they got to know he's a wild card if he's under control that he was. He's not gonna honestly debate Don Cheney but if he gets wild if he is like off the reservation and he just does a couple bumps or maybe smoke some crack and sees that and he might just on impulse agree to do it. Like let's do it tomorrow and then knowing Don jr. They're like yes do it on periscope or something or take top before the DNC even knows he's doing it. That's the only way it's gonna happen and it's a possibility and boy. I don't know.

I think I've been good enough lately that I want to get it but also if it doesn't happen. But it was not meant to be but somewhere just come for yourself knowing that in some universe the sons debate does happen and it's amazing a cursed cheeto gentleman invading our old White House. The Oval Office orange the resolute desk buried under avalanche orange dust if people aren't gonna be able to get meat this shit's gonna get violent. I think you I mean you know how meat fueled. This country is that deaths got to go somewhere you eat all that death. It's got to go somewhere and if it's like built up and you can't keep murdering with your mouth. You're gonna murder with something else. That's energies got to go all that pent up murder all that pent up aggression. All that pent up social anima. All that organ is gonna have to go somewhere and if we can't eat burgers and chicky chicky fillets and pork rib sliders and oh boy man.

It is gonna be a vast expression of kinetic energy. There's gonna be some kinetic scenarios. I don't know when and I don't know where but. Inlet if people don't get meat there's gonna be kinetic scenarios. I don't think it's gonna get to that point. I think that the Chinese are gonna help synthesize something if brings flows in to maintain America as that needed still and non-replaceable where else you gonna go where else you gonna. Go. You can't impoverish Europe enough to fast enough to make them need all of the extra geegaws that we have to compensate for our alienated labor and everywhere else. You don't have developed enough markets to absorb all of that. We're the only place so they're gonna try to save us and that might move us along a little bit and stop us from having the worst possible outcome.

It's all in our hands. That's why the grilling is for a reason you're honing your katana whatever it may be to go forward into battle when battle is joined and however that might and manifest itself and the thing is right. Now. We're in one of the most liquid moments in history that I could recall experiencing. I think it's got to be number one and so we had a way four points of friction to emerge and I'm waiting with you guys. It's it's an incredibly suspenseful moment. I feel I feel like it just suspended. I feel like I'm in that thing in the remake of Total Recall and they go through the center of the earth and when you go around the middle just what they're floating. I feel like we're in. There we are grilling. We are grilling and chilling you're chilling and grilling compound in Montreal. I'm thinking about a compound one way or the other and I'll say that I don't know if anybody knows any way to secure perimeter and create some sort of self-sustaining mini ecology that can facilitate some like you know fractal level of a more ideal social coordination. Some sort of some sort of Walden 3. That's what I'm thinking of. That's what I want to build walden 3 I'm kidding.

No I don't want to do that a medical leader to get out of there. Kanye is probably everyone's best bet if you can't get in with Kanye or Jared Leto I think you're in trouble. I think with Jared Leto if you're a young woman of a certain size and shape say I think you're probably. Gonna get a better pet with Leto. I think Kanye might be open to a bigger variety of people. You're gonna be able you're gonna have to vibe with them though so I hope you build. I hope you really liked yeezus. I hope you're not just say to your friends that you like Jesus cuz. It's gonna be hard to get in if you don't really really show him your enthusiasm for his work and how brilliant he is every moment Jared Leto's wall castle that would be pretty cool.

Things move so fast on this chat. It's difficult sigh. What is this how would I be would. I be Jesse. Ventura's VP absolutely are you kidding me that would be the most fun thing to ever happen how how could I ever turn that down. I mean that would be a ridiculous choice that it would never happened. But of course I would take that that would be amazing how would I even think twice about it. I could not think of a more perfect vision more perfect symmetry of of like body and action and ability and enthusiasm. I would be embodied fully in that task. Yes I will be Jesse Ventura's VP another green ticket but as I say I don't think that would be a smart move on their part but I would still say yes because I'm sorry it wouldn't really matter one way or the other I might as well have some fun.

How many thousands of pages is my manifest are going to be. I've tried to keep it short throat. No I'mnot there'll be no manifesto I think we're gonna try to write stuff though just to refine ideas like I know I've talked a lot about doing an episode about American Protestantism and sort of how it developed and you know its implications for America's political economy are and I've realized that a good test case to sort of see where at what level of abstraction I can kind of relate this stuff to I'm gonna try to write it out. We're gonna try to actually write it instead of doing extemporaneously the way I've done all the other inebriated pasts. This one I'm gonna try to write out like Mike Duncan or Patrick Lyman style and hopefully. It's good and people find it compelling and if so I'll try probably be trying to write more.

But I don't know yet. What do. I think ubi is inevitable like I said if they decide if there is the will and ability to turn the spigot on the only way that that works is if you see a huge huge. Keynesian fill priming of the pump like there and it can't be through Public Works and stuff like that because we wouldn't know where to put people because all of those arms are dead. All those networks have died isn't it gone necrotic so that means pure dumped into the consumer economy through the through the inflationary vehicle of cash infusion and the thing is is that we've been doing that and that's generally how we but dope that's how we bumped out slowly dumped out of the Great Recession was but it was all at the level of quantitative easing. It was all at the level of direct cash into the marketplace at the highest level which of course then gets captured at every level so that by the time it gets to the consumer. It's a drizzle I mean. It is a trickle down but it is a trickle. It is a little piss stream compared to how much money you're talking about how much actual economic capacity of representing in those transactions. So they could just dump a bunch of money into our economy and get us spending again and that'll make it'll still be tough and it's still. Gonna lead to a lot of unemployment and it's gonna lead to a lot of social disco heejun and like I said I would expect now the violent crime might rise. In this context it might be a lagging indicator but I could see it kind of popping up through the social firmament and obviously also all that bank level direct provision that could like stave off the worst for now and leave us in a situation where you know we're talking about. We could look back on this at ten years and be like that looked like a real that was a close one.

But we made it and then you know if we haven't really changed things. We're actually gonna see the next big drop then but who's we can't know yet I don't know either. It's a mystery. It is mystery. We are all still trapped in the in the wispy firmament of time and space in their eternal dance. Their eternal seductive caduceus like dance of writhing snakes you can't learn if you if coding is something that makes sense to you that would be a very useful skill to use that could like help you live in this world and make the world a better place. I mean like I said I think that we have the capacity with our understanding of computer science now to solve a lot of the computational problems that undergird that challenge the validity or the the feasibility rather of socialist central planning. I mean trying to get past those those signal mistranslations in the economy that would obviate the need for the goddamn cash Nexus in the first place. So you could lobotomize the beast. But it's all has to be through the correct application of computer power and and and sorting and all that stuff. Nothing I understand because I've always hated that end of the Sunda stick I can't get those symbols the symbols of numbers. The symbols representing the material world I can't get it. I'm at a much higher level of abstraction. I have one of the most unbalanced brains in human history.

I'll actually tell you guys something. This is an open truth moment. This is no. I took the GRE which to get into graduate school I was gonna do not with nothing really else to do nothing to know what to do. I decided I would go to history. You know that's a lot of people in that in that questionable moment you know did it sit like okay. We'll go to grad school. So I took the GRE and that's it was divided into a math and a language section right. And it's all percentiles of the people who took it so like if you get so in order percentile. You get that is the high that is the percentage of people who you did better than who took the test and I think I was something like 96 or 97 percentile for the verbal portion which was good enough to get me into a middling graduate program. But I swear to God I was something under I was like 10 percentile for math. It was like 10 or 12 I mean.

I can't I mean I'm just saying this to say that I do not understand numbers. I do not understand numbers in any way and so I don't understand how computers work but it really does feel like we could figure out a lot of these computing problems if people were if more people were doing that than building apps that helped enslave people to gig economy jobs and just destroy existing job systems by by disrupting local regulatory regimes doing something that's actually socially productive. The thing is even if you have to work a real job. You could still work towards that goal just don't don't give up. Too soon don't give up the boat don't give up the ship. My brain is dumb. I have a Brett I have a dumb brain. I know I was I'm just telling you guys. I'm telling you guys. I'm being honest and open. So people don't think. I'm some sort of. Because I I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm being honest with all this stuff and I I'm coming from a position of good faith. Yes my brain is bad. It's like a gummed up. It's like a gunned up.

This pasta strainer that's my right Oh. Dr. John Brinkley I referenced him today. Dr. John Brinkley is a fascinating American huckster. He was a guy who he really was like to Nick Riviera of the American West. He who is a fraudulent doctor because back then it was accreditation for a medical professional was so thin that you can basically write into a crackerjack box to get a thing that can get you paid to be a doctor somewhere which is pretty amazing when you think about it considering how tightly round in everything is now. But so this guy Brinkley with his crackerjack diploma creates a miracle cure for impotence which involves the translation. The surgical implantation of goat testes into the male human gonna del sack that's right a goon a ttle sack and that presumably this is what he would tell the hillbillies and plain folk who came to him yeah. You're gonna get the in you're gonna get them animal power of that goat and it's gonna get you up. Now. This probably had some sort of effect because obviously a lot of the erectile dysfunction is is psychosomatic. So Shirl's number of people. Even after after that healed up they got hard and they were like damn thank you dr. Brinkley but for the most part they would just get you know. Swollen balls a lot of the dive.

But anyway he became incredibly popular for this people came all over the world. He had a you know. He had a place in he had a place in Kansas I'm sorry sorry. He had a place in Kansas and he and he where he was. He would the balls on out of the people in Kansas. I got out I got out you take the balls and he would put them in the sacks of the people and he became incredibly popular and and eventually he got stripped of his ability to do it because people kept dying and it was a wildly you know dangerous thing and then he ran for governor of Kansas and came pretty close. He almost won. It was really like mr. When mr. Burns ran for governor you know because he wanted to stop having to pay taxes I was sort of the same thing he was gonna become. Governor then changed the rules so that he could practice medicine in Kansas again and he came pretty close. But he didn't win and he ended up at a you know. I'm having to go to to northern Mexico because they wouldn't allow him to operate the United States and he built a giant array. A giant radio array that was so powerful that it reached all the way across the continental United States and people as far away as like Oklahoma from the border could hear it in barbed wire and bedsprings and like that's how powerful it was and funnily enough that radio station became the place where the vast were most people in the country. First heard country-western music which was like a regional phenomenon that got national exposure for the first time through his radio station yeah. So there you go.

Dr. John Brinkley he spread culture and also horrible horrible go needle infections by sowing goat testicles into human scrotums. I haven't had that many drinks thank you what are we gonna do with all these goat balls buddy. If I knew I would tell you I'm sure we would all tell each other because that's what the world economy's problem is gonna be pretty. Soon with this huge drop in a dam and in America they're gonna have a bunch of button orders for goat balls and nowhere to put them so that everyone is gonna be wondering where to put the goat balls which is why I think we might get a short-term ubi like a monthly cheque. Just so that we keep buying the goat balls because I think there might just be enough slack left in the system at this point to stop like runaway collapse which I think I don't think anyone at the real top wants because you know. I'm sure they'll be fine with living into their New Zealand bunkers. But I think they would rather be able to go skiing and shod and you know going to. If they're pretentious enough going to you know the Lincoln Center and seeing the the Opera you know yes if you yes. If you've been to Bangkok oh oh the Commodores feast it Lord Falcons. Palace is exquisite. They like that stuff and they don't want it to go away so presumably that will prevent them from allowing just a free fall into oblivion and the only real way they can do that without empowering workers too much which they do not want at all is just dumping money into the system. So yeah I think we might be seeing a short-term ubi in the very near future.

Sometimes you get too excited with the go balls. Alfred Korzybski is a guy that my friend Rob was helping me to today who I think I had heard about. He's actually one of the foundational minds behind neural and linguistic programming. But a lot of his The stuff that he talked about is very similar to what I've been trying to explain so I feel like he's a useful person like if somebody is you know at the right. You know confidence with material if they're trying to figure out what I'm talking about. I think course if he gets a lot of it not all of it. But he gets a good chunk and he should be. I think reading core. Zimsky and Marx I think are very useful. I think that reading or zimsky against Marx could be very useful in making the person doing both understand both of them better. So I would say core zips. Key is an interesting figure that I want to engage with more in the future so shout out to good old Alfred Korzybski oh. It's John Titor.

The guy who claimed that he called he was a time. Traveler is that the guy who said who would write to a to a forum and claim to be from the future and said that like the country was going to collapse wasn't that him yeah that's funny I never read enough of it. But I respect to anybody who would go that deeply into a character that's a great bit and you know what at this point maybe he was real who knows I'm pretty much open to everything I'm kind of thinking time-travel could happen just not the looper type Cherryville or back to the future where like something happens to you in the future here and like your arm getting out. Off that doesn't happen but you could have time travel sure why not as a treat. We could have a little time travel as a treat and we just did. Laundry. I've got plenty of live clean laundry oh my god chef Ganon. That's a blast from the past I guarantee you what purse alright. I'll just do a test no guests no bullshitting just like I'm honestly asking you don't look it up do you know who Jeff Gannon is do.

You does that ring a bell because I gotta believe most of these kids listening to this or watching this who are a guy would believe it. But it's like 20s have no idea Jeff I'm getting nothing nothing what kind of amazing mutant would be on here asking me about Jeff Gannon. How old are you dude. Are you can't be as old as me that seems impossible but there's anyone older than me. On here I feel like the oldest man in twitch history. Oh man Jeff Gannon was a guy who was in the White House press corps during the Bush administration w and he would give these softball questions about how like. Mr. Rumsfeld the truth America loves the troops more than ever how can. They help them express their love to the Troops that kind of thing you know. Gallup polls show that America Bush is actually the smartest person to ever live. How does he feel about being such a vision to everybody people eventually kind of said what is his deal and it turned out that he represented like a fake Mooney website and that he also had a side hustle as a male prostitute in DC specializing in like political figures. There are some people who think that he was actually Johnny Gosch. The Franklin credit ring abducted kid I have no idea if that's true or not. It's a funny. It's certainly an amusing idea. But that's god that's such a blast in the past man just think of you kids think about all the stuff. That's gonna blow your mind when you imagine kid. Kids aren't gonna know anything about including I mean if we make it this far Trump being president. Like the just the absurdity of that. They're not gonna have no actual memory of how are you even gonna communicate it unless we've so far transcended it by then that it won't even be a meaningful thing. But if that's the case I don't think we're gonna be doing anything other than Cormac McCarthy as they I'm glad. Somebody remembers Jeff Gannon I believe his real name was Jeff gukor jour something trilling.

I saw tonight. It's excellent beautiful. Apparently. It's gonna be all stormy tomorrow so probably want to button up but real nice today well that I got to be outside a little bit experience. This backyard happy to have a little patch even though it's basically just a little shack. Here yeah it gives me a little bit of a little Sun. Otherwise I would probably be vitamin D deficient if I'm not already I've had two doctors look at me when it's my shirt off and say okay. I think you need to take vitamin D oh yeah.

The gutter guy that Jeff Gannon guy definitely was like an associate of Roger stone if you know what I mean you know people who associate with Roger stone. Like the people he would solicit in that personal ad with him and his wife looking for hyung studs. But I love it you know he's better than the man afford mana for was a monster. He was awful. He was evil. Pauly it looked like Roger stone was ethical. Pauly this his wife seemed very much into it but he seems like kind of a jerk in other areas. I would not be surprised if Roger stone had go testes who the black eagle trust the black.

Halo Trust is a fun esoteric conspiracy theory. They says that after World War 2 the u.s. Took into its possession a massive amount of gold from the Japanese government or Japanese high officials or something and that it was never declared and it was used as like the basis as a fund for to fund basically every like evil CIA plot that has gone on since World War two to me. It's like fun but it also seems beside the point like they had plenty of ways to get money that didn't involve having to have Japanese gold for one thing. There was the Nazi gold and the other thing is that there was the post-war drug trade which they immediately got their beaks wedded and also there's the black funds that are never accounted for the trillions and trillions of dollars just in the Defense Department. A budget alone that our unreconciled and and I'm reconcilable. It's just never gonna be resolved. It's money that's in a quantum state forever which really does tell you that this idea that we could like run out of money is absurd. Like the money. Just went into the when it went into a black hole. It didn't even disappear. They can't even account for it. That's different. It's like it's like a it's like a it's floating in space. It's it's like it's like a giant. The the Pentagon is like a giant Schrodinger a box filled with like twenty trillion. Schrodinger bucks that both exist and don't exist at the same time. A little bit of clapping I'm not looking at the flyover. No thank you I don't even know where it would be. I'm not near where the thing is flying. I'm way up and I'm in the middle of Brooklyn so I don't think I would even see it so yeah there's plenty of money for them to go around. They don't need China. They don't need Japanese gold. You know it's like who's so pissed.

How does that determine the outcome of events is what I don't understand so but it's fun they're all fun the gemstone files. If anyone knows the gemstone files. Those are hilarious. I got I got into that about how aristotle onassis was like the global got crime kingpin who assassinated everybody in him and Howard Hughes basically ruled the entirety of the post-war Western economy and pulled the strings of everything using heart attack potions and excellent stuff very fun hearing the people like applauding. It's like as long as people know that it's not enough you know as long as people use this moment to remember what their duties are to each other. I think it's good you know and it's like it could be either for everyone and I think people end up fighting because they assume they can only be white one way. But it's you know. It's. It's always a degree of both. So it's worth tending to the good part rather than yelling at the bad part.

Maybe I don't know perhaps perhaps perhaps righteous gemstone files. Nice Virgil's doing okay I talked to him about Rick and Morty I tweeted I texted to him. He gave me. He's apparently a big fan of the new episode. So he's doing all right. He can still appreciate good comedy. He still has the reckless it IQ to appreciate Rick and Morty and all of its intricacies. All right guys. It's been an hour good to talk to you. I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll delve into some more stuff. Maybe I'll have a few stuff prepared too. We'll do a little less freeform. Maybe hide it out. We'll talk. See you guys all right.
