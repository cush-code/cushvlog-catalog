So you have now exited host mode. You have now entered sicko mode that's a song right by travis scott. The rapper I gotta say when I heard there was a rapper. I know this. I know I sound like an old man but when I heard there was a rapper called travis scott. I was like well that's kind of goofy but not having a rap name at all. Okay. I can see that as a power move like there are porn stars for example who use their own names power move like. I don't even need a handle but apparently that isn't his real name. It's an actual rap name and it's just a guy's name that isn't his so this to me. This makes no sense and it definitely tells me that whatever is going on with the youth today. I don't really understand it. Yes yes yes everyone's mad about the empire mug deal with it okay. I'm sorry. I know people are mad about it and it is just literally colonialism in a symbol. But the saint andrews the saint george. It's visually pleasing to me. That's it okay. I'm glad to know that. I'm not the only person who didn't know that that wasn't his real name because come on what the hell and his real name was jacques and he went with travis. I don't understand these kids today man. I don't get it no. I mean like come on you got like yes.

The confederate flag is the symbol. It is because of you know more than anything the failure to reconstruct the south. But it's also popular because it looks good like people put it on boogie boards and and on t-shirts and partially because it looks cool. It definitely looks cooler than the american flag was it stupid asymmetry and a big blob of stars in one corner sloppy and the confederate flag. As some people might know is not these stars and bars. These stars and bars is the confederate. The the the flag of the nation of the confederate states of america which is a three star three bars and some stars on one side and it's just sort of like a a a homunculus version of the american flag. Nobody waves that ever you ever seen anybody wave that nobody's interested in that saint andrew's cross. It's the symmetry the stars sweeping across all axes. It looks better. It was a design victory same thing with the swastika. Swastika was a was a good design.

No I the thing someone asked about passatism. I mean it's not a tendency. It's a coping mechanism. It's a it's a bit and there's nothing wrong with having a bit. It's just your. Shouldn't take over your life unless you're jacob wall unless you have that ability don't let your bit take over your life. Otherwise you end up falling into the abyss.

The most boring conspiracy theory is like. I said the last one the moon landing boring boring and apparently impossible like they shot the thing on 30 frames per second which would have made it impossible to do the things that he they did to make it look like they made. It look in terms of because of the atmosphere difference with a 30 frame per second camera so they would have had to invent something and then keep it hidden for 30 years and also what so that they can win a win a headline war with the soviet union come on. I mean. The soviet union got a man in space first and a a satellite in space first did. They win the cold war because of that and moon landing stuff. It gets folded into flat earth too much too which to my mind is like the er dummy expression of like lump and alienation in this country. Like and apparently there's a really good youtube video that connects flat earth to the queue and I think and I do want to watch it. I haven't seen it yet but I will be watching it and yeah. I know flat earth is the basis for all.

This like antivirus is all. It's like. It's. It's a fundamental like unifying concept of life or of like life on earth. As it is understood. You know when we talk about human understanding and because it is not in front of you deciding that everything is made up that you have to you have to be a certain kind of dummy to have that kind of response to the real alienations of life. I don't blame you. I guess you can't really control being a dummy but it is exclusively the domain of dummies they're willing to just decide that everything they see is a fantasy because one thing they see doesn't correspond to something that requires very little in terms of scientific understanding or knowledge to get the notion of a of the earth being a round spheroid thingy. But the problem is you can't see it with your naked eyes. You have to trust science and people don't trust anything. They're wildly wildly alienated from every mechanism that they depend on but they still live within it and so they have to create narratives to explain this and one of the ones that have been used is no no the earth is fl isn't flat. It's the worth is flat because it looks flat to me because anything that requires an explanation beyond that is done by those people like. I was talking about like the media like science science who are on the other team who are who are part of the conspiracy to keep me from realizing life as it should be lived because you can't imagine collab cooperating with people to make the world a better place. No you need to just confront the people who are secretly preventing it from happening through through manufactured reality. When in truth the manufactured reality that's making your life miserable is things like private property things like value how about that.

But they don't have any investment in these institutions in science in in math. Because what they went to school they got a half-assed barely barely. Their education that basically provides no real grounding in why anything happens like you go to school for the most part and maybe that's changing but certainly when I went to school you learn discrete facts. They are not embedded into like a greater web of understanding so you don't even know why you believe them. You just know that you're supposed to and for most people that's supposed to that authority. It's enough. But if you have a specific alienation from maybe like your brain doesn't work in a way that allows you to abstract yourself to the required demands of science. But even beyond that you were never even engaged because we just tell people like you're supposed to believe that there is a viral tweet a viral video a few weeks ago. Some young woman going.

I don't think math is real because how would you do that how would you how would you go from nothing to like algebra or like calculus or something like that. How can you go from nothing to an iphone like how can you get that complexity out of the simplicity of like just numbers being added up and the thing is there's an answer to that. But nobody ever gets it in school. You get nothing you just get thrown this. Thrown at you all because it's supposed to let make you function in the world and then you get out into the world and you're not being able to function at all. It doesn't help at all. It doesn't provide you with a map of meaning anywhere so why should you believe the specific claims why should you accept any of it and I'm saying just that it's the domain of dummies because even if you're alienated from education like I wasn't like most people are you are able to get certain concepts enough that you don't need to have authority stand in for the understanding of them like you can even with the haphazard public education or you know scam ass private education. We get we're able to connect these concepts to a chain of reasoning that maybe doesn't go down to like the basis of it but goes close enough to get us past just because they told you so. But some people don't have that they can't do it or their education didn't provide them even with enough of a context to make the leap and there they respond by going yeah.

No earth's flat earth is. Jehovah's witness as a geology teacher in public high school. He believed that I believe he one time he told us that that jfk was killed by demons and the proof of that was that there was apparently a big ufo flap in texas right before the assassination which according to him and according to his cosmology men. It was demons because that's what ufos are and he was my geology teacher and so but our only answer our. Only answer to this horror is to ridicule people because no one can do the work and no one can no one most more importantly. Nobody can get a buy-in of trust because everyone is trying to sell you something so nobody trusts anybody except you make some like emotional connection. Like you see trump and trump is so much like you in a certain way that you invest him with like total trust because how could you not trust him. He's clearly authentically you in a meaningful way you recognize something in trump that is in you. That is so deep that it means that you have to trust whatever he says because it's basically you talking and so then they use that as the as the anchor and then they can figure out what why everyone else is lying to them which they have to be. And that's where and that's what they're like.

And that's why they'll never be convinced. Global warming. It'll get colder soon watch me trust me. What does he say about coronavirus one day it'll be gone. It'll be over. It'll be like magic.

I also had I also had a history teacher who looked just like a grown-up ralph wiggum like shaped exactly the same and the same barcode haircut and he in science and the thing is at the time. I was kind of like not really paying attention. I didn't really. I wasn't very engaged with with this with school. I mean like. I wanted to get good grades but like history class was not hard for me that's the kind of thing like yeah. No.

I just read the thing and I tell you what you want to hear and this guy showed a lot of movies and now looking back on it with only a few years. I was able to realize later. I was like oh this guy was propagandizing us and not like on a even on a political level. At a religious level. He showed us ben hur and then he showed us something that was very weird. It was a video of a guy dressed up like a lederhosen marching around in the alps looking at art explaining how the roman empire fell because they had a finite world view and later I found out I'm reading rick pearlstein actually He described this series of books by this. This series of films by this guy francis schaefer who was like one of the these seminal figures in creating the modern political evangelical. Protestant movement in this country had this series of it of films that were hugely successful and shown all over america in I think theaters and also on television and reading the description. I was like oh. He was showing us that history class and I had the classic in a history class a different history class.

I had a different year. I had the classic situation where the history teacher was the football coach and we just watched a lot of movies like we watched the grapes of wrath watched sergeant york. No lincoln's death was not an inside job shut up. It wasn't edward stanton. That's so stupid there's no proof of it. I don't get when people yell the same questions over and over again. I understand you're trying to get me to see it but man it makes me feel like people are having a nervous breakdown. There is a theory that it was the jesuits that was a popular nativist anti-catholic feeling in the in the during the gilded age. It is amazing how anti-catholic sentiment anti-catholic political sentiment in this country is almost identical to islamophobia. I'm dappled right. Now. It's nice though because it's it's getting crispy. So not even the sun is bothering me the way it used to. It's fall man. It's fall in september oh. I feel so blessed too bad about the second the other half of the country.

 I i send my sympathies to them but sorry hashtag couldn't be me. Okay. Somebody asked about ego death and I realize I've actually never talked about that on the stream before. I definitely have experienced ego death. One time that was not the time that like was early in quarantine where I had my satori moment that like realigned my spiritual axes that was much milder that was really just like an intellectual epiphany. A moment this was earlier and I and and it was less powerful for me because I didn't really know what was happening at the time or even after for a long time. So I couldn't really contextualize it. It was just insanely weird and and and I i just didn't know. My brain could do that and what happened was is that for worst of all it's ha started with.

At that point. My experience with psychedelics was such that I re I had sort of come to terms with the idea that the cartoon version of getting of dropping acid or doing mushrooms that you see in media where you see like things turn into other things and you have apparitions of things that aren't actually there. I had kind of come to the realization oh that's probably just made up like in reality. It's just sort of a sense. It's it's like a just a sensitivity more than anything and like sometimes that bleeds over into like seeing symbols and movements and stuff. But it's not transportive that way. First thing that happened was that I had a cartoon hallucinations. As in someone I was talking to their head. They looked like a bird like the head was like a a cartoon drawn bird.

I'm like oh snap at one point like black things are coming out of my fingers and tendrils and I see I see a room. I see into a room and it looks like a dollhouse room like. I'm in hereditary like actual intense hallucinatory stuff and then over time What happened is like the hallucination took over my sight to the point that like I wasn't even really seeing anything in front of my eyes at all. I was just seeing patterns and lights and then I just felt the sensation of falling. I was not not not scared at all because I was like lying on my back so. I just felt like I was being pulled down but not falling like it was. It was at no point was I scared it. I actually just kind of felt like this expansion and then the lights took over and that's where the ego dies in the sense that there is no more remembering it. You know what I mean like it is just a spot. It's like a warm glow because I remember this precise moment before I got to it. When like the light overtook me and of course I remember coming back from it. But like there's that space that is it's eternity. It's it's that background radiation of unity and and eternal oneness that we are all just a few degrees away from perceiving at any given moment. But the craziest part is that coming back took me a long time so like. I came into consciousness but it came it was back to just being me conscious of shapes and colors and not really even feeling like. I had a body or that. I was seeing anything and slowly the room took it resolution but my body was not did not like have an end point. I was on a couch and at one point I felt that I wanted to move my arm and in the process of moving my arm. I had to come back to being aware that my couch was separate from or the couch was separate from my arm. Like. I had to pull the arm off not in a sense that like I could see but that I could feel at a level of like of of of convincingness like it felt that way it felt like. I was re-territorializing my arm away from the couch because previously they had been one thing and so that's that's what that was. I had to separate my arm from the couch and then slowly over more time. More things took definition and separation and at the time it was just sort of like holy crap well.

That's ego death. But I didn't really know much more about. It didn't have like a lingering spiritual thing. Like this did happen. Later. It's because. I didn't know what I was experiencing and now. I feel like. I actually do get what I was experiencing. I was getting to that point. I was getting to that awareness that point of awareness whereby you are no longer recognizing distinctions in time and space and therefore are in an eternal space. I.e nirvana heaven whatever you want to call it. I don't know there's the the words you're trying to get are always going to be clumsy translations that are you first need to make sense to yourself and then you have to tell them to other people. They have different definitions. It's it's it's ineffable. It's as inexplicable. It is you can't describe it any more than you can just you can't describe it to yourself. You sure as hell can't describe it to someone else because the things you use to describe it cannot be applied because that requires distinctions and there are no distinctions and that if that's reality and this is all sort of a refracted illusion created by you know our species over development of our sensory apparatus. Then we can detach ourselves from the fear of separateness and the fear of of attack against us as an indi as a distinct element because we know or at least we can feel that we are not distinct. I mean we still have to live our lives but we can live in a way that is not always being tacked towards a selfish craving of pleasure and a terrified repulsion at the idea of pain to protect a thing that is essentially illusory to protect.

It's like a rampart around an empty keep. It's like the dark tower you get inside. There you just keep going up there. Nobody in there and you open the door and then you're back pursuing the man in black across the desert. But maybe this time you've got the horn of eld so yeah. That's what the feeling was and now like. I was only able to come and at 40 it feels like. I took way too long to get there to a moment of like basic peace with my place in the universe and but part of me is annoyed with myself for taking so long. But the other part of me is able to recognize that everything that came before me made it possible and in fact made it inevitable and that nothing I could have changed there's nothing I could have changed at every step. My my actions were determined and they led me here which makes me fortunate and that experience was one of them like if I hadn't had that experience it would have been much harder to hold on to the feeling. I got that second time because holding on to it is the only thing that matters if you. If you feel it you can't stay there and you it's hard to get back there. Like you can't do a yo-yo thing of well just keep pressing the button because then you'll dissolve. You won't be able to function and you won't be able to fulfill your. You know your moral duty to your fellow human beings in the same situation.

All right. No. I'm not 40. I was just trying. I was using it for a nice round effect. No. I'm I'm I'm an oregon trail millennial.

Oh god dershowitz has a podcast. I cannot wait cannot wait for that one thirst cast dersh who are your guys mark dutrow jeffrey epstein the bravant killers silvio berlusconi. Oh we're not getting a joe rogan. We're barely getting an actual debate. We're sure as hell not going to get an awesome ass. Joe rogan debate where they're tuned up in the in the garage not gonna not gonna happen not going to happen. I'm afraid sadly sarah. Palin's moment has passed she sold her. She sold her heritage. She she sold her birthright for a for a instagram tummy tea endorsement. Palin is obviously a precursor.

She's an important person in like the evolution of the political moment. But she was too much like trump sort of like she was. She was early which means she needed to have like had some sort of preternatural instincts to prolong that and make and make hay of it. But because she was as dumb as the moment called for someone to be completely transparent and to appeal to people on that transparency like that authenticity like the stupidity becoming authenticity for certain people and then and then also you know the media part or like the the the spectacle part of it and like turning the whole thing into a into a tv show um. But she was so authentically in the moment that she couldn't make the most of it and so she has to be sort of a precursor figure. She's going to have to just sit out there as like oh yeah. No she missed her moment but but you know it couldn't have been any other way for her. She was never gonna make it make it real. It was always gonna be somebody after her hell until trump won. I thought it was gonna have to be somebody after trump and I was like oh no we're here now. We're here now and thanks to thanks in big part to palin yeah. She's john the baptist exactly.

I was just going to say that there are no somebody's ask who the who should be the next saturday night live movie from a from a recurring character. Snl. Guys swear to god snl. Really doesn't even have recurring characters anymore. It has recurring premises like the old days when snl had you know your your wacky characters your your your built your Wayne's worlds. Your church ladies your rob. The copier guys some of which became movies. Your ladies men that was an amazing one can't believe. They did that but current snl doesn't really have those there are a few of them but like they make no impact and nobody likes them and they're not nobody woos when they see them which is the mark of a recurring sketch is when the character comes in everyone's excited because they like the character they don't do that anymore mostly what they do is. They recycle premises where they take the exact same structure the same premise of the bit and then they just slightly reword the jokes which is sort of what they would do with recurring characters. But at least there was the fact that the character was so popular and so charismatic in some way that them interacting in slightly different situations produced novelty. There is no spark it's just the same thing. It's just a mildly pre-chewed cud hunk after going through the multiple chambers of lauren michael's ruminant stomach so there's nothing they could even do yeah like black jeopardy stuff like that like there's no recurring character. There. It's just a recurring premise. It's it. I have to say it's one of those deals where yes yes that was never really good and it's always presented you know in sort of a hysterical way to to to say that snl is only getting worse. I must say that in recent years it has gotten worse in appreciable ways and that's one of them you know you could talk about how how cringe and lame those old recurring characters were and they were At least people are happy to see somebody you know nobody's nobody's happy to see anybody on that stage. Now oh man thankfully they're not doing zoom snl anymore. They're apparently going to come back to the studio although I bet they won't have a live audience but honestly. I'll take that over what if they have a laugh track that'd be funny. The zoom snl. Was so terrible and it really shows like there has to be a limit to hyper normalization. It's called saturday night live. You don't get to just have a bunch of zoom calls stitching together and say it's saturday night live and try to act like. This is normal. No just get just cancel it until you can make it again or cancel it. All together take it as a sign from god and wrap. It up don't just adulterate it into nothing kyle.

Mooney is okay. I guess he's supposed to be the good one there. But I'm not even a huge fan of his stuff. It seems very one note. It's like him doing a flat impression. A very good impression of an affectless teenager. But I don't it's not even a character you know. It's like wayne was a character wayne was yeah. This is like a party guy in. In suburban chicago is like and kyle mooney's deal is basically. This is what a flat affect californian like person guy is like a young a young millennial youth from the west coast where they don't have affect where they don't have personality But he doesn't have a real name and if he does. I don't know what it is. It's just. It's not great and of course michael che and colin jost just some of the worst ever hosts or a weekend update guys yeah.

The forced hysterectomies. That's that's terrifying that's monster monstrous It's the kind of stuff like a lot of the things. Recently there are things that you sort of have in the back of your throat. You kind of know are happening. You know are real. You assume are happening but you don't know so you can kind of comfort yourself with that ambiguity and then they just snap into reality. It's like no the monster is really under the bed.

Like this is really happening. We're we're doing this and there's no there's no thing that looks like it's going to come close to stopping it and that's and that's the really nauseating part and I do wonder though if people really think like they're the biden people. The people who think biden is the moral required choice for every american because of because of the danger of trump and how this kind of thing is the moral imperative to vote for him do. They really think that there's any meaningful thing that biden's going to do to change that like do they think they're going to dismantle this network of of of concentration camps overnight and just release everybody do. They think that that's possible. I guess. It's similar to thinking do you think donald. Trump's really gonna put the trucks the tanks down fifth avenue and arrest all the sickos and hang them from a yard arm. It's impossible but like everything is a fantasy. Now so of course. We can believe in fantasies even more easily because we've ceased to ground politics at all well anyway that's an mp. That's not an mp that's a yp.

I really love not having to care about the race. I really love having to argue up with people about whether it's my moral duty to vote for biden. I love not having that argument again none of it. No one has any control over this process. Your your vote is is a neurotic fetish object. You're basically frautaging your vote to give yourself a sense of agency to assuage the anxiety of feeling like we're. And so they have to fixate on it and so they want to fight about whether who should I vote for oh my precious vote my one vote who gives a and you're not coordinating it with anybody. I saw someone this blew my mind someone was I saw someone on twitter. Say voting is not an individual moral choice. It's a collective action and I'm like no it is not. It is maybe this is a it is a action that a collective of people pursue but they pursue it. Individually. There is no coordination that's what we do instead of having direct democracy. Is we all just say I or nay and that's independent of one another. We can try to do stuff like outreach to one another but that is all secondary. None of that is able to actually influence it to the level where you can pursue coordinated activities and so that means your individual joy is that it's just that.

It's one of literally a hundred million of them thousands of which just get dropped into a toilet and that thing is is that doesn't mean you shouldn't vote voting. There's other reasons to vote like hey maybe my participation in this election could be tactically or strategically useful then. Now you can actually make an argument make a decision from there about who to vote for but you have to like ping that antenna first you can't start. There's no reason to start from. I'm morally obligated. No you're not maybe. You are strategically and tactically modified motivated and if that's the case do it but you need to examine it through that lens and then that has to and then the answer has to be stripped of that emotional energy because you're you're stripping it down to size. I am voting I'm participating in this election for this reason. But it's not the whole sum of my political identity. It is not the decision that I will take this day to direct politics to feel like I'm participating in politics. No it's going to be like the third or fourth most important thing.

I do that day or that week you know union meetings or organizing knocking on doors. That's that's and that's what follows from stripping it of that emotional power because then you either you have a real choice to make am I fetishizing the vote because there's truly no other thing to do and that this is all. I can do is hold on to this vote or does it keep get me off the hook from having to really do anything that I don't want to do anyway like oh arguing about voting online and then voting. I love doing those things like those like libs like to say hey. It's one day why can't you take time out to do it. It's like exactly. It's one day how about how powerful how important could it really be. It's one day hey you should be doing it every day and part of people are going to be like yeah. But I don't want to do it and like. I have said totally understandable but you have to ask that question and then you have to be honest with yourself and then you'll decide what level of political activism is required of you now. But it flows from answering that question and then you have to cast out the vital of the electorate you have to or you have to you have to cast the spirit the spook out of voting and see it clearly for what it is. What when it should be participated in and on what terms that's why I'm saying don't be electoral. I think electoralism is very important to organize around and there are specific races and specific times that there is coordinated enough activity to merit your vote being a thing to infuse time with considering or trying to you know extend. But if the vote is if the vote is just this if it's just this act then you're going to have to do something or decide. I don't really want to do anything. I'm going to just game and you know what that's better for everybody because then you'll leave us the alone and there's one less person you happen to yap yapping in people's ear and making it harder for them to hear themselves.

I think the belden program is the answer and it is very funny when I saw someone say lol the belden program. It just looks like. It's orthodox marxism yes correct that's the whole thing that is why. I backed brace in his in his pursuit of absolute dictatorship over the left because he's the only one of the few people. I see out there who's got a consistently or like campism and arguing the finer points of america's empire vis-a-vis like emerging like multi-polar world like spending all time on that because because brace recognizes that the foundation the only question now is numbers. That's the only question now and he gets that which I don't see many other people. Other people really seem to be thinking like yeah yeah numbers but what if they're what if their nazis are what if they're pmc.

Or what if this alienates these people it's like that will sort itself out and I'm not saying that that provides a necessary tactical way forward. It just means that you cannot start from the premise of of separating sheep from goats. You have to get the widest possible net whatever that means. I don't know. But it only comes from accepting that as a premise which not many people have done grace has done it so. I will. I will happily I will be his I don't know I'm trying to think of who which of the old bolsheviks I would like to be. I saved I've said trotsky before but. I don't know that. I don't really want to know if. I want to end up that way maybe felix jerzinski the the angel the the blessed true believing angel of death at the checker. The guy who cried over every list of executions he had to authorize you said about the czech. He said you know the only people who who do this work are angels or devils and they've and the angels of dal departed do the random. Humanities. Grad students on twitter who call the belden program fascists have a point 

I mean the point they have is that they want to protect their little racket. The point they have is that they are terrified of anything that removes the gatekeeping power that they have accrued to themselves even if it be pathetic and it is pathetic. It is still it is a you know they they bind themselves in a nut and count them cells king of infinite bodies in spaces and they don't want to lose that position. So all that stuff is just. It's just gentlemen. We got to protect our phony bologna jobs or niches or whatever pathetic little dunghill they've piled up for themselves on the scrounging for clout on the internet let the body face the floor let the body space. The floor let the body space the floor.

I I don't know if the building program honestly even is yet but I'm sure that brace is in the process of of bringing it together. I hon. I honestly assume it will be collaborative to some extent as it must be because you know we're all tacking back towards each other after spending years being thrown apart. But I i have a of all of all the contenders for the crown of like of a lord protector of the left. I I i have my most faith in him yeah. I think what's going to happen is is that you know if we do get there if we are able to like break out of the structures. We've we've fixated and like crack open this. This hardened artifice of like discourse discourse enchanted hysterics on all sides. Some people are gonna be pushed into becoming what people always accuse them of being which is You know right wingers. They'll they'll like form the tucker carlson branch of the new republican party for sure they'll be in there. That's inevitable that doesn't mean that's not necessarily bad though because those people were breaking towards where they always wanted to be similarly a lot of people who now are imagined to be of the most left in radical persuasion. Possible will absolutely crack off and go back to peddling peddling wokeness within the democratic party and specifically within the neo-liberal wing of the democratic party.

That's also inevitable and that's fine and both of them will say no. I didn't leave the left the left left me. But it's like no. We yeah they left you behind because you are remnants of a of a it is a snake shedding its skin as it moves off of the online space that it needed to create a sense of self and needed to create like a vocabulary of action praxis if you will that could be then replicated elsewhere. But then it has to be shed. It becomes more a hindrance than a hade and I'm not saying that it will necessarily happen but if anything good is going to happen it will happen on those terms. No you're going to lose some people.

But I don't think in the context that I'm imagining where you actually are able to to to make the notion of left unity a reality in a way that is threatening to establish relationships and like will require repositioning at a fundamental level. People like backing down and admitting they're wrong on significant stuff that the people who for whom that's a deal breaker were never really yours to begin with they were people who just wanted an argument and the thing that's going to shake them off is going to be the infusion of new people who will have no time for their and that will render them less They will get less enjoyment out of it that their identities is only on the left will mean less to them and they will be able to reorient themselves towards another identity that is more satisfying. But the thing that's going to challenge them is going to be new people and they will be ideally swamped because they were in a sense not in the sense that they often think of themselves a hindrance. But this is of course all contingent on a new current emerging and finding real grassroot connection and that is a big. If I'm just saying it's the only thing worth working towards.

I don't know man october surprise isn't it just been nothing but october surprises now. I mean. I think we're so we're so serotonined out. At this point. We're so fried spectacle-wise that how do you even have how is anyone gonna even notice if there's an october surprise. How would it be distinguished from anything else happening in a week same reason al qaeda isn't. It hasn't been a terror attacking us for about a decade. Why would you how would anyone distinguish that trump is hilariously trying to do it with the vaccine thing which is just so funny.

But it's so transparent like. I said this isn't going to work the way he wants it to because nobody even people who like him trust him on stuff. Like this they're like they might trust his gut. They might trust that he is one of them but they actually know that he lies all the time and like that he lies all the time because it owns the lips which is what he needs to do. He lies for a purpose he lies virtuously and and also to and and also sadistically which is one of their virtues. It makes other people unhappy.

They love that they love it. They love it folks. Do. We love it but that means that when he says something like hey we're going to have a vaccine. By the end of the like. They're already like yeah sure buddy. But that means that people are on. The fence also aren't going to believe them and so it's not even going to get those like wavers or like you know what trump tells it like it is. But they know on stuff like that no he doesn't but who knows if he tries if he pulls out some like sugar water and they start doing like fake vaccination pilot programs. I will it's just. I will give the have to tip the cap just for the sheer brazenness of it. That's like jacob wall at the presidential level well. The late deciders are going to determine it which is hilarious.

I know that there's a meme on the left that this is going to be a low turnout election because of how little enthusiasm there is for biden and that might be the case but it would go against the trend of elections since 2016. All of the races we've had almost or a large number of them especially lately even at low levels. Even like state state. Race levels are seeing participation far in excess of 2016 and that would imply that people are more likely to vote even with covet because a lot of these have happened since kovid. A lot of these primaries and elections have happened since covet. Then there's probably if that trend is is stable and it seems to be more likely that we'll have a high turnout and I would say if that happens then biden will win and win maybe even on the night in a way that cannot be jimmied and trump will sulk and and maybe make a a play for staying in power but will be forced to the exits because the more people vote. The fewer of them are people who have had their brains just like acculturated into like cottage cheese by the reigning cultural narrative that has dominated the experience of living in this country for the past four years while everything has gotten drastically horrifically worse materially and so if you're if you're coming in to vote. It's probably because because things are really shitty and the president's in charge and maybe if there's a different president it won't be a shitty which is a naive thing to think at this late date in american history. But it's the only reason most people get out in the vote is that they've deluded themselves at some level through either ignorance or through self-hypnosis that it's not too late and that actually these elections have consequences and then you are going to come and you're going to vote for biden.

No matter how much he seems out to lunch no matter how much he's a goo. He's a goof eye somebody says they saw richard jules and they don't know why it's good well. We're recording the episode on thursday. We'll you'll find out. Then. It's a great movie. People are gonna be mad at us probably for talking about it especially now with everything else going on but It's the only piece of artwork really a vets like budget or anything that that or profile that I can think of that is actually correctly identifies the dynamic at play within the burgeoning and met or ever widening cultural chasm between college educated and non-college educated whites specifically white men. It's the background radiation of so much cultural hysteria and no one really gets it. They can't even explain it to themselves. They can't express it in art and this thing got it better than anything. I've seen and that's what we're going to talk about on thursday richard jewell. I did see sully I honestly after. I saw richard jewell.

I kind of look back at all of his weird sort of lazy. Not very good movies. He's made over the past decade we're just cranking them out. Most of them are not that good I now kind of see them as all sort of taking a stab at the same material and just until now he hasn't really been able to nail it and this is really the that's the home run similar in my mind to the way that mother is the home run at the end of darren aronofsky's at bat where all of his movies looking back on and the good ones and the bad ones and there are some really good ones in there. I think the the the fountain is underrated in imo but mother is just the perfect connection. Everything comes together and he expresses what he's been trying to express with the closest clarity that you can imagine so. I love that movie. I need to watch it again and I think that richard jewell is similar for what eastwood's been trying to do for the last decade. I think he's kind of trying to do the same thing in american sniper but he just botches it. He's just too suffused with propaganda wrestler was good. I like black swan. I know it's very hysterical and cringy but I that's part of what I like about.

It is how it's got like. That's one of the strands that he pulls for mother is that is that hi that grand guillain un ironic sense of hysteria that most directors are too self-aware to put in their work because they don't want to get laughed at and mother is super masturbatory but I still love it. It's among many other things. It's about art which is masturbation right if all of his movies are masturbatory. Then this one by virtue of being the most masturbatory is the most perfect distillation of his artistic output. Now if you don't like that if you say yeah but he's bad all right we're on a different wavelength and a tip of the cap. But I think if you like anything he's putting out. If you enjoy any of the vibe that arnosky puts out there. Mother to me has to be recognized as just a perfect distillation yes clint eastwood or I'm sorry richard jewell is clint eastwood's mother. I liked under the silver lake a lot. I thought it paired very well with once upon a time in hollywood. That's about the way that we were sort of captive to to the shadows that dance. Upon the screen yeah 2019's I think jesse hawkins on twitter said this yesterday you look back at 2019 that might have been like the swan song for film. You know it was a strong year and and a lot of the movies were about you know sort of the majesty of the art form like once upon a time in hollywood.

And it's just the sign of maybe. It's time to wrap it up. Not. We're not getting rid of narrative like we're not getting rid of you know light and sound and all that it's just moving to the television. It's just all gonna be tv even if it's 90 minutes or even if it's two and a half hours. It's still tv. It's tv. It's all tv and tv is not as good. It just isn't so we're gonna be basically bidding away bidding adieu to an art form which it's not like it hasn't happened before you know. There are plenty of extinct art forms or at the very least like you know exist only as as niche sub subcultures like how many people like to sit in a den and look at stereophonic photographs of of national monuments. Movies are not just big tv god damn it and that'll be some fine tv and then the tv will eventually be dissolved into social media which will replace even that narrative form. Eventually there will be no narrative art forms to speak of it will be pure social media. We will just be looking at each other that will be entertainment it will and there will be no need for narrative architecture of any kind we're just. Gonna be shedding art forms as we go and it just turns into parasocial relationships yeah. The only art form will be my my bloggings all right Maybe one question oh man everyone's mad about the mug. I'm very sorry.

 someone asked about aliens ufos. I would say more likely interdimensional than interstellar because I think we could have a ton and ton ton of life out there. But there's no reason to assume that there's even a way to get to a societal complexity level to allow for interstellar travel that or like kim stanley robinson suggested um. Maybe a society gets complex enough to do that they wouldn't need to because they would have figured out how to make the planet they're on good enough and they wouldn't need to go and try to conquer the unconquerable distances because they would be able to be be able to accept this and not always be thinking with that american mentality. That free real estate mentality that somewhere we can offload all of this pain by finding a new frontier that's a delusion and you'll you will burn out seeking it. If you stay a society that is able to check its horrors check. It's. It's it's exploitation before it throws homeostasis completely off and and destroys the ability to reproduce socially because because the relationship between the humanity the species and the planet and if you did that then if you got to that point it would never occur to you to even try to do that why would you have to maybe as a lark you might put some you know guys on mars for science. But you wouldn't direct your energies that way so that's another explanation.

 but maybe I think if their technology exists to breach one of those things. I think the technology is closer in my mind anyway to potentially pop through space. I'm sorry. It seems to me that the technological requirements to pass from one dimension to another are theoretic. I don't know I'm all. This is all just me pulling out of my ass. This is all just hunches. I have no real understanding of science. It just seems to me to me like. It's. It's more possible than getting something that can go that far in any kind of meaning time scale that we could conceive of it would would be relevant so if they are there. I think they're there because they can move between the raindrops like that's. That's what a lot of people about skinwalker ranch seem to think like like that experience. There it feels more like kind of a place where there's just a thin membrane for one reason or another induced or natural where where like there's just passing between is is almost. It's not even an in net intentional. It can happen accidentally a thinny in the terms of stephen king's dark tower universe and if that happens like just through nature presumably it could also happen through technological intervention. The venus is interesting but I mean it also suggested maybe we could have a lot of life in the universe but very specific situations have to occur to allow for life to develop to our level of sapience. I mean it you could argue it could be very well argued that it is a evolutionary long-term maladaptation and that most the vast vast vast vast vast vast majority of species aren't going to get to that point no matter where they are would. I have sex with the venus microbes well. That's just silly of course close encounter of the 69th kind. All right. I'm peacing out bye-bye.
