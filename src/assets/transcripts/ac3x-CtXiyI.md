Foreign of the Moon foreign needs to be at the old spot by the river quite well known to you and me one more word for Signal token whistle out the marching tune with your Pike upon your shoulder at the rise and now the moon the rising of the Moon the rising of the Moon. The Pikes must be together at the rising of the Moon foreign for the delay guys. I know it's been a minute but been on tour. So today we're gonna finish. The book get it over with I'm gonna do the last chapter and also the uh hilariously downbeat and shruggy shrug Emoji uh conclusion which I honestly give tons of credit to lochman for doing uh book if you've forgotten by now first class passengers on a sinking ship by Richard latram. The last chapter here we're actually probably not going to talk about too much because it covers a lot of the same.

Uh a lot of the same uh territory that was covered in the Grand and pantage book that we we just did making of uh global capitalism. In fact uh. They're probably the most frequent citation in the chapter so no reason to go over it too much. It's basically just describing uh the chapter by the way is called the American economy colon. Financial cannibalization so you kind of get the point uh. It describes the post 70s post Nixon really world where uh we get this final financialization of the world economy uh because in large part uh Finance is able to break free of the Fetters that the New Deal state had created around it because of its propensity towards uh conglomeration and in conglomeration its ability to overrun all regulatory structures and then to finally and completely capture uh the American political system not for capitalism at large because that's latchman's big thesis is that you can't think of the ruling class as one group but rather on behalf of the specific interests of Wall Street financiers because uh as Latchman points out. Uh Financial Capital was not always in the driver's seat in the American political system.

Uh after the Great Depression during the New Deal era. Certainly during World War II Finance was discredited largely and and also largely politically disempowered industry on the other hand. Industrial Capital uh held the whip hand in American politics of course.

Not alone it had to negotiate with labor but we know how that happened. We've told that story a million times uh and at the end of that at the end of the exhaustion of industrial Capital that comes with the great oil shocks and uh and trade rebalances of the 70s who's left but Finance Capital to grab the whole thing and bend it and it's towards its uh will which is the will of stripping four parts everything not creating a um a productive like an engine of increased productivity and Innovation which is the fantasy of American capitalism but rather to cannibalize the existing American economy. I think people have often said that the term uh late capitalism is sort of a pretentious non-concept but to me if it has meaning that meaning is you are if you're describing late capitalism you're describing capitalism that has ceased to form a progressive historical function and is in a state of uh terminal cannibalistic self-destruction which is what you get uh since from the 70s till now foreign so like I said we won't really get too much into the chapter.

We all know the story uh but there are a few specific elements of it that Latchman points out that are kind of interesting and that I hadn't really seen a reference in that specific way. Uh one big thing he talks about is the process in the 70s whereby these uh or in the 80s whereby this newly Unleashed Finance capitalism creates this new uh system where firms which had been uh focused in specific. Industries are now flush with so much  money and so little and not not profits because profits at this point are still uh in crisis. Uh but rather uh credit and being a wash and credit are able to buy up smaller companies in other Industries and become. Diversified conglomerates like that is the mind that's the idea in the 80s 70s and 80s is to create. Diversified conglomerates that have a bunch of different businesses in a bunch of different Industries but of course that sort of lack of specialization leads to a lack of accountability at the top because there's no one person who knows all these businesses and so being able to get them to work together and to increase reduce. Redundant activity is undermined and so by the mid 80s a lot of these companies are sort of groaning uh under their uh inefficiencies and because of the specific uh incentives of the market are undervalued like the the one of the big uh. Revolutions of this era is that you go to a system of self-reporting where all of these industries and all of these companies are left to their own devices to report their profits. Uh their Pro. Their uh their incomes their their good and and to essentially game them uh toward with the eye of keeping the stock price. High and what this does in the 80s is it creates a situation where a bunch of these conglomerates are on are pegged by their own uh boards uh at being worth less than the com.


The composite parts of them would be and so this creates the big leveraged buyout craze if anybody remembers Wall Street other people's money with Danny DeVito. This was the greatest good go go 80s. Junk bonds Michael Milken thing uh that was really like the Supernova for the neoliberal American economy. This blowing up uh everything and everything that we live in this is defined in the in the aftermath of that and what it is is a process whereby uh uh groups are able to get cheap money use it to borrow it to uh under bid basically for the uh. These conglomerates take them over excuse me and then sell the component pieces and meanwhile the other thing that's happening that lastman points here points out here and that I don't think gets talked about enough when we talk about how we're in the situation we aren't in is that because of the compensation involved in finance starting in this 80s you see a brain drain away from things like law science uh medicine towards Finance. Like people very smart people who in other uh in a previous generation would have gone to work uh before Bell Labs or uh the National Institute of Health or become a lawyer's uh are now all moving to finance and bringing with it.

The uh the fertile lines and the federal imaginations that could have gone to practical questions two instead the question of how to extract  rents from the economy and they do an incredible job of financial Innovation and one of the big propaganda coups of the Clinton era. Uh and the guys like Larry Summers love to point out is that the need deregulation in finance was necessary because it allowed for Innovation and that word Innovation was left in people's mind to be related to Innovation as it had stood in the old industrial economy which had given us you know the jet age and all of our amazing technological innovations. Of course.

Most of those were funded with government money uh because you need to have a non-pecuniary motive to  research in order to find anything worthwhile. Otherwise. I'm going to have to figure out is how to extract rents which what a shock is what all these Geniuses start doing and the illusion.

The uh. The alive thing that happens there is the assumption that innovation in finance has the same productivity boosting effect as innovation in the industrial economy or the real economy. In fact innovation. In finance only increases instability undermines the real economy and eventually as we've seen uh destroys it from within.

Uh one one thing that lastman uh says here that I think is a good way of looking at it is so we say that um the the inflation that was in the economy in the 70s was tamed by the volcker shock and other things in the 80s and what actually happened is that inflation what came out of the whole economy and was essentially uh privatized and pushed into the finance sector. So inflation is still real inflation's still happening but inflation is now not being seen as a rise in prices throughout the economy but rather a rise of stock prices executive compensation and the associate monies collected in finance which gives finance a veto essentially over the rest of the economy. The way that the Dutch burgers were able to assert a veto power over the Estates of the Dutch Republic and having a similar effect to  industrial sector worth the name um and uh for example like that uh the wave of uh conglomerate uh leveraged buyouts of conglomerates was largely um uh facilitated by this because the artificially low value of these companies I've talked about uh was maintained because the companies that self-reported they're worth self-reported their share price. Uh essentially priced the real inflation out of it and did not reflect the actual inflation because that would mean lower profit margins. Higher value would mean lower profit margins lower earnings per share so they kept a lower value which left them ripe to be taken over by somebody who is gladly willing to pay that lower Book value and then Arbitrage the difference by shelling off selling off the component pieces for their actual market value that isn't what it wasn't put into the book value by these companies which was reflected by the inflation uh in assets that happened during this period because you gotta the price inflation is gone but asset inflation in the financial economy through the roof which creates a new class of of hedge fund and managers and CEOs who now are directing the economy towards their specific. Uh uh interests which are because their finance and not industrial or other economy uh stripping things for parts and that's where we've been ever since we've been in the in the stripping the  wiring and the copper tubing out of the building stage because uh there is no nothing to stop them because once there's no longer a a Harmony among Elites along a national project. Then you get individual Elite groupings and individual Elites competing for individual profits in the system which uh brings about its collapse.


At least that's historically how hegemons have failed according to Latchman and in this specific instance how our specific hegemony is failing uh armies that can't fight any War but a nuclear one which is looking more and more alarming as the days go on and an economy that can actually  uh sustain itself but of course the question becomes shouldn't. This then lead to a new Elite and another geographic area. Another state structure that has been synthesized by all of this progress up until now to take the reins you'd think so and you'd think it would be China uh but right now. The remaining the plank of American hegemony that remains is its status as the global Reserve currency then China in order to be a global Reserve currency would have to get rid of capital controls which would essentially mean uh getting rid of their ability as a party state to control their financial uh system. Much like our par our parties and our political State lost the ability to control the financial system. The finance was part of one part of a of a collection of elite structures that were managed by a political economy in in the uh the high Keynesian era.

But now it is. It is just this predatory cannibal cannibalist cannibal Corps uh but there is no state to challenge it. That's that's the the real challenge here and that's the that's why the question of America's specific path of decline is so important because it is not the sort of decline that took place in previous generations. When one hegemon was superseded by another. Uh here for the first time we have a hegemon that has the capability to destroy all life on Earth if it feels its hegemony truly undermined foreign. So I'll just read the last chapter or last paragraph of the final chapter of this book to really kind of bring this together.

The last two chapters I should say the power of American regulation and the dollar will not be undone by Elite conflict in the United States since all Elites derive their position in part from America's Global Financial hegemony and their institutions are subject to Fed regulation. Nor has this power challenged by China or the eu's autonomy in other spheres or by the growing ability of countries once under America's thumb to pursue their own interests alone or in concert. Their strategies of autonomy in all other spheres depend on World Markets. Dominant denominated in a stable dollar and presuppose the fed's global regulatory role only if and when a sufficient concert of other nations devises a new regulatory mechanism for Global finance and creates a process to back up demand in recessions and liquidity in crisis. Will American Financial hegemony come to an end well America's nuclear weapons pose a threat that is so nihilistic that they offer no practical response to countries that recognize and exploit the ever more severe limits of U.S conventional warfighting capacities. The fed and dollar provide palpable and regular support for the interests of Elites around the world.

Thus U.S financial agenda endures even as it corrodes the other pillars of American economic power and stymies the emergence of a stable post. Hegemonic Elite structure within the United States and of a government with enough autonomy to advance policies that could address the interests of Americans other than those Elites who have built for themselves impregnable fortresses within largely autonomous institutions. So that's the bummer ending of the book at least before they even bought more bummer uh uh concluding chapter. After Decline so let's go there now uh so this.

This one starts off with addressing what happened to the previous hegemons and what happened is first of all uh. It took a long time for the loss of economic hegemony to translate into a real decline in living standards within these countries uh the the Dutch long act for decades after they had turned over the reins really of the global economy to the British still had uh higher living standards per capita than the England did uh. It took a long time for them to sort of be superseded by the British uh and the British held out less Long uh from us uh. But in both cases there was still a relatively managed decline. Uh that was uh to one degree or another compensated for with some sort of redistributed process. Less in the Netherlands more in England and why more in England than the other ones because England had a larger and more robust and effective Trade union movement to make demands for uh social insurance and provision and things like that uh.


But in both cases they had the United States that uh they had another hegemon there to to maintain the system that they were part of and now we have a situation where the United States is unwilling and unable to recognize and deal with hegemony failure and the reality of Chinese Ascension because unlike those previous hegemons we look across at the potential uh inheritor and we don't see a continuation of our tradition. We see an annihilation of it and so that's why I think we're much more likely to have some sort of war with China than a peaceful. Handover of hegemony to them um foreign but still the end the book ends with the question okay so what happens to the America After Decline and uh rather than offer any kind of Rosy fantasy or some sort of laundry list of of possible solutions. Latchman simply and soberly analyzes the current situation and then says due to the elite conflict that is completely paralyzed the American state apparatus and the failure of there to emerge any uh citizen-based challenge to the existing political structure that uh there can be no amelioration from within the system. There can be no recognition from within the system of our condition. There can only be some sort of uh ah collapse or conflict foreign Brandon's decision to uh essentially decapitate the British or the uh.

Uh the Chinese is it the microprocessing micro processes uh someone tell me I don't remember the specific industry but there's a tech industry which has a lot of American advisors and a lot of American uh semiconductors. There we go a lot of American uh know-how involved uh and the Brandon just told every American working in summer semiconductors in China that they had to come home uh and quit the job or they would lose their American citizenship and every single. One of them left that's because the American state is recognizing that if it continues the technological transfer that is currently going on between it and China taking the one actual tangible non-uh Global Reserve currency based uh Advantage. The US has beside of course our absurd and honestly white elephant filled military and our intellectual property regime. It is our technological Inlet specifically our technological innovation property regime uh and if the Chinese are able to replicate it then there that further undermines America's position vis-a-vis the Chinese so again.

This is another situation where uh we are we collectively are deciding that we would rather fight it out uh than try to come to any kind of recognition of the inevitable flow of the  history and and the exhaustion of the American state project which of course how could we uh like uh our our Elites are always going to at the end of the day be suicidal cannibals because they cannot conceive of collective action they're allergic to it. They're only able to carry it out when all of their interests are aligned by outside forces. I think that's the key to the Latchman thesis is that you have a state empowered to take control in competition that's to to emerge Victorious from competition with other states when that very competition aligns Elite interests in one way but that alignment of Interest over time as conditions change breaks up and pushes everyone in every group and every individual Elite into competition with one another which means they can't acknowledge anything like the reality of Decline and have to instead insist on the maintenance of a gentlemany hegemony even as they with their every action undermine America's capacity to be a hegemon.

So it's hard to see this as leading anywhere but at war with either party in charge that's the funniest thing about people wanting to to figure to to to squint at like Republicans and imagine them as some sort of Anti-Imperialist force. Uh any anti-war sentiment that you see on the right is animated not by a repellent against the concept of conflict and War. The martial virtues are key elements to any kind of right-wing political project. Rather it is for against what they see as a waste and if out of America's fighting capacity fighting the wrong. Wars specifically right now against uh Russia through the proxy of Ukraine when in fact we should be allying with the Russian State uh in a in a like a nationalist a nationalist International to go against uh China and the finance capitalists. Uh I mean this is. It's a amazing how this comes into harmonic.

Focus no matter where you are I mean even  Kanye West gets this I mean he hasn't read a newspaper in his life uh or or a book apparently. But he gets this because when he describes uh the the dark Forces colluding to you know have his children be alienated from him and for people to not like his new music as much as they liked his old music. Uh the answer comes back to China just like it does for guys like Steve Bannon uh and just like it inevitably has to do has to uh come for the other nationalist parties. If America. This this is of course the big if if America can be uh magnified. I think uh you're seeing a very interesting phenomenon here uh with what Saudi Arabia is doing. Saudi Arabia is clearly uh sort of putting its uh.

It's it's realigning itself towards Russia uh and also at the same time clearly uh as it has been supporting the Republicans and specifically Trump and there is talk about Russia. I know a lot of the Anti-Imperialist pro-russia. People think that there's some uh that there is some Chinese Russian alliance against America uh but that's only as long as the United States government is beholden to uh you know International capitalism as they understand it uh. But if that if but but the international capital is also facilitating the movement of power to China as it has to uh and that means that there must inevitably come a conflict between Russia and China. Uh and the hope of the American right is that that Alliance could win that war but of course we all know no one's winning. Any more that comes is uh is going to be a full conflagration but yeah the problem is is that China can't give Russia what it wants like an alternative to the American Financial system because again they cannot make the renimbi the world currency or or a reserve currency of any kind because then they would have to remove Capital controls and financially deregulate and then they wouldn't be a  party State anymore that's the red line that they have. But I don't know what's going to happen all that Latchman season that I agree with is that there can be no uh internal fix. For this uh. The internal uh structures are pointed in One Direction and there's no there's no hand at.


The wheel I think isn't that a what's that what's that God Speedy black Emperor song about there's no one at the wheel opened my wallet and it's full of blood that'll know. But I think turning that into nuclear war that destroys all life. It's like turning climate change into the runaway Venus thing that kills all life you're just you're yeah. I think it is at the end a in a narcissistic desire to be the last person a narcissistic desire to not miss anything to be the cumulative and total and final apotheosis of humanity. Even if it's bad. I don't think any of us. I don't think we get off that easily. I think that there's more struggle and pain ahead than we could ever fathom but that the process is essentially eternal. Although I do believe that there is there is a point where somewhere at some point when there is a real apotheosis but it is not war. It is not climate change. It's not death to all because all right we've turned Earth into a superheated uh hellscape. The Earth has been a superheated hellscape in the past life still emerged on the wreckage and in the rubble and then we'll continue to do that cyclically and that cycle is eternal.

But then it is punctuated and embodied. I think at the End by a a a total consciousness and I say that I was talking about somebody about this the other day and they didn't get that part and I honestly didn't get it myself. It's something I think and I say it and it's like what do I mean by that I finally think I understand why it's because if you imagine uh existence as a Consciousness field not as you know material pla fixed in space. But as just a suspended field of Consciousness is throughout time which I think is accurate. I think the the new Nobel Prize winners in physics would agree uh there's no local reality right. It's either local or it's reality or it's neither. But it's not both and uh for me. What makes sense is that there is no uh reality. There is no uh existence outside of perception what is consciousness. Consciousness is by definition uh retroactive and retrospective. Consciousness is not experiencing an event it's not having a sensation. It is the reflection upon that sensation which has to has to happen after it foreign a final event final point uh at which all consciousnesses are embodied and then retroactively uh perceived. I don't know uh and that moment is individually for individual. Consciousness. The moment of death and the moment of death of the universe you know uh but death is not blowing out of a light the play the replacement of Darkness or light with Darkness. It is instead the elimination of the distinction between the two thank you. I don't know I have no idea. I'm just I'm just trying to make sense of of how I can feel relatively. Uh peaceful in a way that I never used to be able to uh and to me. That's the only thing that makes sense uh of course.

You know it's all up for refinement but the reason I would never start a cult. The reason I would never proselytize is because I think the real implications of this is that Stakes as we understand that moral. Stakes as we understand them do not persist that we will all no matter what we do in life. No matter what our experience is of will have the experience the the subjective experience of of reconstitution reunion uh and therefore there's nobody who needs saving you know. There are people who need help we all need to help each other. But there's nobody who needs saving the idea that we need to be saved is the building block the the fulcrum uh of the cultural justification or religious cultural justification for class society. As such you cannot if you have saved and Damned then it is your duty right to to uh increase one group and and decrease the other and how can you do that what mechanism exists to do that other than our our orders our structures of governance and the society that we can imbue supposedly with a religious idea with a a system of values that can increase the number of Saved. But what they actually do is just increase. The amount of surplus that are uh exalted rulers get to enjoy foreign.

Like existence universe is a Consciousness field then how what of materialism what if historical materialism what if our precious material uh understanding our dialectic materialism. What about we love saying materialism don't we folks. It's our favorite word if there is no real material outside of our perception uh if there if objects don't have uh content that is independent of of our Collective observation and uh assertion of them then my God. What is what can material be and uh. I think the way I make sense of it is is that yes like the universe is just this Consciousness field. We are suspended within nothing is real as we as it were uh. But the mind that creates it is not an individual mind. It is the collective minds of all that have ever existed and exist. Currently of course also will ever exist but those contributions are essentially invisible to us. They're they operate in a spectrum that are sense apparatus cannot perceive at least not conventionally and cannot communicate about conventionally uh but we do not experience life that way we experience life as individual Minds so that means that our encounter with this. Uh this realm of ideals is one in which their the solidity and the materiality of others of other things of other people of other objects is reified in our own individual Minds because of our inherent uh subjective alienation from all of those other Minds. So that is why though we make history we do not make it as we wish and that we are bound by our conditions because these conditions have only been made by minds and are only made of mines and our minds is part of that mind.

But they can only be experienced by individuals individually coming into contact with them and then trying to assert flailingly and fits and starts uh that Unity uh through cooperation but only through only restrained because we cannot communicate to ourselves or to others. The fundamental Unity of these things and the fundamental uh mutability of of these things because we can only communicate as individual Minds so to me. That's how I make sense of that seeming contradiction is that we're all Minds. It's all mine. There is no material uh but it is perceived subjectively as material I will pilot the Eva I I'm. Not I never watched that show but apparently that's about a little nerd who won't get in the robot. Uh I I'm a big nerd who will get in the robot okay uh so so. That's Richard Latchman I meant sorry for the the little detour at the end. But the end of the book is kind of a bummer. So you know I want to get somewhere. More. Uh exalted at the end there. Like I said I want to do a book about China. Now.

I've had a couple of very good recommendations. I'll think about it. I'll let everybody know which one I've chosen uh. But uh maybe right now. Maybe next next week I'll do another one. That's just uh some fun hangout q a uh but yeah because if we're if we're cash the question becomes then.


What is China doing about it and how uh can China adapt but you know if the missiles fly. It really won't matter because it's very hard to imagine the hegemon in a context where they have the capacity to escalate to nuclear confrontation not taking the path because if you have a button on your desk it's there for a reason and why would you ever step back from the button without pressing it. Why would you ever give up power give up control. Buck break yourself when you could press the button and find out what happens because my God. It's there for reason. Now the the the Russians didn't do this because I do believe because there was something uh there was something Beyond hegemony in the DNA of that governing structure uh and they're the most cynical you know uh monstrous people in those regimes uh they had a lot to gain. By the end of Communism. They could they imagine themselves integrating into the new capitalism from a position of strength and power so they had no incentive to blow everything up and the true deal communists don't want to blow up anything now though there's only there are only cynics and monsters at the top of this system because any True Believer has been grounded to dust and obliterated so faced with the idea of final humiliation and dethronement which is the same as death why not take everybody else with you and if not and and maybe you wouldn't that's the thing maybe you can win.

Maybe you can win. Why is that button there. Why do we have this capability if we might not win. I think you're seeing that with Putin like a lot of people oh by the way I should read I forgot to read this part of this book. It's pretty funny uh like Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Uh in something that people thought impossible is because of its uh potential for disaster right but Putin rightly understands that absence of war with Ukraine or at least an attempt to assert like a real uh. Uh territorial control of those areas and those pipelines and stuff to dictate oil prices and stuff and not be undermined that uh that Russia's autonomous autonomy the Russian State and Bourgeois autonomy will eventually be obliterated well.

You've got this Army for the Christ's sake. See what it can do first before you  run up. The flag run up the white flag and that is what's insane about the NATO position in this war is that they basically want the uh the Russian Elites to kill themselves why for the good of for the good of uh the rule of law or some  who would do that would you do that asking them to do. It is absurd okay. Here it is so this is a this is a paragraph about the likelihood of uh nuclear of of real military conflict. In the coming. This book was written in the middle of the Obama or the middle of the Trump Administration.

Like 2018 the United States despite recent and forthcoming diplomatic reverses remains in a far stronger geopolitical position that Britain held in 1914. Most of the strong military powers are American Allies and neither Russia nor China has any plans to confront the United States or to attack smaller countries that would provoke the United States into war. As Britain was by Germany's invasion of Belgium. The realignment of trade and diplomacy in Asia likely eliminates the possibility of war between China and its neighbors. Neither the United States nor NATO regards Russia's intervention in Ukraine as a casa spell eye and that assessment most likely will not change normal Russia whose Army depends largely on volunteers and professionals since it reduced the length of conscription to 12 months and broadened exemptions in 2008 risk fighting a war against the Hostile populace backed by nato in the Baltic Nations. Thus the United States has no fear of being drawn into a war with any nation that has a significant military and you can laugh at that LOL owned but in 2018 that looked correct what is not can't be taken account into account is the rate of decline and honestly. I think covid as a phenomena like Trump being president. Uh is one of those increasingly frequent Black Swan shocks to the system that knock us uh into new trajectories of intensification that are not predictable in like a fixed moment in time where you presume a certain stability of conditions moving forward foreign.


I got a few I got a little time more if anybody has any questions I could take those about the book or anything else sir. Yes. The Cool Zone indeed I have not picked a China book. Yet if anybody has recommendations. Where are the Crags crabs. They're in my dang underwear Nora Connolly. James Connolly's daughter had correspondence with Trotsky. That's interesting didn't uh didn't James Connolly's like brother son or something teach Lenin English which is why he had an Irish accent. When he spoke. It have I figured out who gambo is hmm. I mean at the end of the day. Gambo is is the uh is the anachronistic character. Right. Gambo is the modern subject who can reflect the horrors of the Medieval World to the audience from a position of superiority right uh so that we can kind of look down on these these.

Hicks much you know uh Mad Men did the same thing. It's very difficult for shows about the past especially now not to uh fixate on that and I feel like uh with that being the case. Uh I don't know I mean the uh is it is it. Rainera is she gambo people are trying to make Damon into gambo but I cannot accept a man that unattractive as my gambo. I can't do it. I can't look at his face. I have to look at the screen through a camera. Obscura I gotta say the the Amen Kid with an eye patch. Somehow even more hideous than Matt Smith. They really went all out with with grotesques.

On this this season. This show it does very much seem that they're trying to uh set up the the the blacks rhaenerys faction as like the good progressives uh and the greens is like the bad reactionary uh uh sign like it's. It's Hillary versus Trump all over again uh as it must be forever and ever in all uh mainstream entertainments made by Hollywood liberals which Cuts against the other uh real theme of the whole Dance with Dragons which is that none of this  uh uh country who were just getting you know burned by dragons and cut to Pieces by armies for something that meant nothing to them that meant nothing to their well-being one way or the other uh it'll be interesting to see if they can tease that out more because I think if you could really harp on that like like because to a degree. It's kind of annoying to see them stack the deck for the blacks. The way they have and sort of Pander to Liberal uh verities the way that they have but at the same time if they really show consistently the indifference of both sides to regular people that they might it might be more interesting. I think but we'll see it's crap. It's all crap. We're all just having a good time or I'll. Just we all just want to watch our stories we all want to be entertained.

The American Empire can only entertain so my God try to at least be entertained okay so people say that's a new someone says multilateralism isn't that just another way to get a nuclear war like if you do not have super seeding institutions to uh to uh militate conflict in a nuclear multi-polar world. Doesn't doesn't everybody isn't everybody eventually and given crisis conditions. Eventually it's going to come faster than you think decide to press the button. I'm not saying you need uh NATO because that'll that eventually eventually the existential need to resist uh natoification will lead to the conflict either way. But the idea of multipolarity is something that will rescue you from uh total conflict seems uh like wishful thinking like the only real like world government as much as it is allergic to the American mind is the only real uh Salvation International institutions.

Now the problem is the international institutions. We do have only exist to support International capitalism but yeah I'd much rather have unipolarity under China than some multi-polar thing that what it's going to be everybody fighting everybody else how what is what is to prevent the polls from going to war what's well. 1914 was multi-polar how'd that go I don't think anybody really knows what multi-polarity is. They just know that American hegemony is bad and that something should replace it and I agree with that. But I don't think any any national Bourgeois formation that currently exists as a state structure.

Certainly any of the ones that have nuclear capabilities uh is in any position to replace it with uh more human institutions that recognize you know ecological limitations and and and uh values. Beyond consumption you know I gotta say I think fukuyama people make fun of somebody asked about fukiyama and apparently he says that we're still at the end of History. I think he was always right. I mean people's people have been making fun of him for 20 years but we have been 20 years of Crisis right 20 years of deep crisis and has any alternative emerged. Really has any alternative political economic structure to Liberal democracy or capitalism with like a liberal Democratic loss really emerged. The question is how does the end of History end and I think it has to end with a bang maybe a whimper. But since we have nukes. I think it's probably going to be a bang. The only problem that Fujiyama had is that he had normative assumptions about what endless liberal capitalism. No alternative to finance uh consumption The Matrix that we live within uh. He thought that that was good and that we'd come to some you know stable Accord but instead that that that triumphant system is is the death now of uh of civilization. He was uh heart he was right but for the wrong reasons in the classic way do you kind of wonder if the the creation of nuclear weapons did not necessitate their eventual use in in the totalizing fashion but again so we have nukes okay fine that gonna kill everybody on Earth maybe probably not even if it did though still Earth still a bunch of stuff on it still a rich melange of molecules banging into each other chemicals bubbling and throbbing a cauldron from which something will emerge so that's why I I think that even if fukayama was right it doesn't matter because that history that he imagines is might have an end that means that another history will have a beginning and we're all part of it can't be disentangled from it. We cannot be isolated or alienated so that is all an illusory a necessary illusory.


Uh presumption that allows us to Pilot our bodies through time and space but that eventually I think is superseded by a greater understanding there's organizing to be done but it is for survival and dignity not for abstract notion of uh change towards uh equilibrium. All right. A couple more questions thank you somebody says this is all a simulation. Uh the real world everything is like my anime I I want to say this about simulation. I do think that we are in a simulation but I think the way we think about that is incorrect because it assumes someone is doing the simulating. It assumes some outside force like pressing a button to make a machine go or like a an alien doing the thing a god pressing a button. Uh I think because the universe is cyclically created and destroyed and that in that intervention in between the creation and the destruction you have life play out like the unfolding of entropy that that those conditions only obtained during that specific arrangement of atoms that is then that same space filled with another one and another one and another one uh which all serve as simulations of a greater. Uh uh mind I guess but a mind that is made up of those simulations that is not outside of them like it's a simulation.

The same way that like your dreams are your thoughts are not not programmed by out from outside but the very Act of perceiving through time and space as a being in a body collect all of us doing that and all things doing that while having those experiences uh through that those experiences creates the world creates the structures of the world then destroys them and the thing is like I truly I don't believe in Free Will at all like I would say that we are all absolutely from birth charted on a course. But because we don't know that because we live as I said after action we live in the we live in in the uh the time delay between perception between being acted upon and for the perception of an act uh the perception of us of a sensation uh that we are totally free to interpret the actions that we will go through in life. The our interpretation of our predetermined actions why we do them what they mean what our perceptions mean is up to us. I know this is Al gibberish and I'm very sorry. I'm just trying to talk off the top of my head. If it doesn't make sense that's not your problem.

It's definitely mine and I think that's the that's the that's the premise of uh of the the Taoist golden path right. Uh it is. It is not willing oneself to control things or detaching oneself from what is happening to your what is happening to you but rather turning everything that happens to you as it is happening to you to the thing. The the thing that you want to do the thing the the your most uh your most preferred course of action all right so this is good. I'll talk we'll talk again soon got one more show on the tour but after tour will come back. Let you guys know which China book we'll be doing and then we will put that one out there uh we'll start reading that one then okay talk later bye-bye.
