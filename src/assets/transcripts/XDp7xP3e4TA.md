There we go excellent yay all right. We are all we are bravo for launch. Here guys ladies everyone hello uh so today I'm gonna start with a couple of topics that might check you. Talking with you guys see what you guys want to talk about. But I'm gonna start off going off as it were on a few topics. Few things have occurred last couple days that uh you know I want to talk about a little bit just as a as an exercise in education for you and me. And we can like talk our way through these things that have happened help us make sense of the world with them and of course we're going to start with the story that everyone's talking about you know obviously. That's pretty hilarious when you consider where we are on the knife's edge of the collapse of capitalism as we know it public health crisis likes which we've never experienced in the modern era. But nothing to do about any of that what we can do is have a lot of fun at the expense of once again.

Everyone's favorite lace-curtain buffoon Joe Biden Joseph Robinette Biden who today on The Breakfast Club wet hands as the kids say and claim that if you don't if you vote if you don't vote for Joe Biden then you ain't black which ma just the most perfect morsel of any oh. God yeah. It's perfect bite not so much because he said it you know he's Joe Biden of course. He's gonna say something like that the whole point of Joe Biden's candidacy is that it represents the same way.

Trumps does like the end state of it's part of the party that he represents in this moment of crisis like the relationship between the Republican Party in its base is such that by now they have Trump a perfect reflection of what they want a perfect embodiment of everything out of a president. He's that he is a peevish incurious bitter bitter. Even though God blessed angry even though I'm incredibly fortunate he is who they were he we represents he is a perfect representation of the party because the party is now in a position in a situation where it has got this transparent relationship between its its base and it's in its political structure. The Democrats are the reverse of course because they would have to be and they have created a situation where nobody gets what they want out of their out of the candidate how there is no sense of like visceral juice off so you don't get any  of the old. The old juice they like black people got what Obama was president or that women were supposed to get when Hillary won the PA the Republican old Republicans to get with Trump this sense of I am validated by the president. This is saying the Democrats now are saying no no one gets that because we're left with him because in order to maintain the structure in order to maintain our interests and in order to deny that there's anything like class or or you know political or or access to capital having to do with political power and we're not going to challenge the existing parameters of that and really we have nothing to offer.

You was what we used to offer. You was at least you know nothing's changing in the posts in the neoliberal era. Nothing's changing but you can get represented. You can get some fun just like Republicans. Nothing's changing but our guys you're gonna get. They're gonna trigger. The libs more and they're gonna be more oh fish. They're gonna be more like you.

They both got that offer but now the Democrats were forced to pick someone because they couldn't get anyone else. No one else had established the position where they were credible. The way Obama was to embody some you know segments of their coalition. They got a guy who maintained loyalty to enough Democrats because of their Marie of him associated with Obama so it's like a contact high. It's already a second-order thing. It's tough. It's smoking the resin. It's it's a desperation move and now they have to try to sell that to a general election electorate which is not nearly the same thing and that means that their only move since they cannot offer the thing that their party is traditionally offered. They have this this old mommy who represents no one who represents the worst in the party from an ideological perspective whose record is everything that these people claim to care about that his record on all accesses of of intersectional oppression. He's bad so what the hell are you supposed to say it. What are you supposed to think you're supposed to say and think Trump is worse.

Therefore you are morally obligated to vote for Biden. Now that was always the the gun to the head of every Democratic voter right but there was always something else too. There was some positive part. There was some some joy to be had in the Democratic tent. Some sense that you were representing a a more progressive social vision gone. Now that's out the window with with Biden. It's purely and only an appeal to negative emotions about Trump. There is nothing else and because Biden is the transparent embodiment of his party's relationship to their base because of his dementia and his lack of filter. He is when challenged pushed back to the only real argument he has I'm not Trump go vote for Trump if you don't like me. He was saying that  during primaries when people had other options and now he's saying in the general because that's the only I only uh appeal they have and of course nobody wants to hear that because it really does show you the degree to which they have you completely over a barrel if you accept their premise. That is if you accept the premise that Trump that the Republican winning is always the worst outcome and and that there's like no context at which a Republican winning in the short term could lead to anything good. It's all one disaster after another until somehow we interrupt that by electing a Democrat and so you know and like wiping the slate clean I don't know how that's supposed to work but that's that's their whole that's their claim of how this  goes down. Is you've got a Republican and we're all terrified of them and you are you are required to vote for them and but that means is that you can make no claims on them. There is no pressing them forward.


There is no being an activist. There is no seeing anything better done because you have no leverage like Zerlina Maxwell. The other day said truck Biden has to nominate a black woman as VP and a million people asked her. I don't think she responded what if he doesn't what if he doesn't for the melina because there's no answer. There's no response. Someone actually said I'll be unhappy. I'll vote for Trump Biden but I'll do it angrily you the degree to which you have to acknowledge so you don't have a choice is agree to which you feel powerless in this and that's bad enough for voters. It's even worse for these  opinion colonists and thought leaders and political operatives who are supposed to give the impression and intent of themselves as having political influence and power like the whole point that the reason they're in. Politics is not supposed to be for personal advancement right. There are Democrats they're good people their politics to help but they know but they can't say I'm voting for Mike because he's better the Trump and there's nothing that could happen that could change that emphasizing that only only undermine only makes everyone ask the question that Bob's did in office space. What is it you do here. What are you for you have this the party and the candidate will do what they want you have no place. In this. All you are doing is to justify what they do after they say it and if everyone sees that as your role as just this propagandist you lose a lot of credibility or at least they're afraid you.

They will and so they hate it and so cut. Things like this today is so juicy because they all freaked out now. They all have to spaz and figure out some sort of justification for why this isn't on its face awful and of course they can put the one thing they could say is. It's not gonna matter and the thing is yes that's true. That's the hilarious part of all. This is that the the truth undergirding even the harsher truth undergirding the harsh truths of they're hot the fact that they're hostages to Biden is the fact that they don't have any influence in any way even if it wasn't by the whole class of people. They're squawking are purely ornamental. They're talking to each other and trying to convince us that they have some reason for the perks that they have assume. Some reason they have a checkmark. They have some net value-add and they do not. But they immediately and instinctively what something like this comes up get the need to express their actual use. I'm actually useful to this process and I'll Express you why and that requires them to then get the  knots to try to explain why what Biden said is okay. Why is that fine I mean my god this as my friend Dan Kay said does that mean that the diamond and silk aren't black and Rachel Dolezal is are we at that level you want to make those you want to eat. You want a strip race of all of all a non. You want a strip race of everything except just total social signifiers go for it but to just say that out loud in violation of so many carefully constructed towers of  maybe. All this intersectionality is just getting us more awful. Republicans and awful Democrats and nothing is getting better maybe there's no intersecting at all. Maybe. It's just parallel roads that lead to the  gutter. Maybe we should do something about this. No no don't you see no no. Race is a delicate dance and it needs to be acknowledged at every level and we need to intersect it with all these other things and then you got a guy like Biden saying you had black people. Hit look look up look black vote for me or else.

Your honky destroys their entire thing. It destroys everything they've done because they have to defend it. They have to defend it and how do they defend it. There's a bunch of different ways. One guy. We're gonna go through a few tweets here in response to this because I think it's just all of it is so  instructive. This isn't a big guy but I just wanted to point this out for like the older boomer II Biden supporter like the real bloomers as opposed to the younger people who are you know they're all on that on the arm. They're all just democratic flak operatives one way or the other but this guy is like he speaks sort of for the for the older white boomers who like Bertie because they hate Biden's or they hate they hate. They hate Trump because of his uncouthness. The fact that he that he violates all their norms and expectations of what government should be but look what ears has done look what the ears have done. This guy look at what all those years of beholding the monster of Trump. This is really the Nietzsche this guy is warning. This is the Nietzschean warning you know few fights must is risks becoming one if you stare into the abyss to do long. The abyss stares back. So. This guy says Chris Jackson is his name and he was a blue check. And I think like a trump or flyer and he says this I've said it before and I'll say it again. Joe Biden is gonna be Joe Biden regardless of what you think and personally that's why I like it. He is real he's authentic and he's gonna. He's gone through far too much in his life to give a  with blue. Checks say about him on Twitter okay that is just - a word. What people say to defend Trump. I mean identical that's exactly how people talk about Trump when the the Clorox thing every time you've said something racist like the  countries. They're saying he's being honest Trump's honest and he's a real man okay and you can't accept that and I think what these guys saw over. The time is that they kept yelling that's not fair. At Trump. He just kept ignoring all the rules and they realized they want to do it too. That's where their joy is. Gonna come from not ideological of course get out of here. They don't care about any of that not but now instead of like getting pleasure from denying themselves. Those those sweets those sweet indulgences of politics.

They can just Gorge and they're gonna go to town at least and then and at some point all these old white. Aggrieved idiots are gonna realize that they really have nothing separating them. They're all the same class they'll have the same broad interests. They are the same reactionary social view of younger people basically at some point they're gonna realize what's let's just  fuse around one character one candidate and then of course. My favorite Hannah Jones pellets surprise winner for her work with the 16:19 project which I've talked about out here about how that is the whole premise of that thing for what I understand is baloney reading. This certainly makes me think my my instinct on that is correct and that all those people who fled to defend it from guys like James McPherson. What just because Ben Shapiro said it was bad that meant it had to have been good just absolute tribalistic reflexive miss none of it having anything to do with some real questions at hand very disappointing every time you see it you hate to see it. So Hannah Hannah Jones who worked on the 16:19 project and as a Democrat a proud Democrat says there is a difference between being politically black and being racially black. I'm not defending anyone. But we all know this and should stop pretending that we don't someone replies what does this mean. She said if you don't know it ain't for you which that is how politics works generally as you make a political claim and then when people ask you for more information. You say it's not my job to educate you and so she the person replies I'm not the only one that asks I'm also a black person to which she replied yes.

I'm capable to sue your avatar and I will repeat if you don't understand the difference between being born slash designated race and having taking up a particular set of racial politics. I am NOT going to educate you here so obviously like I said this just destroys all this carefully crafted years of talking about how like race is this fundamental aspect of American life. Right. Like this this  is like like the Tanana. See Coates say you know the brand. The 1969 teen project to the idea that racism is a scarring brand across America that is so inextricably fused with capitalism that it can't be unbroken from it and that therefore you know basically racism is as defeatable as capitalism which if capitalism isn't defeatable because of the racism I guess you just have to live with it. But maybe you can reduce the racial part. The capitalism you can't really do anything about so obviously that's part of it but so that all goes out the window all that goes out the window that thing that they spent all this years if she want a Pulitzer Prize writing about out the window. It's going now. This invalidates the entire thing because if race and politics are that broke it breakable apart. Then race is not the indelible daily mute scarring and punishing and traumatizing element that drives all white and black people apart and means that they can never really come together and that therefore racism can never really be overcome just like capitalism can't only mitigate it destroys. Gone blue pull blew it over in one second why not to make sure that Biden gets reelected or it gets elected. It's not gonna matter nothing. She says it's gonna matter at the level of a  candidacy. This laid out this far for the election. No it's the preserve hearse place pace in the hierarchy. Because people are gonna say you like this Biden guy. You also are supposed to be a racism expert. What do you think what he said you can't say he is I condemn him because you can't not vote for him oops. So all you can do is say it actually wasn't bad and so the first thing that comes to hand mind regardless of how it conflicts with everything else she believes and everything else she's ever written but first thing that comes to mind just to save your ass a little bit and then she ended up deleting it. So it didn't even work the wicked flee when none pursue a--the. It's really funny but they did all that they destroyed their entire project. Their entire tempted like reifying neoliberalism isn't as in is inextricably linked and metaphysically connected to racism. Meaning you cannot address class in any way because that's not addressing race because class means people other than the effective racial group. Therefore by definition you cannot talk about class or race. At the same time it can only be race or class and so destroyed the whole thing I mean it's goddamn beyond everything ed.

Tom from one second reprieve from judgment that didn't even work. It's. It's pretty stunning. It's crazy world. They gotta sell tickets hell. I'd buy one and then there's my favorite doctor Jason Johnson.


The faux birdy bros another  says just a thought how about we listen to the entire joe biden interview with Charlamagne tha God before we start roasting him. A white man telling a black man who isn't racist is black isn't excusable but what led to that exchange and why biden was triggered matters as well well. Then it is excusable right because if it's inexcusable that nothing can mitigate that that's what inexcusable means that there's no situation could mitigate. The fact of the inexcusable is if Biden's triggering the idea of Biden being triggered obviously. Hilarious couldn't affect that so it's excusable you're excusing it in fact you are excusing it by bringing it up because it's not like this is this is like a piece of the shattered cuneiform found in the  five minutes before he said that you could look at the tape so that means that just say hey I didn't say anything was a killing blow. I mean nothing's gonna change in any of these or for any of these people.

That's not part of this. This is all just about making sense of things in my head so that I don't go crazy and hopefully having other people like tell me mate to the degree or which I'm not now that it's changing anything. It's literally not gonna change any of their views. The reviews are determined by reasonable dialogue that are determined by social hierarchy and then to me the need to maintain it. That's not something you can argue against. So what's the point it's just me talking to myself literally so all of them. All these people have spent years and years and years cultivating their expertise to us the great unwashed as speakers on all issues of social trauma and justice. Along racial lines along gender lines have decided in the last three months that none of it matters that it's all.

They don't believe a word of it because they are in a relationship with the Democratic Party where their fortunes and it it's are inextricably linked and their interests are fused at the level of its its class project. It means it furthering Halla gawky. That's what the Democratic Party is for and they have decided that their role is to be courtiers of that and and if that's the extent they're lashed to the mast and they're going down with the ship and all it's left for them. To do is reassure each other that no we're not all sellout morons. No no we're principled smart people and here's the proof and along those lines.

Another thing happened just a few days ago on the Twitter's on the twittering machine that speaks to this exact same phenomenon I'm talking about the whole gia tolentino thing about her parents being human traffickers. Uh not gonna talk really that much about the. Case it's not her fault what her parents are did. Now the fact that she wrote about her parents in part of her memoir that's about herself and her you know her struggle with America's systems of oppression. She painted them as hardscrabble immigrants not as human traffickers even though they did the human trafficking already at that point that's an admission so huge that it's a lie basically I'm sorry. So then that's why when this comes up again she feels the need to backfill and explain their behavior because she she had the moment where she could have said. My parents were human traffickers and she could have dealt with it.

But it would have made it harder for her to ingratiate herself to her memoir audience and to the people who read her  articles in The New Yorker. So she just to skip all that awful awkward stuff that painful stuff that it's so painful to write about and so that's it. It's like people said why did. She even say anything she has to. She already staked her reputation on her virtue and the virtue she inherited from her family that's what happens when you make your your career as a as a as a writer about you as a person you're. You cannot have a recent view of it.

You can't you know take the jaundiced eye because you've already decided that you're gonna take a cheat code instead of engaging at the level of prose or insight you're going to do pure personal ingratiate and that means your parents can't be human traffickers because then it's like wait. A minute aren't you just another snot-nosed rich kid of privilege and exploitation who's now what probably got her parents paying for her loft in New York so that she can play Carrie Bradshaw why should I listen to you but anyway the thing that was most interesting and most baffling and horrifying to watch. It's just shameful was not her whole thing attempting to defend her parents. It was the instantaneous and overwhelming flood of fellow writers at every level of media not just the general media but left media as well essentially everybody on the current affairs. Masthead got into the back got into the puddle puddle of reassurance to her that it's okay. It's so bad that you all even had to write this oh the person whose entire career is writing about her life it has to write about her parents. Criminality wow I can't believe the nerve how dare. Anyone asked this of someone when that's their entire  value-add. It's a goddamn media figure and but they weren't doing this for her of course. Most of them don't know her. I mean some of them do. It's a very tight Club. It's very chummy but most of them don't know her personally what they know about. Her though is that one she's one of them meaning. She's a media person and that means two things to that me that means she's a media person which means one she could do something for them in their careers at some point if they're if they have if they have enough fun. Bada nosh on Twitter. Maybe there's a DM. Hey you know could you show an editor this so at that level just to maintain friendly relations and like score good person points with a person who they could later use the other being that hey I want to make sure.


Everyone has my back when it turns out when everyone finds out that ah my parents were slave owners because they all have family that are slave owners because they only get to write like that. Because they're all  rich kids there are a few art of course. They're exceptions but the meritocracy broke along ago and it became a system for reproducing the meritocratic the the risk. They turned the meritocratic positions that people established in in the earlier 20th century and turned them now into aristocratic signatures and so all these people are just rich people's kids - right in the body to each other and so they know that people find just like the slave guy how many people came out of the woodwork when that guy's paper about yeah my family owned a slave. Then I have a slave. Eventually I decided to pay a minimum wage. I felt kind of bad about it oh now I'm gonna die so you can't drag me how many people came out of the woodwork. To say. This is more complicated than it looks really why well you know with my family okay. Nevermind you're another global oligarch just cuz you're not from the United States just cuz you're. A different race doesn't mean you're not part of a global 1% of willful knowledgeable exploiters and arbitrage errs of human misery and just the fact that like oh I I dealt with anti ancient racism in school or whatever it's like yeah that sucks but you still are in a position wildly exalted beyond the average American and not because you were you know what with all that racism and I'm still pretty. Popular wow that must mean I'm really talented no no no the millions and millions of dollars of your wealthy. Parasite family helped but you can't mention that none of them want to mention that because they're all almost all of them are part of it and the ones who aren't part of it.

They need those jobs so they're not gonna stop kissing ass so that means everyone has an India has a a in the front of their mind motive to kiss her ass to tell her it's okay and the wit and just like with the Biden thing. The lengths people went to destroy any pretense that they actually believed any of the socialist  walk of life how a number of people who said well it couldn't have been that bad because they were they pled down and didn't serve any jail time yeah because they were  slap on the wrist. I mean otherwise how do you explain it because the explanation is oh. They were targeted by the racist ice and bush administration class not just classic racism until the case couldn't sustain itself anymore. Ah darn it really. They didn't plea down to a better deal like every other rich scumbag does when they get caught because they have good lawyers.

You wouldn't accept that answer in it for a second in anybody else and that was Michael Tracy's family. You wouldn't accept that you wouldn't say you know. The police are the ones who said that so what our laws you only extend that benefit to somebody who you think can help you in some way down the line and that means you didn't believe in any of this stuff. You never believed in it for a second. It was an instrument. It was a tool for your social advancement and people been talking about that and it's been like this. This running argument on Twitter about like you know how much can you test for trust people and like I've said on this place. I've said that like there's a reason that everybody Wizard resorts to bad faith and that they're in the Twitter. Such an undirected Oh space and one of the big ones is. There are these people everywhere. There are tons of them not everyone but how the hell are you supposed to tell how can you tell and so that uncertainty drives everyone crazy and they decide to rely on shibboleths so that's what ends up happening because everyone is suspicious. The only people you can trust are the people who mouthed the right words to you the people who know the passwords but of course. If you know the passwords you can say anything if it doesn't matter you don't have to believe anything if you know the passwords then and that's what we have with people. All these  of what are the passwords they're not hard and now they're just using them to walk everywhere they want and that's why people treat the place with such distrust and why you can't have an argument there. So I would say first horrifying as this all is and as much as it probably makes you want to go on the internet and scream into the void and no one knows me. I literally am screaming into the void about it.

There's really good not gonna be any benefit there because none of the stuff I've explained just now none of those incentives change by you owning somebody. It's it's it's big baked in. It's fixed there's no changing it but now all these people. I will just say this who find themselves now just in this position of having to defend Joe Biden as his brain like slowly rolls the clock back and he just thinks that he's in the Senate cloakroom with Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms all the time and they start doing. Mammy jokes to one another and and he's doing it in public on a  microphone and you have to defend it. That's what race first politics will get you that's what any that's what any non class political agenda will get you because you cannot build a coalition that can take over you can only assert a limited amount of influence within the context of a greater coalition and if Capitol is leading that coalition you're never gonna get anything other than scraps and that's where we find ourselves everybody who has very reasonable reasonable and non-fat faith arguments for why Republicans are worse for their lives why Republican governance is more painful and exploitative and durable for people of certain economic groups. It is it is harder but the thing is it's so much. It's so bad with Democrats that the marginal benefit you're reaping is not anywhere near worth the amount of leverage you're giving up so what you're keeping at bay. Is only this much worse than the reality you're gonna have and we know that from Obama black wealth eventual basically disappeared. I'll accumulate a black wealth over the last four years. A huge chunk of it disappeared after 2008 and never came back that's because of Obama's Wall Street. Bailout and his entire approach to the housing crisis which was to have it all followed on the on the shoulders of homeowners that meant hugely disproportionate number of relatively recent homeowners. African American homeowners wiped out and never came back that so what are you avoiding by hat by by clinging to the Democrats.

It's only in your head. It's a fantasy of what could have been worse but what is is so terrible and it will only get worse because there you have no leverage watch. Watch Biden talk and watch you unable to do anything watch him pick clove char for VP which I think he's gonna do because he's unless this freaks him out we'll see how long the backlash to this is but if enough people are gonna defend him to defend their own status hierarchy and their own credibility. Then if they might decide it's not a big enough thing to worry about because what they are really worried about are those numbers in the Upper Midwest. They're terrified of those numbers in the Upper Midwest and if they think Lubbock R will do better for them there then any black VP or P VP VP of any other color than white they're gonna pick her and then they're gonna say what are you gonna do about it so drill. That's that's the gist of what I'm saying here as you can see. It's a bunch of. We have no control over any of it no matter what Biden says no matter what Trump says. It's still basically a coin flip because the great mass of voters are not moved by any of this stuff.

But we're just we're just the  bodies out over the way when he gets hungry but guess what eventually yet you're a little slow and then you get eaten too. But if you have a class first politics. You can actually build a coalition that can assert real leverage and demands and pry things away from capital and even challenge capital. It cannot be done enough because what is what is your intersection of interests because if you have an intersection of oppression that's that's explanatory. I think that's a useful useful rubric to explain oppression but then what do you do about it. What's your intersectional praxis. What's your intersectional interest point to mobilize around I mean for the most part. The one that's the most prevalent the most. The one that reflects most the oppressions we're talking about is class because racial oppression is felt by degrees and those degrees are pretty. Much tracked very very strongly with class all right so those are a few things I wanted to get off. My chest wanted to get off I want to stop talking about it got my gears all grinded up.


But I have want to get these ideas out just so that I understand them and I have one other thing that I wanted to say this is Matt's movie corner and then maybe we'll take some questions. So I finally after  webson months and I said this a couple days ago. Someone asked if I'd seen drag bike. I dragged across concrete no because I was doing this waiting game to see what it was available on some streaming service to see for free. I was actually about to give up last night and  just click on the thing and watch it even though and pay for it. It was it had it would have come to HBO which I have so. I didn't have to pay actually for it.

So I watched dragged across country before last night and I gotta say I think it's his best film. I've liked all three of the Craig Saylor films. I really and I really liked brawlin selling out cell block 99. I think I might even like this one more Mike D'Angelo. The critic said that sailor is kind of trying to be the modern day Don Siegel and I think that is precisely correct that is his game like if you asked him who he's trying to be even if he didn't know the real answer is he's trying to be Don Siegel just muscular you know beaten potatoes American reactionary exploitative exploitation. You know like the white male it you know unleashed in a world that never made or it doesn't get to make anymore you know smashing against the confines of society and doing so in the most violent way possible. So I think he really pulls it off in that movie and a lot of people got mad at it because it's his most explicitly political yet because he made the first movie bow tomahawk and some people muttered a little bit because it has like these beastial Native American tribes. People cannibals as the bad guys and you know he makes pains to distinguish them from other Native American tribes but people sort of whisper a little bit I don't know man that's a little problematic. Then he made brawlin sell at 99 which has Vince Vaughn going to war with the cartels and has a lot of racially coded language and it has kind of a you know a magnet flare to it.

Even though it's all very subtle oh this one. He just lets it out. He has scenes where the cops are literally just sitting around going damn cell phone. Cameras won't allow us to do our jobs thanks to the damn media and they're like yes true and he's got these little vignettes that are just like they might as well. They could be short films directed by if TP USA had any talent behind it and but it's all shot in like the house style of sort of post post-millennial like prestige programming and it really made me realize that of all the people who tried to resurrect the exploitation genre in the 21st century and try to do exploitation movies like postmodern exploitation movies. He is the one who gets them the most one I think because he is a reactionary and what he gets the thing that is that most of these people who do neo exploitation don't get which is that exploitation films are inherently to one degree or another reactionary specifically vigilantism.

Its reactionary anything that's about somebody getting fed up and doing an insane amount of violence on people outside the law is reactionary in that it it credits like violence as a solution rather than any kind of socially cooperative endeavor towards the resolution of conflict. That's not terrible and doesn't mean. It's a terrible. But it's unwatchable. I mean people think that now because we bound up our politics in our art so much that we can't get them straight and we're all anxiety riddled about it all the time. But it says it's. It's a it's a reactionary genre and therefore the best people to make it our reactionaries and the way that he like threads in the right-wing stuff and those in the movie which is also by the way filled with incredibly good. Deeply felt like social observation and commentary and texture because it's not vapid. It's not. It's not dogmatic that stuff is in there because you can one of the big problems with trying to make a neo exploitation. Movie is that you can't shock people the way you could with exploitation films because people have seen everything we're all desensitized violence doesn't do anything - doesn't move the needle how do you make violence move the needle anymore and Sayla realizes it has to be in contrast to something. The violence has to come as a contrast to the other things in the movies that didn't used to be the case because the movie was a contrast to everything else but now everything is movie. So the it has the contrast has to come inside the film itself and so the contrast of this of this stage sort of Paul Haggis II vibe with just explicit reactionary content. It shocks you a little bit. It jars you just the way that like the the very quiet measured tone of all of his movies makes their explosions of extreme violence shocking and jarring. It actually does jolt you the way that these guys anybody making like ironic exploitation movies doesn't really get around.

They don't really grasp the needle of it and that is why even though I would not actually want her to do this because no one should got no one with talent should go near Marvel. It's just a giant machine that sucks talent it leaves. It's just correct uncreated dead-eyed husks in its wake because they see God like it's. Like the  hot lighthouse. They go to Disney and they see the frozen head of Walt Disney in a vault and it's throbbing and it has like black eyes and they stare into Disney's black eyes and they come out a husk because they've seen into the heart of the dream machine and they know that it is actually the  with Marvel film wise. But he is the only person I could think of who could possibly make something good out of the Punisher right now because if anybody saw the Marvel that the Netflix Marvel Show with Joe Barron Thal which is  one of the big reasons is CGI blood which is of course out of here and something I know that Zeller would never allow by the way they didn't just do CGI blood. On that show. They did CGI muzzle flashes on the guns which is just the  why am I even watching.

This I know Saylor wouldn't do that but what but the other thing that made that thing bad and unwatchable is that it spoke. They tried to make  Punisher woke because they have this thing that has a context the Punisher as a context of like coming out of the reactionary ferment of the 70s. The same thing they gave us death wish Dirty Harry and all this other stuff because of the hot huge dried violent crime racially and the huge rise of racial anxiety and racial friction. He pops out and and there is no way to make you can make him the villain I guess. If you wanted to be woke. You cannot make him the protagonist the traditional protagonists of something and make him woke because vigilantism like that is reactionary inherently going outside the bounds of law to use violence against someone you individually not as some sort of some like revolutionary process of changing the mode of production or it's a social order but as an individual that's I'm sorry that's reactionary he is. Frank castles are reactionary and just because you  give him what Blackwater and proud boys to kill that doesn't change that fact and but the guys that make these shows are all good liberals and so they're very nervous. Is very anxious about that so they work backwards I guarantee you when they said we're doing Punisher and they're only doing Punisher for money. None of them under and Punisher out of inspiration they wouldn't do Punisher. Nobody would it's a  if they wanted to they're doing it because it's where the money is and the money says. This is the thing people like so we want you to make more of them. This is the thing that came out of this specific cultural moment. This is the thing that this is the thing that stands in for a load of male anxiety and a certain hinge point in American history. An expression of like nihilistic violence to over social conflict. What are you gonna do with it oh well okay well that we can't make it back because that that would be bad and people would wash it and then they would want to be like him. It's like they want to be like him. Anyway idiots you made him blow congratulations. Did it stop. Flak jacket. He's not Bo the fact that they've appropriated his symbol shows that you're the one appropriating him. You're appropriating him by making him whoa he can't be you either you have to deal with that back. You want to make him the villain that's like one choice or you have to take him as he is and they're not comfortable with that and so they have to reverse engineer. Sailor would take Frank Castle as he as he was and that would be.


I would make for viewing that would make people go oh my god. It would be like oh that's a bad idea but unless you're accepting the tip of your worldview and you're willing to put that on record then you watch something and then you do it or you believe what it says discreetly not socially but discreetly like obviously. We're all we are all nothing but like the ik ruins of our media consumption but not that's the accrue ins honest on an individual level. You cannot be you cannot be moved into action by any one piece of media which is the thing that nobody can get their head around. No all media has to be good all the time because then we will all we will all be watching it. At the same time we'll all get the same message and the Care Bear stare will just burst out of our chests and we will all live in harmony forever and the thing is that's the only thing they have is as a model for social change because if you do not class politics like this like if you say America is indelibly racist and therefore we can't change capitalism. Then all you can do is like Hector people and make art and do posts until there's so many art and so many posts that everyone just at one moment everyone from the irredeemable or enough people. I guess they would say not but like to 51%. We'll all just snap in to undo mutual understanding. That's their only that's their only hope so like I so yeah I really like dragged across concrete.

Late this poet post a punish mal is honestly on a roll great performances. I haven't seen all of it but blood father was really good and he was really good. At this hacks are Ridge has some of the best. Just grody ass violence I've seen in a movie in a long time and if he does make a use the one a director who if he actually does remake the Wild Bunch I'll allow it because he's the one guy who kind of gets Peck and paws like psycho religious ecstatic communion with film violence because I think for most other purveyors of film violence. It's either wrote or sublimated misogyny or a joke and it is not any of those things for Mel Gibson. It is expiation. It is salvation which it was for Peckinpah so thumbs up for dragged across concrete and yeah. If you're gonna make an exploitation movie and you're a left winger. You can you just have to leave it at the door.

You know you just have to take it as it comes instead of trying to deform it into something it can never be I'm trying to actually when I was in high school. I read a biography of Sam Peckinpah. You can tell this was before the internet that I would never imagine now reading a biography of Sam Peckinpah. But I did because there was nothing to distract me certainly not girls. I was trying I'm trying to check to see if Peckinpah was Catholic. Can't remember. I don't think he was he's like no his family was like Western pioneers so I don't think so. But he certainly had that Catholic fixation on a blood the sanctity of blood so yeah. If you you you could be a left-wing egg maker of exploitation movies and somebody says the purge. The purge movies are actually an interesting case because their premise is such that like that they do have a actual left-wing text which is also possible. Like the text of anything can be any politics you want it to be. It's the subtext I'm talking about I'm talking about. It's. It's uh. It's it's heart and that's why the third one. That's why uh Election Day is so weak at the end because they go live. They go live at the end because they can't handle the the implications of the genre.

They're working it and also they use  CGI and for me you're not doing you're not making exploitation unless you're using squids. I know that CGI is cheaper now so therefore squibs are actually the luxury Cadillac a list thing. But I'm sorry you can find somewhere else to cut you can always find something else to cut if they could put squids and surviving edge weapons. You can find the budget for squids. In your movie. They did squid some. Wild bunch for Christ's sake haha we are looking to do that script reading actually I should bring up Network. I don't know they might not want to do Network but I would like to do Network. Maybe they think that now I would I think they would find that they would think that would be too too self-centered of me. Although you know he's not the main character really. It's William Holden could definitely see we'll play William Holden but we are probably gonna do Miller's Crossing. If we can get everybody on board. I think I think we've we were trying to figure out like the Terms of Service whether that would be a copyright infringement but apparently if you just do it and don't like leave it up. There's not any weird way. That's gonna get brought down. So we're gonna try to do that guess which character I will play Bertie. Ya know I'm not playing a Leo either. Now. I think we're getting Felix how can the Coen.

Brothers make incredible insightful films and then be lives because art and politics aren't the same thing like there's political insurance and there's artistic truth and like that artistic truth is like a prism of all truths and any piece of art is only able to get like one or two refracted rays right of the prism and maybe it might get a little bit of political truth in there. But it's mostly gonna be personal. It's mostly going to be experiential and aesthetic and it's and it's gonna be abstract and then you have to build from that you have to actually build a personality and like a  a firmware update from the every movie you watch. These things have lives of their own might be like what we're all trying to meet my god. It's just nice when you consider how collaborative film is a genre how many how many minds how many efforts how many decisions are made the idea that any of this stuff has there's any coordinating anything you need to grab you just have to be open and this thing is you might not find any and that's fine too but you have to be open to the magic basically the the moments of grace the sublimity of any piece of art because the it's not necessarily going to be resonating on frequencies of the political. But there are other frequencies of truths and beauty that exists and that can be expressed by almost anyone in any place in time. Rudy roll Rudolf Wolff Rudolf work Wurlitzer. Yes I didn't notice from Cincinnati yeah. All right book quick is really good what is alright. This is an interesting question. This cuz.

It's so weird what is the governance ownership of chapo. LLC. Anything is socialist in its structure well. I don't know what that means what I mean we all own it equally. So I guess that is so that's like owner-operated or like worker operated because we're also that what the thing is is that we're not. We're not workers but we're also not capitalists. We're craftsmen. We are. We are this cottage industry craftsman of a bygone era. Like that is that is people want to know like what's the podcaster Miche at least like the the ones who do self like direct distribution like us as opposed to ones that have an ad network or something. It's. It's. It's would you like my layers. I like I'm a I'm a Cooper. Basically. We're all like word Cooper's and you come into our shop and you buy our barrels or not. But we made the barrels and then we get the money for the barrels. That's it. We're not socialists because it's not. It's a pre-modern form of uh. It's it's. It's a it's a. It's a remnant I mean over time. It'll go away like all don's capitalist social relationships will go away but it still exists in in fragmentary form.


I have seen upstream color that guy's wild he just did an interview where he said I basically can't do movies anymore. I'm sick of  trying to make money get money off of them to make them which really should remind. You. I mean how can any of these things that you get that make that spent when you see filmmakers of genuine. Talent just give up because of how hard it is to raise money for things that have like an actual vision behind it. How little does must people care about and like a basic artistic like sense of ownership sense of care how little must everyone care when they're making. You know Avengers how little must everyone care in order to put up with the demands of that much the requirements of that degree of investment you would have to just turn your actual artistic investment into the face you know a little.

I think because he's an old guy trying to tweet more than anything. It's not a form that uh that's that's that he came into. It's a form for people with a completely different social experience. We didn't lie old. People in general are terrible on their I mean and the thing I don't understand about the people who cling so hard to the idea that politics must be expressed in art and it has to on a moral level like if you push them why does it have to be. This way first it might be something about how well you know it hurts. It hurts people of this groups to see things that aren't sensitive to them. But at the base it's know people. See this bad stuff and then they have the bad thoughts and if enough of them see the good stuff they'll have the good thoughts and I don't understand how you can have the 2016 election happen and not realize that that cannot be true or if it's true. It's true to such a way fractional degree that all the pressure in the world in that direction is not going to move anything because the entire culture was arrayed against Trump every cultural output was against Trump and it didn't matter I might do a Spanish Civil War episode. We'll see. It's good like I said my hope my goal would be to get everyone mad at me uh.

Hunter on October is one of those great man that was a real stretch in the late 80s. Early 90s of just some perfect action movies really. It's not. I don't want to I sound old but that  I'll say if they don't make them like that anymore just perfect little propulsive thrillers. The same time is like die hard and uh stuff predator good check it out on frantic time. Crimson Tide's also good I think hunt for October's better but they're both good. Crimson Tide also better than 99% of Ridley Scott's films. So I want to get another another map strike one for Tony Scott. What's happening on my own on what we did. I just finished I just finished the gam which is a delightful little chapter. I might read one quick chapter to end tonight. I don't know I got to see if I can find one there. We go my next chapter will be the town-ho's story someone that someone had the town-ho give their tale that one was very weak. I think it's cuz. It's kind of. It's really overcast today and kind of gloomy. I think a lot of people are outside oh wait.

A minute never mind sometimes it'll go it'll get her out a little bit and then I think they get a little embarrassed that they stopped and then they'll all kind of dare each other to go back up. I will read Ulysses. I'm just not. I'm gonna read I'm getting I'm trying to go through the 20th scent. I'm trying to like go through levels of like semantic facility. Yeah I feel I feel very comfortable with Moby Dick. I'm gonna go to gravity's rainbow which I've always felt harder a harder time getting my head around I'm gonna do Ulysses. I went through a major kurt vonnegut phase. When I was in college. I read like not all of them but a good chunk Galapagos is really good. Breakfast of champions also very very good but I like most people the first one of his I'm. The bread was slaughterhouse-five in high school and it's one of those books that does a thing to certain people not everybody but you if you're in the right frame of mind. And if you have the right demographic background probably it hits you. It's different and it really does make you start thinking differently about the world.

Someone wants me to read the leash or I get back to that one might not be there. Yet these Oh somebody wants me to talk about the Demiurge alright. I'll see if I can find this thing and then I'll talk a little bit about the Demiurge. So it's in the Gnostic Christians were early Christian sect. They believed that the material world was essentially created by an evil spirit that intervened between God and eternity to create a false version of the world that we all live in in material bodies created for the purpose of keeping us from each other and from God most importantly and that it was our duty in life to try to transcend that category through concentration of will and faith and spirit gnosis. As it's called to understand that higher truth and I think that that's a useful metaphor for the way that we all live in a reality that is really constructed by an evil demon that evil. Dean being demon that evil demon being the collective historical weight of all humans who came before us the history of all dead generations weighing on the minds of the living. We live in structures that we are born into that we did not have any hand in creating and those those structures are deformed like our expect our meet our expectations of things our ideology that we operate under our expectations of other people. Our reward systems are deformed. They are there they're bent away from harmony with nature harmony with other people harmony with God.

They are bent towards rudeness and and hatred and and exploitation domination fear misery because of the intervening because of the failures of generations of people to see the world as it really is because of all of the all of the things that they have to deal with that others have placed on them. So that's the Demiurge and thing is is that we can we can transcend it. We can we can we can bring the Tim The Crooked Timber of reality closer to it to an even keel. But it just takes a lot of  time and a lot of faith and and a lot of will and those things are all sapped by the culture. We live in. The demo is basically directing us away from the holy and towards towards selfishness. But all but selfishness is at the end of the day self-defeating because we can have nothing without each other. We can have nothing without each other ah my favorite chapter. I'm not sure yet which one I really like the most. But let's do the leash or here. It is oh yes. This is very good well. It's so short that's so perfect. It's like three four perfect five perfect paragraphs some chapters back.


One Bulkington was spoken of at all. New new landed mariner encountered a new bedford at the end when on that shimmering winter's night the Pequod thrust her vindictive boughs into the cold malicious waves who should I see standing in her helm but Bulkington I looked with sympathetic on fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a for years. Dangerous voyage could sow unrest ting Li push off again for still another to patch to astern the land seems scorching to his feet wonderful as things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs. This six-inch chapter is the stone 'less grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor. The port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort.

Hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all of its kind to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that ships dyrus jeopardy. She must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might. She crowds all sail off shore and once in so doing fights against the very winds that fain would blow. Her homeward seeks ah flashed seas landlessness again for refuges sake for lauren lee rushing into peril. Her only friend her bitterest foe ye know ye now Bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see if that's mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shores but as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth. Shoreless.

This indefinite is God so better is it to perish in that howling infinite then being gloriously dashed the Lee. Even if that were safety for worm-like that oh who would crave and crawl to land terror of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart out bulking ttan barely grimly demigod up from the spray of the ocean. Perishing straight up leaps aye apotheosis that's actually a good chapter to read right after talking about Gnosticism because I feel like that if you want to understand like what I mean by like the Demiurge achill nature of reality. This thing if the glimpse all deep earnest thinking prayer meditation communion with our understanding of the infinite which that's God in any language is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her see while the wildest winds of slave of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish Shore because we have to live in this world and living in this world distracts us and pulls us away from our understanding of our mutual interdependence and in fact our mutual identical miss and it pulls us off of that beam and that that is and then we make a world that is demonic and we make that world and all collectively we are the Demiurge. So will you are the Demiurge I am the Demiurge. The Slayer is greater and smaller extents. We're all building a world that makes it hard for people who are living in it to find God whatever that means to find transcendence from this seeming prison of isolation and confusion and loneliness and fear this do doomed to die doomed to eternal night without ever understanding. Any of it alright guys I'll talk to you soon. This is a good one bye-bye.
