Hey guys this work. It's a flip I guess not. I guess I'm stuck with this. So I'm I'm out here doing Instagram live one more time because it's the one day strike at Amazon and other places and I know that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism which is such a banal and true fact. I don't hi Lana. Hi John I do not let anybody by the way if you know me and you want to come on cuz pop on give me a request and I'll say hi if you don't know I mean I need a little bit more. I think I need a little bit more degree of comfort with you before. I make that move at least one trying to formalize this stuff anyway. So there's no let's look at suffering capitalism. It's fine to do whatever you think you need to do but for me given my degree of I do not have any need to be on to be streaming on Twitter and resign right now.

So I'm not going to I feel like if that's the attitude you should take like every time. There's a strike especially for companies like this that are about convenience there's someone who gets really mad and says well what if you need what and they create these these imaginary situations where someone would need to use the service and it's like well. Then they should use it but you're not in that situation. You're usually need to know what your own situation is. How much do you depend on this thing how much would it cost you not to utilize it when other people who are of good faith are doing something that you agree with and so if they tell me that I'm gonna just do it you don't have to no one else has to do but to me. That is how I align my greater belief in the rightness of the strikers cause with my life.

I would feel if I was on. I could be doing this on Instagram. I could be doing this on twitch right now and I would feel nothing but a very little bit of job of guilt. But it would still be a little bit of guilt that I would have to deal with instead of trying to figure out the world by instead of applying my mind to what's in front of me the way I've been doing now for the last almost week. Part of my mind would be distracted by the Magon guilt that I was on twitch. Now I can stream to you. Guys directly don't feel guilty and also by thinking about that and thinking about my relationship to twitch and my relationship to boycotts. In general I understand my own motivations even better than I did so the whole thing for me good and hopefully it'll have an impact that I am less certain of. But I certainly hope that we can get together some degree of social coordination to counteract the terrifying or collapse accumulated capital of guys.

Like these O's it's like yikes. It's very scary stuff and anyone who wants to fight them. And I know we're on twitch and that is that's an even smaller hypocrisy that I deal with that one. I think I can justify just out of its. It's a good way to get out to people an idea that they might find useful and then I can justify but considering that there are other options available and people specifically said don't access this site.

On this day. I'm just gonna do it like I said if you make a different conclusion. It's because you have different material circumstances to deal with and so. I'm not going to claim to know you. That is why you can be totally judgmental of other people's actions but not judge them for them. If you're aware that they were all brought about by conditions outside of every individuals control but that when you're in that superposition of being aware of that then you have to choose so how are you guys doing unless I got a really tasty question.

I'll be back on twitch tomorrow well see how do we counteract businesses like warm are shutting down stores to avoid unionizing draft. See. That is where that's what suggests that in a retail service economy like the one we have we actually have to bring together the boycott and the strike to bring together the power of the consumer and the worker because in a way that wasn't the case under large-scale and isn't the case under large-scale manufacturing. The customer truly is the consumer I mean the the the worker truly is the consumer in the retail in the retail context so like as a consumer you have a relationship to Walmart that is more akin to a worker than that's something manager and so the key to effective action against mega. Corporations like Amazon and Walmart is not consumer boycott and it's not individual. I mean it could start with but it can't be sufficient to do. Individual strikes with an individual area is because as you see they could just shut them down. You need a coordination inside and outside between customers and employees a revoking labor in the form of a strike and then revoking patronage in the form of a boycott. They may go together. That's the only way to actually it punish them. That's the only way to stop them from closing. A Walmart is if it will have repercussions outside of that Walmart and that's only if people respond with their role as in their role. As a consumer. They have a they have a role as a consumer if to the degree to which it's coordinated with work of the of the of the labor of the workers like boycotts get rightfully poo-pooed by a lot of people because they are imagined to happen isolation and in isolation boycotts don't work. I just said that as you typed it boycotts don't work in isolation but as we are seeing in a post-industrial landscape strikes they work better than boycotts but they aren't 100% effective and that a strike would be made could be made more effective if it was in conjunction with a boycott in the context of retail like big-box stores and stuff like that. But once again it's not an on/off switch. It's not a works good enough to fix it or it doesn't work at all and as a failure it will work to a degree and then other things happen and then you gather up the reactions to those new material conditions and you move from there and it's maybe. It's no longer a boycott and strike. Maybe it's something else but you move on depending on your recognition of the changed material circumstances having made a by the way I'm sure most of you know the story of the of the Haymarket bombing the Haymarket martyrs Albert Parsons August B's those brave martyrs the bomb thrown at the Haymarket rally.

The dead cops cops shooting in the crowd the frenzied Red Scare the crackdown on the city of Chicago ever since the ginned up trial which led to the unjust executions of what I believe it's seven and Haymarket martyrs one of them. No the bomb maker yeah. I'm already off one of them Lois Lane the German bomb maker. He was scheduled to be executed but he had I wonder I wonder. I want to look this up. So I have the correct quote. It's an amazing quote. He had he was able. He had smuggled into his cell by one of his visitors a blasting cap in his mouth and he bit down on it and essentially blew his face off pretty. Gruesome botched execution similar to Wolfe Tone.

The famous Irish Republican revolutionary who similarly botched cutting his own neck also rope spear box shooting himself blasted his job anyway Louis Lange as he lay dying on the floor of his cell wrote in his own blood while his face was blown up. He wrote hurray for anarchy in his own blood on the floor of a cell after blowing his face off that's pretty hurray for anarchy Hawke di Marquis in Germans don't get used to the IG if the strikers if that if the strike is off tomorrow I'll be back on twitch but as long as their employees are calling a strike. I'll be not on twitch so yeah. Though the Haymarket martyrs who's led to the creation of Mayday. They weren't all anarchists and they were all part. They were all believers in one degree or another to the to the notion of the propaganda of the deed and to the industrial syndicalism which were the chief practices of anarchism basically assassinating people and trying to organize workers into revolutionary unions. Not ones interested in things like well or conditions of the pension.

But that was the incident that led to Mayday becoming the international labor day that was not to be it was it was. It was the inciting incident for making it into a International Day to honor labour and it was used as a way to agitate towards socialist ads. Of course that's why we created Labor Day as a deep politicized Americanized day where we can study labor not as a process of exploitation or we could celebrate labor not in the context of it. Being you know an unjust exploitation of someone's species being which is what it was under Mayday. Now hey you got a job. It's a way to celebrate oh. They changed made a to law day during the Red Scare but guess what it's still there you could still call it Mayday.

You can still I'm sure the anarchists in Seattle who like to go crazy around this time are not happy with their inability to do it maybe they're gonna like kick out their own front windows. I don't know they're under warranty but this is actually a good segue to something. I wanted to talk about referring referencing something I had said later or earlier and that is that we're talking about Chomsky and we're talking about anarchism. Libertarianism and I said that champs Chomsky is a liberal and people got justifiably defensive about that people who respect Chauncey's views people who find liberal to be an epithet and not a descriptor people who you know feel a lot of value in the anarchists tradition which is totally understandable and now you know I thought about it a little more and I realized that I misspoke that I think the basic principle I was arguing is correct but I did not elaborate clearly enough on why so my basic argument there was so some leftists like Mehdi Hassan and are dragging out as Democrats. Do every four years. The increasingly aged Noam Chomsky they wind him up like a teddy ruxpin and they ask him should you vote for the Democrat and he says yes and then people like maybe asan safe. See Chomsky says vote for Biden yeah you're not to the left of Chomsky so that means the left position is to vote for Biden and now may be a sign. I think probably has bad faith in that but I don't think that Chomsky has bad faith. I think a lot of like you see people talk about how when this comes up they'll say oh you know is there MIT all those years and defense contracts and I mean the bulk of his work of the volkl that worked on life belies. That being real I mean he clearly says what he believes he has paid the price for sending what he believes his whole life and and the way I know that he bears Brice is because he answers every email he receives which means he is clearly at some level seeking truth.

No one would do that if they worked so I believe Chomsky what he said when he says that his reason gets him to vote. He provide this is where liberalism comes in because I think you can listen to me and tell me if I'm wrong or not. I think that that Chomsky's liberalism is why he I think he's wrong first of all about voting for Biden and I think he is liberalism to just not just to say he's wrong in isolation. But you've only ever explained something if you've explained why look a lot of that happens on the Internet is people describing a condition and then calling that an argument no one made an argument until you've added the why so I will make the proposition first of all will take me as as assumed proposition. Among us that yeah you don't have to vote for Biden. That's silly you don't agree with them now let's figure out why we disagree with them on this.

This is once again how I have reasoned it out. You can tell me how you think I'm wrong if you do and the reason I make that people said Noam Chomsky is a liberal and that came up is because they had an intuitive understanding that that was tied to his wrongness in this case and a lot of people took that the wrong way and they're like oh do you mean it like he's too stupid or he doesn't get it or he's too because when you say someone's a liberal you mean there's some combination of stupid and greedy. There's some combination of too dumb to get the point or materially positioned where they don't want socialism so they're either drum dumb or greedy if they're liberal. Like that's what liberal is. It's it's some combination of those two things and the thing is we all are to some extent and how much we are depends on our fixed position in space-time and the life we've lived so when I say that Chomsky is a liberal guess. What Karl Marx was also a liberal to different extents now to the extent that Chomsky as a liberal is the extent that he has explicitly said that his vision of the world his vision of politics.

His vision of practice all comes from enlightenment thinking he has said that a million times he even points to a specific relatively obscure German humanist. As like his his foundational influence. I'm gonna find the guy's name I keep forgetting it Chomsky enlightenment. Some crowd influence one of my people one square-headed. goddamnit now I feel like I'm losing you guys because I can't find the name of this dude. It's some dumb name anyway I'll find it at some point in the meantime. What matters is is that he fixes himself in the liberal tradition of personhood. So when he says you know I want to do X Y & Z because after the liberal tradition what he means is he he believes in socialism is a moral proposition flowing from the inviolability of the individual. That's where the liberalism concept. He believes that the individual is an unmoved place of meaning an essence that there is that a soul exists. It's not necessarily spiritual but there is a individual human consciousness that is unmoved and that moves upon others.

That's the liberal conception of the self. It arose as the economy in Western Europe became more complicated became more abstracted and required a greater degree of abstracted thinking in order to process it and that created a more abstract notion of the self than the more immediate motion notion of the Renaissance era or certainly the medieval era where everyone believes in God. So thus that version of the self that emerges to compensate for this new more complicated this this new more complex economic arrangement and social system that you're in makes you into that liberal subject. So he carries that with him and he said that and so that means that he's approaching I'm sorry so that's why he is a liberal when he approaches the question of should you vote for Biden. Now Marx start also as a liberal subject because he was born in the early 1800s in in south western Germany. A region that was one of the on one of the areas near the R r Valley that was one of the original hotbeds of industrial capitalism. Now Dutch real capitalism was still in its infancy but he saw it and his life took place in tandem with the arriving of industrial capitalism witnessing that in his life and witnessing its it's impression on the world around him made him think differently and it made him take the dialectical processes that lead but he noticed lead through economic development like what powered us from slave states to feudalism to capitalism.

It was a dialectical conflict of forces within the society slave Freeman serf master. A serf Lord worker owner that's a badess how society comes into recognition of itself as a society is through conflict within it. He applied that as heigl did Hegel did to the self now. They say that they do it at different sides but that comes back to the same. Thing the self is a series of resolved contradictions. It is not an individual monad that moves up its own volition. It is always being made by what's around it and that means that when we examine a political question we have to examine it in time and space. So that is why Chomsky looks at the question of vote for biding two dimensionally.

Here's the Democratic Party. Here's the Republican Party. The Democratic Party is less evil. It's less bad. Its platform is not as bad. The people who make it up are better people in the sense that they have more agreed-upon stated values that accord with what we think is the good so. Whoo so anyway. So that's the Democrats are on that axis better than Republicans and so Chomsky says I want what's best for everybody. The Democrats want more of what's best for people's and Republicans do therefore I have to go for Democrats and the thing is that's correct. He reasoned that out right he's right but only on that mirror level. He is not interposed the context on top of it in the context of Chomsky misses because he's not applying dielectric reasoning to the question is the role that the Democratic Party plays in making the Republican Party worse.

Over time they drive each other the degree to which the presently construed Democratic Party is allowed to maintain its structure the people in charge of it and it's a material base as in who contributes money to maintaining it that will continue to as it has drive the Republicans back to the right even more reactionary so the rule is even worse and that means that when they take power they only intensify a process that's that's going to happen either way like take. For example if Biden is president during a world defining economic collapse following because like okay say we get the virus under control. When we let back up. There is no return to normal. There is a huge demand gap that will have to be filled and filling. It is will be a bigger challenge than the Great Depression. If the Democrats are in charge of that process the way the Republicans were during the early days of the depression. They will be the party associated with austerity because they will be doing the bidding of actual capital and in a situation like that austerity is demanded so they will be the cap reactionary party which means that the Republicans they're not going to get less racist. They're getting it maybe a little rest racist. They're gonna get more redistributed and maybe it'll be enough to get them into power at which point you have a cyst.

You have like a mild social a few mild social democratic trappings to a system that is mostly dedicated to like an ethnos you flipped it over you could have had the other thing. So whatever that is that dimension is absent from Chomsky's analysis of the situation and so it's wrong and the reason he gets it. Wrong is because he comes from a liberal conception of the self. He thinks that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are distinct things that move of their own volition based on what the people within them want. That's not the case they are brought into being in conflict one another with one another always at the personal end system and intellectual level. So that is why Chomsky is wrong and it comes from him being a liberal like I said Marx was also oh here's here's the here's the kicker Marx. Also growing up in the early 1800s had a liberal conception of the self that he interposed on top of dialectical materialism so he accepts personhood to the level that shops he does of all humans are worthy of respect that the golden rule applies to all recognizable humans depending on how we define that but then he puts dialectical materialism on top of it. Chomsky doesn't and so that can run off in all kinds of wrong directions when it comes in contact with a place that has a fault beyond the conditions that produce to the original insight.

All right that made sense I felt better about that one. I gotta say like this is why the key to all like thought and right action and all those notions are never really understood for Buddhism and Christianity and Islam and and from socialism is a practice. The need to do them every moment and so like I felt kind of crippled by how people were gonna. Think I was crazy when I started explaining things a few of the episodes ago now by repetition to keep doing it and from hearing back from people who hurt me I have more confidence that fear is gone. So I'm able dwara to concentrate I'm getting across the ideas and I'm better able to to get the ideas across. I am able to concentrate more perfectly because I'm less worried about appearing crazy because I got feedback in the form of you guys talking to me saying. I wasn't that's it that is encapsulants a process and that is what the liberal conception of the self cannot absorb. And that is why anarchism even if it has the right goals will go about go about achieving them less efficiently like it could still get there over enough space and time but compared to other approaches. Given the limits of our lives and the limits of matter in the universe. There are more effective ways to go about it so once again I am asking for all all feedback and basically the way I approach.

All this stuff is if you say something what I realized is is that when I was a teak Smith when my job was just piping off takes the way that I would respond if I got to a level of understanding of an issue that I did not fully grasp I would have an emotional response. Usually it would be some sort of panic and shame that I didn't know that panicking shame would have to be transformed into over over compensation elsewhere form of dropping a big name of someone whose book I probably hadn't read you know saying something loud and obnoxious or performing my anger because that distracted from the fact that I didn't hit bottom on a point and that left me ruthless. I don't know where to go if I don't know why I think what I think and dialectical reasoning which is something I had seen written about and talked about never understood now thanks to absolute luck. I'm in a position where I can explain it to myself enough to convince myself to do it and that makes me better at it.

It's literally gross and it comes because but it only and the thing is. It happens no matter what but if we recognize the process if we recognize that it is through resolution of conflicts. Then we recognize the need for action at all times the need for acting on our through our and then people say yes but what about the crippling postmodern condition. The crippling quotation marks on everything that endless recursion to self-consciousness well once again if you add another dimension if you had time to the dimension that problem goes away so I believe simultaneously. This is a little up there and I won't go too far. The fact I could well but I simultaneously in equal measure believe that all actions up to including my decision to lift up.

This spindrift. Grapefruits reckon water and taking a sip from it are fully and completely physically determined. I had no say in the matter if viewed from outside the process if viewed from God's eye. If viewed outside of space-time. It is its billiards. It's direct causality. There's nowhere you can get down to a level and find something that wasn't caused directly by something else.

But there comes an inflection point if you are aware enough of time and time as it occupies the space that you occupy you can recognize your position. You can recognize the determined position of everyone else. You can understand why everything is the way it is why you are where you are why the person you're talking to is in their position to you why they're mad at you either happy to see you why anything why that garbage truck is barreling towards you why anything why there's a recession why the TV show isn't good anymore why you have a answer and if you have an answer you can act from full confidence and that means it doesn't matter that technically your actions were determined. In the moment. You see every option and you have the confidence to do the leap of faith. The character guard speaks up the leap of faith comes from having confidence in your decision. The decision gets confidence from your degree of perception that when you are making a decision to do something you are confident that you are perceiving correctly and if you're only perceiving space or only in a little bit of time you will be wracked with doubt and it will paralyze you. But if you have enough consciousness of time as a dimension on top of. Space then you can act with full freewill and the thing is is that you always aren't acting on freewill. It's just at a different level like when you jack off instead of cleaning a room you're acting a free will what it boils down to is. You want to jack off to distract yourself from the fact that you are not doing a thing that is in accord with what will get you to a conscious and a kind of sensation of time and you don't want to clean your room because it's boring and it's boring to me because our physical activity involves you know some degree of mental mental output. The more mental output it takes up.

The less space is left for the questions. That's where ennui comes from that's where like existential acts comes from. It's from that the degree to which you're not directly engaged which is why people seek things like drugs sex jacking off war. They're seeking the heightening to non. They're seeking the heightening of symbolic reality beyond words. That's what they're looking for and so if you're gonna clean your room. The only way that's gonna get you to not feel that way is to literally keep thinking while you're picking. Things up keep thinking about picking things up thinking about what's going on around you how long is that gonna take it's gonna suck. You have to the amount of like present potential pleasure that you have to give up to keep doing that eventually if you don't believe in it if you don't believe it doing it to get there. You're gonna try something else like jacking off. So there is no such thing as a contradiction in though such thing as a hypocrisy. Everything you do or don't do is because of what you truly believe and becoming conscious of time aka mindful aka in the moment. Aka dialectical is the degree to which you can actually put faith behind action all right. That's what I got.

I don't know if it made sense I don't know if I'm there's problems with me as I'm talking though like now a little bit of the worries going back. But it's now. It's after not during which makes me feel better about it. You guys want to hear me talk a little bit about fascism because I realized I've talked a lot on to shows and I've thought a lot over the years about fascism and I realized I was missing some significant parts about it. Significantly. The question is really powerful and really on people's minds now because we see how insufficient our institutions are dealing with the current crisis. What if fascism comes back what's gonna bring fascism back and that has led to further splits down at different levels of meaning different levels of semantic translation that have resulted in now there's a big fight on the left about is fascism a real threat. The fash is there a chapo to fash hype line. Do we have to worry about fashion. The streets should we be daxing peppe's because if we don't they're going to march like like the essay to Nuremberg and I think that there's been a lot of heat expended on this topic.

I know that I have generally been skeptical of the looming threat of fascism but I haven't been able to express it. Then. I feel like now I'm a little closer to understanding it and so I want to just get it out there and see if you guys make sense of it so my main objection to people wanting to label things in the current moment is fascism is my knowledge how about that historically fixed fascism was in terms of its heart. It's impossible to imagine fascism outside of the post-world War. One context of Europe like the cultural ingredients were very specific but also you want to have a word for you know nationalist authoritarianism when it shows up but once again that was because I wasn't thinking dialectically. I was thinking only along the planes of binaries and not the binary. The nesting binaries so now I really not what I realized if you guys can't tell me if I'm wrong is that the root of my objection there that fascism has like a fixed interwar context really does lead you to a further insight that tells you really what the threat is in the moment in my opinion. So first of all we have to understand what fascism is now. It's one thing to say fascism is capitalism in crisis that's true the thing is it's capitalism.

In a specific type of crisis. It is in a crisis of it isn't a material crisis it is in a crisis where you have the the built up industrial capacity but you don't have the inputs. There is a demand shortfall otherwise known as a depression. Now capitalism was relatively new in the 20s. Modern democracy was even newer so in the caldron of these things came this thing that solved a lot of questions about mass politics and about crisis of capitalism. But in the wrong way they've solved a lot of the problems of maintaining a system but at the expense of you know the soul of the people living under it so if we think of there being two types of inputs to cap into cat into capitalism or any economic system. If we think of them as human labor obnoxiously put by and more generally a bio power the term that that Foucault invented there refer to just human inputs into into human systems like intellectual and literal like seniors the supply of power and technology that is the balance of all economic orders that have been risen to this complexity of having tools. So it was it's so it was. This was a bio crisis. This is not a crisis of technology.

It was a crisis of inputs and fascism solutions. Fascism specific pollution solution to a crisis of inputs in capitalism is to solve that by grabbing inputs from outside first by building up military report forces that had to be used because military resources are the kind of things that if they're not used they literally take up space and undermine your ability to maintain economic regularity but take then use their military to literally take from outside. It was it's like capitalism is dying. It's a fish on the beach flopping and its last attempts to get some oxygen came in the form of bursting outward to grab and hold and of course because that is gonna bring counter responses in the form of everyone else standing together against you you're probably going to die but you wouldn't necessarily. I think that fill kid dick made a very good point in his observation of the plot of the land of high castles. So even if the Nazis and the Japanese had won World War two and become the new Cold War. Their fascist regimes were structured for that environment. They were structured for the skipper the frantic grab for resources in the scarcity moment of a significant capitalist crisis.

In capitalism. They're not built for scared plenty. They're not built for growth and so for no reason at all. They're gonna end up nuking each other because fascism is not built for those conditions but the impulse the impulses all like alright so now. We're gonna have another crisis like the Great Depression the impulse within capitalism to solve that problem through hyper exploitation of bio power. Basically like that's what that's what I meant by expanding. We're using your the hyper exploiting bio power to build up the capacity to literally enslave the forces of others in the form of the slobs who were to be literally turned into a slave race. So that's that problem in capitalism still exists of how to how to solve the bio power technology issue.

Now there's a technology. There is a potential technology solution to that which is you know oh we get a free energy or you. Know. 3d printing or a number of people were talking about in Wired magazine five years ago. But if that doesn't happen it doesn't look like it is because honestly a lot of these. A lot of these currents end up looking like scans to get VC money retro actively so so the problem is still there.

There's still a technological prop like barrier. So the if we're going to keep capitalism basically and we can't solve the problem technologically which was true under in German in Europe. After World War World War one they had a economic problem that an economic crisis that could not be solved technologically. They had to enslave and exploit bio power like the the other solution to that would have been to communal eyes to share the like to share more evenly the surplus and reduce the pain and the accompanying social crisis caused by the pain from hyper exploitation. Now some countries did that to some different degrees like dumbass Jonah Goldberg says that the New Deal is Nazism because it had Public Works no the New Deal had the same features some of the same features as Nazism to do to socialize surplus for productively. Nazism dips socialize surplus productively but that's not all it didn't do that's not all it did. It also built up this military safe that had to be used if you if you would agree to which you draw surplus down and use that to alleviate disruption and pain caused by crust crisis. This is which capitalism is contained basically the way FDR came to it in the United States that's one way to go and you could go farther like if things had gone differently.

If the Tai Qing sticks had fallen differently we would have built socialism in America or something much closer to it out of the New Deal. Things intervened later to stop that from happening but we were on a trajectory thanks to a general tendency in America because of its specific outlay to move things in that direction. Germany because of its specific outlay of material conditions went towards solving it with hyper exploitation and destruction of bio power.

We are in the same boat. Now we're going to be anyway. I mean we're already there a lot of us already there. More of us are going to be in the boat as things continue to get bad and we're gonna have the same crisis of capitalism. There's gonna be the same technological limit on on increasing surplus that way. That means there's gonna have to be hyper exploitation of bio power which of course is why one of the things I have pointed out earlier about fascism in a different episode. I mean inebriated past was that one that feature of fascism is that it brings colonial practices into the Metropole now if we see colonialism as capitalism reaching out in its like in the death throes of its productive state within a country to gain more resources and markets that would cease to sustain itself and then you have a crisis of capitalism in which you know because first that there's a weird. There's a weird dynamic with with empires where at first they're enriched and then over time as like the networks solidify. The extent of Empire actually becomes a burden on the middle State but it's okay because it could be afforded. Eventually there's a crisis.

Those things starts those beams start cracking and all of a sudden. The bio power you need to hyper exploit isn't on the periphery anymore. It's in your home country and you have to and you have these tools you've used on those natives to use on your people. So what you're seeing is the response to a input crisis by hyper exploitation and and destruction of biopharm and that is a possibility now but here's the thing and here's why I hesitate to use the word fascism to describe what I think is the danger we they're still gonna hit a technological limit on how much they can increase surplus or whatever absent exploitation and hyper exploitation and destruction of biopharm. But that level is way higher than it was in the twenties way higher. So we have much more technological so there's much more technological undergirding of society and our political order.

Now what that means is there's much less. There's much less of a bio power aspect of political power back in the twentieth political power that bodies in the streets over time as capitalism got more complicated that as middle-class grew and a symbol symbolic language got more complicated. Language fled to the actual like boardrooms of onion the executive suites of power only and then it was just a symbol for people to respond to because they no longer had their hands on the real wheels of power anymore. Now we have such a technologically advanced society and the biomechanism of politics is so impoverished that if they decided that they needed to execute like the fascist playbook in terms of hyper exploitation to resuscitate surpluses they don't need the mass movement that Nazism represented. They don't need people in the streets. They don't need brown shirts or proud boys. They have invested power in alienated machine out. Machine tools surveillance CCTV computers.

GPS drones whatever the degree to which that is accumulated to capital and to the capitalist state to sense the 20s. The degree to which that is accumulated is the degree to which the need to have a mass right-wing movement of any kind falls away because you don't need them. You don't need the bodies. You don't need the beat boys in the streets with guns you don't need Gavin McGinnis. You have the state arrayed with a technological advantage over regular people that is undefeatable. You don't need to further bolster Authority with with popular legitimacy. Because that's what fascism was. It was an attempt to give give capitalism the be the popular legitimacy necessary for it to continue now in order for those people to believe in capitalism. They needed to give them scapegoats for why things weren't getting better enough and that's what that's the engine that leads to the Holocaust. We didn't need to do it that they felt they did because they convinced themselves. It was necessary because it was an underlying fundamental lie that they told to keep capitalism going because there was such a mass there was such a huge role of people in the in creating state power state power. I mean my god the brick. The German state almost got overthrown like three times in the 20s. My Sparta sis or whatever and a botched general strikes that was a environment in which popular legitimacy needed to adhere to any regime that was going to continue to exist. It would be ripped up up otherwise and fascism was a way to do that. I don't think that need in the system exists anymore. I think it is a byproduct of the system and you see deformed smaller versions of it but because we have such an impoverished political bio terrain. They're not relevant to the struggle because they're not at the point of four.

The point of force is in a wedding in Yemen he just as easily be annihilating a militia gathering in Montana and if things go in one way he will be but it will not require a mass political woman to do it. It will require new ID a lot ideologies but they will have to apply to fewer and fewer people because they'll need fewer and fewer people to push the buttons and the people who aren't pushing the buttons can literally at that point of crisis be exterminated. He's dabbing on us folks oh yeah booyah. What we call right-wing populism is a vestige and an echo of that but in a new context in which the political realm is deeply. Tecnológica technologized and dehumanized it. All takes place on screens. Politics takes place on screens and then what rallies which are literally like going to a concert. You know. It's like watching TV and then go to the movies that constitutes like the act of watching TV and going to the movies. The actual act of it sitting in a chair looking at the screen in your house going outside sitting in a chair and looking at something else. We're going to the theater or whatever those two acts constitute the sum total of most people including me political activities that is different than when you have thousands of people in streets punching each other and fighting and occupying factories and doing direct combat conflict with the state over its resources distribution and in that situation you don't really not only do not need men in the streets you couldn't get them. If you wanted to like those guys. The black the brown shirts were willing to die and they did die. A large number is the horse less light which was the song which was the theme song of the the stomach might long. The brown shirt was about them were martyred young si officer who was killed by a communist even though in reality it was like some sort of fight over a sex worker. He was a pamper but like that was part of it it was like living or dying were part of it. Now it is it's a cathartic theater.

All those jackass like everyone's. Their pants about those absolute lumps hanging around the Michigan courthouse. They're allowed to do that because they're not a threat to any power structure and see that's different in other countries. Like I would be much more comfortable saying that whatever is going on in India shares those features because the technological balance is so much different because there's three people for one thing I've read her fascism. I like Paxton's book on fascism a lot because contextualize it and like actions as opposed to ideology because honestly I feel like anybody who wants to talk about fascism and their sources are like thinkers even if it's guys like Ebola or meniscus mold bug or any of these guys you're missing the plane. Smash ISM was a praxis. It was a it was a attempt to channel popular support and popular mobilization away from socialism down the easier road of a co-opted populism because the Nazis had a much easier road to take power than the Soviet. The Communists did even though they had similarly huge followings similarly mobilized street bands. It was because the state wasn't stepping on the necks of the Nazis so it's a cynical recognition that you can skip the steps like Mussolini looks and sees hey. I can use this rhetoric in these ideas to get people in the streets to give me power and I don't have to worry about landlord hiring some mob dude to blow my brains out with a shotgun sometime when I'm taking a getting arrested because the people in power need me just to to channel some of that away and to redirect it in a fight to suppress it. It's purely cynical ooh. The person who makes that move in that decision has no values so anybody who made the pivot to because you could talk all you want about socialists inspired Nazism or fascism but at them at that moment of choice like I said you're only those guys were destined to be Nazis by their conditions. If you look through it. Every decision was predetermined but in the moment they chose to be a Nazi and the moment they chose to say you know what this whole working-class thing is too tough.

There's too many obstacles. I can use some of these other elements and some of these other critiques without getting the stake down my back now that should tell me something the fact that the state doesn't want. Me doesn't want to stop. Me should tell me that they're not interested in ending the exploitation that is the cause of all of this. If they were they wouldn't let me take power. So I should think about that and if you don't if you ignore that because you're too greedy or you're too dumb. Then you're not a socialist anymore. You're you've you've gone off on another tangent. You're in another. You you've stepped off into another parallel dimension bye-bye because that's a moral choice. It's a moral choice and an intellectual choice. It's a test and you failed it both ways because look at the fascists that there was not a stable basis for a society you. Up like sorry the German state. The German people could not do what you thought they could do Adolf. Objectively. You were wrong like Adolf was one of the few gods who can know definitively that he liked lost. He basically hit. The Hitler basically knows more than any other hurt. One of the few human beings on earth who knows what Satan felt like in Paradise. Lost because he was God. He was remaking the world with his voice basically on a principle that he believed as deeply as I believed in life but the thing is that outcome would have been. It was determined in the react real he was because he couldn't wait. He needed to have it now which means he needed to see it happen in front of him which means that he took a bunch of shortcuts that got him. The Germans they failed me but then of course. He also failed them and he knew that as he blew his brains out he knew that so no one went to hell harder. Then no one was cast into hell with greater alacrity than Adolf Hitler. Yes of course yes become a communist and start organizing essential workers. I agree with that the problem is I don't have sufficient confidence in a specific set of actions that will get me there yet and that's the thing one of the things that defeats growth. Is you label yourself as having certain capacities and then you just never try again if you don't judge yourself and say I have insufficients to dispatch. Now. I might not later you'll find that you can do things a lot easier I love Oh. Someone asks about Wilhelm Reich.

I only know about the Oregon box and I love the concept of Oregon. I think it's a very good metaphysical like visualization of a real phenomenon excuse me well. I somebody says our office workers management or labor. They are like most things a degree. They are to a degree like burgers and they're to a degree management and their relationship to management and labor is contingent on the specific moment. You're talking about census much details I can get into and that's one of the reasons it's hard to talk anywhere. Let alone online is because you end up making shortcuts linguistically and symbolically that reduce the actual content of what you're trying to get across and then people don't fully get what you're trying to say so like. If I tried to get more specific. There. I would start using words wrong because because I don't have the granular knowledge of the situation down to the level of like almost pure visuals simple so no Dualla to let's see. That's the thing dualism is a trap. If you think that there's only dualism the binaries are trapped. If you think there are only binaries but there are the universe is made up of binaries binary opposites trying to occupy the same space at the same time and being cast out by that action. But there are so many of them happening at so many different levels but also everything is purely relative to its two other things everything is purely relevant but also everything is objectively one way or the other but not at the same time until you notice at the same time until you open shorteners box and then they collapse into one moment where certain positions obtain where there is a binary being discussed where you are not talking you're talking about a degree.

That's why I think the fast pipeline stuff is very funny because like I am foundationally opposed like I can tell you I I think I can tell you I feel more confident. I guess. I'll say it this way. The aura I got it maintain you know even keel. I feel more confident. I feel that I could more confidently. This quick describe not why Nazis are wrong than the people who put most effort into defeating them online and the reason for that is because or the reason that they fight so hard against the Nazis online is because they know they're bad and they're right that they're bad. But they're not fully aware of why they're bad. They only know some of the reasons and instead of pursuing them further for other specific reasons and specific influences. They flee from the question and that is why they have to no platform and that's why they have to abolish. The idea of anyone else not create categories of unthinkable thought because that's the only way that they can deal with the unresolved trauma of not having thought through what they believe because they're right that Nazis are categorically bad but they've got to that reasoning insufficiently and so that leaves them with a lot of excess emotional energy around the name and the word and the idea of Nazis that they unproductively direct emotionally instead of where it would be more productively placed. All right guys. Pretty fun I will be back on twitch tomorrow and yeah. There's not the one-hour time limit on Twitch like there is on Instagram. So I think that'll be a fun. One probably gonna go a little long. I might do some more graphs. We'll see how I'm feeling but talk to you guys tomorrow should be should try it trying to keep these around 6 o'clock unless things are intervening with the fym boys or I have something else to do. But I'll always I was trying to do one everyday I'm gonna. This is part of my daily practice so if you're gonna still be here I will still be talking and like I said please give me back any questions. You have that's the only way I'm gonna keep on this. On the path of the beam here bye-bye you.
