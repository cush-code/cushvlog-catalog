I have to say that one of the things that makes me feel oldest in the universe and of course I feel very old looking at the internet all day. All these children running around on my lawn. It would be that there is a very popular rapper so popular in fact that he has his own signature. Mcdonald's meal whose rap name not real name whose rap name is travis scott. What is going on with the kids. Is it all. The is it. The scissor is it. The tick tocks their brains not not an emcee not not a not a young not a not a friend. No no not a sir nothing just some just like hi. I I'm not even m.c. Travis scott. I'm just travis scott what what in the world is going on. I mean is it all is it just is it. The training of hope for the future is that the idea that like why would I even bother coming up with a with a hypnotist hip-hop persona. When there's no point to anything is that the idea don't get it one of the many things. I don't get 

Hey guys are you ready for some hand egg sunday party. It's hand egg time. Guys remember when people would say hand egg remember who read it remember bacon. They'd say hand egg and sports ball. Those are the days now you can you only hear those things ironically making fun of people who haven't said that in in 10 years and half of whom are probably dead of covet man. What's wrong with tom brady that he's still playing in tampa bay of all places what's wrong with his brain. I mean obviously he's a quarterback. There's probably a significant amount wrong with his brain but I mean brady has got to be one of the most blessed quarterbacks ever in terms of that. I mean how many they basically made it illegal to hit him because how many concussions has brady even had in his career compared to even the average quarterback who of course are some of the least. Concussed players on a football field. So his brain's probably relatively intact and yet he's still at 41 with seven super bowls. He's got to go win one with the soul.

No aaron rodgers will never win the world series again to all-time top five quarterback and he won't win more than one that's too bad. I want him to win one just so that he could definitively be proven as better than farve and the thing is brett. Favre was my quarterback as a child. I have deep deep emotional associations with him that I could never put on to rogers who showed up when I was older and when I'd actually kind of stopped caring about football that much But I got to recognize reality. I can't become one of these people who's totally his brain is deformed by nostalgia. Rogers is way better than farv ever was and I would like him to get one more world one more super bowl than that. It's just such a shame that his best years were wasted by that that overgrown plus-sized top child toddler model that ashbash goshbagash cover boy mike mccarthy god damn 

So today. I wanted to start talking about um. Something people are freaking out about a little bit. That farv said today. They were talking about the guy in portland who got shot by the cops after killing the patriot prayer guy. The guy who I think there's relatively strong circumstantial case was probably some sort of confidential informant with the police and either was like put up to shooting him by the cops or maybe like a tamerlane. Tsarnaev thing kind of got too into his role that he was supposed to be playing because he very very suspiciously had totally apolitical social media until like three months ago and then he got a blm tattoo on his neck like two days before he shot the guy very eyebrow-raising as I like to say like. I don't like to say any of this stuff happen because it leads you down a rabbit hole. I like to say my eyebrow is cocked so he's talking about this guy getting shot and he says you know there has to be retribution. He was a bad guy. He was nasty and people are going oh my god oh my. God 

He's admitting that they he basically put a hit out on this guy that he said go kill this guy because he shot one of my beloved my beautiful boaters my beautiful land voters and I understand that that's a way to read that quote but I honestly don't think that that's the correct read at least from my experience with trump and you can tell me if you disagree. But trump's presidency has been absolutely one of a kind in that he experiences being president as the act of watching himself be president. Not to be president he does not think of himself. He does not conceive of himself as president the way that those guys who clawed and scraped their way up. The political mud hill to get to the top and killed. Everybody stabbed their mother to do. It guys who shed any soul they had in the pursuit of this office which is basically all of them. They got there so they could embody that power so that they could feel like they're on. The their hands are on the wheel which of course is a joke because it isn't really like bill. Clinton found out himself you mean to tell me.

My presidency is in the hands of a bunch of bond traders. That's what he said when he found out no they're not going to let you They're not letting you do any anything other than deregulate and cut taxes and balance the budget if you have time. Trump does not think of himself as having power because all he really cares about is what the media thinks of him and even as president. He doesn't have total power over that so he does not consider himself in power because he gets to watch people be critical of him that's not power so he and that's why by the way he is beloved by his base because that's how save you the world. These are. I mean the people who've elected him are people who just watch tv all day or they're on facebook but mostly tv and they they want a president who who who vibes on that level. But what what I but one of the consequences of that is that I just have a very hard time imagining him giving it like calling up the u.s. Marshal service and saying yeah.

I'm gonna need raylen gibbons to shoot this guy. He killed one of my guys. He killed one of my precious guys. What are my voters. You could say that likely. I think much more likely is either because the cops were very angry at this guy for killing a fellow. White supremacist or he was an op and had to be killed to prevent a investigation of the case which would reveal certain things and I think that's just as plausible. If not more so he saw and he goes good you just get you got to do it way to go guys. He's talking to the tv. He's like way to go get him and I think that that reality is key to why he might actually win re-election.

Obviously a big part of it will just be good old-fashioned voter suppression voter theft. You know vote vote fraud on the part of like the people administering the vote as opposed to the poor schmucks who get accused of it who never actually do it and have no ability to you know like the brian kemp georgia governor race playbook. So we're gonna have that but even with that you're gonna need him to retain a substantial number of voters who did not vote for him in 2016 with the brains like the lizard brain that recognized him as one of their own and wanted to elevate him as like the king of the lizards like has a had a relatively like distanced like a relative detachment from politics they were not ready. They were not just sitting there waiting for someone to imprint on their brain and take over the role of jesus christ for them which is what happened to his base. But his base would never have been enough to elect him even in 2020 2016. He needed people who are willing to take a chance on him people who just vote for republicans in general even if they don't like trump in particular and his performance in the last four years should by any logical stretch make all those people vote against him or at the very least not show up for him and tip the balance for even a generic a senile walking abomination like biden who hey you know you know hey he's not got it on the ball but these guys. Up so bad and presumably somebody at biden's white house will know what they're doing and I think one of the reasons that that might not happen and you might see an unprecedented number of people vote for a president. Re-elect the president during like one of the single worst material conditions relative to when they took office that has ever existed.

No one has gone. No one has gone farther down in every category economic public health. Street violence like a sense sense of burning the entire west coast on fire. I mean a failure to deal with any of these things and more importantly as I said. A failure to deal with any of these crises first to help manufacture them and then to fail to deal with them in any way. No one has ever had that and one. I mean how very few have even had that period but none have ever had that at one 2004 are you kidding me what are you talking about that's insane 911 changes the entire thing there. 911 changed redefined that race redefine that presidency. I mean hell there's a world where 9 11 doesn't happen with bush but bush. One 9 11 still doesn't happen. I mean if he didn't do it obviously or he tried to do it bundle it. One of the big reasons. I think they'd like pentagon or something but say there's no. 911 enron might have brought down bush not just with the economic drop but his his incredibly close connection to that company. I mean he flew around in the enron jet. During the campaign he was um. Ken. Lay had his was on his short list for energy secretary.

It could have been a big deal but anyway this is unprecedented and the reason it doesn't happen is because most people are not psychologically dedicated have not subsumed their very like self and their ambitions and their wants and dreams and their autonomy to a figure on television like trump when they deal with politics. Now that's the way everyone will eventually remember. These people are the leading indicator that trumpian identification that is the only thing that's left for us now because politics stopped meaning anything a long time ago but it became more and more important to people as things got worse so things get worse and worse because politics is lost like it's the market the market does it. Politics is just where you argue about it and feel bad about it so of course. It's going to have to get more and more personal and so that trumpian like fixation where there's nothing he can do. That's wrong and no material condition can change your opinion of him because you're already seeing things from his point of view that's identical there's no difference the way he justifies himself. You instantly do it yourself. He doesn't have to convince you you already have made the leap and that's where we're going but we're not there yet at least. I thought we weren't there yet and I honestly thought we weren't there to elect trump in 2016. So this might be another reason to think he might win but one of the things I think might get those people.

Those those light trump voters is that they understand at a certain level that he's not in charge but at least he is mad on their behalf and at least he makes the people who are in charge. The two parties the media mad at him all the time and that will provide enough of a basis to vote for him because they have lost any belief that anyone else could have done any differently and that's the important thing because you say well obviously. People aren't going to vote for trump after what happened but if they don't think the democrats can do better then why not have the guy who will theatrically channel their rage at the same people. They hate and they have every reason to hate these people. They have every reason to hit the democratic party. They have every reason to hate the media um so kudos to him if he gets that if he does that he will have performed something that no political figure in this country has ever even come close to and it will be because he is a singular genius at being famous which should tell you all you really need to know about what the political process actually is in this country. At this point what it actually represents what what levers it really touches which is why these liberals who are freaking out about trump about how we need biden to win.

Just the way it's a moral necessity. I mean come on people. You really think that there's anything these people could do if they wanted to and they sure. Don't want to that doesn't mean we're doomed. It means that this process has played itself out and it the and our our our. The fate of humanity is the fate of humans starting with the fate of americans which are sadly intertwined because we are the head of this dragon is gonna depend on us realizing that that this game is over.

This isn't that this puppet show is done and of course you can't take any liberals seriously certainly. Not any of the ones who had any position in the media or in the party that led to the stampede to biden. You can't let any of them get away with even pretending that they care if trump gets reelected because they willingly and intentionally help fix and erase or at least rig it as much as they had to to the benefit of someone who they knew was mentally incompetent for the job. Now. I'm not saying that means that they're responsible because oh you're gonna put a bad like that in charge. No it's that they knew he was a guy who wouldn't be able to run a real race against trump. He would they were gonna have to keep in a closet the whole time and they were still okay with it which means they were okay with losing giving it to bernie was worse than losing to trump which means losing to trump by definition can't be that bad so they're full of. I mean the base morons the ones whose whose opinions are totally made by like msnbc. They probably don't real.

They didn't realize that biden was doomed. They thought biden was the most elected electable but that's because they listened to those idiots. They listened to these people who made a choice to pick someone who was. He could win but my god you are throwing it into doubt in a way you didn't have to. But he was the only choice left. He was the only card on the table how many quotes has bite has come out from. Obama either leaked himself or leaked by close confidance where he says biden doesn't have it if there's one person who could who made the phone calls to make him the nominee. So every time he talks about how it's an existential threat. He could jack me off because he picked a guy who he knew in. His heart didn't have the the stamina to even run against trump a guy who ran against like a woman who is not beloved certainly hillary clinton but one who is an unparalleled like dynamo of of at least ambition.

This guy is just waiting for the dinner bell at the whole nursing home to ring so you can get some. Pudding you think he can just run a real race against trump when he can't even string three words together and that's why he's going down in the polls maybe not enough to lose but enough to make it way closer than by any rights. It should be because people are like realistically thinking okay. He's supposed to be. The alternative to this horror of these dead bodies in this turmoil. But he's not even there oh somebody's roasting corn right now in the neighborhood. Oh my god that smells good. I'm not doing it. Only fans know. I don't think anyone wants to see that thank you. I should do a gross stream soon um. I was thinking. I might for my birthday. Later this month. I might I might do the brisket and I might do a grill stream not during eating it but but like maybe an hour's worth of you know tending it. My birthday is done. I would probably do it the weekend before but yes my birthday is debate night. So it's definitely that debate is going to be an omen of something the moment of my next year because it's either going to be the best crescent.

I've ever had if these two demented old men just jabber at one another and start mentally regressing trump just thinks he's yelling at he's like yelling at um john mcenroe at studios 50 54 about which one of them is going to get the hit on stephanie. Seymour and biden is is knife fighting corn pop in the in the in the trunk of a 57 chevy yes libra libra. I actually know my whole chart. Now. I've got my chart. If anyone knows the zodiac. I'd be interested to hear your take I am libra sun capricorn moon leo rising earth wind and fire baby apparently people keep saying. I look like an insane uncle today and I gotta say insane uncle energy is stuff. I love you know what's so funny you guys talking to me about this and and how you you you know these a lot of young people listen to these streams and really like they like they like what they're hearing and they find me like some sort of figure who's helped them like think their way through the world. I have younger cousins and I would see them twice a year. I would see them on the christmas. I'd see them at our family reunion. In the summer. All the way growing up from little shavers. They're full-grown men now because like. I was like a like 12 when they were. I was like I'm. I think. I'm like not even 10 years older than these kids and and they're all libertarians.

I remember trying to explain vault rawls's veil of ignorance to my cousin. One time it just. I guess like you people really aren't ready to hear anything unless it comes from the internet now all right. So what's the deal with that What do you mean what about air libra is an air sign. Leo rising people are saying omg leo rising. I don't know what that means and someone said capricorn moon ah which is very cute. But I don't know what that means either oh god. I wanted to talk about cuties so thank you for reminding me um. Cutie's thing to me is awesome and hilarious because obviously it's hysteria. It's goofy. It's like this this is just some art. It's an art movie from france. It's like who even cares but the thing then now the the the the argument about it. I think is fascinating because it really shows the degree to which people don't. I don't think people really get this whole moment. I know people get q. They don't think they get the appeal of q. I don't think they they get the appeal of like this whole nascent like cultural reactionary like trumpian moment because I've seen so many people yelling at these conservatives for being like hypocritical or for um for being hysterical like talking oh. This is just satanic panic anymore or oh but you guys you guys are hypocrites.

It really underestimates the degree to which they're clearly with you. They're serious because everyone doesn't think there's going to be a future which means they're fixated psychotically on their children and the preservation of their children's innocence because they know the world is just a giant grinding meat maw that's going to turn them into julian chuck whatever that is cannibal sandwiches for everybody that's life outside of the home and they know that and they're terrified of it and it gets turned into this. This fixation on preserving youth in innocence but the way this took off you don't think they're trying to. With all the people who've spent the last five years at least as the as the sheriffs of popular culture. The the self-appointed ba sheriffs of wokeness going around and determining what's problematic what needs to go. I mean we just we just watched how many how many shows had blackface episodes purged from the royals in the last couple months and of course.

A lot of that is just ass covering from corporations who are just trying to get people off their back. But it's in a context where people take the like. The people take what they see in in um in cinema in culture seriously as like a political vector and have decided that they're going to like make their political activism at least in part about shaping what appears on screen to promote wholesome things less white less toxic masculinity less racism. Less centering of whiteness more diversity from people of other oppressed intersections like basically an idea of politics where everybody grows up and as children grow up and they watch their screens. They see a percentage of bad white male based entertainment and good poc and woc and I guess white women entertainment and although that changes depending on who's on top and and the mo and whichever one wins whichever one they see more of is going to determine which politics they have and you can say that that's simplistic. But I don't know any other way they'll understand how they think this stuff works to the degree that they have to put so much energy into shaping this stuff and so gotta get rid of the bad things cancel hashtag whatever and gotta protect the good things and now these guys get to get get to say so you guys wanted to get cancel everything for being racist everything for being sexist problematic whatever and it needs to go off tv and I don't get to watch it.

But this show with 12 11 year olds showing their asses to each other is okay. I mean it's they've just it's a jujitsu move and it's it's and it taps into a real live wire of panic about the future of these of this country's children and about their like vulnerability and now we're back and it's like. Hey remember how you guys in. The 90s said that in the 80s said that it was hysterical to blame popular culture for the way people lived that it's hysterical to blame violence and media for violence in real life. It's hysterical to blame sex and media for licentiousness in real life and now you spent the last five years with bell book and candle demanding that popular culture demand. Meets certain political parameters in order to infect people's behavior because otherwise why does it matter and now the line you draw is pedophilia and I gotta say they got you. They got your asses and I can see why people are mad and just stomping their hats. Like cartoon prospectors. They got your ass and not to mention the fact that I mean we are in the queue world. We're in the epstein world and epstein had a lot to do with us. Like these things rise from material conditions. The world's foremost a child procurer for the rich and famous kills himself in federal custody that creates a context.

This is not a blouse. It's a shirt. This is bigger. It's I've lost a little weight so my older shirts. I realize now are getting a little big. So it's like this whole cuties thing. It's like. It's the sewing yay or reap sewing yay reaping boo and like hey maybe maybe stop this. Jerk him off and of course that won't happen because everyone's captured by their emotional relationship to his arguments but it would be nice if some people like stuff like this stuff like jessica krug. I really the one girl whose name was like cv. Haddad did you see that there was a woman at uw madison who claimed she was italian and she was claiming to be black. It's like I'm sorry. You're about a hundred years too late for that one. Honey and her fake name was like cv. Haddad like like cv.

Like she's in she's trying to get a job as as a wokeness translator and her name is cv. It's like hi. I'm resume johnson woc at large maybe. It'd be nice maybe nice if people were to do a little bit of soul searching not going to happen not going to happen at all. Nope. So it's gonna be an argument about what programs to watch a bunch of people huddled around the television in a flooded kroger like with a little security camera tv with wires on arguing about what to watch that's politics.

That's the entire argument why are people asking about the dune worm. I thought the dune trailer looked like. The armor was it's like the armor on those on the guards in the in the throne room. In return the last jedi only. It's not as colorful. It doesn't even have that going for it. It's all washed out. There's no silks. There's no there's no flowing anything. There's no sense of empire. It's just this grim like capitalist realism. It's like the present but with space worms. I'll see it of course because it's a fun story and there's cool parts. I gotta say the design of the worm is pretty good. I like the idea that it's got like the baleen thing instead of teeth which makes more sense considering what it eats but the idea that it's all got to be so grim and it's like.

And so I i said on twitter. I said this is like why is it so serious and someone's like would you rather have whedon quips and of course. I don't want weed and quips. I don't want soy banter but that really is our only option isn't it. It's weeding or nolan for the end of time for like serious art. It's we either get self-serious like a ponderous dull colored sepia toned nolan or we get zippy quippy. Cgi nothingness with awful soy banter. Those are our only options that sucks michael bay has been banished to netflix. At least he has some pop. I mean that movie the 6 underground was terrible but my god. I still thinking about that color palette can't think of the last movie. I saw if I'd seen that in the movie theater I might have gone blind. His movies are like the only big budget ones anymore with any color in them yeah. That's a good point. It's like we have to be to be super serious or knowingly humorous. Like the only kind of humor is like oh wow. I guess that happened oh boy. Oh wow. So we're doing this now. I think I forgot who pointed this out. It might have been will but I thought this was a perfect distillation of that whole genre of film is that I might have said this on the stream before. But I just want to say it again is that you know as quality as art got leached out of filmmaking by money as money replaced art. One of the things that had to go is characterization like it takes it's you're not going to spend money. You're not going to spend time trying to create realized characters. It's hard. It's not something you can throw money at the way you can throw it at effects and so how do you make a character compelling.

If they don't have any definition easy. You just make them the imagined audience you just make the head character who you in your head imagine is watching the movie which is a schlubby self-aware soy-based man-animal and then you have them act like that. So that's why it's all people in disbelief. So oh this is happening now because that's what you would say if you were in that position because that's the only way to create audience. Identification with the main characters is if they just received a reflection of themselves which is of course behind a lot of representation arguments as well. I'm sorry it's like yeah. There's one thing which is the real radical failure to distribute artistic power along racial lines by the accumulation of capital by white people and that makes art monochromatic and bad. But there is an element of like especially the way that representation has been like pursued of course by hollywood like they're not going to actually change that they're not going to change who makes the movies they're not going to redistribute that it's going to be the same little club of you know of mostly white people who all know each other. They're not going to bring in new people where are they going to come from they're not in the social circle already. I mean like it's already already a totally self-reproducing. Thing directors are now the sons of directors and the daughters of directors. Producers are the daughters and sons of producers kid. The actors are the kid wyatt. Russell is kurt russell's kid and goldie hawn's kid and the little turd on boys is dennis quaid's kid where are you going to bring in representation that way what you can do is. You can make the art look like people and then what that ends up doing is as a way to pander to them. Now they don't have you know oh. I don't actually have to write a character. They only have to represent somebody and then they get to feel seen and that fills in the emotional space where you used to have to fill it with art. You used to have to fill it with character creation. You used to have to fill it with nuance and and shading that made you care about the person. Now they either look like the audience member or they sound like them and that does all the work for you overlord. I'm sorry aren't you isn't.

The argument supposed to be that we need to be aware of historical trauma right. We have to be aware of historical racism and the in the impact of historical racism right am. I wrong. Like that is a mean a main argument of like about making art representational so that we can tell the stories of america that haven't been told so that we can realize how unfair the current present moment is and how much there has to be redress right like that is part of the argument right. I'm not wrong about that if that's the case having a black guy lead a squadron of paratroopers in world war. Ii essentially says yeah yeah. No race wasn't an issue in 1941 or 45 or whatever the. It was you've done violence to history in a way that you have claimed not to want to do the opposite of what you want to do you watch overlord. If you're a young person and remember this has to be assumed. You have to assume always that the point of this is to change people's minds because that's the only way that it has a political valence and it's not just an artistic question is. If no no they see the good representation and some people feel better and it makes other people more politically awake woke as it were some person who does who has got as good in education as the rest of us which is not very good in history oh yeah. No there were world war ii guys. Black guys shooting zombies cool and I know it's like oh. But there weren't really zombies either. But it's like yes but like it's zombies in a world war two context and the context of world war. Ii was a segregated military. I have I i if what race is an issue in overlord. It's not an issue enough to not have a guy with a unit of white people which didn't happen. That's why.

I'm saying. I don't care if they like made a wrenching of race. There is a fundamental difference between a society like in terms of its advancement along racial lines where like oh there's some friction because the captain's black to the captain not ever being allowed to be black. There's a difference and you are lighting it and why so that people can so that people can see the character and if they're white they fill in the gap of recognition with oh. This is a black eye and I can feel. I can feel woke and I can feel good about myself for identifying with this black character. You know what. I didn't even notice. He was black a little russian self-righteousness and then a black. A black viewer can be like hey you know and they understandably want to see that because it's so rare in in especially genre filmmaking they're like hey. There's a guy who has like and that identification that fills that space for them. But in both cases it is cynical and it's unartistic. It does violence to the art. It is a cynical attempt to skip a step in making a piece of film making a piece of art and everyone's doing that all the time. But it's just such a glaring one and more importantly to my mind one that is pitched to people as virtue and I say that's gross. I don't like it 

Someone asked was watergate a coup. I that's another one. I don't once again. There's a lot of circumstantial evidence there that that the watergate burglary was botched on purpose on behalf of the cia and the there's a couple of theories as to why they would do that. There's one in the book called the great heroin coup that claims that it was actually an internecine intelligence intelligence agency battle about where the cia would be getting its heroin whether from the old french connection from turkey to to italy to marseille to the us or from the golden triangle. But the last sort of lurid james elroy theory is that nixon had over the course of his presidency cut out the entire national security establishment from foreign policy and the war in vietnam. He ran the state department and the defense department out of his office with henry kissinger and that was that's the kind of abrogation of powers. The presidents just don't do and at the very least it certainly gave plenty of incentive to the cia to see him neutralized because there's supposed to be a structure. Here like we're talking about the most awesome power on earth and it has to be to some degree horizontally distributed or else. One guy is in charge and that means that the institutional incentives that keep the thing moving get disrupted hell yeah secret honor great movie. I'm glad someone watched it why I don't understand also watch.

Travis. Scott is called cactus jack. I'm sorry but cactus. Jack was mick foley's alter ego in the wrestling and what the hell has that got to do with him. I have to watch cloud atlas again someone's asking about cloud atlas. I remember being very moved by its by its tender heart and and absolute earnestness. But I think structurally it was a little inert. I did love the thing where everyone was cast over the generations with different makeup and stuff that was so ballsy.

Very few people would have the I have the what's better do that yeah. Apparently the travis scott meal is just it's a barbecue. It's just a bacon quarter pounder with barbecue sauce. I'm much more excited about the ghost chili wings at popeyes thank you very much if. I'm going to go if I'm going to indulge in a speeded food a a rapid a rapid comestible. It's going to be the ghost chili wings at popeye and mcdonald's is also doing spicy nugs now soon which of course will be interesting by the way I gotta give a shout out to somebody i. I don't remember who it is. I'll have to go through my dms but a while ago. I was talking about how I really wanted a goju-chang korean pepper paste based dip for nuggets and that most goju-chang you get is a little too thick for that somebody dm me and said this is the stuff and he gave me a link to this korean squeeze tube product and I said that's what you're looking for and I got it and it is holy crap. It's like cj's. I think it's called. It's got like the consistency of ketchup but like the rich deliciousness of korean red pepper paste. I don't. I'm a ketchup lover as many know. I'm I i love ketchup. I'm staunch ketchup on hot dogs obviously but ketchup on. Eggs yes ketchup on macaroni and cheese delightful but man. I don't know. I might. I might be done with macaroni. If I can keep this stuff around the problem is. I have to like. I think I have to mail out for it. I don't think it's available locally.

But if I could get that at a steady supply I might get rid of ketchup. But since I can only get it irregularly apparently. I will I will also have ketchup stop stop slamming ketchup. It's still good ketchup is overrated that's absurd that's like saying the beatles are overrated. It doesn't make sense. Ketchup is like a a a a consuming concept on its own. You can take it or leave it but you can't talk about its ratedness. I don't understand what's supposed to be wrong with ketchup on hot dogs. Why catch up on hamburgers but not hot dogs. You're talking very similar profiles of flavor. I will not get the prabai's fries. No no no no no no no no no mashed potatoes and gravy every time nope. This is not negotiable ketchup is for kids so what kids like a lot of things that are delicious. Ice cream is for kids do you not eat ice cream smarty pants hell hot dogs you could you say ketchups for kids. You know what hot dogs are for kids cut them up a little kitty eating them come on get out of here. They're for adults too damn. It. Someone just said the most insane thing I've ever seen on this twitch. Stream. Someone said ketchup is good but heinz ketchup sucks sir you have taken leave of your senses. Heinz is a absolutely perfect complexion. Given what it's trying to be. It is the ideal ketchup oliver. Ketchup is a sad deformation. It is the form everything else is a shadow on a wall last night. I heard somebody in the sink here having a backyard um comedy show and I was listening to it and you'd hear.

Some amplified setup clapping wooing and then some laughter and then all of a sudden. Some guy just started yelling his head off and I'm like oh snap. There's a heckler and not just any heckler. Emondo pissed off one and what's so funny is the guy's yelling and yelling and then when he stops it's just over as in all sound ceased. I didn't hear. I don't even think they even said okay bye. He literally ended the show so somebody went hard and I respected hunts is not also good sir. No house is bad that's how you knew that that's how you knew that the republicans were death cult in 2004 when they switched out all the heinz ketchup for hunts at the rnc. In new york they gave themselves worse ketchup to own libs who weren't even there death call oh the korean sauce. I think it's called cj's like cj's bebop bb bop sauce. I don't know where it's available. I had to. I had to mail it. I had to get it from amazon. I think I i couldn't find it anywhere else. They might have a website.

I don't know tatsuki is really good. Tzatziki's underrated but then again lam is underrated. I keep talking about food because I keep doing this. These streams right before dinner so I just keep getting hungry somebody's bumping something's bumping back. Here. White socks is very good too. We're just naming delicious delicious. Sauces right now and I'm imagining eating them all oh man. I wish. We had ketchup chicks in the u.s ketchup chips and all dressed. It's honestly. We america is the snack capital of the world right five million. We have so many chain restaurants europeans. All of them are stunned like australia has like three chains. They've got mcdonald's hungry jacks which is burger king and like probably some kangaroo based place. They're blown away by how many we have and yet we have the worst chips in the anglosphere except for when lays does the does those like limited edition chips. Those are often amazing to this day they're They did a biscuits and gravy chip that in my mind is still the best chip I've ever had. But it's gone. They did a korean barbecue one that was really good. They did a euro one. They did garlic fries oh man. They were so good but they're always limited time like the regular options in america suck. We don't have all dressed. We don't have ketchup. I did not like the chicken fries or our chicken. Fried steak. Someone's asked much. I like chicken breast. It reminds me that there was a chicken and waffles one that I thought was going to be good but it was just all waffle. No chicken yeah lay's tatsuki. Oh so good lays. They're so good. Oh. They did like a a cherry. They did a brazilian like churrascuria steak chip. They just don't. They're not year-round but no all dressed yeah. No we got the worst chips in the anglosphere. I want all dressed. I don't want ketchup prawn give me the prawn apparently though the one to get according to bill oakley and I trust him on all things. Comestible is that there is a in spain.

They have a jimon iberico lace chip that is supposed to take tastes like their delicious charcuterie and he says that it's the best chip and if they pull that off most black-pilled civil war general depending on what you mean by that. It's got to be sherman right because sherman was there like everybody else during the civil war. One of the tragedies of the civil war and one of the things that made it so bloody is that it was being play acted by a bunch of napoleonic cosplaying fancy lads guys with big plumes in their hair guys who were reenacting chivalric traditions from like medieval england like pompous. Rifle bore munitions and jeb stewart who wanted to count coup with out out in the fields. Sherman that had small time said no this is This is a dirty business we're trying to win a political contest at the least expense to our side and you do that by extinguishing the opponent's will to fight and he famously gave a speech at a commencement into some military thing afterwards. Where he said the war is the famous war is hell speech where he goes war. Zeldas cannot be refined. Its glories are all moonshine. It is cruelty and you cannot refine it and you could say that's like that's a step towards the horror of the coming like industrial slaughter of the 20th century. But it's still an advancement over because over the delusion of of that of that generation of of antebellum of military pageant players at least sherman was like was going to apply that logic to a just cause you know and like that's the real reason that that's a progressive position is that if you if you really accept war as awful in its own right and irredeemable then it can only be pursued for virtuous reasons and you actually have to like interrogate what that means. Meanwhile you got robert e lee going. It is after fredericksburg after watching innocent people just getting butchered on on a rocky outcropping because their dumb ass mistak stupidly facial haired incompetent.

General ordered them to go up a hill and they obeyed their orders get massacred well. He just got to sit there on a horse goes. It is good that was so terrible or we should grow too fond of it. Yeah. You think it's terrible you think it's terrible you sick about the virtue of the country or the office. You don't think we kill people. You don't think we have killers. I'm dappling a little bit. It's coming through the trees. I'm tapping most tiresome film director. At this point. It's gotta be nolan. He's sick of his and depending on how dune goes. I'll definitely put villanueva on that list. I liked sicario but I haven't really enjoyed anything else. I didn't even finish the blade runner movie all right. I think guys.

I might pop back on but I gotta pop off for a second. I'm back guys. I don't like to go too far lower than an hour. So. I'm back molly was are from mollywood arrival. I like too. I like more than some people but his whole deal. I just it's oppressive without really being illuminating. I had to break for the geico ad and and the cactus jack. Mcdonald's ad. I've seen that like 50 times logging onto twitch because yes I do not have an account. I do think that the the central metaphor of arrival there with the language like being three-dimensional. I think that's kind of cool topicio doritos aren't I bad a huge fan of annihilation. I must admit didn't really get me. It's noise out look at the smoke. I got loud you can hit my line. I'm trying to smoke. I got loud. I hope. I don't get dcci for the music in the background. R.i.p. By the way to to king dave young king dave taking too soon.

I don't think he would have survived covet anyway so but r.i.p. Nonetheless he was a legend oh yeah. I just want to say finally about q in germany it's going to happen. I think it's going to happen more and more and trump specifically is going to be the face of it because the thing about trump being this the third party president who stands away from the office and just kind of comments on his own presidency is that he can never be held responsible for anything in the minds of people to them. He is always as grieved as they are and it means that the people they hate hate them hate him like in germany. I mean germany you want to talk about a country where like the political process has basically ground lost all all pretense how long have they had a unity government now how long have they had the two main parties in coalition how many years has it been. Angela merkel has been in office longer than like a number of dictators who we overthrow. There's no political spaces and if that happens you look for a hero outside of the system and trump is. He's the only figure in the world who is both to the size of the system in a way that could make him a credible like foil for it and in any realistic imaginative sense outside of it and so. I think you're going to see more of that as as coronavirus keeps just squeezing the life out of everybody and the sense of possibility and hope of any kind of future. He's going to be the deliverance people seek. I don't know what I'm gonna have for dinner now.

I was trying. I was halfway to talking myself into getting the popeyes but I probably won't know not sure what though. I didn't really change my diet to lose weight. I honestly just stopped drinking as much and eating less. I mean I ate out less so I ate less calories in general. I mean. I just was a very. I just went from like a wildly unhealthy diet and lifestyle to a slightly less unhealthy one.

It's amazing what that does oh god trump said that we don't need to be in the middle east. We're just there to protect israel. I love it. That's the one thing you love to see about his whole. Presidency is just shedding all of the pretense which is the reason they hate him telling telling our troops that they're suckers. They're not supposed to know that because eventually those troops become generals and they have to think they're sacrificing for something like john. Kelly believes in this country in a way that trump won't that's because he is a sucker. He let his son die in iraq for no reason but he's got to convince himself of that and he's also he was in a position of very high power that's true of the high members of the military as well. How do you react to them being disabused. How does your system function when the people in charge of those organs of state are disabused in one way or another of the of the ideological motivators that have kept them on a track trump isn't going to do anything about aliens because they if there is. I don't know if there is aliens honestly all this stuff that's come out last couple years.

It could all be viral marketing for some mark hoppus production that he put together with a a ambitious like junior officer in like the navy to be like hey you you know if you can get me some documents or whatever. I don't know like harry. Reid is also like harry. Reid is also friends with the guy who he got all that money for that brought bigelow guy. You know that could that whole operation with harry reid funding that it just could be pork barrel or money laundering. So. I have no idea that's another thing agnostic on the aliens. But the one thing I do know is that there are aliens and there's proof of them that the us government has they did not tell trump I doubt. They tell most presidents why would they what would be the motivation. Why would you get that information into the hands of someone who legally can declassify any thing did. You know that the president is not bound by any laws against the releasing of classified documents. If the president decides to release it. It is declassified legally you think they're going to give anything of importance to anyone that they don't have complete control over or at least trust. His like basic conversational continence to not spill the beans.

Every five minutes get out of here get out of here out of here oh. It's tom delonge who's the ufa guy right whatever they're all the same guy in my mind. They're all the same kind of blanky kind of doughy face guy with the same voice don't waste the time. I'm already knowing the mice inside my hand missing you never like those guys. What's my age again is okay. I guess go pack. I didn't even watch. I mean. It's not on tv here not really a fan at this point but I do like this hat and it is It's heritage not hate that travis barker was the drummer.

Moon landing happened shut up the moon landing. Like what were they getting out of it propaganda victory. It's not like. It's not like the soviets were that close to landing on the moon themselves. I want to address one thing before I go because it caught my eyes. Somebody said it is strange that people assume that alien life would be more or less empathetic than ours and I would say that I think there is and I think posada. The pasadists talk about. This is that any symbols that any any alien life form that achieved a civilizational complexity necessary to allow for interdimensional or interstellar travel would by definition be communist. I think that's true and as we've talked about like there is a moral center to communism that is a a decentered ego and a like a social sense of of identity let alone morality that it stands to reason that they would be more benevolent than us or else they wouldn't have made it that far oh man. I smell some mommy's doing barbecue out. Here. I'm gonna die oh man. It was corn and now it's barbecue oh oh oh it smells good too. I did not go pasades. I would never go pasadist because one element that they talk about how dare you all right guys done for today bye.
