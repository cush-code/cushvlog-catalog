You have found it now go and do it too go and have a good time and just chill out maybe and you know relax hey everybody I forgot to do this recently but I wanna I'll never mind maybe. I should do it later when there's more people listening. No wait a minute. This isn't for people listening now is for people watching later so. I can say it right now if you're watching this on youtube please if you haven't already subscribe to the page because I want chris to get his hundred thousand dollar or hundred thousand follower. Not a hundred thousand dollars but a hundred thousand follower reward from youtube. They send you a big plaque shaped like the the finger that you have on youtube the up finger. So let's get the man his damn plaque. He worked way harder than any of us oh good. I helped them yeah. I think I got my right set up finally yeah. We're close too. It's less than 10 000.

Now so come on you click on it. It doesn't you don't have to do anything. It doesn't tell you what to do. It's just. I don't even honestly know. I don't have a youtube. You know what maybe. I should like our page. It's a good idea or. I guess. I do because I yeah. I've signed up so yeah. I guess. I could. I should like it. I've never liked our page. I guess we should so yeah. I'll do that. I will I will in fact right now. I'm going to like the chapeau trap house page because I'm presumably signed in by my personal page. And if I am I can then like it. There's no law against that all right. I gotta sign in. I don't. I don't know what it'll do maybe will it give me access to treats. I have to say I rarely understand I'm not much of one of these. I'm not a youtube generation type person. I mean I remember when youtube came out and it was just videos of people getting their balls demolished like that was what youtube was for epic fails oh crap thank god.

All these companies are only owned by like one of three corporate megaliths. So I don't have to worry about the fact that all these counts are connected to one another nothing to worry about all right. I'm in here folks. I'm in. I've hacked into the gibson or whatever you call it all right. I'm gonna click boom. I subscribed. It's just that easy folks even a tech dinosaur. Like me an absolute buffoon can do it yeah. No for you people who grow who you youngsters who grown up with like youtube instead of television which is apparently true. I don't know if it's still true. I think maybe the attention spans have been so fried that it literally is tick-tock now. But I think for like what maybe older zoomers and even like young millennials you watched youtube instead of television and to me that is an experience. I don't have. I was well formed by television growing up when youtube showed came along and so. I saw it as a place to watch guys getting hit in the balls and then local. Terrible. Local ads terrible local television spots that like that turned into memes like the living room's bedrooms guy and then eventually it was like old tv shows like I remember. I watched the the pilot for that. Weird ben stiller show about the sentient motorcycle and jack black but now but if but you know if you grew up with your media diet being like divided between those two. By that point you have like these people who are on there like these personalities that you watch like your paul your brother's paul for example and then that you subscribe to them and I guess like that lets you know when they go live. So you can turn on the tv basically and watch them. It's like oh owen wilson yeah that was it so yeah. This is just me old man yelling at a cloud today which is frankly half of this. And now we're gonna have like these younger zoomers right like the kid.

The teens today didn't they really did they grow up or am. I hallucinating this did they not grow up. Watching procedurally generated click bait cartoons of different like marvel different disney properties doing sex with each other and cutting each other's heads off and does. Anyone remember that it was a big. There was a big weird article about a few years ago. But the thing is. I don't know how long those were those those are going around but anyway that means the next generation those babies they're all going to be. They're going to be programmed mk ultra slugs.

Like that's what you will you'll have had your brain warped before you've even developed a complete endocrine system but it definitely fulfills in my mind. The it undermines the the reality about the internet in general that I think has to be remembered to understand it correctly which is that the internet was the continuation by other means of mk. Ultra and I don't mean that in the sense that the cia said we're going to build an internet to control people's brains. I am saying that you had a whole bunch of scientific advancement happening in the 60s and in 50s right and sec to the 70s until that era. Because you have this big state investment in the public sector in the form of the the military-industrial complex and that meant that you had real investment in all kinds of ideas pharmacology and also technology so you have government money funding all this stuff and the leading edge of government power. Like the intelligence community. The ones tasked with actually steering the ship of state like determining what will be acceptable in america's democratic context like the guard rails on democracy at the end of the day. Like obviously it's the constitution formally but in terms of the structures that carry out the prerogatives of of limiting our democratic influence on our own government. It is the intelligence state that does that and that meant that when cutting edge science of psychopharmacology cut starts exploding you got albert hoffman tripping balls on his boat bicycle in switzerland. There's gonna be money there to direct that research towards the goal of controlling people and that's what they did and they fried the brains of a generation or tried to now.

I don't think that the cia ever figured out how to program predictably an assassin or anything like that like in a repeatable fashion. I don't think that they could ever get that that good at it. They could fry a brain and they could get people to sort of go in a general direction but they could not ever expect to fulfill an order by like asking someone to do something and so that limited the utility of this research. Now that doesn't mean you couldn't theoretically do it. It just got to a point where it was no longer cost effective for the cia to keep pursuing that level of research. Instead they focused on all right what can this stuff do and what it could do is throw. Social. Monkey wrenches into things like infiltrate milieus and direct them by people who are suggestible to to agents of the state. Be.

It charles manson or jim jones or the people who administered mk ultra in universities and colleges and helped create guys like ted kaczynski and so since mk ultra you know all we know about it is that at some point they just gave up according to them to their own records they were never in. For there was never any actual investigation or punishment. Nobody ever went to jail for mk ultra so there's no reason to believe that they would have stopped unless there was no longer a reason to continue and my argument is not that they said oh well that failed. Let's make the internet. Let's let's do cathode ray tubing to people's brains. I am saying is that the same time that they're the they're in the the little elves sydney. Gottlieb's elves are in the in the acid mines during mk.

Ultra you're seeing built the technology the structures of media and and computational technology. The creation of the microchip that are that are networking human relationships and de-centering human reality away from the south. The immediate identity and into this mediated space that is controlled by the market but by the underlying logic of the system that you're protecting and it's being driven by people who are trying to make the world a better place. Like the internet was the product product of the failure of the 60s counter revolution. Oh there was an attempt to make it so that everybody in the world could be free of the of the of the tyrannies of capitalism. Its alienations even at the heart of empire and that was the dream of the 60s but it was pursued individually and hedonistically because that's all we had at that point. The children of the suburban splendor of the 50s did not have the class experience to to act in any way other than hedonistically and individually and that meant that their dream failed.

But what replaced it was the dream of finding a new frontier where freedom can be really expressed if we're going to be bound to this capitalist structure where can we find freedom and it was the next frontier of online. The idea was we're going to cybernetically and horizontally reorient human consciousness around this.

 this new conception of like a human community that would enliven like a human species awareness but because these are the end children of history the the products of a declast american experience. Their efforts towards that end are channeled through structures created by this economic system which meant that it was privately owned eventually and directed towards capitalist ends which created within it within this cultural engine. An algorithm that will be self-perpetuating because the world people are going to now inhabit mediated through this new structure is one where class has been dissolved out of existence because we are only able to understand ourselves in this context in a lens of individual consumer identity because we are mediating a concept of human kind of americans. Abstract notions of people we are orienting that away from ourselves but the definitions of those terms what those things mean to us when we when we conceptualize them is generated by this self-sustaining capitalist.

 cultural programming that then powers this media into our heads and makes us live more and more in an abstracted and alienated realm. We are no longer reacting to the world in a way that can productively engage with alienation because our alienation is now trapped. We're we're locked into an a gigantic orgone accumulator that sucks up and disperses all of our wounded anima that comes with being an alienated capitalist subject and then we've chased phantoms in the cultural sphere that they've created and so what is that if not the end of mkultra pursued to its most efficient technological specifications yeah you can't make everybody do exactly what you want every minute or even for a minute. But you can arrange things you can set guard rails up technologically and structurally and conceptually that prevent them from expressing that alienation in a coordinated way one that subsumes personal desire to a group project that is defined in opposition to capitalism not to any of these ill-defined propagandistic categories that we actually engage in politics with and so we are like all in in they nationalized and now have internationalized mk ultra in that they now have a whereas acid and like all the drugs that they experimented on for the individual brain were supposed to like cut re rewire your brain like regroove your brain so that a thing that used that met x now means why and then you act as though that's true and then then you you try to use conditioning and symbols to try to get them to do one thing and by defining our world defining our social existence through the lens of this thing. This this structure this structure of structures and mediated existence as generated by these structures. Your your understanding of the world is being regrooved a thing that should all by rights naturally.

Mean a now means why you're operating off of collectively experienced and this is the most important thing capitalistically over determined so you have a situation not where we have anything like a human polity as ever understood historically and have created a new a new social relationships that has been technologically over determined and that means directed not to human ends but to the ends of capitalism which is in a distinct entity. I really think that this is true there's a thing marx talked about and it's hard to really get into because it is very you know kind of wooly headed but to my mind. It's very important. It's really helped me every time I'm trying to like make sense of the world around myself I find myself you know getting caught in the same semantic web that we all do and the thing that pulls me out is to stop thinking of this. This class struggle that we're in right now as one that is between human beings that are arranged in a class position. It is between humans and capitalism as a distinct will now of course it's doing it. It's expressing that will through humans and those humans are capitalists. But they do not seek what capitalism seeks.

But they can't operate any other way because they have been technologically over determined. Their brains have been rewired as acutely as a programmed assassin from the cia in like the most outlandish version of mk ultra would be. They are only if they're expressing a a a separate non-human capitalist will a real god in the world. There's a guy named ian wright as someone who sent me this to me today and I read it. There's a guy named ian wright. Last year wrote a blog post called marx on capitol as a real god and I read that today and I was like yes precisely. We have to think of capitalism not as a thing that capitalists worship the way that christians worship jesus or whatever the relationship of submission is similar. The difference is is that jesus is just their collective will filtered through democratic and cultural institutions. Jesus is what they wanted to do collectively however that's determined by force and extraction and exploitation and hierarchy. It is determined and however it's determined by those people is what god wants under capitalism. These people are worshiping a god that has its own will independent of theirs and for me like when I'm like all history. All theory is all.

All marxism is as a study you know as as a study. It really is just the study of history because everything within it that you want to talk about economics. The sociology. All the things that marx did the journalism. It's all just wrapped around history as it is a narrativizing of the past after it has happened it is narrativizing it. It is not seeking. It's not pulling some sort of like mechanistic truth out because you can't get that what you can do is tell a story and so and everybody does this like every who every every bourgeois historian does the same thing. We're all telling history about a story about the past. It's just for the marxist the different.

The thing that distinguishes them from those others is that you understand that that's what you're doing you understand you take the leap of faith. You you. Late you take the leap of kierkegaardian faith that yes I am telling a story here. I am not dividing a truth but that in so doing I'm going to be saying something that is still true and the paralysis of the capitalist intellectual is that they can't make the leap. They have to get one more piece of information that is going to convince them that now that they can make the leap and that leads them to just allowing the categories and narratives of capitalism that they've absorbed to over determine their relation response to it and of course all of that motivated by their unconscious and conscious class interests. The only thing that cuts through these is that leap of faith and then once you have that you say okay capitalism is god. You can look at the iron filings of history like look back on them and then hold that rod that galvanized rod over them and they will all start to line up and this is of course the stuff that made karl popper so horrifically incensed by the very notion of marxism as a science.

Cop popper was like ah. I'm not falsifiable wow. It's like there is a thing called science that involves like practical application of mind but that is not the same thing as the spirit that animates our pursuit of science and that is made in theology and history. It is made in fl. It is it made in the humanities broadly construed. It is the story we tell about the past that then we live by live having shaped us because all of the all of the conflicts all the social ills all the baffling array of human cultures in conflict and in collaboration striking off each other throughout history.

The the cascade of social realities and then as time goes on as you look through history the in the over abundance of material to sift through the amount of information. We have about the past it makes discerning a human narrative one that presumes that human minds are in control of this process. It makes it very difficult to arrange them in a way that feels consistent and coherent and that is why we end up allowing capitalism to discernment for us because we can't convince ourselves. It's too much information. It's too varied why would x do y why is not z but if you understand that once capitalism becomes a hegemonic cultural set of cultural practices that you have created a non-human intelligence that is going to battle humanity over control of this thing called technology that the civilization that emerged emerges from human humans desire to survive which is cooperative which is instinctively cooperative until equilibrium is breached which in which it then as a temporary as a measure of emergency hierarchy is introduced into the system but then it persists because of its domination of technology until disequilibrium breaks it up again and another class structure emerges in power. That is a struggle that is over resources by humans. But once capitalism emerges as a way for humans to cooperatively pursue their ends as they understand them now when I say cooperatively it becomes coercive but it is not just co-op coercive every social order.

Every civilization has degrees of coercion and consent within the system and they're managed around technology and the intensity of technology. But they are held by human hands when capitalism emerges out of the state con the westphalian state competitive framework of europe a place with no resources but also no threat from imperial domination from without intensity of focus around technology leads to the ability to dominate others in a way that can drastically increase the efficiency of technological intensification and everyone in the leading.

Positions within the power. Structures of europe pursued those goals.

The thing that will help you dominate why you have to pursue it but making but intensifying technology means intensifying urban relationships. It means intensifying the creation of cultural structures of of of things that gravitate around not the the the state rural idiocy of land-based tenure but around the dynamics. Capital circulation engines of the of um urban modernity and so that means that the power dynamic between the old landed powers who unleash capitalism to compete against the other old landed powers give power to their emergent bourgeois who then over time destroy them either destroy them if they can't accommodate quickly enough like the stuarts and the bourbons and the romanovs or are able to be bought off essentially into positions of ceremonial power like the like the post revolution english monarchs or the scandinavian monarchs.

Either way they surrender power to their bourgeois to their national bourgeois who then go to war against the other national bourgeois and emerging from the dust of that is a american over america overseeing a post-world war ii re-organization of the world into a for the first time a global structure of capitalist extraction and at every point of this process you are accumulating this massive amount of exploitation and misery at the bottom but then filtering up to the top because at a certain point even your. Bourgeois are starting to become disaffected with capitalism as they lose power to capital unrestrained in the form of the algorithm that can be administrative administrated technologically with no human intervention and you can see the entire history modern history from from the wars of religion and third in the 30 years war that create the westphalian state and that are the first big explosions of resistance to capitalism emerging from both the peasant class in the form of the peasants wars of the 1520s to the the revolt of the barons and the um and the electors of the holy roman empire. The 30 years were and of course the the lowland burgers of the dutch the habs the spanish netherlands and then the entire hit and then the post-revolutionary french revolutionary. Centuries of war in europe is the emergent national bourgeois of these different states fighting one another for control of a world market that they can dominate technologically from their metropoles so they're battling now with the resources of a planet even though they're still just little europe and that means they gain the capacity to destroy each other on a mass and unprecedented scale and they do eventually but capitalism is not destroyed as it should have been because while they were doing that the settler colony of america was absorbing all of the excess social conflict and alienation that their system couldn't contain even with their wars and there was still a lot of excess and instead of it overthrowing from below capitalism. It vented off opposition to it where it reformed in a place where the endless capacity for territorial expansion at the expense of less socially developed. Pre-capitalist subjects meant that capitalism could be reforged with a smoother mechanism for social interaction.

A greater degree of consent from within the structures of capitalism in the form of free real estate. This is the bump this is my drum. I've been banging now. I feel like af reading. Greg. Granted's end of the myth is one of the most clarifying experiences I've had of the last like five years in terms of clearing the cobwebs and trying to understand what is going on in this. Country and free real estate meant that the social angst of europe that explode exploded over and over again in peasant revolts and wars of religion and then nationalist movements could be subsumed by giving people end of the stick of capitalism that they could be the one holding the whip and not the one being whipped.

The problem is is that being there whipping on behalf of someone else is still alienating so even the people benefiting from capitalism are being immiserated. Spiritually. They're miserable they have to consume more and more and distract themselves more and more from the basic position of alienation and guilt that they feel they have to filter that through an anxious and neurotic culture that they generate to allow themselves to feel good about whipping their fellow humans instead of being whipped of course. The person being whipped is experiencing significant horrifying alienation of the physical kind but that also has a spiritual dimension. Everybody is being spiritually impoverished. No one is doing what they would like to do if they could get together and make a decision but they're locked in this death embrace by their need to appease the god because everyone in every room is answering to debt answering to money answering to a ledger book that is transcendent of human will. You got the goddamn heads of europe together in the middle ages in the euphyrial era to determine a a a question of religion.

The answer was found by their collective will. If some group didn't like it. They could fight them but whoever won won and got to impose their will but it was collectively decided. Modern capitalist ruling class filtered down through the positions of everybody under it are not ever in charge of any decision about what to be is to be done and the social co now the thing is that the deal we got as americans is breaking down and that's why our politics are breaking down because we're no longer able to promise a better future more consumption instead of more freedom over our lives. Because that's gone we're no longer going to get the good deal. The people who made a deal and held the whip because it it benefited them in the near term are now in a position where they cannot guarantee collectively their best interest and it's driving them crazy. It's driving us all crazy we're in the winchester mystery house. We're we're we're locked in a cycle of guilt and exploitation and misery where the people in charge are so detached from the real conditions of pain.

The system causes because their lives are so goddamn comfortable the most comfortable lives. Anyone's ever lived in human history and what I mean that is that literally less pain physical discomfort. Physical discomfort. I know that that's like a relative thing but it's also an absolute thing. There is like degrees of pain that we feel less of and this is more important. This is even more important. There are degrees of comfort and pleasure that we can pursue that we never could have before.
