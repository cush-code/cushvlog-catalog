That was fast. It's usually not that fast. I make sure this is working. I gotta watch. This playstation commercial first to make sure there. We are. There's me there's me on the line me online who to thunk it me. Online sounds too complicated. That's what I used to think hello uh that day's okay. I guess it was kind of muggy and overcast earlier but then the sun came out which was nice. I'd spend the evening out here now that it's nicer. I don't like being indoors yes. I'm going to teach you how to log off while you're on the computer and while I'm on the computer and while we're on well where well we are all on the computer lol. At the end of the day. Everybody just loves being on the computer and who is to blame them information stimulation all reachable at the touch of your fingers. All you have to do is hit your finger.

You can get picked up and taken on the information superhighway by digital ed kemper who will cut your head off and put it in the trunk of his car when he goes to meet his parole officer shout out to the homie maddie gatz who uh is apparently doubling down on the idea that his that he has an adopted cuban uh son which is pretty funny and you know what if it's all true sure. I would believe that too why am. I going to disbelieve anything could happen in this world. I mean yes it doesn't seem likely. It seems more likely that some sort of weird perverted deal especially given gats's background but you know what wouldn't it be weirder if it was true and isn't the best understanding of this current moment that the weirder the truer so maybe he's 100 right and he did adopt a cuban boy who he has now raised who was also part of the house page program and who he referred to only previously as his helper. I do kind of like the idea that that he did have this son who he kept separate from politics you know for maybe for virtuous reasons. You don't want especially since he's an unmarried man people would raise eyebrows. He was like no. I'm going to save my beautiful young nephew son hector from this nester from the slings and arrows of the outraged internet mobs and the sleuths and the investigative journalists and the fake news media and then all it. Takes is one bad clip where he gets owned for not having a non-white child uh to go like actually no. I do and here he is uh either way.

It's funny. You you you win no matter what even if it's as stated and nothing he's saying is not true. It's still hilarious. This is my son and partner hw playing field. That's funny my son and helpler prosperous little business. No.


I would hope. I would like to see uh maddie gatz could be the president. I could see that happening i. I definitely have more faith than any of those weird mutant congressmen than any of these nerd senators who are supposed to be synthesizing trumpism into a coherent ideology like anyone in america gives a  about coherent ideologies nestor and pollux. Yes they're going to be in uh face-off too which has to take place in florida. Uh china india is pretty pretty pretty pretty wacky huh hand-to-hand combat on a giant uh gorge people falling in like it like  temple of doom hitting each other with like metal studded rebar or something wild. Einstein famously said that I don't know what world war iii will be fought what weapons world war three will be fought with but I know that world war four will be fought with sticks and stones. It turns out nope world war. Iii also sticks and stones awesome.

I would love that you know because obviously the conveyor belt for uh economic growth in both india and china has broken so their hope of like allaying a social conflict through economic expansion is over so why not just have a giant. Brawl why not just do a gangster new york style showdown with like a million guys on each side and see who wins you'd kill fewer civilians and it'd be way more entertaining for everyone else well. India has announced that soldiers died. I mean china is always close fist close-chested with information so who knows how many chinese guys died. I wouldn't be surprised. It was only indians died though the chinese military is a little bit more formidable than the indian generally but uh making indians mad at china instead of muslims is probably good for their domestic muslim population. Although you think that they could bond over their similar treatment like hey you guys put yours in camps and we lynch ours come on why what is our what what what are we really fighting about here. But I don't think it'll amount to anything. I mean the fact that it's literally hand-to-hand combat indicates that there's some awareness of the the risk of escalation and that nobody's nobody's tipping over into it so remember when the indian pakistan were going to go to war like a year ago. This stuff's not going to happen until it happens uh and when but no man knows the hour of the day of that it wasn't a year ago. All time has stopped to mean anything we're just in one eternal presence.

This is an interesting question at what age did you become yourself hmm. I don't know if anyone has ever themselves. I don't know if a self. I mean a self isn't a real thing. Obviously the self is an illusion. The self is a momentary uh delusional uh coping with the exist. The the fact of your accumulated memories or whatever and experiences all that  in your head that you you imagine that that's itself. But it isn't really. I guess the question is like when did. I become self-directed as opposed to just just going with the flow. I don't know if I ever have I mean I'm trying to get there but I'm not sure if I'm if. I'm there yet or if I will get there.

I would say that the grill pill uh attitude towards death is that death is not black. It's it's not blackness. It's not like the end of sopranos. It's it's it's not a light turning off. It's light going on. It's. It's re-communing with the entirety of existence of which you are inextricably bound and which you are a part of but which you falsely think that you're separated from for the the period of your life. And then you go back now. Virgil should be back um. I think. I think he's he's back now. I mean obviously it's probationary because we haven't talked to him in a while so but he was good on the show on monday. So for now he's back. I would love to do another lively solitude. I love a good uh. I love a good drawing room uh romance another good.

Oscar wild rip-off somebody got mad at me for saying that ohio is serbia because they were insisting that ohio is germany and they have one strong piece of evidence in their favor and that is that germany and ohio are both weird in that they tend to. They avoid the tendency to have one very large city and then a bunch of smaller ones and that they have a bunch of medium-sized cities and no one big one which is the way which is also true of germany which contrasts it with the rest of western europe uh. But I'm sorry uh you can't get at that balkan animosity without uh without ohio being serbia matt have I ever taken have you ever taken psychedelics uh yeah yeah. I think and I have I've been. I don't think I've done dmt. Somebody gave me something that they said was tmc but I don't think it was.

I've had ego death before but not through dmt and I'll tell you that's something having your having your consciousness dissolve having your awareness of your corporeal form be uh completely removed and then slowly reconstituting yourself. At like an atomic level you feel like dr manhattan uh only at the end of it. You don't have a giant blue penis which honestly if you're not going to have that why even bother now. I know you don't need to have drugs for ego death obviously. But it certainly makes it easier for a western subject to do that. Because the type of focus and presence of mind necessary to transcend you know the moment that you're in is very hard to cultivate. I'm trying to meditate yeah. I'm I'm not really getting any better at it. Uh just in terms of you know being able to kind of clear space. If I had but I want to do more. I would like to like do with other people you know in some way but right now. I just still feel like I'm stuck in this weird limbo where it's like the the quarantine seal has been broken but the illness certainly isn't gone and people are still aware of it and public gatherings are weird. I don't know this whole moment just feels so odd so singularly weird like everything at once and then nothing also.


I did see that trump owned. Uh owned uh juan guadito by calling him the beta o'rourke of venezuela which honestly. I think we might have done. At some point he might be a listener to the show. The tracksuit is uh is still there but it's warmer now. I wear the tracksuit because it was the spring and it was chilly but now. It's. It's it's warm. I always got to keep minimal layers during anything after mid-may due to just overwhelming sweating issues ah the beautiful venezuelan generals. He loved them too much. I don't want to go and kill those generals look how beautiful they are. I do like that. Bolton wrote this whole book to try to discredit trump as a idiot uh deleton. She's not serious about foreign policy but all that's coming out of it that anyone cares about is his hilarious just dumb ass anecdotes where he's getting horny for one guido's wife or something which is as it should be because his laziness and lack of vision on foreign policy is one of his blessings. One of the few things that are good about him relative to the average american president. The ellen john thing was very funny. You can imagine him trying to score with like tiffany amber thiessen.

In the early 90s. With that move yeah brazil is brazil is or brazil is the america of latin america. Brazil is the america of latin america. Uh france is the is the america of europe. Turkey is the america of the middle east. I'm still not sure the american of asia is that was a little tougher. No no no no uh brits. People say it should be. The brits should be the america of the uk and they are fat and stupid like we are. But they don't have that messianic nationalism that we have they lost that after world war ii we the french have a vision of themselves and a vision of their country that is very similar to ours in terms of its delusional narcissism. India is probably the united states of asia yeah but it breaks down there because you've got you know.

It's the difference between the the clone. It's development different like development levels and stuff are different. It's harder to compare italy is like us but like us in the future. Italy is future america after it's completely broken down and all of the residual uh. Uh all the residuals uh civic religious stuff is just been completely obliterated and it's pure gangsterism and we're certainly on that trajectory. It won't be long but I think there's still a few more years where we're still france oh man. The masks thing and uh the mask  is so amazing. I mean when you see the way that that got turned into a culture war instantly.

Uh it really does tell you that there is no chance for this polity called the united states to solve any problem. I mean unless unless you really do believe there's some sort of demographic destiny and you know all the old people dying and and the younger people being less tribalistic and tv adult. But I don't know if that's if there's any reason real reason to believe that uh but it certainly indicates that there's absolutely no there's no solving anything because because people can't agree on even what the problem is and I'm not even talking about it in abstract terms in terms of like a concrete crisis moment like a  viral pandemic. So now you've got mandated hamas in california but then the governor of uh oklahoma. I guess is telling cup cities that they won't get uh state money to combat coronavirus if they mandate masks so it's it's fun. It's like the five obstructions with federal government with uh with city governance here good luck.


But I think it's because uh. I mean why would we have any kind of unified understanding of anything every force in our cultures is towards towards not just atomization socially but atomization epistemically atomization of point of view. Whatever one of those one of those corn states corn and fossil fuels nebraska. There you go the one that's uh the one that's governed by one of the guys who owns the cubs but my idea that like china the united states are going to come together into some sort of weird political union. It's it's premised on the notion that there is a there is a enduring global marketplace. I guess at a global economy and a global elite because if that's the case and and maintain a global capitalist system.

If that's the place you're going to have to start finding more and more points of efficiency to to focus on in order to make up the loss of profit from the general decline of the rate and that's going to mean replacing the competitive state framework between two big chunks. Two big huge economies the world's two biggest economies that essentially work interdependently one another in practice but are politically separated that creates a whole bunch of inefficiencies that over time are going to become less viable if they want to maintain a capitalism. So there's going to have to be some sort of free trade uh framework between the two countries and that can only work where in a situation where there's been a some sort of political um modus of enemy. The only alternative to that would be some sort of war between the united states and china which is not impossible. I guess but uh seems to be much less likely the big thing that just concerns me is not even about china. It's just. I mean we're gonna see half a million dead from covet within a year right. I think that's pretty assumed now and that just doesn't happen you know like you don't just forget about it. You might even think you forget about it. You might stop talking about it but the reality of that many deaths doesn't go away and the need for someone to pay for it doesn't go away either and if there isn't some sort of conflict with an outside force that we could blame this on china being the number one culprit and I don't think there will be then we're all gonna take it out on each other. That's the only alternative.

I think the way that you become unblackpilled is to one detach yourself from the certainty your certainty of how things are going to end because you don't know nobody knows sir. Nobody on the internet knows. I don't know no man knows the hour of the day and the reality of that is freeing uh and of course the other part is finding things in your life to try to build around as opposed to trying to wish cast into the future about uh about what politics is. Gonna look like in five years or whatever because there's no way to know and all all fixating on a doom outcome does is give you permission not even to stop thinking about it. That's the worst part about the whole black pill thing if black people meant oh yeah. I'm just gonna stop talking thinking about politics and just like live my life that would probably be more that would be better for people than what they do which is that they organize their life. Around this sort of doom concept that they're not doing anything about like how many blackfield people are preppers how many blackfield people are significantly trying to figure out a way to you know have a to survive some sort of coming up apocalypse or have made the choice that oh things go to hell. I'm just gonna kill myself.

I don't think most of them do. I think what they do is. They use it as a as an ad hoc justification for anything uh but what that usually ends up being is self-indulgence in a self-destructive way. I think having a kid honestly people ask about having kids. I think having a kid is a good uh antidote to the to to blackpilling because you have someone you have to be there for and you have someone you have to imagine a future for and you know people have had children in every condition possible in this world now and in the past and assuming that you can't bring someone into this world is is once again assuming a degree of foresight that is foolhardy. You you can't know things out that closely you you can't have any kind of a surety of what's going to happen and even if it happens the idea that there's going to be some sudden apocalyptic culling of human life seems very unlikely of all of all the scenarios that seems like the least likely we want and so in the meantime you have to live and denying yourself essential parts of life to prevent some future calamity from happening will only ensure that your life is stunted has there ever been a realistic uh.

Oh. This is a good one actually this. This I can say something. I'd want to think for a while. Uh has there ever been a realistic and satisfying solution to nepotism um okay. This is something that bakunin said pukunen suggested and I'm always with marks over bakunin in their conflicts mostly because marx was speaking from the mid 19th century and bakunin being from russia was speaking from like the 16th century but but kunin's insight that inheritance is one of the foundational pillars of exploitation under capitalism is absolutely true and if you can't if you couldn't abolish capitalism which I think you could uh the only way you could make it work in any way like it's supposed to in any of the schemes and theories of of pro-capitalist ideologues is if you abolish inheritance completely in every way. Like you cannot transfer any money or property or capital of any kind to your kids or anybody. You don't get to pick you die.

It all goes to the state all property. All money goes to the state on your debt and the funny thing is you can't really argue against that on any kind of liberty grounds because you have free liberty to make as much money as you want uh. Once you're dead the idea that you get to carry out or that the state should carry out orders on behalf of a dead guy regarding like the disposal of huge amounts of capital. That's absurd so if you wanted to get rid of nepotism uh without abolishing capitalism. A good first step would be just making it impossible for people to inherit wouldn't that lead to people spending all their money before they died okay. What's wrong with that builds the economy what you don't have is you don't have generational wealth being transferred. You don't have people able to rest on their parents pile of money to be able to uh explore creative endeavors like that's why all the holly everyone in hollywood. Now when any kind of position of creative prominence is somebody's kid because the only people who can afford the risk of attempting to do an artistic life are people who have backup who have a lot of money just to fall back upon and if you didn't have that then maybe it would be less reproducing of of uh of wealth.


The way it is now exactly. It would be basically legislating the veil of ignorance and if you're going to do you know liberal capitalism. You need to do something like that to even come close to approximating the way that this system is supposed to work the way that the the relationship between an employer and employee is supposed to be an equal. Uh negotiation which of course is a hilarious fraud because of the existing debt ledgers. Everyone carries around with them but they are passed on from generation to generation. They would have to be wiped eternally wiped but that is not going to happen and honestly just get rid of capitalism. Why do the british people get mad when their celebs dodge taxes and we don't well the important thing to remember is.

It doesn't change anything that they get mad about it. How hot are the venezuelan generals. I haven't actually taken a look. I haven't taken a look at any of the handsome. Venezuelan generals. I'm going to take a look all right. I'm going to see some venezuelan generals here oh and by the way the other thing that goes with all of that money being taken to death is that there are uh instead of inheritance. There is a  safety net so the idea that oh uh you know somebody who is in the prime of urban years dies. Their family is left without anything. No it just wouldn't be provided by this. This cl. Essentially clan style of of resource hoarding. It would be administered by an agreed upon framework.

All right uh does anybody know any uh venezuelan generals. I could look up because all right. I'm going to the wikipedia page for the venezuelan generals all right uh. It looks like the guy in charge is vladimir. Pedrino lopez can I take a look at him. You know he's not that bad looking uh he kind of he's got the silver panther uh sort of a george clooney thing and like a less attractive clooney he's okay. I don't think he's handsome as our generals. I'll tell I'll tell you that I think our generals are much more attractive all right and then there's admiral remigo ceballo so let's check him out or sebeo. Rather he kind of looks like curtis sliwa. Uh yeah. He's all right. I mean I gotta say I've seen more handsome generals not gonna lie. I've seen hamster generals and what venezuela's working with they're no joe seastack. I'll say that but then again the admirals always were more handsome than the generals. I'm gonna get yelled at now for saying that the venezuelan generals aren't that hot. I'm betraying critical solidarity with the venezuelan bolivarian revolution. By not saying that their generals are the hottest of all time.


I don't know why amber mentioned the ho-chunk. I was surprised by it as well. Uh in wisconsin. You know what uh what native american tribes live there by uh what casinos are there because there's the monotony casino in milwaukee. There's ho chum casino in northern wisconsin. There's a few more even though half most of the town names are native native words. You don't learn a lot about them. Let's just say that people keep asking when bind is going to announce his. Vp pick but they generally don't do it historically until right before the convention. So it'll be a while if they if they stick with that. I've never been to foxwoods no. I've been to the monotonomy casino in uh in milwaukee. Though played bingo. There yes locks to flambeau kamala. I think. I think. I think kamal is a safe choice so that's probably who they're going to go with because they're looking at those polls and they feel like they got this thing in the bag. So they're going to do the lowest risk maneuver. They can't and they and a presidential campaign vetted. Uh senator is a good one. Even though nobody likes her. She doesn't excite anybody just like him tim kaine. They figure they don't need that and honestly they might be right. I mean the way things are looking now.

I really don't see barring a complete collapse by biden and like physical and mental which I think they're. Gonna keep him zapped up on enough anticoagulants and uh giving him like ground-up rhino horn and adrenochrome and and donkey tranquilizers that he will make it through. Although I do kind of think that he will not debate trump. I'm. I still kind of have a I have a feeling that there's no way we get the trump biden race that we all want or the trump buying debate that we all want so. I was for a while thinking that trump wouldn't debate biden but I think he will because hey sleepy joe would be great to own him biden. I think has a real danger about what if he has like a pants  moment what if he has a a real wool gathering like stockdale and 92 thing where he just kind of clips out that could genuinely risk him so maybe they figure out a way to say we're not debating trump. We're not going to platform this fascist like think about that if biden said in september we're not going to debate because we don't want to platform this uh. This fascist monster how would the how would the media respond to that they would say he's right because how can you argue after having spent four years making that argument about platforming how do you say that he's wrong especially if you're rooting for him.

You don't. He would get he would get off he would get a media reprieve for being the first pres presidential candidate since I think nixon to refuse to debate all. I know is there's no way we get it. There's no way. We get a great debate like that. Either they switch him out somehow because he's he's literally dying or or he cancels them. I just can't imagine. I guess oh god. There's one more even worse option one more even more depressing option and honestly now.

I'm thinking it's more even likely than that is that they do debate and it sucks. They have a debate and it's just boring. They both read for the prompters they hit their cues. None of them go off on tangents. None of them start really riffing on corn pop or hanging out with cheryl teagues at the model cafe. And it's it's just another political uh debate that would be the uh and that would be the grimace possible outcome and that's why that's why. I think it's probably gonna happen more likely than anything and that's why we're not gonna get the the sun's debate as much as that would be amazing trump don jr. Versus hunter that would be that would be truly transcendent maybe in four years when don jr runs for president and then maybe hunter can run against him because we know biden's only going to do one term. Maybe. He annoys his son as a successor like he wanted to do with bo maybe. He just says  to uh we're giving the patrimony to hunter that would be great that would be wonderful. We would love to see it. I don't think they're going to do. I don't think the the election will be postponed. I just don't think that it will be have popular. Legitimacy and people say well that happened in 2002 but in 2000 we were at the end of the 90s boom. The tech bubble hadn't even burst yet.

There were no conditions for anybody to do anything other than kind of mutter vaguely. That that was  if that happened now in the middle of what will still be happening which will be pandemics and civil unrest. I don't know what happens but there is a chance everyone's just too tired but everyone's too tired to give a  about an election because their concerns have transcended the theater of politics and politics has become fused with their daily lives is george saunders. A liberal probably. I think so yeah. I think most writers are most artists are the ones who aren't nazis. It's fine very good though. I like his work a lot what happens yeah what happens if turnout is less than 50 which I think could very well happen uh nothing although virgil we'll be talking in an episode. Soon about this virgil is very convinced that there's going to be like a big surge in turnout uh in november because all all the people who who are sort of constitutionally liberal or left or anti-republican who kind of tuned out in 2016 are going to  like make voting this time a priority uh and you know maybe.


I have no idea. I have I've given up prognostication on that that kind of thing we'll probably talk more about the senate because the senate is pretty interesting got a lot of toss-ups and I think it would be pretty pretty funny if biden won in a landslide got back the senate and then did nothing in the middle of a in the middle of a great depression level economic collapse like extended unemployment for an extra six weeks or something and that's it other than that he's the hunger chancellor. I'm glad booker is doing what better than mcgrath and I hope he beats her but mostly just so that if the unlikely event that you have some sort of massive wave election an unprecedented big surge which once let's say like. I said is not unheard of and not impossible that mcconnell could lose and in that situation you want a better person than mcgrath certainly to be the potential beneficiary of that people keep saying they're not going to extend anything past july. But I really don't think they're going to let that happen in an election year because at the end of the day these people are politicians and the money is free money right. There's no real extending unemployment extending the checks.

It's not really another than like in in a vague sense of offending uh uh uh sort of uh in offending like the mores of the the the manners of washington and their weird fixation on deficits and stuff uh. It's not actually gonna cause any real conflicts and it's going to be what the business community is to want because you need to have  consumer base to have in a consumer economy so people need money and you can just print more. There's no inflation right now so the idea that they're just going to say no we're not going to extend anything at the end of july and we're going to precipitate after we've already seen this massive wave of of civil unrest now just doesn't seem. I don't understand what would stop it from happening and the only thing people have been able to tell me is well. They want to make some sort of evil cruel point. No they want to get reelected and their their bosses want to make money and that's going to depend on. They're still being in united states which might not happen if you stop paying people in july with a covid once again out of control what they're going to do though is they're going to wait until the very last minute to do it. They're not going to do it until until it's the midnight up so that it's on their terms. Anyway maybe I'm wrong on that but I just don't see what would be the the material intercession that would prevent them from just cutting more checks to keep the economy from completely collapsing. I mean it's a  election here. I mean they still want to get reelected. You know yeah exactly july 31st at 11 58. They'll like put through more checks because they don't want anybody to get used to it.

The world is both incredibly boring and incredibly exciting absolutely because we're in a moment of deep crisis and we recognize the crisis and we're all in awe of seeing verities that we've taken for granted our entire lives crumbled before our eyes but the lived experience of that is looking at a  on their right wing. No one gives a  at all about the deficit. No actual conservatives except for a few cranks certainly nobody nobody in government and very few people who vote actually care about deficits and the only people who actually care about deficits are democrats because the way you know what people believe in is how they act and democrats in power cut cut budgets. Republicans in power spend because republicans don't really believe in devas the deficits that are bad or to be avoided or have any kind of long-term bad effect on the economy and I think the reason for that is that republicans also believe in this country more as in they believe in the endurance of american military and political influence and economic and industrial and all that they believe that america will never not be the first among equals of world powers and as long as that's the case. There really is no danger of some sort of uh debt crisis in america because who's going to call it in on behalf of whom as long as america is the dollar denomination for uh the dollar's nomination for the world energy economy and as long as the us military is the guarantor of market stability everywhere in the world. There's gonna be absolutely nobody to tell us we can't borrow money anymore because if we need it then that means this country needs it to stay up to stay open and they need the country to stay open and they and republicans believe that deeply you know as part of the armature of their ideology. That america is this enduring internal creature. Uh they lie and say otherwise because you know that they they want to game it to their advantage and they want to use it as an excuse to not fund social programs and to maintain wealth disparities democrats on the other hand.

I think are more skeptical of america's enduring role in the world and they think there is a there is a situation where these deaths could get called in and so you should be wary about running up too much what's going to happen when massive hurricanes start destroying. The east coast in a few months is that how do you say something like that with total confidence. No wonder you people are  knows what kind of. Do you know you're just telling this stuff to yourself so you can like get off on it or something or excuse why you're ordering taco bell for the fourth day in a row okay. The forecast is an above average hurricane season. All right how does that correspond to east coast destroyed by hurricanes are those commensurate concepts.

I just think that that's very indicative of the general black pill concept you you extrapolate wildly from current conditions without knowing what future conditions are going to enter how future conditions are going to intercede because things are never the thing the moment you're imagining is going to have things in it that you can't can you cannot predict by definition because it's the future. All those things are here now and they're going to determine it but nobody knows because nobody has perfect knowledge maybe. Someday you'll have an algorithm that will tell you every every element that goes in every decision. You'll have a perfect model of the universe. You'll have mintaculous and you can make a million dollars in the stock market every minute and uh and you can you can become. You could have the oculus and fernum from 13 ghosts and just see the facts in the future and everything but for now that does not exist if. I had five minutes with trump alone. What would I do with him. I'd probably make out with him. He would freak out. It'd be hilarious and I could get freaking cheeto dust in my beard the worst job I ever had was one. I had briefly.

I worked for a company that would contract to do inventory for real real uh retail stores. They would set up a thing where there's a like bar codes on all the products and you would have to run all of them on a barcode reader and then it would tell you how many of xyz products they have in stock. It was really bad for my bad back. I have a pretty like a herniated disc that's like the size of a  uh catcher's mitt and it really really did the number on my back. I had to quit actually because it was. I would come home and I couldn't move regis. Yes. It was regis that was it yep rgis baby oh man barcode. Satanism was so cool that the movie naked talks about that david. Thulis has a whole thing where he talks about the the the barcode thing. I don't know the whole the whole revelation seems so cute now that was that was literally a millennial movement like the whole left behind. Evangelical notion does anybody believe that anymore do even evangelicals believe that anymore best job I've ever had well. What do you think being a freaking podcaster I'm sure they still believe that stuff evangelicals but it certainly doesn't seem like it has as much of a cultural imprint as it used to yeah.


I honestly don't even think trump would contest the election. I mean did you see that tweet where he said or that interview where he said they asked him what if he loses and he says oh you know probably goes through something else he doesn't like being president. I mean that's clear if he has an out. I think he would take it his question is whether his supporters would accept it and at that level the question isn't really like his supporters is an aggregate group because they're mostly lazy suburbanites. I mean like are there any state governors who are going to kind of try to take a mantle of denying the uh the legitimacy of the election because these guys can control uh national guards and stuff that would be interesting okay. See all right. Someone says I'm not sure about extended unemployment. I think it's philosophical no philosophical esophageal they want to make money. All the ideology stuff is is trellis. It's all it's all uh. It's trellis. It's ivy. It's it's decorative. You can't make money if there's no economy and we're already seeing an uptick in the unemployment. Now even after the bounce back uh and the degree to which spending is completely correlating to uh. Access to this federal money means that it's absence especially in a time when you've lifted uh protections for renters and stuff like that. I just don't see this percentage in it. I guess is my saying. I think anybody who's talking about these things ideologically and says oh this goes against x y or z principle is missing the point they don't have principles uh yeah see that's the thing as somebody points out is that restaurants that we're opening are now closing again not because of any organic stay-at-home order. But because everyone's getting sick and that's going to keep happening and even even the even the psychic rupture of the of the quarantine mindset isn't going to change that where would I like to live in if not here.

I I've said before but I think pittsburgh would be cool. Maine is nice northern wisconsin. My my home state is very pretty. Syracuse is terrible. I'll keep that in mind I do not hate the south it all became a joke because southerners got too demanding about us coming. There is that then we decided to troll them. It is too warm for me. I will say that the south is too humid for me to be there for any extended amount of time. Humidity is my nemesis in life. The pacific northwest is nice but there's that fault line kind of freaks me out. A little bit. Florida is one of those states where I honestly cannot believe anyone even ever goes to their own volition absolutely baffling me just the air dense and thick slabs of of condensed hot water that you're just kind of swimming through t-shirt shops. Palm trees everything that was naturally beautiful just bulldozed under to create subdivisions for dying uh old people grim grim no thank you palmetto bugs flying cockroaches no thank you check please matt gatz. No thank you rick scott good lord. You guys have  elected skeletor to that governor and senator come on yurts are cool. I've I've gone to. I've rented a yurt a couple times and I gotta say the yurt is a good is a good. Those mongols knew what they were doing so. It's a good way to. It's a good way to chill.

Now okay they might set. They might reduce the amount of money they give people. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did that and then see if it's enough and if it isn't throw some more but I can see them definitely like tacking back on the amount that they give uh. But it they're still gonna have to be another. There's gonna have to be another tranche of dispersed monies. I have not eaten an olive garden in a very long time. Olive garden is really actually terrible. I'll stand for a number of the of chain family restaurants and darden group restaurants. Texas roadhouse isn't bad out bakes. Outback's okay red lobster is pretty good. I mean especially if you're not close to the coast. It's not bad chili's fine applebee's okay but olive garden is dreadful. The only good thing at olive garden are like the  calamari and the breadsticks that's it the idea of eating an entire plate like an entree at olive garden genuinely nauseated like that's one of those situations where I would have to be paid to go there because yeah I could have apps at olive garden but I am not sitting before a plate of their pasta. Oh god. This portions are so big oh boy. I'm getting nauseous just thinking about it. I haven't even eaten dinner yet well. If the economy is in an unstoppable death spiral. Then what are you doing in your house. I guess and that's the question. I should ask myself. What are any of us doing I'm cooking a little bit. I'm grilling certainly perkins is definitely better than denny's but I'm going to admit even as a midwesterner waffle house is better than either waffle house is by far the best of the regional diner chains. Do you think the thing is they got the gravy you know and you can get it on the hashbrowns. Any way you want. Nobody else can compare poor bill oakley. I would love to talk to him again but he's been having to just like eat food that people made him and make his own burgers since quarantine.

What see this is what I think is most likely to happen right here what if things just sort of plateau and even the perpetual weirdness is absorbed into malaise. That's what's going to happen until it can't happen anymore and that's when I talk about that's why you can't be black-pilled or anything because we are clearly in a critical decline phase of the american experiment. There's no question about that but those decline phases can last a very long time and they can end very abruptly or they can sort of be soothed out like the cycles of modern historical empires that have lost their their preeminence. Like the dutch and the british. The spanish they did not involve a wholesale like uh collapse of the polity that they um originated in you know but they um but they also were not the point of a global market which the united states is for the first time um. And that's the difference. But I i I all you can do is is is look after the moment look at what's around you uh. I said this on the jackman uh stay-at-home thing. I did yesterday with amber about the internet. But I wanted to run this guy buy you guys this this metaphor. I thought of political activism the act of like trying to create a new political world in this country trying to be a socialist. It's like building a ship right. Everybody comes together and through the trial and error of doing it and with some with some uh blueprints you build a damn ship.

You trim the you trim the keel. You you learn how to stand up the masts and all that stuff uh and at the end of it you have a boat that could go on the water and maybe get you somewhere and what the internet does is. The internet tells you that it's teaching you how to build a ship. There. You spend all that time on the internet thinking you're learning how to build a ship. But what you're not that's not what you're doing what you're actually doing is you're building a ship in a bottle you're building a perfect little boat. Little glass guy totally intact. It's not like you learn how to you know how to uh do one job to make a boat you learn how to make an entire bow entire ship. You're not just learning like the one job you need to cooperatively learn to get a boat in the water. You're you're making an entire one. But it's it's a little tiny model and when it's time to go out into the world you don't have a skill that can be applied to the task of building a ship. You have this ship in a bottle. Everybody comes out of their houses and they're all there with their ships and bottles and what the hell do you do with. Those you can't sail on those and that's it's just. It's the it's the sacrifice of temporal context. That makes it's so hard to even know what's going on in the world. When you're trying to construct uh a world out of the detritus of the internet is that you are you are idealizing you're creating ideal forms even if you don't know you're doing it and I've certainly done it and continue to do it because there's not a lot of alternatives and then you try to use those to navigate the world around you. But they're hermetic and that's why as scary as the world is. The demand still exists to engage with it because you can't outsmart it as much as the internet makes you think you can't all right guys. I'm gonna go I'll ask once answer one question before.

I go what kind of crazy new deal public works project would you like to see. The obvious answer is trains and that's a good one uh. But I don't know maybe zeppelin's would be even more fun. Zeppelin's charging stations and zeppelin paths all the way across the country. A stately and refined way of travel through the skies zero emissions and it's less uh infrastructurally intensive than building railroads would be there. We go let's catch you on the flippity-flop.
