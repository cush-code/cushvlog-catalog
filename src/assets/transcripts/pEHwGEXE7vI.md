Hmm. Driving that train. I don't contain casey jones. You better watch your speed trouble ahead trouble behind and you know that notion just caused my mind. I've replaced the cord here to try to get a better sound. If it's muffled at all. Say the word. I have the mic right here. I can switch but I think last time it wasn't connecting like it wasn't plugged in really this time. I think it is. It's muffled all right never mind. This time. I came prepared this time. I have all the necessary equipment at my disposal. There we go there we go now you can hears me. You guys can hears me can't you can you hear me now verizon or is it t-mobile who knows that guy's a country see a guy come on tv as a trusted symbol of of cellular telephonic clarity and bargain and he tells you. This is the bone to get and then a couple years later yeah. No it's actually these guys because they paid me more how am. I actually supposed to know who has the superior cell phone clarity and coverage if you guys are just saying this because people are paying you. I mean what the man honestly. I feel like they need to be held accountable.

Oh man you know. I was feeling kind of a little spooked up. You know feeling not too good about things in general. I mean. I feel fine personally but but I was able to ground myself by remembering hey. I can always hold people accountable and man. It really did help holding people accountable all day. It's fantastic just get the point of people to say accountable now. I didn't say accountable for what so this still technically isn't politics that's not politics. I want to hold the t-mobile guy accountable for switching. I want to hold whoever the first guy to figure out that you could make a must be held accountable but yeah it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun to to hold people accountable and it's free. It's free either. It could cost you nothing you don't and that it requires no effort whatsoever. It's a miracle. It's like white diagony said when he was He talked about masturbating and he said wood that were so simple to soothe your hunger by rubbing your belly. It's like you get to take all of your sense of outrage or anger or powerlessness and convert it into accountability in the form of you saying something who wouldn't take that deal we wouldn't take that deal who wouldn't be who wouldn't be sucked off by that particular succubus.

I have to say the mississippi state flag is a good one. They jumped up in the tears from very bottom tier to top tier flag best flags. This is now one of the better ones but new mexico is really good. The symbol um. What are the other good ones. I really like new mexico that one always stands out. But there's a couple. I'm forgetting about texas. I mean you got to give it to him just for simplicity and starkness um. Flags are not politics. Flags are aesthetics we're talking purely on aesthetic grounds. Virginia does have a murder on it which is pretty. Metal. It has a murder being carried out but I don't like flags with human figures on them because humans don't pop on a flag. It's too much detail. It's too busy. You need big bold strokes and colors in my mind. That's the best flag which is why new mexico is so good.

It's like off for two reasons. It's actually a decent design with the big o for ohio but two problems one. It's a pennant get over yourself. Everybody else has a do you think you're nepal. The nepalese flag is like that because it's you know those pennants are like you know traditional elements of of of nepalese buddhist practice. You just want it to be different and too many stars. Why are there stars. What are the stars doing what are the stars on there just busy and they're not even in a they're not even symmetrical or anything. They're just almost randomly thrown scattered and I will cop as a wisconsinite. Wisconsin has one of the worst flags in the country wisconsin and new york which both have the big emblems with the two figures and all the huge swinging and miss there and the funny thing is is not only do. They have similarly shitty flags. They actually basically have the same state motto because the same out of wisconsin is forward and the state motto of new york is excelsior which is I believe forward in latin or something else. So I will cop wisconsin bad state flag wish. It was different but it is really bad wisconsin.

Washington's yes clip art is the word for it. Excelsior is upwards well depending on like where you're facing upward and forward being basically the same thing you're talking about progress you're talking about positivism you're talking about like the brazilian flag ordo progreso. You're talking about upward or forward movement progress. The worm turning towards greater prosperity and safety for all the 19th century credo what yeah arizona's is good too. The the the southwest flags are both good oh yeah. That's great oh with the star and then the imperial japan but not problematic because you know. Arizona has not carried out any genocides in the greater east asia coast prosperity spear that I'm aware of yeah. No arizona is what you want in a flag for sure people are saying.

People are shouting out indiana. Let me look at that one not bad. The torch is pretty good the torsion and the in this case the stars make sense unlike on the ohio flag. So yeah no indiana is not bad. I mean ironic since in the end is absolutely bottom tier toilet. Garbage state bottom five but nice flag somebody's yelling for missouri. This has gotta be bad. Those hicks man think you're midwestern. I do not think so okay is it. Two bears are there two bears are there two bears holding up an emblem okay that's kind of cool they have literal bears. I believe those are two of alex. Branson's ancestors that's impressive yes missouri is the south correct.

I'm glad someone pointed that out this is interesting. I have a little bit of data here. Maybe. It's because I'm early it's either because I'm early or because I put friday vibe stream no politics in the header. But I have way fewer viewers than usual alive and I wouldn't be surprised if it's because people are like give me the politics and that's good. It's good to know what my what my real value add to the market is wow. I did not yeah two figures holding up an emblem is boring but if the two figures are bears it's kind of charming. It's almost like a flag for an alternative world where the bears took over planet of the bears. That's whimsical. I like it. The bear is also the symbol of the city of berlin you see a lot of bear themed emblems and and and symbology.

There. No albania has a great flag anything with a headed eagle. It's good. It's real good. Mexico also has a good flag. Mexico and canada. Both have vastly better flags in the united states. I hope this is all understood. Both canada you can say what you want about oh. It's a leaf. That's kind of you know. It's not viral in the way you want a nation's to be represented whatever if you're you know going to be heteronormative about it. It's just it's it's striking and it's it's. It pops the colors and the design pop and mexico. What the eagle and the snake great america bunch of lines not even symmetrical bunch of light. Like the ideal version of the american flag is the british union jack that is that concept made into something visually interesting. Everything else is just some version of bars like france and poland and russia and germany borrowed colors that all mean something if you're gonna mix that up the british figure that out and maybe it speaks to the difference between like how the political cultures came to be like the union. Jack has three three crosses on top of each other right. You've got the the saint george's cross that represents england that's the english emblem you've got. The saint andrews cross on the on the blue like the red on the white for st george that's england and then the white on the blue which is for scotland. Although they change the color scottish people real like snp people will not not cease to point out that the blue in the union jack is not the blue. In this. In this in the scottish flag it's like a powder blue and then there's a royal navy blue which is of course. A navy blue is very fitting for those and then like there is there's also a like a welsh flag in there.

But I don't know how it ends in there but anyway it It's all three on top of each other which represents like a political polity that emerged sort of organically as a whole. The united states and the fundamental problem with the united states from a political perspective. Like the the reason this exists. The the real materialist reason is the reality of free real estate europeans creating a european polity in a world of almost limitless expansion that is the reality that created our absurd situation where our political polity was. This weird mutual stand down between mexican standoffing states where they all relinquished the minimal amount of power and negotiated entry into this thing a system that only worked in the absence of sharpened regional or sectional or ideologue or party-based divisions and the proof of that was in the civil war that happened within 80 years of its adoption which should have ended the document. But because we were still expanding then because we were still pushing outward. We were still venting outward among other reasons but I think that's the generator of all the other ones. When that war ended. We left that this is history. This is not politics the one with flag. The one with the wheel man is really good and so the colors in our flag are just gingerly separated. Like here are the 13 colonies all separate from one another and not crossing in any way and then here are the stars all one after another and it's like oh my god god damn it.

This should have been dissolved away by the create the fermentation of america's social base that exploded the civil war but no the necessary container for it that contained those things in european polities. The first the other capitalist policy polities of this era didn't exist the hard lines like the social structural like resilient institutional realities built by the endless lapping of social currents along a fixed bordered enclosed polity. Our conflict happened in a in a context of continual expansion a continually unfixed border and that meant that we never really had to confront the class con the class the growing and emergent and finally you know terminal class conflict within the social order. When we could just buy it off like the history of america is buying off all of our social problems. All of our political problems all of our economic problems that are generated by the contradictions of our society buying them off at the expense of others that's it at the first. The expense of the native population of this continent the expense of um imported african slave labor at the expense of indentured and then immigrant working class labor from the the peasant overflow of europe and then the re-encountering of like remaining indigenous people and integrating them through you know conquest in the southwest and over time these different. These different groups of people become political subjects and obtain a political stake. But while doing so they are bought off with new lucr accrued through the exploitation of people. Other places in in um in our little burgeoning empire that we built in the united states for a while before just taking over the control of the world empire from the uk and then x and then like making fighting a war with communism over the resources of the post-colonial world and prevent and maintaining a position where they were essentially confiscated from these places that they existed. No recompense at all for the the robbing of natural resources and then our current crisis comes from the fact that we can't do it anymore. The border is closed.

The myth is over as greg grandin says and that is where all of this this spiral downward we're seeing like with the president not conceding. I mean. This is a big deal not in terms of there's going to be a coup but a big deal just historically as a as a new normal as a new degradation of like the the political space as a as a as a like self-conscious public arena where both sides accept the basic outcome of agreed-upon structures of government and law. That's a big deal and what is causing this breakdown is the inability of us to offload anymore. That's definitely politics and you know what you guys should hold me accountable for that please hold me accountable. I did a politics I didn't know growth.

I did an imperialism I did a white fragility and I have not even begun to contemplate the multiplicity of my offenses. Very sorry give me another flag folks. Let's let's keep reviewing some flags of course before you say it mozambique. Everyone loves it. It's got a ak on it badass. The soviet flag was really good hammer and sickle. How do you beat it just in the one corner though so you've got that just field of red man it was something. Movie. Bob does not want to debate me does he no did. He challenge me. He's he hasn't blocked me so I could check it out has he is. He has called me out. I would not do it. I don't debate but I'm amused by it if that's true. I don't.

I think you guys are pulling my leg. I gotta say. I kind of feel bad for movie bob. I can't get. I can't torment him too much he he did this tweet where he talked about how sad he how he felt like all of the progress he'd make in building made it building. A social life over the last 10 years is all being undone by covid and he worries. He's not going to be able to get it back and it hurt it hurt. I felt for the guy like that is a that is a thing where I recognize that he and I are basically the same guy in many ways. Like our backgrounds are similar or the way we encounter the world after going through college roughly similar with just differences of you know happenstance things that we did not control like we got sorted away from each other by by the quantum just interplay of of our of everyone going through their you know automatic social roles. So I made me really think like damn they're but for the grace of god So I don't feel like. I can really. I'm not gonna ever at him again or anything.

I mean I stopped doing that in general but this is definitely another reason. I can't do it for him and of course. This is true for every person. Like the fact is that if you think about anybody long enough if you know enough about anybody's history you will find some narrative whereby it really couldn't have been any other way. It doesn't absolve anybody of personal responsibility but it should drain from you the ability to hate them. But I have to say it is very difficult to practice that especially when you see people who do real evil enormous evil and they're right in your face in a way that that wasn't always the case in the pre-media overload age tacoma wept.

Tacoma wept somebody keeps asking for the isle of man. That's the one with the that's the one with the lovecraft like occult wickerman ass leg guy right yep. What's that thing called. I'm gonna look this up. There's a name for that right. The three legs ah and nia tree cassin nice triskelion we love it folks. Don't we love a traskelion. We love it. We got three legs. They go down the street bye oh man. The red hand of ulster is It's appropriately metal for what has the history of that region of the world. Like if you guys are going to fight over symbols and you know historical memory and identity. Like that you better have some badass symbology to back it up and I gotta say red hand of ulster pulls it off irish flag. On the other hand man. I always was hard for me to see all these patties get all teary-eyed about you know the raw and just flying that thing like you know flying the irish flag is a defiant act. During the troubles in england it absolutely was but it's really all the irish. All the irish flag is is the italian flag. If you leave it out on the pole for a month. It's just green white and then faded orange instead of red and I understand yes. It symbolizes the catholics the symbolizes the palestinians you see. The grain of himalayas is the catholics and the and the orange represents. The protestants and white is of course the pace that we make between us boring get something more interesting.

The the harp is pretty good. The harp isn't bad. They should use the heart more aruba aruba that's not bad. I don't. I don't like the star. The star looks like it's a hood ornament. It actually looks like the the door of a cop car. That's yeah the reuben flag looks like the door of a cop car. No thank you the south african flag. The new one is good. The old apartheid one is hilariously bad. The the south african flag is great because it's it does the you know the challenge of just lines or colors. Like representative colors. It goes above and beyond just lining them up and it doesn't even just do like the you know the the the the pen. The internal pennant thing that you get with like puerto rico goes through us. It's good but man the old apartheid one which was like a clip art deal where it was like orange and then like the british flag and stuff like all in little and little rectangles in the middle yeah. Dog look at that thing. It's a little uni. It's orange on the top white in the middle blue on the bottom and then in the white stripe in order is the little a little tiny union jack a flag and a flag and then another flag that represents probably. The the milwaukee flag is really really way too busy and cartoonish. It's not great australia anything with the union jack on it is cucked you're cucked. Get a new flag get a new head of state you. The queen the hell man cucked yes. The red letter media guy sitting on a couch should be the milwaukee flag agreed. They represent the city in every respect sri lanka sri lanka. No this apartheid south african flag is some clip art. A collage of other people's flags. It's like something you you. It's like a flag project like design a flag for your country and you forgot to do it until the morning of class just dragging flags on a clipart thing and putting it together what did someone say. I forgot already sri lanka ooh yes sword lion you're doing well 

It's a little busy. It's gonna stay out. It's not gonna be in my top top because it's a little busy but big if it is if it was yeah like if maybe the border wasn't there. Sorry guys am I back. I think. I'm back right. I got a phone call. I don't know how you if there's a way to stop that but yeah if if I got a phone call it just knocks me off. I guess yeah. I can't go airplane. Mode can I go airplane mode do not disturb. I don't really know how to do it.

I've never really looked at the doohickeys all right so give me another flag gibraltar oh. I thought I made my point about the sri lankan flag clear nice but too busy welsh flag. They used to be have a leak on there and they switched to dragon because they thought it was cooler. She have some leak. It's not good enough for you. The alaska flag has a big dipper on it right yeah that's not bad just a big dipper like it actually reflects something natural which I like brazil is funny. It's the only flag in the country in the world national flag that has any words on it and those words are ordo o progreso or order in progress in portuguese because the people who design the brazilian flag were part of a essentially quasi-religious cult around french positivist philosopher august konkt and they believed that the the the enlightenment and then the industrial revolution that came after it had created a situation where human perceptive capacity human ability to to empirically observe its world rationally would become so powerful that all human issues how problems would be solved through the application of reason that was the basic faith and it was an actual church. They had churches that they were all over the place in the 19th century they're kind of like a fraternal lodges. It was it was like it was like a nerdier less ritualistic freemasonry basically because freemasons believe kind of broadly the same thing but in occult terms like when they talk about progress you know us improving the world you know it's in these in the terms of you know like the grand work and everything but you know in practice that means applying reason to the world and solving its problems and they were very influential and especially in latin america. Like the The scientificos who were caught like a like essentially the intellectual the coordinating committee for cap emerging capitalism in 19th century mexico. Under the porfiriado of diaz. They were similarly positivists in that they felt like if we get the data.

Here we can turn this country into a modern society and all of our problems which are lingering issues that come from colonialism and racism and everything else will be resolved and it had a lot of influence. I think world war. One really kind of took the window of the sales. On that world war. One was kind of a oh boy. We got more technology than we've ever had. We have more scientific knowledge than we've ever had and we just had the world's biggest puddle of european royalty. But you know really. It was about you know the system overheating the need for markets to be found elsewhere and and the need to deal with the rest of working class who were acquiring political power at an alarming rate in all of the countries that went to war in world war one and that kind of took the wind out of the sails of positivism but then for a while there. In the 19th century it had a real goal and one of the legacies of it is the flag of brazil ordo and progreso and then you look at brazil now and you look at. Bolsonaro running around getting pecked to death by emus and getting 16 types of corona and saying that we need to not be. Homos about it only worse than that. I don't know man. I don't know think the I don't know if I agree with your police work. There lou south carolina flag. Is a good flag. There's an interesting factoid about the south carolina flag and it speaks to the history of of like the settlement into plantation agriculture of the south.

Because the underlying reality the underlying thing that that ended up creating the dueling economic models in the north and south out of the american colonies was was geographical. It was distribution of soil riches basically. The northern tier thanks to weather and other things had land that could could be used for agriculture but was could not be profitably utilized in the nutrient-intensive extractive economies of cash crops. So the model became small holding farmers who traded with cities. They traded their surplus production to to urban areas in exchange for finished products in the south. The existence of this rich bottomland allowed for this large-scale exploitation which required a degree of labor input that was simply not affordable on the market. No one could be paid enough to do what it takes to take to to make that profitable you would take all the profit. There would be no profit. There would be no place for the guy to sit on the veranda and fan himself and that simply wouldn't do and so slavery had to be invented out of that reality and the people who carried out that slavery were culturally distinct within the people coming to the new world because every every like wave of europe english first english and irish. Immigration. British immigration in the very early air of the con of the of the colonies was the distribution first almost randomly like religious outcasts and you know people seeking trade but over town over time as the area became settled and as like its actual distribution of resources became known. People started self-selecting and in a place where there's a ton of land that could be bought held and converted to to like massively labor extractive agriculture meaning indentured labor or slaves. This brought the aristocracy it brought the the gentry of the of the of great britain. It brought the the the overflowing squires the children of the of the of the land-owning elite. The the real blue bloods in heraldry. The crescent moon is the sign of the second son who doesn't inherit anything under primogeniture. The one who has to become a join the army or the priesthood or find something to do because you don't get the you don't get anything you have to find your way and a lot of these people in after the after immigration. And colonial colonialization colonization started in first in the west indies and in the americas um they started following suit. They followed the land and the generation of leaders of colonial south carolina the ones who built its institutions and built its culture and built its political you know architecture and and it's like economic. Arrangements were largely the second son sec second the second sons of planters who had already been established in jamaica and in the west indies controlled by the uk places where the you know the dwindling. Land like the land of the old aristocracy was sort of dwindling away in its profitability during this era in england and at the same time you could take your capital. If you accumulated. There go to the new world buy some land and recreate it there with slave labor instead of tenets or or hired hands and a much higher profitability rate than like shearing sheep or whatever you were doing in the cotswolds and so they recreated the old aristocracy in the new world. But the same issue of primogeniture arose and so the early elite of south carolina were the second sons of those jamaican and barbadian planter aristocrats and so they put the sun on the flag. So that's a fun little fact.

 anybody have any other flags for me nepal yeah. That's the one that's the pennant right. That's the one that isn't trying and that's actually like ohio is just a pennant this with the with the saab. It's cool. It's good. It's good.

It's a good battle standard which presumably it was maryland is weird marilyn. If you look at it too closely you get a headache. It looks like a magic eye poster scariest world war ii group except for the nazis that's a good one. There's two big contenders in my view one the eustachia in croatia ante pavlick. These guys were when the not when when they entered into their junior partnership with with the third reich they saw what what they could get away with who boy. They went ham and um and even like the local nazis were so appalled by it that they said hey tone it down a little bit. There was a There was a group called I mean there was there was a rumor. I think it was like in a you know. It was. It appeared in a novel but people sometimes think it's it's true. I guess. It's apocryphal. It's too good.

I kind of believe it's true because it's too good a story that ante pavolik the guy who was the head of that puppet regime. Was. He had a jar of eyeballs on his desk but he along with a lot of the other estacia in a higher rate than like other collaborators was able to escape europe through a rat line involving the vatican and catholic priests the cia and the mafia. Like this was the early stages of setting up the networks that would become the gladio operation. The first thing they did was get these croatian catholics out of europe and into south. America and anti-poverty went to argentina. I believe where he lived for like relatively in the open for 20 years until a I think a serbian nationalist found him and plugged his ass and he actually survived the initial gunshot and was flown to spain for medical treatment under franco and then died there so the ustasher up there the iron god of guard of romania who carried out one of the most gruesome pogroms of world war ii where they literally took jewish people I think of budapest into our bucharest into a slaughterhouse.

Texas chainsaw asker stuff like the kind of stuff that that even for holocaust standards is pretty grim you know like because you've got your holocaust stuff which is all like bone-bleachingly sold terribly so shreddingly terrible and then you've got things like the iron guard. The dural wongler brigade come and see is based on those guys that is like and of course mengele where you're like and then I will say non-european edition you gotta go with japanese imperialism holy. Machine guns is a bad mixture unit 731 but that on the list that goes above and beyond world war ii grossness nanking massacre also yeah. It's a very good likelihood that I mean you can trace seven you mk. Ultra starts with unit 731 because it was from that research that the cia developed the germ warfare that they were using in in korea that they had to cover up and and also the mind control techniques. They used to try to like reverse engineer brainwashing and also create at the same time and you got to say though though like of all these places like the japanese to just like not really talk about it at all to just sort of act like okay why are you bringing up old. It's it's pretty breathtaking from like you know from a g8 country. It's like come on guys. You guys are rich. You.

Guys are rich look at the germans. The germans are like are bad and it's like sure you know. They can. They can feel sad. They're all chop stuffed with chocolate and round and enjoying a big frosty beer and listening to some oompa music. They can be like yeah sorry sorry about the holocaust. You guys have. Say my bad oh what because you got nuked oh sorry. I mean turkey you can kind of understand a bit more you know like it's it's been.

It's. It's it's a developed country. But it's also a much lower. You know just per capita income level than japan. It's much less politically stable. I mean four or five what. I think what I think believe three coups since world war ii and an attempted one only a few years ago and you know like the fact that they're that their whole domestic political culture is this sort of like islamofascism. It's kind of funny like that was a made-up term that was a made-up term for years by guys like christopher hitchens to squint at the cold war and turn it into world war ii but like specifically like the akp political um you know military machine that controls. Turkey is like fusion of like the old you know right-wing secular nationalism of the grey wolves with like explicit. Islamic like religious justification and of course also just shock through with gladio. But of course. The japanese government was also shot through gladio. I don't know as much about that but apparently there's a lot of stuff like the us and the yakuza operating it to essentially create like a a shadow structure behind the entire political facade and the like. The emerging conglomerates that dominated japanese economy. I'd like to know more about it click at the same time like it's all behind the scenes and they get to groove. They get to dance with like the mascots they get to do. The mascot dance. Turkey doesn't get to do the mascot dance. They go to soccer matches and I'll have to stab each other. So I say japan you have less of an excuse than turkey come on. Japan come on yeah. Both the japan in both japan and italy the united states essentially created one-party states to replace the fascist governments staffed largely by former administrators and political figures of those fascist regimes to maintain make sure that calvinism did not come through the back door.

We're going to play cod cold war on sunday. We're going to try anyway. I do not. I mean i. I trust chris but I don't trust the equipment necessarily so and I don't like know how this is the first time you're streaming something. So we're going to be in the office having tested each other and had our tests done and we're going to be coding. The fact that it's all there in the 80s is just so mind-blowing the amer. I mean we like to think of the 80s as the grand like climax of the cold war in terms of it's when we achieve moral clarity. It's when we finally had a president who had the guts to call them an evil empire and demand the end of oppression in eastern europe tear down this wall and it all ended up to the walls tumbling down like jericho but in terms of our actual policy like the strategic. Geo like the the the geopolitical like strategic operations that made up our cold war response. Our comor gamesmanship was at its most depraved and monstrous and that's because we felt like we had him and we were gonna squeeze the life out of him. What was like the u.s. Cold war in the 80s was let's go around the horn. We'll start close to home in the 80s cold war was in latin in central america.

 support genocide against indigenous people who are resisting the the feudal overlords. The the post-colonial fuel overlords that we had installed there or in the case of nicaragua respond to a popular political uprising against our disgusting latifundist comprador class collaborators. We declared unofficial and illegal war on them and that were including the illegal mining of their harbor and the funding of a bunch of drug peddling psychopath former military officers whose main tactics were burning down rural hospitals and raping teachers and burning down schools. That's what they did. They didn't fight. They didn't fight the san anises. They murdered civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure with the drug money that we helped them get by selling drugs to american citizens. That's another part of this thing.

Let's not forget that in the 80s it's collaborating with operation condor and the it is full-throated military and diplomatic alliance with the south african apartheid regime in its death throws supporting it against international censure and and the the effective application of sanctions and then militarily collaborating with them in trying to defeat indigenous or african. Independence movements in namibia you get a situation the battle of queento canavale the biggest land battle in africa since world war ii a stand-up month months-long battle between marxist angolans and supported by cuban and russia cuban troops and russian advisers against south african against a a native like puppet guerilla movement supported by south africa european mercenaries and us that's what we were doing in europe. That's what we're doing in africa at that time. Meanwhile the the south african security service. The boss the bureau of state security is going hog wild doing everything from assassinating obviously assassinating domestic political opponents like steve biko creating puppet organizations like within the zulu. Communities to create like a a turf war with the anc. So if I undermine their position from the inside killing opponents in foreign countries they swedish prime minister.

They very well might have intentionally infected townships with aids if you believe anything that was in cold case hammerstroll and there's reason to the middle east who did we support in in the in the convulsions of the middle east like the lebanese civil war israel and the phalange. The people who carried out the severance shittily massacre funded both sides of the iraq iran war which is the biggest land war of the 20th centuries under the world war since world war ii and killed millions cease needlessly defend supporting the mujahideen in afghanistan a bunch of tribal psychopaths reactionaries in every sense like the the up up holders of like the least progressive elements of the society intentionally to undermine communism with no idea or care about what it would do in the long run. Also just dealing drugs let's not forget that just dealing wild amounts of coke and some heroin too the golden triangle's still there afghanistan oh we were supporting the po the khmer rouge in exile isn't that funny the khmer rouge and exile because they had been kicked out by the vietnamese. The the vietnamese communists was supported in the u.n. And materially by the united states and britain and china of course which is hilarious but and so yeah like what's one of the missions you go in and meet paul pott and you give him a bunch of land mines just like there's nothing but repression and bloodshed. There's nothing you can like at least in the 60s there was like the usaid thing. There was like the peace corps which is awful as you could. As you want to say at least was an attempt to like extend a carrot and by the 80s because the tide was turning there was no carrot that developmentalist that by the 80s that rug had been pulled out after the vulcan shock especially in the domestic. In latin america. The vulcan shock we talk about what it did in domestically but what it did internationally is also still with us and what specifically it did in. Latin america is that it essentially exploded the death of every country in latin america which was priced in american dollars and had american interest rates therefore determining its transactions and they could and so their interest rates on the the debt just exploded and it essentially broke the back of the entire like developmental model that was being tried in latin america like there was an attempt even among like the right-wing regimes to build independent domestic economies and not just be extraction economies for the west and and the the yankees but those efforts were fundamentally in every sense abrogated by that and everything has been struggling with the fallout of that so once again nothing nothing to write home about about the us and the cold war you know I'm trying to think of like forces that the us supported in other parts of the cold war that might have you know even if they were bad because we were supporting them.

Why wouldn't they be but you know like the people making them up. You have some sympathy for like. I would say that the hmong the the mounted yards that the cia recruited to to fight on their behalf in vietnam and laos. I I it was all bad but like I they themselves you know were fighting. They weren't fighting to oppress anybody really. You know you could see that they were like just trying to maintain a way of life. Maybe even maybe that's and of course everything was fueled by drugs and so you've got local leaders just taking over and it's corrupt of course. There's just something. I could see is like yeah. You know what that's that's a bum rap. I don't know what I would do in that situation either. But by the 80s it was all just monsters. It was. It was it was the worst the settler colonial over class unrestrained by any concern for needing to negotiate with like working class power or or or peasant power. So yeah. I'm very interested to see what the missions are like. I said it'd be very funny. If the verbont killings were one you got to go into a belgian grocery store and just spray everybody like the no russian scene trying to think. But I'm wondering whether it will actually be in there. Where is he gonna go. I saw some jungle action. Are they gonna just do. Rambo like pretend.

That's what we were doing in the 80s yeah. There's a good idea the dalai lama. The dalai lama is basically a cia asset. They they got him. They got him out of there as donald sutherland said in jfk for to serve a purpose. Like he his his international position is is a was maintained because of its advantageousness to u.s. Foreign policy but at the same time I can't get mad at the llama and I can't really feel. The llama is doing that much bad maybe he's doing more. I don't know that much about the llama he probably I mean and it is true that hereditarily the llamas were just feudal overlords and they were extra. They were exploitative and like they were but like when they kicked him out is. He even that anymore isn't he just kind of like a hobo so can't get too mad at the lava.

But that was the 50s in the 80s. It's jonas savimbi. It's pinochet pol pot. As I said earlier yeah. There should definitely be a a a thing where you just have to escort like a shipment like an escobar shipment. Because we were buying it for we were They were moving it for escobar. The cio was moving for escar escobar through central america among other people. And just stuff you got to get like a giant thing and you got to get it through and like escort mission wrap up maybe cigarette boats. I know it was most of california but maybe just like a cigarette boat thing like that'd be fun.

Someone wants to know about the ecci. I mean it was essentially a front bank for cia transactions and money laundering which the vatican bank also served as is the 80s. If there's a contemporary equivalent deutsche. I mean all of them are obviously if in a case of emergency. All of them are but in terms of ones that act on a day-to-day basis for that purposes you look at the global war thing hsbc is up. There they got dinged for that like multi multi multi-billion dollar cartel laundering case where nobody did a dive the second of jail time and their their their their um. Their their fine was basically a rounding error compared to how much money they'd moved but deutsche bank man deutsche bank. I don't know a lot about all the ins and out stuff. I'm not true not. I'm not a details guy. I'm big picture but man deutsches bank wild. Oh yeah chechnya you could go to chechnya in that one too. In the 90s oh man. I want those vatican archives. Somebody said vatican irvines are the deutsche bank archives. They would both be rich rich treasures but I would love to get like the whole depths of of the vatican's specifically their inner intervention in italian politics after world war ii very interested in that but also all the pedophile stuff come on how far did that go yeah. That's there was a cause like if p2 is like the secret government like the social secret government of italy after world war.

Ii then south africa had one too someone is reminding me. This south africa had one of those too It's it was called the africana broderbund the african afrikaner brotherhood and it was a it was like kiwanis club and if you if you wanted to be if you wanted to get into the the top ranks of the national party you had to be in it and that's kind of what you get when you get a situation that it happened after in south africa because after they after south africa officially got separated from the uk they became kind of a one-party state. For a while. The national party became like the the the governing structure even though they were still formally a democracy within the white. You know electorate so that meant that like politics had to become internalized and it was internalized through this organization a broad report and you know it was. It was a way to to identify talent and then groom it through social trust and connection because that's how you actually have to govern you have to govern through insinuation and trust so that you can leave unspoken horrible things.

The only way you can do that is by the acculturation of trust over time and so these ritualized sort of initiations. They're part of any power structure and so like that is why you know that's one of those things that is distorting because conspiracy theory turns it into the whole sum of the thing. But really. It's just the social ritualization of power that is there implicit in the str. The structure that we're all finding ourselves part of and we're playing our part within. But at the end of the day there was enough like when any of you talk about any of these shadow governments or anything they're able to rule because they represent a social order. That is that is in some sense materially generated.

That's why they're able to rule so something intervenes with them. They will rule up and put some politics in there and if I did I have to say that I i feel that I am accountable and I want everyone to know that. I feel that I am being held to account by you and that you can be aware that in the future I will always remember this moment of accountability and carry it forward into the future to remain an accountable boy. An accounting accountable boy who we all love to account for and account for every day. Don't we love him. Isn't he a sweetheart. He is. Isn't. He say goodbye to the accountable boy accountable boy. They all said.
