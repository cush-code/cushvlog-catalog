I think ah looks like I am Skrillex sake trying to get this thing to work. I got all I got a frickin lens flare. I feel like I'm in a damn JJ Abrams. Movie guys you guys know what I'm talking about freakin JJ Abrams am. I right that guy he loves his lens flares so one thing he loves. It's a goddamn lens flare. So I have one of those it looks like I'll try them angle. I don't know and I'm not doing very good job sorry guys. Didn't do a show. Yesterday didn't do a stream. Cuz. I was just feeling a little drained and I didn't want to force it. So I gave myself some time to just vibe something. That's okay with everyone but not back and I'm ready to take on the news of the day. Whenever you guys want to talk about. I would turn the light out.

But it's very dark in here. It's not a lot of windows in this apartment. So even with the Sun out it would be you wouldn't be able to see me if I didn't have the light on So the other day Matt yeah Glacia Scott had a classic epic one of his trolling moments where I said I think Trump is actually pretty smart. He's smarter than people give him credit for and that many people may add and it became a big argument that it made me really feel of two minds about it because I feel like there's a lot of evidence that the man is an idiot but the very level he is wildly wildly intellectually lazy and I'm interested in applying any like intelligence he might have to anything because he assumes he already knows everything and like that's I don't know at one level at what level can you separate that from just being dumb I mean because functionally it makes you incapable of applying knowledge anyway but today he had some lines that really made people be like wow.

I think this determines the case once and for all these are some amazing quotes I want to read. He was in Allentown. Today the way he said he said we have the best testing in the world because that testing B could be the test is frankly overrated. Maybe it is overrated but whether they start yelling we want more. We want more than we do want and they say we want more when you test you have a case and when you test you find something was wrong with people. If we didn't do any testing. We wouldn't have a few cases we would have very few cases so people are like goddamn what the hell he is.

He doesn't have object permanence. He doesn't realize that you're not reducing the number of people who have it you're only reducing your knowledge of the people who have it so people plate that and say that's evidence that he's dumb and that's what I thought at first too. But honestly. I thought about it a little bit more and he's really just coming from a different premise. He's coming what a lot of what happens with Trump is that he is coming from a prat one of what makes him dumb and honestly. It's not so much dumb as unnecessary for him is that because he has such a unique relationship with the press and with the public he doesn't have to play certain games. He doesn't have to hide certain premises he doesn't have to be disingenuous. He can be direct and that leads him to come at things from an angle that like the media class is baffled by and so they see this and they're like what an idiot he is but think of it.

This way he is coming from the realization from the knowledge from the understanding that all the people at the highest levels have and there is slowly dawning on everyone around us is that that there's nothing to be done that there's no cavalry coming they're not gonna do any kind of system to reduce the spread of this disease because it would require allowing people to live outside of market relationships that are defined in like a country that is a service economy that means that since we're not gonna change that relationship and the only way to put money back into the system is to recirculate capital in the market. Then we're gonna open back up. We're gonna let everybody back out. We have to there's no alternative because there's no there's there's no willingness or even ability at the highest levels to put together the infrastructure to replace the market. So we're gonna go back anyway and there's not gonna be some wholesale testing and tracing.

They're not gonna be quarantine anything. So if we all if you understand that which Trump does and which a lot of people in the media are either lying to themselves about or are too stupid to understand. Then why why test people it only undermines their consumer confidence to know how many kids positive cases. There are or how many people are dying from it if we have all collectively decided that we have given up what is the point about maintaining some tally the number isn't going anywhere. It's just gonna go to make it harder to convince people to leave their houses which you need them to do. Because the scary thing for a lot of for the economy people is you can reopen but it won't make people necessarily go back out to the places like Sweden has not done any orders for sheltered place or anything. Like that yes. They have a much higher rate of infection than the rest of Scandinavia but what's important to note is that they have a similar drop in people going out and retail and and restaurants and bars. They didn't need an order people don't want to get it so you need to get over that one way. It's like toughen people up to the mass death. That's gonna happen and say don't be afraid to let your body die all that stuff oh. There's more to life than that mere living you know there's the Darton stock buyback provisions so that Red Lobster stays in business and there's no reason to have the number so he's right. He's right people need to be as ignorant as possible about what's really happening with this thing. In order to get the economy back going we have to be in complete denial if anything we should stop counting all together and make it illegal to tell people who have it that would be the way to like really dive into what now what we're gonna do what's the point of having these numbers just to feel anxious about them.

[07:39](https://youtu.be/DUnJBm0JIpM?t=07m39s)

Wait we are not fixing. There's no cavalry. There's no fixing this. No one at the top levels have the interest ability willingness. There's no challenge to them from anyone else. So we're going to go through with this. We're going to accept the new normal of people dying from this disease in huge numbers and if that's the case knowing the number only undermines our recovery effort because I think a lot of people who are still indoors and are horrified and all these people leaving their houses. I think you gotta realize something like a lot of people. Everyone is is dealing with stress from this change. You know it's like obviously. It's not like you know being in a war zone or anything. It's very but you're talking about incredibly pampered people in general Americans so any kind of restriction is felt very hardly because they haven't had many so they don't. They're not used to it and a bridle on it and then they have to deal with it now for a lot of liberals and leftists who pride themselves on their community mindedness and their intelligence and their ability to recognize and listen to expert opinions staying home carries with it. Some sense of satisfaction you know staying home even though it sucks and you can't you'd rather go out yes.

But I'm a good person because I'm indoors and so that is that's a little benefit. You see it when people clap at 7:00 o'clock. They're like yes. I am you know involved in a project. The conservative people and even apolitical people do not have that relationship with this. They're not getting that benefit they're not getting that like psychic identity boost of being like oh my god. I am a good person because I'm staying indoors because they don't buy any of that stuff. They don't buy the community mindedness for one. They think that's frankly kind of fruity as Homer Simpson would say they don't buy what experts tell them because they assume experts are on the other side. So they think they're getting scammed and rooked and conned by staying indoors and so they have to find something else and getting mad about that that's their version of you're feeling good about staying indoors but all of its coping with the fact that this whole thing was supposed to build time buy time to prepare prepare a contingency plan that maximize human lives. It's the same that like that privilege saving lives and it didn't happen and it can't happen now so like Trump is being dumb because he's not playing the game the way it's supposed to be and he's he's living in a level of abstraction that just speaks his. It really just speaks to his sociopathy. I mean like a lot of the stuff that we think of as trumping dumb is just him not recognizing other people as having interior tea you know and that's not technically the same thing but really what he's just doing is. He's recognizing a deeper reality which is that this number doesn't mean anything.

These numbers aren't going to help we're not going to use them to save lives. They're only going to make it harder for us to reassert a normality in which this death is part and parcel like car accidents or gun gun deaths or anything else and that's what's so horrifying to see people see these right-wingers going like you know there's more important things than just clinging to life like this life has to have meaning and what's so annoying is that that's a hundred percent true and it really would have been nice to have some of that sentiment floating anywhere in the cultural ether. After I don't know 9/11 went a little bit perspective on 3,000 deaths might have prevented us from killing a million more but that fit you know the the emerging need for a replacement for the Soviet Union to justify like the defense Keynesian state and the American military you know global hegemony. Now all of a sudden we have perspective on the meaning of life when it means that caring too much about life well instead of lead us to insanely attack everybody in the world and spends trillions of dollars it'll lead us to oh no not go out to eat not go to TGI Fridays oh dear God not to go to Red Robin and get the blorch burger with extra blorp sauce and so that's what's so disgusting because they're evoking a truth. They're voting a reality of this like disenchanted and spiritually dead in time.

This we are morbidly fixated on our physical lives and extending them because it's all we have because we don't think that there's anything else not just beyond life but even in it beyond physical pleasure and mere distraction and we need this change that we need to like Reese acryl ice life at some level. I'm not talking about like reinstituting a religious you know doctrine or state theology. But I mean just like creating a value to social social interaction like building social meaning that has to be part of the equation and these people are invoking that idea on the for the benefit of the Darden Restaurant Group and Yum Brands and the continued viability of this just disgusting weezing exploitation machinery. It's very sad because then you have to say no lives mean something but you're still you're at the end of a your reifying that spiritual deadness you're saying no all. We have is our lives and it's like we should be willing to sacrifice but for something worthwhile we should be willing to sacrifice for something for building something.

They're asking us to sacrifice to may sustain an unsustainable system of misery spiritual and material death. It's very depressing so that's why those guys are to me. The most disgusting people of this entire thing are the people who want to who want to exploit everyone's like thwarted yearning to be heroes everyone's throated yearning to seek meaning through action and to say yes what that means that that feeling in your heart is take a Applebee's that's not good that's just that's more your your you're cheapening life even more by saying that the material mere distractions that have robbed of us are of any spiritual understanding are more important than any human could be. I mean my god. I can't think of a more nihilistic and monstrous piece of yeah and the idea that anyone who believes that they want to bring religion back to this country that they think like we've lost spiritual values and that we need to restore them and is saying die for Darden. Brands is nauseating honestly died for dart and brands. Folks died for bharden brands. Darden brands bargain brands so how are you guys doing shop until you drop it. Deep. God remember. I remember being a kid and like even as a child recognizing the over heavy-handedness of like corp of like anti consumer culture. You know like Adbusters. And it's like the analysis that you get from that is not very strong and it doesn't really point you towards meaningful action because it gets so fixated on you know cultural stuff.

But goddamn it. It's very hard not to see the death. Drive manifested by it directly through the need to consume like we're literally willing to die in order to consume and it's like Dawn of the Dead where he's got all the zombies tottering around in the mall. It's like you know it's harder to roll your eyes. At that. Like we really have reached a point where every satirical observation and exaggeration that has to come before is now just happening that's at hyperspeed just like at any moment. Anything you ever thought was over-the-top in some satire is going to appear before you first. It's start of the dead next death race - mm get ready for it. It'll be death race 2020 I did see Colorado's face and I really enjoyed the fact that when he was kind of losing it and he was reverting to the voice of his father he was 100% doing Donald Trump.

[18:14](https://youtu.be/DUnJBm0JIpM?t=18m14s)

That's pretty funny talk about Lincoln and his generals oh boy poor Lincoln. He got it's just a bad. He got a hit dealt a bad hand a lot of the cream of the la. The cream of the officer corps were we're southerners that did not mean Lee necessarily lead us to overrated I mean. He looked good compared to the Oaks that he was fighting against but Lincoln gets credit for learning on the job and and giving guys promotions who deserved it. I cannot spare this man he fights he sad about grants. Lincoln didn't have very massive generals. In fact the handsomer ones were generally the least competent that little that little pop and shea that little de Polian himself george. Mcclellan god don't get me started. There is no worse record I think among American military leaders outside of like Benedict Arnold than George McClellan.

How bad is it - completely botched the job the whole time undermining the president and then actually run against him on a balls on that guy. Grant was not as drunk as his reputation might make you believe that is largely propaganda thanks to the Dunning school. Those swine who had there's a reason that you that grant is remembered for being a drunk and for being corrupt and that's because of the Dunning school and the need to slander anyone associated with reconstruction and he was one of the most effective prosecutors of reconstruction. We had so he so his presidency is reduced to him being drunk and being corrupt.

The corruption is funny because yes of course there was tons of corruption great. He was the political knife and he depended on advisors and friends who had their own agendas common among the disgusting cynical pro corporate. Republicans who took over after Lincoln was killed but he was that personally corrupt and more importantly the corruption during his camp during his presidency was par for the course for Victorian presidents. They were all turn of the century until the Progressive Era. Benjamin Harrison was like cartoonishly corrupt but they remember him as a drunken as his corrupt because it served that narrative the drunk. Stuff was mostly really from when he was stationed in California after the mexican-american war when he was basically traumatized from his combat experience and completely alone and bored and lonely and he just kind of drank and that was where his like reputation for alcoholism was most established. He did not mean it drink nearly as much during the war as his reputation would make anyone assume yeah and that's another thing to remember you about like anti-corruption campaigns is that a lot of the times they become covers for for reactionary neutralization.

Popular involvement in politics like I guarantee everyone in New York wishes they still had Tammany Hall around. Maybe they could get some thing that anybody in the in the country or the world. If there was somebody you could call. Somebody's cousin's cousin had a job somewhere that actually like connected you practically to a level of political leverage got to get rid of that. We replaced it with this bloodless. Transactional technocracy that ends up wouldn't you know it only serving people with the most money and and corporate interests with the deepest pockets you know if George Washington Plunkett honest graft. Baby I mean it wasn't ideal and it had its own reactionary elements to it and there were socialists who always fought against Tammany Hall while I was around but it wasn't destroyed by socialism. It was destroyed by good governance programs propagated by mostly urban middle class people which is how the machines and all the big cities got broken basically do-gooders who did not replace it with like citizen control. They replaced it with with meritocratic influence which ends up being just graft but only from the top cutting off any grassroots connection between governing and resources.

There were no Marxist organizations in the United States of any size. I don't think in the Civil War largely because Marxism really wasn't a thing yet. It was still you know being being created what you had were like organizations that were more or less influenced by Marx personally since he was still alive so you had the International workingmen's association. The first international but you know its influence was relatively weak at that point but you didn't have communist you had you had communists guys who weren't Marxists who because they firstly knew him and like most people who knew him had some sort of conflict with him like August. We'll each my boy my guy. The Prussian commie Marx sent on behalf of the International workingmen's association.

A letter to congratulate Lincoln on his re-election in 1864. They didn't correspond. He gave he sent a letter back and thanks but it wasn't like they were correspondents like dear. Carl. You know not just like we just won the Battle of Gettysburg. I'm so excited you know wasn't like that all right. I'll read the letter though let me read the letter and you know it was signed by a bunch of people. He's just one of them sir. We congratulate the American people upon your re-election by a large majority. If resistance to the slave power was the reserved watchword of your first election. The triumphant work right here. Re-election is death to slavery from the commencement of the titanic american strife.

The working men of europe felt instinctively that the star-spangled banner carried their destiny. The destiny of their class. The contest for the territories which opened the diary PO e where was it not to decide whether the virgin soil of immense tracts should be wedded to the labor of the emigrant or prostituted by the of the slave driver when an oligarchy of 300,000 slaveholders dared to inscribe for the first time in the annals of the world slavery on the banner of armed revolt. When on the very spots were hardly a century ago. The idea of one great democratic republic had first sprung up.

Once the first declaration of rights of man was issued and the first impulse given to the european revolution of the 18th century when on those very spots counter-revolution with systematic thoroughness gloried and rescinding the ideas entertained by the time of the formation of the old constitution and maintain slavery to be a beneficent. Institution indeed the old solution of the great problem of the relation of capital to labor and cynically proclaimed property and man the cornerstone of the new edifice. Then the working classes of Europe understood at once even before the fantastic partisanship of the upper classes for the Confederate Gentry had given its dismal warning that the does slaveholders rebellion was to sound the toxin for a general holy crusade of property against labor and that for the men of Labor with their hopes for the future even their past conquest were at stake in that tremendous conflict on the other side of the Atlantic. Everywhere everywhere they bore therefore patiently the hardships imposed upon them by the cotton crisis opposed enthusiastically.

The pro-slavery intervention of their betters and for most parts of Europe contributed their quota of blood to the good cause well. The working man the true. Political powers of the North allowed slavery to defile their own like well before the negro mastered and sold without his concurrence. They boasted if the highest frog ative of the white skinned laborer to sell himself and choose his own master. They were unable to attain the true freedom of labour or to support their European brethren in their struggle for emancipation. But this barrier to progress has been swept off by the red sea of civil war. The worthy men of Europe feel that sure that as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class so the American anti-slavery war will do for the working classes. They consider at an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln.

The single-minded son of the working class to lead his country through the merits matchless struggle for the rescue of an insane race and the reconstruction of a social world signed on behalf of the International workingmen's association. The Central Committee you got a whole bunch of guys in here including the boy himself and they got a response from Charles Francis Adams yes the son of John Quincy Adams who is the ambassador to the court of st. James aka the Great Britain during the Civil War because at that point the International metal Association was headquartered in London. Sir I am directed to inform you that the address of the central council of your association which was duly transmitted through delegation to the President of the United States has been received by him so far as the sentiments expressed by it are personal that are accepted by him with a sincere and anxious desire that he may be able to improve himself not unworthy of the confidence which has been recently extended to him by his fellow citizens and by so many of the friends of humanity and progress throughout the world. The government of the United States has a clear consciousness that its policy neither is nor could be reactionary but at the same time it adheres to the course which is adopted at the beginning of abstaining everywhere from propaganda ISM and unlawful intervention. It strives to do equal and exact justice to all states and well men and it relies upon the benefits. Beneficial results of that effort for support at home and forest and goodwill throughout the world. Nations do not exactly exist for themselves alone but to promote the welfare and happiness of mankind by benevolent intercourse and example. It is in this relation that the United States regard their cause in the present conflict with slavery maintaining insurgents as the cause of human nature and that they derive new encouragement to pervert persevere from the testimony of the working men of Europe that the National attitude is favoured with their enlightened approval and earnest sympathies.

[30:12](https://youtu.be/DUnJBm0JIpM?t=30m12s)

I have the honor to be sir your obedient servant Charles Francis Adams so that was it that's the correspondence like they didn't write letters to each other. But yes this they were not talking out of their ass. It's actually very interesting. The upper classes of Europe were of course instantly and immediately sympathetic to the South because that's where they got their. Locally produce stuff. Nobody was importing it what you needed to be imported was the raw material to make the ship to actually have capital formation so they love that they love so it was so cheap because of the slavery they loved it and so there was a real move in specifically France and Europe.

The big boys and with Russia also to recognize the Confederacy as a legitimate government which would allow them to do something like intervene on their behalf in the Civil War and the Confederates tried very hard to make that happen and they had a lot of sympathy at the upper levels of government. Including the prime ministers I know Louis Napoleon was dying to recognize the Confederacy hell. He sent Maximilian to take over Mexico behind the United States is back which was only possible because the Civil War he didn't want that to end he didn't want the Confederacy to go away in fact if they helped them win. Then they would accept Maximilian's rule in Mexico as a fait accompli and it's like a. Quid pro quo for recognition but a working class the actual people who were suffering the most from the dearth of cotton the people in the mill towns of Manchester Liverpool Birmingham. They were violently the Confederacy and we're basically united in support of the Union and there were huge demonstrations protests all throughout the Civil War in the in Britain specifically to keep those from throwing in with the Confederacy because they recognized that you know this is about capital and labor and if they think they can enslave the blacks what the hell makes you think that it's some future point. They might not find it necessary in that moment to enslave. Whites to which is always was the case and like the more honest could set us southern propagandists and apologist for slavery actually made that point the guy in the book cannibals.

All look I fits you as his name. He wrote a book that basically said that in a qua even in equality in human ability is inherent and it is it doesn't actually have to do with race at all. Like it's. It's it's gradiated through all races and all social classes and it's all based on a natural order and so there always be always gonna be bosses and workers. What's the best relationship between applause and a worker. It is a master/slave relationship because it implies mutual obligation. A wage labor relationship is by its definition more inhumane because the boss does not have any obligation to proceed to the health livelihood and viability of their workers because they can always get new ones and he said that leads to instability. It leads to the democracy falling apart because of populism and demagoguery and attempts to like redistribute because you are creating a situation where people are left to their own devices and so he said to the people who say to the northerners to say you know. Slavery is fine because it's it's it's black. It's just it's on black skin. He said no ideally it would extend to whites too because you have the same problem in the north. It would only be worse if it was if you allowed blacks to not be slaves and made them work for wages. But you have the same problems and with the same solution and most they didn't want to spook there nor their neighbors. So they didn't say that too loudly. He's one of the few who did but it was people understood it and it was one of the things that made wage. Labor is hostile to slavery and it was. It was the out. It was the app the I mean.

It was the fact that the Union was able to fight well enough to prevent Europe from like just throwing the dice because the North the South looks stronger militarily but also as domestic pressure that kept him from siding with the Confederacy because they recognize the class character funnily enough a guy who had sympathy for the Confederacy and kind of said they might have been on the right Bakunin. Something about that that liberal concept in anarchism. I don't know when you have to apply it to real situations. All of a sudden you get spun around sometimes I'm just saying I'm not saying I'm just saying the Macau Macau. Bakunin had good things to say about the Confederacy. I'll see if I can find a quote I'm gonna fire well anyway. He was he did because he saw what he saw it in terms of like coercion you know and then the North was trying to coerce the South into obedience and that that you know and of course it recognizes the reality of that. After the war the south or the north did end up becoming more capitalist but that was inevitable what are the terms of the capitalism. If it's a capitalism where slavery is allowed that's going to be deformed in a way the capitalism where slavery has been ruled out will not be.

I don't know I don't know what the best books on the Civil War. I'm sure I haven't read all the best ones and there's so many because it's such a heavily studied topic because it's I think where a lot of people's Americans anyways if they become historians as they become history fans. They get stuck on the Civil War early so a lot of them stick around. So I definitely have not read the best ones oh. The books on the Civil War would be anything by Jeff Shara. The hack fraud son of Michael Shara whose book whose book The Killer Angels is a Pulitzer Prize winner and a great a great young adult classic that is one of the first books I read about the civil war that really stuck with me and made me want to read more about it and his son basically pulled a Brian Herbert. You know Christopher Tolkien and wrote sequels to his dad's book with the same characters different points to the war but whereas Michael Shara was pretty clearly sympathetic to the Union and you know he saw the human drama and then they created trying to create sympathetic. You know poor trails throughout both sides. But his sympathies with the Union you know there's a big speech. Josh Chamberlain gives to his man about the how about being an army say on the mission of you know setting people free and how that was unique almost in human history and then his son though writes sequels where the good guys are now.

The more sympathetic characters with the more righteous side are the movies I've ever seen just dreadful three hours of absolute and the fact that it's like wildly pro-confederate is not even the worst part about it. It's three hours long. The acting is uniformly terrible terrible in the war. Scenes are hilariously bad because they always end up doing his Sam abusing reenactors right because they already have their own. They know how to Martian formation you just film them but the thing is is. Most reenactors are you know like hobbyists like 45 year old. Americans with like beer guts whereas the average Civil War soldier for either side was like a 19 year old who weighed about 85 pounds and seeing these like just actuaries that like dicks sporting goods managers just shooting each other well like puffing and trying to get up like Mary's Heights at Fredericksburg very humorous and not at all immersive.

[39:29](https://youtu.be/DUnJBm0JIpM?t=39m29s)

I mean that's the thing if there's no corona vaccine. They might want to get that information out there earlier right because you're asking someone asks how black billed are people. Gonna get I mean does it agree that they need to to function and like I said that we're not allowing any alternative to the market. We can only restart the economy by engaging in market transactions. We're not doing enough on the internet to make up the shortfall so we got to get out then that means and if there's no there's no rescue if there's no vaccine coming. Then what is the point of waiting why not get it over with and I know people say overwhelming hospitals and stuff but like the level of locking down you would have to do to prevent. Overwhelming. A hospital is not viable given the restraints of the economic reality we need people out. We need these jobs back we need this in order to keep the lights on keep things moving keep supply chains going and that only happens if you're creating shareholder value that only happens if we get used to it and knowing that there's no help coming will help get people used to it yeah.

I wouldn't be surprised if we're seeing like the the the what will happen is. We're gonna turn first-responders into troops in that there's going to be a there's going to be a campaign with a flag of a certain color. That's gonna stand for nurses and doctors and or you know anyone who works in that medical field. So there's gonna be a flag campaign they're going to be called our troops. They might even get drafted who knows and they're gonna be working in big field. Hospitals in like you know college football stadiums or on tender ships or decks of aircraft carriers big fields of repossessed zoos and they're just gonna pack people in there in tents like they do in Central Park. What's really interesting for me is like if I know it's gonna get bad and we're gonna have a new normal that is gonna be way worse than anybody thought they were gonna experience this quickly and they're not gonna be able to funk handle it. But I really don't think that there's any political valence to their anger about it because I really don't think that there are enough people with a common understanding of this situation that could mobilize effectively along an axis that could provide meaningful leverage.

So what you're gonna have is you're gonna have something like 300 million people expressing this wildly new level of alienation. This wildly new level of material scarcity time that is now devoted entirely to survival or more so the need for their entertainments to be even more immersive and energy and and and intense to make up for it. The the the what kind of like civic what kind of civic myths are we gonna have to create to explain how we're living in the country that we the United States of America as we've always been given to understand it. But this is how we're living that dissonance is gonna have to be reconciled through mental processes that are going to build just cathedrals of because it's unorganized because it's not class-conscious just cathedrals of neurotic mania just like violent ritualistic primal belief systems.

Qi think is just like the first most extreme expression of a phenomenon that's going to take over the minds of huge lots of people and I don't know how that's gonna turn out. I'm saying is that yeah all that psychic energy under energy is gonna have to go somewhere like you're just steam heating people who had like an expectation that what being an American meant in terms of their material security comfort safety sense of worth and a lot of it is tied up in that country and then it just gets flash-fried out of existence. But they still have the same mythology and they don't know why it's happening because there's no coherent understanding of the world that anyone's operating off of there's only the fragments that they can grab piecemeal from an unsustainably explosive torrent of information. I don't know how people reckon with this. I don't know what kind of new cults are gonna form. I mean they wouldn't be in person because that would go against the current of of atomization internet-based but then expressed individually mass violence. I don't know better turn to like 70 style of guerrilla movements not political necessarily but like or weirdly political like who knows the only way to vent. It off would be something like a war but war with China is just so vast and inconceivable.

In many ways half the rare earth metals we use to program the microchips for our rockets and stuff come from leftovers because what happens in the leftovers right 2% of the population just disappears overnight. That's basically what we're doing and it's like the the reason. It's such a trauma in the leftovers. Universe is because nobody knows where they went or why right and will know where they went. They died but we won't know why we won't know why this was allowed to happen. There will be no coherent. Universal even partially regionally hegemonic understanding for what happened and so you will have the same crisis. You will have the same sort of sense of crisis spiritual and material that you saw in that show but just along a different axis not spiritual but around like what where am I what country is. This how did this happen who let this happen who made this happen that's gonna be.

The providing thought that people are not gonna be able to change anything around them. They're not. Gonna know how to and so they're gonna want someone to blame and that question is going to become more and more relevant and more and more powerful to them because it's the only way to flee from the reality of what's in front of them. Because people are staying in now honestly it feels like everyone who's still staying in we're staying in out of some like it's neither a it's either people are either in denial to think that there is a plan or any point that staying in longer will presume pronoun will allow for better results in the long run. I don't think there's any reason to believe that at this point but I think some people still do or at this point. It's just purely a way to still feel like a good person because you have a set of values that attach to seeing a doctor on television tell.

You people are getting sick. You don't want to get them sick that makes you want to do that. But a bunch of other people see that same thing and they see live media telling them lies in order to hurt their president. I mean you say people don't want to get sick but like I'm saying is that it's gonna happen unless you does unless you're gonna stay in like you've decided that this is your new life and you're like. What anyone else does I'm staying in if you do that then okay and I think for a lot of people who are immunocompromised. They're gonna have to do that because it's gonna be too scary to go out. But I think a lot of other people who don't have either the ability or personal Constitution to put up with that. They're going to go out eventually which means they're. Gonna get it eventually and so yeah nobody wants it. But eventually it's gonna be. I can stay in but you're either gonna get driven out by the market. Saying you need rent you need to pay for rent you need to have a job or if you can unless you can stay in because you have the ability to get money well indoors you could cut a commute and they'll let you do it. People you're not gonna have that option and it's gonna become. It's gonna become like a liberal affectation. Basically it like liberals will stay indoors. The the artists bat.

Brat Rommel who has a really wonderful Instagram had an amazing an incredibly prescient like visual essay about a month ago already where we talked about how we're definitely leading to a thing where where this the persistence of kovat is going to create a political caste system of people who go out on purpose as a political act and people who stay in on purpose as a political act is going to read reface reshape the face of America because it means that all liberals are gonna eventually just have to go to the cut to the suburbs to the country to get any any space to avoid being completely cooped up and conservatives are gonna have to move to the city to maintain the viability of close contact with everybody. I mean the way to stop. This is to take control of this political system to take control of this means of production to redirect in to redirect production for use in the old as Upton Sinclair would have said but there's no there's no power you know in the world that's making that happen that's pushing for that and and in the short term. I don't know any way that it's gonna happen. I mean the best hope for it is just the reality of people being forced to risk their lives for minimum wage.

We'll get enough of them to say no and then to organize along their jobs to prevent getting sick. That's our best hope. But the problem is with so many unemployed people who are so desperate. They're leveraged as employees is going to be reduced to. It would have to be like sit-in strikes like 30 where you actually deny the space. You deny the capital and we have we have a militarized police force now in this country that it's just looking for an excuse. I don't know it's not gonna be anybody's theory. That's for sure when it happens if it happens. It's gonna be a brushfire like 1905 or 1917. It's it's it's gonna be people just deciding that they can't take enough because there's no plausible leadership right like what's the plausible leadership for some workers movement against this virus creating a new class system and a new and reducing human life that much further in dignity and just quality.

There's no one there. There's no one who speaks universally enough and it's not. I don't think that's anyone's fault. I mean. This people of mistakes made mistakes all the way along the way the Bernie campaign certainly wasn't perfect. But these social conditions are such that we have lost any working class conveyor belt of ideology. It's just sort of spinning off. I'm sorry I know this is that grill pill but the thing is this is kind of part of my grill pill is like talking. Like this you know like I don't have a grill yet even like this is how I deal with things and I think it's constructive because I get feedback.

You know I think I installed the floating shelf. Yeah was it hard easy I might start doing. I have to buy one. I want to get one small low because I don't have a lot of space back there. So it would have to probably be one of those mini ones. I don't even know if those even work. But I know I can't get a big one that's just not enough space. I think probably charcoals because I don't want to have to deal with getting a refillable tank and all that stuff. I think that's drywall. I think the walls are all drywall an electric grill that's interesting I don't know that seems like it might be too small.

Yeah. I think I think what no one wants to really confront is just how we're gonna have to just like we're going to have to recalibrate our relationship to h expecting to survive a day downward and it's you know people have lived and people live in this world already in much higher levels of that than we have and at the end of the day we'll be because we chose we chose comfort over anything and because our rulers have figured out a way to completely divorce themselves from consequences. I mean you got a guy telling people. At this moment. Hey you want you want to bailout well. People in Hell want ice water. They're writing a bill a standalone bill to bailout lobbyists. There is not a single person of either party who is a regular human voter who likes lobbyists because in their mind. If there is Democrat and Republican they imagine the evil lobbyists. The other ones the bad the bet the lobbying on the wrong side of their issues that they prefer. So they still hate the concept they could be pretty easily rallied to the idea that they don't deserve a bailout but instead it's not even an issue. Because both sides agree well. We certainly have to have lobbyists where are we gonna get jobs. After this where are we gonna get the real money that comes with governing the actual point of any of this. The seven-figure job after we leave office after we get primary by you know the the yodeling kid once he reaches the age of majority a smokeless Korean barbecue that's interesting how does that work without smoke sounds mysterious you know what it's funny.

Somebody else wants to know about the end of history. In the 90s you know that was obviously a joke everyone made fun of Fujiyama for it for saying we've reached the end of history by what she meant. I think the forces of history had stopped moving because we'd found the ideal synthesis of this. The ideal social order in terms of long term stability which is capital democracy and then eventually capital democracy would reach every country every area and we would reach a steady state social order that would basically be peaceful over time essentially materialism like dialectical materials and teleological Marxism but ending at capitalism instead of going forward to the next step and of course. In the 90s. There was a sense that that was the case that it was all over but the shouting really and that all the old conflicts were going to be smoothed out by the market. Then 9/11 happened and of course everyone and now everything that's happened. Since never looks like you idiot Fujiyama but honestly looking at things now looking at the way that we're prepared to deal with this looking at looking at the way that we're prepared the biggest powers.

Though the biggest rulers are the most empowering countries all of which have robust democratic traditions of which are ostensibly Republic's with with that are ostensibly designed and exist to sustain the public happiness to sustain public health happiness and safety. The whole reason you write a thing like a constitution. All of them are basically to one degree or another come forward and admitted that there are since there is no alternative to neoliberal capitalism. We are going to have to embrace death on a scale that we thought was not part of the deal. Anymore. We thought the whole point of having this alienated capitalist system with lives moving so fast and so desacralized and so dead and so just devoted to distraction and amusement at the expense of death. But at least we have material comforts at least you know like guys like Steve Pinker could point to a chart and say look extreme poverty is down.

Look. Life expectancy is up look you know consumer spending is up. People's lives are getting better. We're giving that up the one thing that was supposed to justify. This continued the continued existence of the system. We're in the process of slowly admitting that we are giving up even that but because we can't give up the capitalism so in a sense who qiyamah was right. But his framing of it was we have created a sustained endless system that will because it is so beneficial over the long run. Lasts forever and people's lives will only get better like Ned Beatty at the end of network. But what we're finding instead is no these systems now thanks to technology most of all and because of the brutal alienating effective you know of capitalism on land geography workplace and culture most importantly and any global trade networks and the displacement of of manufacturing throughout the globe. The way the the arbitrage inge of of government authorities authoritarian systems versus you know capitalist culture stuff.

It's now at a point where it is. It cannot be removed. Maybe I'm not saying it is in that point because things are gonna change. But it's in a situation where it can only now us. It can now just say now we're managing decline the way we were managing ascent we're now managing decline but there is no alternative so history is ending. History is ending but it's ending in heat death. It's ending in the eventual dissolution and squandering of our resources as the center fails to hold and it splitters off into you know techno feudalist min our keys before even those fall apart so yeah people might want to end up people might end up giving Fukien a second look but he was only right in the sense that we might have reached a point where this system cannot be meaningfully and interdicted with not that it's going to lead to some universal peace but rather universal or a harmony of overwhelming and collective. Murder said this let's add with a song. I don't usually play these anymore because they'd only gets DCC I'd. I don't know what the rules are actually I haven't done that on twitch yet so I won't do it. I was gonna play two dogs dead by cloud dead so if you've ever heard that song it's got. A it's got that Herzog quote at the end of it. All right. I'll play one saw and hopefully we'll get a warning instead of it.

There's this idea I know I'm supposed to have an ad blocker on this thing but I don't and half the answer for master class. It's actually amazingly okay yeah but if China takes over it's just another accelerated form of hyper capitalism. If China takes over it's just furthering the development of that system. You really think that going back to communism you think mouths. Gonna come out of the caboose out of his hyper exploitation and and an absolute knowledge of where every person is at any given moment. Oh glands I'm gonna. I'm losing social credit flights. I know I know I mean like hell president. She probably should save us from ourselves from our like death. Drive of consumption but that's just a resting collapse. It's not building something durable because their economy is just as dependent on our wild overconsumption and hyper exploitation of Labor on peripheral regions of the world. There's nothing else that the economy works there's no other fuel for their economy than that and I mean alright say they don't need us anymore to be consumers well. Then they need to be consumers right. Then they build their own consumer economy and then they just turn themselves in to us. They start consuming the way that we did now. I see the thing is China's. Gonna consume the degree to which we stop consuming so if we just like if we if we just took tap off the stave and become you know like a giant agricultural Latta fund yeah. So that's okay. But we can't all be consuming at the same right. Somebody's got to stop to be returned to dogs to be read and dogs to be dead center of a serious crash. Oh I'm gonna talk about 911 tomorrow a harmony of overwhelming and collective murder. Hi guys.
