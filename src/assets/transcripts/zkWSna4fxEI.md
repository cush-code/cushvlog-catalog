Bridges the embankments and cuts they blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts. They never drank water about whiskey by pints and the shantytowns rang with their songs and their fights. Navigator navigator rise up and be strong. The morning is here and there's work to be done take your pick. A few tons of this earthly delight yes we'll shift a few tons of this earthly delight and mark on this land. We'll see no scene ends still away for commerce reverse fortunes were made landslide and rock class. I got buried so deep then now deep in oh. Definitely not like the peaceful. They sleep hi everybody. I'm back outside it rain. It snowed like crazy the other day and now we've got some serious accumulation. Around here see those see that guys yeah yep. We got we got some real. We got some real snowfall here. I'll see that in the in the door there nice gotta say very surprised. At it kind of thought. They stopped doing that in new york before march. But it's nice not too cold. It's like 30.

So it's beginning to look a lot like chrisman anywhere you go ron johnson my senator. The guy who defeated my first political hero russ feingold. That was a tough one and then real kick of the dick when he beat him in the rematch which I kind of assumed Johnson was gonna lose but hillary really did a number in 2016 on the democrats well. Obama did a number on the democrats in general. Hillary was just an expediter of it but man that guy is as politicians go he's dumb. I actually my cousin is friends with his son and was at his son's wedding like they were college roommates together and he said that he went to ranjan and he's a friend of the kid and he's a friend of ron. Johnson. He's a good libertarian like all guys of his age and demographic cohort and he said that when he went to visit his house which is a big gaudy mcmansion as you can imagine there was a big flat screen playing fox news in every tv and they were all on that guy is a senator so that's cool so yeah.

I really dislike that guy but what are you going to do what's the bench in them in wisconsin to beat him. What is that what is the weight what way can a democrat win an election. Now at this point how can a democrat win. An election in this country given what they are as a party beyond you know house seats that are all literally written for them to govern in. It's pretty grim and um you know. I tried to talk to my cousin about johnson what a joke his whole small business. Because he's he's one of these he was a guy who he is a beautiful boater. He owns like a construction in this company before he decided to run for con senate and he got the money to start it for his wife. We met in college 

I don't wear shorts when it's outside when it's cold on purpose as a flex. I have done it occasionally. I have i. I will admit that I have done the thing where you wear like a sweatshirt and shorts. I've done that. But I don't. I don't try to try to big dog my cold tolerance. Although it is pretty high. I will admit croods anybody seen the croods too yet what are they what's the take it does. It improve or on any does.

It does it expand the mythos of any in any way. Do we know more about the crudes universe. Do we get any end credit sequences where we find out that they're gonna join like a crude's avengers type situation. I would like to know I've actually never been to the house on the rock which shameful for a wisconsinite. That's one of our number one tourist traps. But I've heard only bad things. I've heard that it is a huge. It's literally just a giant pile of junk. That is there for you to look at like the most denuded type of pure like most photographed barn in america type deal. But I haven't been there. I don't know that's just what I've heard that's why I heard. I have of course been to like wisconsin dells many times and i. I'm. I'm a little annoyed though that. I have never been to talison which I think it would be cool eagle river of course up north. I've been there frequently people keep asking about the jimmy dore aoc thing. I think.

I've made my position pretty clear what difference. This is this is all about affect. It's about there's aoc. She's in office. I can't do anything about that one way or the other. I can't affect her behavior in any way what I can do is have an affect towards her. I can think she's on my side or I can think she's against me. I can boo and hiss at her when I see her on tv or I can clap is she a face or is she a heel and this whole discussion is a meta-narrative where you get to figure out in conversation with your favorite left media figures. Whether you think aoc is a heel or a face and like if you're going to consume political media and invest it with emotion. That's not an insignificant question you have to have an answer to that everybody in this drama that we're experiencing this public. This cafe political reality. Everybody has to have a face or heal value for you to have programmed so that you can get your your joy out of having a reaction to when they do things to get mad at them or to get happy. When they do it both ways to root for or against them. That is the narrative that you're engaging in and you have to know who is the clawed applaud and who are the people to poo and hiss and this is how we figure that out in the biden era without trump being there. The question now is much more. is going to be much more pronounced who in the people now governing are to be booed and hissed and who is to be cheered. That's it. I don't really. I mean. I can't. I don't watch wrestling. I mean. I don't want to sound. you know I that sounds very pretentious and and and above it. All like oh you you peasants dealing with this. It's just for me.

I can't. I can't get enough emotional investment in it because all I can keep thinking is if aoc did do a first of all if you decide as a person. If we decide. There's no way to decide worst of all whether she should do it. We all decide all right aoc yeah. She should push for a medicare for a vote okay. What now you called her call her office. You email her you text. Her you you tweet at her you dm her okay. That's gonna happen. I mean do you think that's gonna have an effect and the argument. I think is well. It might not affect her but it will build organizational capacity.

No it's more posting pressure works when it is coordinated. Nothing can be coordinated by this media and I don't blame anybody for including myself for participating in that because it was the only option that seemed available to the atomized american subject trying to figure out how to rebuild a political identity. It was the only option so we took it and it took us as far as it could go. But it's not. It's the horse is dead. The horse dropped dead halfway into town and you got to walk the rest of the way carrying the little girl got bit by the snake like the end of true grit. But also if you say no no that she shouldn't do that what does that mean and there's the if you if she does do it all right. Here's the people who voted for medicare for all here's the people voted against it. I guess the question is like you as a per as a voter can say ah. I will not support them anymore like you'll flush people. But we know and the thing more importantly is those votes don't mean anything how many people campaigned on medicare for all in 20 20 20 to try to steal birdie's left wing credentials including the vice president-elect. They can say anything and in a context where a vote is dead in the water. They can vote anyway and more importantly even if that did give you something to do the thing to do disappears into the wind with every other media based political organizational tactic. They can't work we know it can't work.

Everything else is secondary. I don't care about any of the matter you're just and if you decide aoc is a is a is not a heel. She's a face well good. Now you've got jimmy dore. He could be your heel. You got somebody to boo out of it. You've got somebody to invest you. You know the sides so that you can you can cheer on the people that you want and boo and hiss the people you don't like. I don't care about it. There's no left there is no there is nothing to ris there's no us to make decisions like this. But the main thing it is like the real like i. I'm not saying that this is what people have in mind. But this is why they think they're arguing but the material under reality of all. This is that the biden era is going to be a new landscape and it's going to create audiences for left commentary and this moment as the administration shapes into being is when sides are called when audiences and and creators align themselves and this is what's happening. It's the sorting mechanism. These controversies in addition to being the balls of string. We can bat around function as sorting mechanisms for who is in whose audience who's in whose demo so that's that on that I'm done talking about it and of course that means that that to me that that's why my whole job now is has thrown me into sort of a constant anxiety cycle because I'm more and more convinced every day that this that this illusory political reality that we invest our emotions in is a fundamental hindrance to our ability to recognize the the conditions around us and to act from them.

But I also depend on this you know for for all of a lot of the good things in my life. So how do I square that circle and that's the question I have to ask myself every day and the chat the the answer. the answer. I think it has to come every day too you know. I have to answer that question for myself by what I do every day nothing matters see. That's the other problem is. I don't want to say that. I don't want to get that message across everything matters. But the things that we have charged with political meaning don't but we can charge other things with political meaning things closer to us things that we can engage with more concretely and more satisfactorily and less self-defeatingly. But they cannot be prescribed from a abstract point that is another circle that I have to square every day.

The grill is actually covered somebody's asking about the grill. The grill is where is it there. It is look at that puppy look at how much snow is on that baby love it. The weather outside is delightful. I say really does remind me a home yeah. I'm going to get old man about it right now going to get prustian and and crotchety but growing up in wisconsin specifically coastal wisconsin next to the great lake next to lake michigan which had always a lake effect which meant that even in a state that was already very very snow covered during the winter.

The lake counties would get even more yes. It's coastal. If you want like really wax you know like 19th century like crank historiography geographic destiny style on america. It's kind of interesting that the places that vote democratic are essentially all the places on water but anyway so coastal wisconsin. They get more snow even than inland and so the winter when I was growing up was My memories are of huge snow banks and king of the hill and my jeans getting wet going into playing at recess and wearing moon boots and kindergarten and mittens pinned to jackets. It's a it's a it's a very vivid mindscape of like impressionable time in my life so yeah. I'm actually kind of like being chilling out here and seeing the big piles saw snowman today awesome yeah. A lot of it has to do with population density. Obviously. People live near water for a million reasons and the more people there are in the america.

It just requires you to break down a lot of the more. reactionary social responses that really can only only maintain themselves in relatively stable population population densities and low power. I should say low population densities cosmopolitanism. They call it that's why turkey is very interesting as like a middle eastern united states. I know people israel isn't the american isn't the america of the middle east. It is just america turkey is the america of the middle east and they got a big broad middle swath of sullen religiously fanatic or religiously devout. islamist sort of conservatives where where like devotion to is to sunni. Islam is also correlated to neoliberal economic somehow and then on the coast. You've got the the cosmopolitan types who who who still cling to kamal out of turks secularism and are more you know left in.

General and america is very similar and if anyone ever wants proof of the of the argument that turkey is the united states of the middle east. A couple years ago. There was some dumb kerfuffle about an american minister who got detained in turkey because they thought he was connected to the goulan network and trump did like retaliatory like sanctions on the lira and it's and it just the lira had a crisis it like dropped hugely dropped in value very quickly and in response there was a nationwide turkish campaign to have people film themselves destroying american products and one. I remember distinctly was a guy yelling into the screen cutting a promo against america with a hammer in his hand and then getting down on a driveway and smashing a line of iphones and I just remember thinking yes that is better. There. We are there we are flynn did try to black bag mulan and that's very funny.

Milwaukee does not have a nice flag. Milwaukee has a terrible flag. We're talking flags a couple weeks ago. The milwaukee flag is embarrassing some clip art ass and then wisconsin itself has a load. A bottom tier bottom five flag somebody showed me that there's like a vexology society that ranks the american flags the amer the flags of the americas rather like all the states and provinces of the united states and canada. I don't know if mexico but definitely those two and number one was new mexico which correct and wisconsin was in the bottom. Five also accurate yeah. Wisconsin's flags has the words 14 1848 on it not 1488. Although you could do that if you wanted to that'd be a clever bit of culture jamming because that's when it was founded. But that's just dumb why are you doing that why are you doing that why would you do that. Arizona's is also good. I would say that arizona new mexico the best flags both of them. That's one and two for me in the united states and that's kind of amazing that they were the last two continental states brought into the union. They like it had taken that long for like modern ideas of aesthetics to to carry on because the earlier flags are from states that were brought into the union. In the middle of the 19th century. The florida a very florid era you know florida pros over um over furnished rooms and overly intricate flags.

Here's a miner and here's a farmer and here's a sailboat and here's some lead bricks and here's a bushel of wheat. Literal overly literally don't have to describe so much dude leave a little bit to the imagination. I gotta say. I think that there is a sign that maybe if we haven't gotten better at some arguments in america. Maybe we just have so many more pressing idiocies that we can't remember the old stuff. But the fact that michigan's that mississippi's new no non-confederate flag says in god. We trust having grown up in the 90s. I swear to god that would have been a bigger deal if that had happened then putting god on a state flag because that's the kind of and like sure like conservatives and people still talk about that stuff. But there was a while for well that was a thing that that liberals love to bat around you know this idea of really enforcing a separation of church and state. It was during that period especially after bush became president when everyone on the liberal left was terrified of some theocracy being imposed and there was this this like militant secularism and then now nobody cares about. Nobody gives a city hall front yard and it's like this is dude that was made in 2019 or something like that what the man yeah there is no more reddit religion than church of satan which is just libertarianism with capes. Anton zander levy was explicit. About this. He basically just took randy and objectivism and added ritual that's it. Neither of those things are appealing like ritual is appealing if it if it speaks to community and it speaks to connectivity. This is literally ritualizing the psychosis of libertarianism.

No thank you sir baphomet was This is funny that like in this yeah alpha met is a corruption of the the name m ammad and it was I think it was when the knights templar were suppressed by king philip I believe of france and they were all tortured into confessing to witchcraft so that the king could repudiate the debt. He owed to the templars and seize all of their money and property the one. They they confessed to worshipping baphomet and that was probably just that was just probably m ammad you know because these guys remember this was a crusading order and the bad guys were not the bad guy was not the devil. At that point. The bad guy was the m ammadian the saracen and oh we got oh. There's another thing a very distinct childhood memory is talking around giant plumes of smoke. This is great.

I can I can chew my own chew now and you can't even tell other than the when I you know leaned out. So like this thing that these worship isn't even like it's all just. It is a reddit religion whoever said that was correct it is reddit religion. It is an attempt to reverse engineer meaning out of the arid spiritual desert that you find yourself after you've committed yourself to the rationalist perspective. That is the that was the default like world view of the internet at its beginning because it was begun by white dudes because it was begun by the people who pioneered and perfected that that de-sacralization effort that that profaning of life profaning of the world and that's the final outcome of it. That's the final expression of that drive and at the end of it you find yourself alone in every sense. What do you do you got to find your way back but you've cut the cord. You can't find the the church of satan. It's like let's get some ritual. Let's get some let's get some magic and put it in the world in the form of a bunch of gross california people rubbing each other while wearing capes. Now you know that's not talking about like crowley and you know the esoteric tradition of magic which is is not doing that but church of satan is just like get out of here.

Freemasons are a similar deal certainly but that's like at a higher level social strata where like social bonds remain intact longer because you're perpetuating a class project. At least in the you know at the elite level of masonry. But I think for most guys. It's just. It's like the kiwanis club and then even at the top levels. It's just like a kiwanis cub for the rich and powerful at which point once again. Conspiracy becomes an obsolete concept because you're just describing capitalism and how it functions in social terms like we know we know in other countries how these things work like house house. How social orders are used to identify potential wielders of power at a young age or a relatively young age and allow for them to seek connections to other powerful people and create networks of trust and a mutual.

 understanding of the world that can allow for you know different currents and of power to develop in south africa. After the british left after world war ii and the nationalist party which had been like a the um which had been the like dutch nat. Essentially the boar nationalist party that had resisted british rule before the war. was opposed to the the like the the liberal party which was like the dominant sort of collaborationist party with the british and then after the war the nationalist party became the dominant party because they were essentially the the party of national liberation like the congress party in india or the anc later and it meant that you had this rule like the national rule within in south. Africa was by this this middle this tier of professional members of the dutch reform church. Basically these these these afrikaners because remember there are tons of brits. There are tons of english descended people in south africa. There are also a bunch of indians of all k of all classes in south. Africa and jews shout out to the friedland family. But the the party of post-war rule was the nationalist afrikaner party and how it ruled was in public through. You know its offices the prime minister and and the parliament and and a formal democracy that included white voters 

But in practice it was a cabal within the greater. bore ruling class of like high level industrialists and high-level professionals both political and bureaucratic and academic who mingled socially and through those social relationships established positions of power and in south africa. The real recruiters of people into a power structure was more than the votes in parliament. was the membership of an organization called the afrikaner brother which is dutch south which is afrikaner for the afrikaner brotherhood and it was like a masonic society and and people who joined it early and showed promise moved through the ranks. that's where heinrich reward who was like the post-war sort of mastermind of apartheid that's where he came up and they ran the whole thing a whole show behind the scenes but like it wasn't really behind the scenes. You know what I mean and it's. I think it's very similar with us with all these like seemingly these. These organizations like the bilderbergers and the trilateral and and the masons and kids together. In fact. I wouldn't be surprised if they do but essentially the same way that the shriners get together and get shit-faced and used to get shit-faced and watch like stag movies on a bed sheet.

You know same deal blowing off steam making social connections learning who you vibe with. But all they're really doing is giving a chance for the meritocracy as it exists to work its way through to work people through the highest levels of power virtue signal. Some more what virtues should I signal who would like to see who has a virtu let's do my cameo who has a virtue they would like to see me signal. I'll signal it for you signal piety hmm. This is tough doing it. Self-consciously is difficult. You have to really have it built into your your. your online identity to just be able to instinctively virtue signal. I guess it could just be like I i pray every day is it is that what it is just like saying that you do it. I don't know. I don't.

I don't really know how you do it. Somebody keeps asking about the silmarillion I am not the talking guy dude. I'm much more george rr martin give me the horny. the horny middle of fake middle ages not the one not the not. The ins not the whole cell in cell one where nobody's. I read. I read I read the hobbit in sixth grade because it was a sign. I watched the lord of the rings movies and the first two hobbit movies because that's when I saw that was when. I would see basically every big movie in theaters and that's it. That's not my jam. We will not get the winds of winter that's fine though honestly the best thing that ben and off and weiss ever did for george. Rr. Martin is take the pressure off because I got to believe that people don't bug him as much about the books now that we kind of how are you ever going to be even if it came out tomorrow and it was and it was actually it wrapped the whole thing up. would it really feel. It would it hit the same as it would have before you know what I mean that whole the whole incident with how the show ended and honestly any ending. I think would have taken the wind out of the sales to some extent even if it nailed it. Maybe especially if it nailed it either way like the show in our minds they got intertwined at a certain point and now it has ended like anything. We're gonna read in the book is just gonna feel like a shadow world. It's gonna feel like some some path not taken and like dimly perceived. Real ending will be the one that we saw so that's too bad. I'm I'm gonna watch the prequel show probably because I do like the lore and and you know if you get annoyed with benioff and weiss. At least all this stuff has been written so you don't have to worry going in about them having to improvise but I do What's it gonna be about. I think it's about the targaryen invasion. I don't know like if you were gonna do a prequel wouldn't.

It seems like that's not the most interesting angle you take like obviously. The dance of dragons seems to be to be the obvious one why wouldn't you why wouldn't you do that one. That's like. It's got a built-in narrative. It's got drama. It's got it. It's why would you do the dance dragons but if you're not gonna do the dance of dragons so you're just gonna do like aegon's conquest which is narratively has none of the back and forth action of of the dance of dragons but then again. I don't. I don't know what this I think it's about aegon's conquest but but either way. I wouldn't be interested in that honestly give me something somewhere other than westeros. I originally thought they were going to do something about the age of heroes but I guess not or are they doing that also I don't know. I should oh we'll see I might. I might be over it. By the time any of this stuff airs and I might have evolved beyond the need to keep up with this. Who do the horsey people represent the dothraki or the mongols or like. I mean essentially all step nomadic warlords. I don't have thoughts on the silmarillion leave me alone.

It's getting cold out here. That's like fingers getting chilly. But I like it let me make a snowball. Karth isn't cars basically like medieval. Baghdad like bravos is venice but I think karth is like medieval baghdad. There we go little ball. I guess it could be constantinople. Too just feels a little out of the way to be constantly. I thought like maybe volantis is that rome.

I'm making a little snowman. Here. This first this person keeps asking this baffling question that I have to talk to when did. I first realize that power is real and that my and my beliefs don't really have any of it when did. I first realize. I was powerless well. I mean we all just we all realize we're powerless as children and then we spend the rest of our lives trying to delude ourselves into believing that we aren't. I guess when I relearned that I was powerless probably in the hospital bed when I was stricken with a near fatal spinal injury look at this guy.

He's a little snowman. I mean a little snow guy where should we call him what should we call him. I'm taking. I'm taking names grogu. That's not bad grogu's not bad that's kind of funny ah. I'm trying to make his head a little bit bigger crood well. Maybe that'll be his last name. He's gotta have a first name though snow grew that's not bad. I'm going to try to give him a little face actually here apologize to anybody who listens to these on the podcast format because you're not going to be able to see this. So this might not feel like it's worthwhile. But I think it's fun stop that's good yeah. Maybe. I'll call him stop that's funny trying to kind of give him a face. I don't think this really works.

I was trying to use these these filter tips. Kinda looks freaky amber frost that's funny that's good in fact. I'll go with that. This is amber frost right here. It's too bad. We don't use It's too bad. We don't use screenshots for the intro for the covers of the youtube of these like that would be a good one that would be a good one for the for the cover image for this kush vlog. I'm looking at it like a funko pop frosty the soy man yeah that's good with the eyes.

It's like you. Gotta saw a sexy lady ah now my hands are cold who could have predicted that that would happen what the hell packing snow yeah cool. This is awesome having cold hands afterwards. God damn it oh communism is when no funko pops. I don't know if that's true but I sure hope so because if not what are you even fighting for if the world you're fighting for has funko pops. In there you need to reconsider your priorities. Someone keeps asking about the submarine and swear sweater god people people. I am getting trolled in the comments. I keep forgetting that not everyone can be as much a perfect avatar of good faith interaction as I am sad sad hey you know it's interesting.

Trump has trumpet been around lately. He's still contesting the election but mostly just through tweets. He hasn't been doing any rallies or anything. He seems. I think he's checked out. I'm guessing is that is that he is coming to terms like he is. This feels obviously this is me just pulling things out of my ass. But you know. We've had four years of this guy. Now I i feel like. I got a vibe for his like personal emotional cycles um. It feels like this is him hitting the end of the kubleros cycle and accepting that he's gonna have to leave. I mean there was that piece that said that he says he's gonna not gonna leave but he's a he's a which means that he will leave the white house on that day to go do something else like a rally and then just not come back. He's not going to allow something happening as humiliating as being carried out by u.s.

Marshals. There's zero percent chance as much as it would be hilariously aesthetically gratifying to see such a thing and as much as liberals have been jacking off the prospect for the past four years. He is too much a coward to do it um somebody's asking how evil is george h.w bush compared to other presidents. I don't think that's a terribly helpful question when you're trying to you know understand how power works or anything. But I do think that they're probably there have to be right because everything has gradation. So there are gradations of evil within the the presidential bestiary. So there are more and less evil. Presidents like. I do think that that's true yes. They're all evil to a minimal threshold but past that threshold there has to be grades because there has to be grades and everything so that means you can talk about it. It's just it's not tied to questions of you know power. It's not. It's not quite. It doesn't tell us anything about you know how power operates because mostly they're operating out of a a not evil but out of what they imagine to be necessity and sure their evil is what makes them see it that way. But it's it's not a it's not generative of action because because most presidents are largely constrained in their actions by the circumstances of their presidency and as such their freedom to allow evil to be the predominant motivator of their actions is constrained also so as soon as you make that assumption and you clear that and say we're not actually talking about anything that matters we're just talking about like idly who's the most evil like who just seems like their brain was the most desolate snake pit. There are more and less ones the least evil ones. I would say the ones whose brains if you entered them would feel like a human brain. Like there would be a mid there would be a similar amount of you know emotional connection to the world that you have lincoln. John quincy adams um maybe jfk because like he wasn't a good guy but and he was very callow but or he might have been a stone psychopath. I don't really know enough about fdr. I think yes yes definitely fdr probably even teddy roosevelt. Even though he was a complete psycho um james garfield for sure jimmy carter definitely honestly. No. I don't think either of them. Maybe eisenhower grant definitely.

But we're all talking about you know. This is slim pickings and the degrees are all relatively low. What about the people who if you went into their head would just find would define snakes would find reptiles would find a cold-blooded detachment and lizard-like hostility to to everything other than themselves. george. H.w bush's top five for sure 100 andrew. Jackson also up there andrew. Johnson also up there donald trump personally wicked but too cowardly to to do the stuff too cowardly and lazy bill clinton 100 percent for our sacko crumbo 100 percent reagan. I honestly don't know if you can use and use these concepts because by the time he even got close to power. He had essentially stopped thinking in a conventional way. So what can you even say about it maybe yeah maybe when he was governor of california. I would say yeah both atoms is how many more presidents will there be. That's a good question. I mean in many ways.

It is absurd that we're having another one after trump and I did say that one thing that I was repulsed by was the idea of us trying to act like it never happened and I have to say that the specifics of biden being president mean that we can't do that as much as you might want to pretend. You can because biden's presidency will be so trump-like in so many ways and the only real difference you're gonna. See is that the media that spent four years trying to hang trump for every transgression against norms and propriety will spend those four years trying to tell you actually. No these are all good and don't worry about them and they're fine and it's not bad and it's actually 

It's actually racist for you to think that this is a gibbering old senile maniac profaning all of these hallowed institutions that he's supposedly to be charged with shepherding not gonna be. Out of here the people who say it's holly are captured by the fundamental delusion that there is something more authentically grounded in like right-wing spectacle of politics than there is on amongst the democrats because because if you're on the left and you see id paul being weaponized by the democrats and turning people into just these these people who are allergic to class politics you look to the lot right and you think well because they don't have these mechanisms of of coercion. Then that means that a populist message will like find some sort of real kindling at the grassroots that is impossible on the left. But they have their own set of dumb culture war id paul. That decapitates their br the brain stem of most of their voters and makes it impossible for you to appeal to them any more than you can democratic voters and so if josh.

Hawley does make a pitch to be the intellectually consistent national populist heron volk inheritor of pure ideological trumpism. He will get smashed and destroyed by either trump himself if he just decides to deal with losing by spending four years running to get it back and then winning to make it up for it and then hope he can die somewhere along the way so he can just stop or donald trump jr or some. Dnc cynically presses the brain stem on the democratic voters. Everybody says is going to be josh hawley that because they think well if I was a republican voter.

I would vote for holly. You're not though by the way I found out that apparently noah holly has a twin brother. I believe who is a show runner for. I like a network procedural. It's literally like donald kaufman and and charlie from adaptation. It's astounding like you've got the sellout brother who's just making shows about like horny cops and then you've got the pretentious brother who thinks he's doing elevated cuisine not flipping burgers and apparently they hate each other that's hilarious to me and it makes the third season twin plot with ewan. Mcgregor really make sense because twins that's not really something from the cohens that was something from holly nobody likes.

Dan crenshaw dan crenshaw is trying to take a the specific liberal democratic cultural soy discord spectacle like the the language of marvel universe and use it to be and use it to appeal to republicans and there is like some sort of base to that. I think. I and that's just well. This is a language that everybody is absorbing even if they are re republicans. They watch these movies even if they think hollywood is filled with pedophiles who hate the president. They still watch them because they're what's on so why not use that familiar language to your benefit that cultural costume going on saturday night live and stuff. But that might get you some tv appearances and it might get you trending once in a while on twitter. But it's not going to let you raise to the ranks of the political public establishment because the people who make decisions on who to send to the halls of power. Not your little bitch-ass gerrymandered signature district where they just took all the white people around houston and put them into a little comma for you like having to vote run statewide in in a big ass state like texas or run for a national office. Those people are not kids stewing in marvel. Soy banter. Those are old legs as far as I can see and only one eye but again don't know what can happen. That's just how it feels dan crude shaw. Now there we go he might win something if he changed his name to crude shaw and he ran in like a in a bear skin like he redressed like a caveman and he only spoke in grunts and he took his fake eyeball out and didn't wear the eye patch and just had the hole because that's how a caveman would be island with no I crude shaw that's the reboot he needs to become a president. It would be funny if he ended up marrying marrying aoc.

It's like a dynastic carville matlin marriage oh. I wanted to say this before. I stopped because I'm going to leave soon but I wanted to mention this today and I know. I just talked about it yesterday. But I feel like. I conjured something into being Today a bungler came out with his list of the shows and movies he liked watching in 2020 and I gotta say I felt like a baby cyclo on a diet of straight karbango cause. It was just my it was everything I've been. Saying about this guy laid out. There he like He likes this this perfect. He is a perfect amalgam of all these middle class middlebrow. professional class taste and people say oh he just had an intern write that I disagree that's true of most politicians like a lot of these lizards just sit in the room and stare at a wall when they're or are like doing ritual sacrifice. Like that's one thing that veep got very right is that most of these people are totally disengaged from popular culture because they're not they don't halls of power and their own megalomania to watch tv so they don't know they don't watch. Tv. They don't watch sports but I believe obama does when you look at what he has done since he's been president. You look the way he's lived his whole life. I 100 believe he watches this because that's why he's doing it. That's why he ran for president in the first place and was president so that he could watch himself be president and then tell that story again and again to just to live as a narrative and so he has to watch things like the way that trump watches trump. Like that's the other thing politician Like the president he doesn't watch fake cable news. People who are actually you know in in in connection to real power don't watch cable news.

I mean they might have it on in their rooms to like watch it. If they're on it. They make sure everybody sees it and like they use it as like a as a touchstone to see like oh. What's the what's today's scoop. But they're not sitting there watching it the way that you would have to to to pile up the hours that trump does but trump sits and watches it. Obama watches those shows. Obama watches those shows and he watches those movies and when he came out today with those and people were saying they were either saying he didn't really see these or they were saying he didn't get it. How could he have liked this how could he have watched the boys doesn't. He understand that he is the vaught corporation in that movie or whatever doesn't he understand that he's homelander how could he have watched bukuru the movie about rich white americans going to hunt poor brazilians for sport. And it's all about income. Inequality is a and a global like racial apartheid and it's like a maoist third world text how could he have watched that and they think well. He got. He got the wrong he didn't get the right message from it. He didn't get it he his brain wouldn't receive it. I my my belief and I've said it before. I'll say it again is that he gets it. He gets everything that you get out of this show he got everything out of parasite that you got out of it. You got everything out of bukaru that you got on everybody. You got everything out of the boys and everything out of the good lord bird which he put on the list and that oh that got me yeah baby yeah good lord bird. Obama watching this show that's supposed to be about john brown and loving it. But I don't understand how how could he he must not understand it. No he gets it. He gets it.

It doesn't matter because you think to yourself well. I watch this stuff and it gives me these beliefs if obama watches this stuff and it doesn't he if he had those beliefs he would act out of them. But he is where he is because he has made certain mental assumptions about the way the world works that have essentially allowed him to take any cultural critique and rationalize it as he is absorbing it which is in microcosm. The way that all cultural products under capitalism are recuperated. We get this thunder bolt of of like rel political revelation from these works of art that have these like creed core against a world that is unjust and we see the injustice around us but then we have to deal with reality because to reject the order as such is to put ourselves at risk and we don't we fear the risk and so we figure out a reason that we can't act now and for most of us there's nothing immoral about that because we don't really have any power anyway what we do one way or the other is minimally impactful and so we really do have a right to ourselves to at a certain point take our own self-interest first now. The thing that makes guys like obama guys like obama that narcissistic megalomania makes it so that they are able to at every moment abstract and rationalize away from the reality of the horror of like. What amer what the world is that a movie like bukuru symbolizes or the need for like revolutionary resistance to to oppression as such and a refusal to to accommodate oneself that john brown represented in the good lord bird and feel it because you're supposed to but then well. I'm only one president. I'm only one ex-president and that implications of that are uncomfortable because it might. It means then that the fact that we consume the good art. The good media does not confer upon us inherent virtues. I don't think it makes you bad but it doesn't necessarily compose part of your virtues and that is destabilizing because of how much we have built this jenga tower of self-conception out of media consumption by the way. I'm sure it's not pronounced bukuru. But I don't know. It's. It's it's brazilian. It's portuguese language name for town bukaru. I don't know bakurao bakarao that's not even close good lord.

But he got the point he watched bukaru and said yep global north slaving and exploiting global sound. yep race racial apartheid regimes inscribed at the barrel of god But it's more complicated than that of course you know there's. there are cultural pathologies at work that undermine the ability of communities to resist that oppression but compromises have to be. I mean. It's just and the thing is that the thing his brain is doing is all of our brains are doing it every moment to allow us to do things like you know buy a phone that has literal slave labor in it every this thing. Here. These things have coltan in it that was pulled out of the ground at gunpoint like huge segments of our ability to live are are are necessitated by slave labor because you couldn't pay someone enough to do the stuff that needs to be done at least because we've decided not to invest our capital in saving that labor because it's cheaper to just compel it. But the thing is we don't have a lot of power over that individually and so we have to make accommodations or else what you're going to fly over to the drc and try to save like break people out of a coltan mine with a shot you would not work. It would it would help no one and so we may we all make these compromises the higher up you go in power the mind.

It's it's more and more compromised by essentially one's evil one's ability to disconnect from everyone else around them and disconnect from the world and seek decide to put themselves at the seat of all meaning. But the thought process is the same because nobody thinks of themselves as evil so that means you just got to watch the stuff and enjoy it. The same way you can listen to politics podcasts and pay attention to politics. You can watch your streaming shows and watch movies. I know I do but doing those things have the same they have the same moral weight as any other consumer action which is to say they're. They they're either neutral or just bad by virtue of the fact that they're contributory to a system that is bad. But they're also necessary to the maintenance of like economic function so that so maybe at the end of the day it's they're all neutral. They're neutral. Let's say that and so anything else you get from them has to come from their aesthetic elements which are not nothing. Art means something art is always going to mean something but it doesn't mean what we have decided. It means any more than politics does because they're the same thing you can't expect anything from anybody in political power. Political power responds to pressure that's it well our political. I'm sorry political power is manifested in pressure manifested in the ability to to compel and right now. The reason things are so terrible the reason that we're watching this monstrous response to covet allowing this. This any chance of even minor economic aid to people who are on the verge of starvation being parried down to nothing and some disgusting know-nothing wisconsin cheesehead. Chocolate sundae is because there is no there is no fear these people have they fear nothing from us. They fear no consequence from us not even. I mean obviously not personally but also not even professionally or for their careers because we are not a public that can express anything other than the disaggregated individual confused selfish selfless. Irrational jabbering imp political identity of 100 million people or whoever on any vote and as long as it's that their job is just essentially to read demographic waves and figure out where to pitch messages to to maintain a structure that is essentially self-perpetuating. We have to put we have to put branches in the spokes ourselves by creating a but creating a will out of this disaggregation and then imposing it and saying you do this or you suffer consequences all right. It's cold as out. Here.

I'm gonna go soon So I think this might be my la. I might do another one tomorrow. We'll see But I think it will be the last one either today or tomorrow will be the last one for like about a week so that for the christmas week I will be otherwise occupied and I don't want to have to worry about you know keeping up a schedule So we'll be back the week after and so wednesday. The 30th will probably not be the first time back but but it will be i. I can at least say that there will be a stream then and that we'll talk about the last half of the first part of richard white's the republic for which it stands chapters four through eight and we'll talk about that. I'm reading chapter four right now the one about home and it's very interesting he frames everything. He frames like the domestic ideal that I've been talking about that like the yeoman self-sufficiency as the abstract concept of a home and he charts the way that it sort of constellates throughout political rhetoric and culture. At the time. It's pretty good all right talk to you guys soon either tomorrow or in like a week bye.
