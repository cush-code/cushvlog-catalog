 oh hey guys. I'm on. I had to take a bit of a break so I did a bunch of really abstract stuff last couple times and I want to get back to that because I think there's more to develop but I kind of don't want to push it too hard because I've been thinking this weekend and and I think. I want to get a little bit more comfortable about moving forward without getting too wacky and too abstract at least that's how. I'm going to try to plan to go so today. Instead. I feel like this is gonna be a low-key chill stream. This is gonna be hang stream unless something pops off and that could happen but I'm gonna start chill. This is the lazy monday lazy monday.

I'd like to start by just addressing a weird thing. I've seen people say in the chat here and elsewhere that I am on some sort of regime of uppers like I'm popping pills. people are naming stuff that I actually don't even know what it is like monotophill. I've never heard of that. I I don't do uppers as a recovering hypochondriac. They're very bad for someone like me because I would just be waiting for my heart to explode anyway but anyway. I just want to. If anyone's worried about me. I just want to make sure that there's nothing to worry about. I'm not on uppers. Sometimes. I just get a little excited. I don't have any new tropics though now I would love maybe. I should get some gorilla mind and try to get a get. A really. intense stack no more nootropics how about some nut tropics tacoma wept folks tacoma wept.

It still blows my mind that there are people who tell me like I like both of you guys and you should debate and it's like what is what is it that you like. I mean. I get it. You know people like things for different reasons. But we seem to be sort that him and me and that guy seem to be sort of differently on a different wavelength to the point where it seems hard to imagine that a conversation would be very fruitful. I mean the guy thinks that like there's such a thing as pushing the democrats left at this point at this late date. How do you talk to somebody who's that removed from reality. It's like talking to that lady who wrote the indefensive looting book. That people are posting clips from that made. My eyes bleed but it is funny. I gotta say there's some real there's some real characters out there.

I'll say that I don't know I i I wonder if I would want to debate anyone because I'm I used to. I'll admit this like and I think a lot of people who who really hold the never debate anybody standard are still gripped by this. A big reason people are hostile to debate is because they don't know why they believe their beliefs and so they're afraid of losing. I mean they won't put it that way that's why they invent all that stuff about not validating point of views that shouldn't be debated in the first place. It's a lack of confidence in their ability to engage with the argument effectively for a third party because obviously you're not going to ever change anyone's mind in a debate. It's always for the benefit of an audience. It's always for a benefit of a presumably unaffiliated audience and that I can imagine that in certain circumstances the debate could be useful along those lines and I think people don't they they reject that because they assume no everyone on every side everyone who could possibly hear any argument is by definition on one side or another and if they aren't admitting it.

They're lying about it so. I think you know there could be uses for a debate but I don't know and now. I feel much more confident in myself and in my ability to explicit like more abstract ideas that before I maybe kind of like had an inkling of but I couldn't really grasp because I hadn't dug down. I hadn't really pulled up the earth of my of my priors and I feel like I mean obviously. I'll never be done doing that there will always be blind spots that's the definition that's defining that is the the the absence the lack of understanding in the universe that you have is is is the sum total of your of your personal existence because the rest of it is everything and if you had all of it you'd be everything the thing that makes you less than that. The things that make you perceive yourself as separate from that which you are part of is ignorance oh and yeah.

The zuzia peterson debate is a perfect example of a debate that was pretty clearly a good idea because I mean obviously other things happened in his life. But I think I think peterson sort of lost a little credibility maybe even not like with a broad audience but even maybe with himself after that because he was just so unable to to grapple with the stuff that zizik was talking about because he was he just zizek has has grounded his beliefs so much more deeply that he could just engage him sometimes talking about this stuff. On here. I kind of wonder if my my project is with the vlogs and zizik and of course the winner in that would be would be gg. But you know you would have to thread some peterson into it anyway. I mean the grill pill. As people have pointed out is a lot like clean your room but you know in that it it is a fixation on like how practical engagement with the world around you can lead towards introspection and and growth and that you know the way we think is largely shaped by symbolic orders. but beyond that it's just a bunch of you know barely thought out reactionary gibberish. Clean your trash can there you go that'd be perfect damn. That's not bad train your clean your trash can I guess. It'd be empty your trash can but that wouldn't be as symmetrical.

I don't know that's good but yeah. I would debate somebody but it would depend on who it would have to be somebody who had like a very interesting conflict with but somebody who says you're a class reductionist who who is hurting hurting minorities and poor people by not supporting joe biden for president as a podcaster. I'm sorry. But that's not the amount of digging you would have to do to even get to anything like a stable foundation to build from would take too long. This guy is he's shadow boxing. The thing is. I wouldn't debate class reductionists because who who are we even talking about there. I think that's mostly a term of abuse. I've talked about how class perfectionism is just this thing people put out there to try to just undermine the argument with with with a a term of abuse. I mean it's it's it's to pre-determine to pre-condemn the argument especially since from a technical perspective everyone who has a like a genuine. I think a useful analysis of the situation would say of course. It's a class reduction because class is the is the signal friction point within a society. It is the first and fundamental friction point in a society is along class lines and you can disagree with that fine but then calling me. A class reductionist is stupid because you're not in the same thing that I'm in so anything you call me is sort of beside the point. The class reductionist argument is what's supposed to be within the left and assumes that like there's a that there that that is some sort of violation of an orthodoxy. No it's a confirmation of the most basic orthodoxy of any meaningful marxist inflected socialist analysis. The question that people like what they're trying to say there is that well by by recognizing this thing which is obvious and which is to in my mind foundational by doing that you are somehow implying a tactical approach that means that engaging with superstructural alienations like racism and misogyny. is therefore not to be engaged with and ignored and de-prioritized and that the concerns of people with exploitations that emerge from those superstructures should be ignored. Some people might believe that but I s it is a in my opinion for my observations a fraction of the larger group of people that generally get called class reductionist. I think most people who are realistic and who understand that the base superstructure relationship is reinforcing it's not just gender.

It's not just a one-way flow. It is a circulation whereby social friction is turned into superstructure that that dissipates the social friction in one way but creates new sources of alienation that have that then inflect the base again and have and and make it accommodate that and that's what capitalism has been doing over the last 40 years along racial racism. For example has been super structurally accommodating but also in but in ways that then reinforce and change capitalism. That's what recuperation is and that's what capitalism has done with these issues but that doesn't mean that they're not felt and it doesn't mean that they are not that those exploitations because they emerge from capitalism must be addressed at the same time at the same level or else people will be alienated from your attempt to to defeat the thing that is causing all of the horror in the first place because they won't take you seriously because they will reject you and what the what the stupid argument online did is because it created an incentive to build this cudgel to use first by the way by the even thought they were socialists when hillary said breaking up. The banks won't end racism therefore don't even bother but then when the tent got bigger after trump's win. All of a sudden you have people who are saying. I'm the most socialist person in the world and the worst thing about socialism and the war socialists and the ones we need to kick out are the class reductionists. It's like. I'm sorry aren't you just applying the hillary. blood libel within the tent so that you can like get more influence and that's where some people say yeah.

That's that's the infiltration and domination of the pmc and that's my fundamental disagreement with that analysis with like the new class notion that the real class divide now is between this professional class and everyone else because I don't think that that even if it does create channels whereby afford conforming to that status quo gets you advanced like in the media or whatever it's not generated there. It's generated by because it's super structural because it's in the discourse. It's generated by a desire to to be heard and to be taken seriously and to be validated because that's what the internet is for the internet is a validation machine and when we go on twitter to do politics we are going on twitter to be validated and so that turns us into little as I have said like a little ego driven entrepreneurs trying to validate themselves. I sure should know that's why I started going on twitter was to be validated was to have my dumb opinions taken seriously and my dumb jokes laughed at and what that means is that you can't argue anyone out of that position. None of these positions can be argued out of and I think one of the main ways that you can cut down on online political addiction. what I've said is to filter subjects by importance to you. So you don't have to care about anything and then secondly. I would say on top of that add a a an additional filter where you can divide arguments into two types because part of one of the big reasons people get stuck on this hamster ball is because there is this deep brain confusion between two types of arguments.

There are arguments to be had that are had because people disagree on a course of action and have to try to decide between each other how to go forward. That is a model that has tooth that has stakes for the people involved in the argument and because it has stakes it tends to resolve towards a satisfactory resolution because it's like there's two people who who want to who are in a car and they there's they're trying to drive somewhere and they disagree on the best route they have to decide if they want to get to that place and so even though they might be heated and they'll be heated because they want to get there. They will also be focused by that anger towards resolving something at least over time. Of course. Some people are going to fly off the handle and be psychos and but I'm talking about in general people who are are able to control their emotions enough to engage with other people will come to a point where they resolve to do something. Then there's the other type of argument. The type that is basically the only type of argument you see online which is an argument that exists to be had. There is no place to the other side of town that anybody needs to get to it is hypothetically arguing about the best way to get somewhere that nobody involved in the argument has to go and that's twitter. It's people. It's five million people in a car arguing about the best way to get to a place. But they're not in a car and there's no place that argument exists as recreation that exact argument exists as I said to be argued which means you need two sides and they need to keep going against each other to maintain the dynamic.

The illusion of forward progress that satisfies your desire to be entertained and every argument online like what is class reductionism that doesn't exist to do anything what are you going to get out of this especially as I have said because of the way that online demands bad faith and therefore will never allow for anyone to give every anybody any point and will impute bad motives to invalidate reasonable arguments. But the real problem is not just that it's entertaining. It's that the people involved in these arguments because they don't do politics in the real life for the most part or because the politics in the real life are shaped so much by what they what they see online which dominates their emotional landscape. They argue it with the intensity and urgency of someone who is arguing to get to an actual resolution even though the the the tone called for in a in an argument to be had is playful. It's like when your friend that it's like. It's the difference between trying to argue with your friend about like where to get to the hospital when one of you've been shot in the leg or something the best way to get there and your friends arguing at a party about who would be if superman could beat up the terminator or whatever the and arguing is a fun way to have a fun conversation. If it's done in fun and that's the arguments online essentially and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that. People need to have fun but people are arguing these these positions as though they were arguments about how to get to the hospital with a bullet wound.

Obviously superman could not obviously superman would beat up the terminator that I was just kind of pulling names out of my ass how about the terminator versus robocop. There's a good one robocop beat the terminator. I honestly don't know if that's what would happen because you got to feel like the the human gooey. Part of termina of robocop are more vulnerable than the terminator because he could leave all of his tissue and still have his exoskeleton. I mean of course robocop would beat the perimeter because robocop's the good guy. I mean that's the real.

That's why those questions are so fun and stupid and have to be recreational because the real answer to all of them boils down to the good guy would win because they're all just artificial concepts structured to adhere to certain narrative conventions so lighten the up. If you're gonna have fun batting things around remember the stakes they're basically zero because the decision you're just if you really people can and people say this all the time they say you say twitter is in real life but people take that stuff and those ideas and they apply it to the real life and I say yes they do but I would I just think that that what ends up happening more often than not because of how obviously small and disorganized. The left is is not what some people think which is people bring bad ideas from the internet online or offline and then they dominate with those ideas and they scare everybody away. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is that people come from online with these weird intense expectations related to the fantasy worlds. They've constructed there and then they I and then some of them who have the intensity of of purpose and and frankly willing to willingness to be shameless and annoying maybe. They do dominate some sectors of the real like left or whatever but since it's so small. I think the answer for what happens with the rest of people is not that they are alienated by that.

It's that the vast majority of first of all remember most people aren't engaging in this at all. But the ones who are they their engagement with online has created their own structure right and they do bring it offline. But they bring it offline by using the fact that they see all this cringe. Offline and try to apply it to the real world get conflict from that and feedback and then run away and are broken against the rocks of reality and decide to flee back so. You've got one group of people who have like the the perfect combination of brittle internet poisoning and and and remaining like personal. grit. I guess to stick stick out long enough to win battles over things like you know a dsa local election. But then you have much larger groups of people who either can't hack the the the social demands of trying to be a pill in the real world and the ones who use what they see online as an excuse to stay home and then of course.

There's most importantly the fourth group of people who might be online might encounter these ideas but would never think of getting political who don't aren't touched to the level of action aren't stirred to the level of action by any of this favorite roman emperor. I know it's a a popular revisionist pick to pick a really in because he basically single-handedly saved the empire from early death and then was nonetheless killed by his own dumb troops. He's like he's like a sort of underrated dude making a comeback he's fine I guess trajan because everyone forgets him but he he presided over the creation of rome to its fullest physical extent that's pretty cool and he did it with an amazingly terrible bowl. Cut. I mean yeah sure roman nerds remember trajan. I'm just saying in popular culture. He's not very well remembered among the emperors but that's mostly because the most remembered ones are the worst ones.

Someone wants me to ask talk about p2 lodge. I didn't talk about it on the gladio episode but just a quick refreshers. I don't know that much about it sadly there aren't a lot of great english language sources on gladio and I from what I understand not great italian stuff either. But it was a freemasons lodge in rome that was essentially a front for a group of high-level italian political religious military and economic leaders to get together and distribute money to neo-fascist gangs who've been armed by nato in order to do things like launder corsican drug money through the vatican bank and carry out what was called the strategy of tension which was a series of terrorist attacks that were carried out by neo-fascist street gangs allied with the mafia and on the left oh.

 . It's funny because the it was a masonic lodge and it had a number of high levels of the catholic church as clergy or as members even though in the 19th century a papal edict forbid all calf. I think it was just catholic Not. I think it was all catholics actually from becoming freemasons. All like even lay people let alone cardinals and stuff oh so a young silvio. Berlusconi was a member. I don't think don.

Jr is going to become president because he's going to like he's going to make sense as an option. But he's just he doesn't have he doesn't have it. He doesn't have what his dad has and ivanka looked really good at the convention but I'm still not convinced that the republican party wants what she's selling in terms of affect and and whatnot. She just seems a little too. I mean that they're gonna all be q people within four years. You know like q is going to take over the entire republican base that is inevitable and I don't know if ivanka. She has the bloodline you know. But I just don't know if she has the she has the brand to catch them. But I don't know finger shrug emoji. I have no idea yeah everyone's gonna. All republicans are gonna be cue.

It's the only it's the only way forward because because like I said it's the only way to square living in this country and having this image of america in your head that you can't challenge for deeper ideological reasons that you have can't even examine like that's a good example of like how false consciousness works and some people get mad about the idea of false consciousness because they say um they say that it's like condescending. I don't think it is if you remember that everyone has it everyone has false consciousness like. I've said before the work ruling class doesn't rule in their own interests. They rule in the perception of their own interests which they undermine all the time because they don't have all the information and they're always competing with one another. But like you have a level of awareness. You have enough awareness to have to understand that this country is in a crisis and you're horrified and you're alienated from it. But you are not aware. You have not absorbed the necessary information through experience and and exposure to even create a viable way to criticize the country as you perceive it in your head and so you have to find a solution and like cue's the only way q is the only way and the p first people to do it were the most like i.

I talked about how some people are the most sensitive antenna people who are more emotionally compromised and undermined by living under in contemporary conditions than the rest of us for specific reasons having to do with their specific lives and it's gotten bigger as as that condition as the heightening of alienation becomes deeper and as the fear becomes higher of what come next and that's why children are the focus of it and how children are the focus of all right-wing populist paranoia because there's a sense that the future that that the present is. That america at the moment is awful and that life for you is miserable. But so it's too late so what you get to be mad. About is what the lizard people and the triple parentheses people are going to steal from your children from the future because you don't see the possibility of a future and certainly that's true of people on the left. Nobody can see it and people across the center. No one can imagine a future but that that hits different depending on your ideological priors and for conservatives. It manifests as a desire to protect literal children because that's the level of analysis they're on.

They're not aware of what they're actually worried about which is the fact that the future does not appear to exist on our current trajectory not in terms of annihilation even but in terms of change towards the better. The future is just this but shittier. I have seen the future it is murder so that means that q is going to only become more popular as more people turn up the need for a more heightened and more dramatic and more melodramatic explanation for their alienation and their horror and q will do q will do because it's the only thing there and so yeah. I'd say I say q is q is the future of the right. Here's the future of the right and I also think it's a religious revival. I think it's the third great I think it's the third great awakening the most q mindset movie.

I think is jfk. We said this when we did our movie review episode of it just because jfk posits a sort of right reactionary fairy tale whereby an evil force within the greater good that was america made up of decadent perverts who want to keep doing decadent perversions conspire to kill a president who is going to undermine their power and stop them from being perverted. I mean there's literally a scene. The first scene that where jim garrison starts to have second thoughts about kennedy is when he's on an airplane with russell long played by walter matthau and walter. Matthau was talking about the the vietnam war and how it's burning out of control but also about all the hippies in the streets and jim. Garrison goes. I begin. I wonder if I kind of think it all went bad after. Kennedy died and if you have a cultural lens through which you're looking at politics which they.

All do and you and you are horrified and repulsed by america's culture. As many of them are you look back as many people have and see the 60s as the culprit and I think that's the reason that jfk jr. Figures so spectacularly in their in their cosmology. I mean he's the returned messiah. I mean these people are also deeply christian. I mean it should be pointed out that the whole thing is evangelical as. Like this is just a politicization of evangelicalism. It's a furthering of the moral majority move from the sidelines to the to the center of american politics of evangelicals over the past 40 years and jfk is jesus returned to to judge the wicked and the righteous and it's important to remember the jfk. Junior thing is not from a cue proof that was people operating independently okay.

This is interesting someone says no civil war but what about something like the troubles that I could definitely see more likely. Now. We might be talking. You could see an escalation to like low-level street warfare between semi-organized groups. I think it would take a while to get to anywhere like the organization of the provisional ira or or even the The loyalist paramilitaries who mostly were just drug dealers by the way and still are but you'd have something like it car bombs shooting things up. But I think what a lot of people assume is that that would cause this cycle whereby everyone would start picking up guns and that's not what happened in northern ireland and I don't think it was what had happened here either someone remind me.

I don't want to do it today because I i don't. I'm still trying to like rev back up into the like abstract stuff. But I want to go deeper into gnosticism on one point because somebody somebody said something about narcissism in the in the chat that made me read my eye. They said eyebrow. They said like narcissism doesn't require satan if you think god up to allow a demon to inter interact with with because god could do anything right like that's always been a question and I think the thing that in my mind squares that circle is if you understand obviously like a lot of this is all filtered through outmoded symbolic orders that we don't really translate. But I think the real maybe not understood intellectually but understood spiritually the real demiurge. The real interceding force that created the hell of of the demiurgical reality is the experience of consciousness specifically the experience of time because and as and so that because if we assume like as I do that god is really just our closest to the bone symbolic representation of the concept of unity. The unity of all things and all things in the universe in the universe and you well the notion that all that there is no fundamental separation between any object in the universe.

There is one substance in the universe as spinoza said and that we are all composed of it and make up the eddies within it and that the thing that made this world. This fallen world. This world that is choking on its own gas. That is that is a process of committing suicide. Um is that we evolved intense enough sensory organs and a mental ability to process sensory information that was sufficient to create an inflection point where we get we we received so much sensory data that we were able to create such a detailed map of the world around us that we were able to convince ourselves basically to consciously act to take a step here instead of a step there. Not the way that lower animals do lower animals take a step instead of a stutter step because they're instinctively reacting a conscious creature. Act puts one foot in front of the other because there's something deep enough in his brain to convince them to make one move over another move and the more sensory data you can create the richer and more textured that picture of the past of the of the of the recent past. But the past the greater the degree you can imagine project forward what would happen if you do this versus that and then you do one creating a tunnel that we can burrow through reality with and that has like a narrow evolutionary. benefit the way if you're a hominid and you're a you know a furry you don't have spikes. You can't run that fast and especially if conditions that you live in change quickly inc. The ability to plan ahead is useful but the problem is the more you are able to live in the past and the future which is what a more conscious mind can do the less you are able to literally be present and in the moment of existence.

Not the processing of the moment not the imagining the past and the future and the side the presence the sensory presence of the moment there is an awareness of that unity and at that point fear if not eliminated is removed is leeched away desire likewise because we have to feel separate to ever feel like the rest of the world could endanger us because what are they endangering if we are the same they are endangering the separate entity of me. But I can only sustain that delusion if I am not present and so the more intense our mental landscape. The less present we are and that means that we are ruled by fear and desire as we navigate a world between choices that we think might lead us to pleasure or pain and in so doing we create the need to we create the desire to gain take more than we give to take from others who otherwise we might understand implicitly to be part of a holistic unit even if it's not. It's not the entire universe. It is a network of beings that can maintain that sense of safety because that's why we seek others because they provide a simulacrum of the safety that we feel when we feel unity. It's not the same thing but it's close. We can sleep easily because we're in we're surrounded by people we trust that's why we build communities and that's when social evolution kicks in and that's when we cease to be evo. We cease to evolve individually and we evolve as a group. But in so doing you accumulate separateness over time and as you get more intense in your perception and as conditions become more endangering. We seek ways to gain comfort and the comfort one great way to perceive comfort is to rest while others. Work is to gain food and and items that have been imbued with value and experiences that have been imbued with value that others don't get to have and now you have in.

Now you've let lip. You have created the engine of history here and you have also created the drive towards the creation of structures that push us ever farther away from the present and push us ever farther from unity and ever farther from god. But we have to work through those things and as we are driven away from each other by entropy. We also are grasping for one another and the class project the socialist project. The the the the the slow but steady coming into awareness of itself of the of the oppressed class is the process of people reaching out to grab one another in the void and the best way to start that process.

I think is to have a real understanding of love personified in maybe a religious concept. But that's very hard to hold on to in a world where other people have different understandings of that religion and that causes intellectual disagreements and alienation like people can hold on to religion and hold on to love and hold on to unity maybe in cloistered religious communities and I think that's possible but in in the secular world that we live in the closest thing is love for one person. One person who can stand in for the moment one person who because you know them fully you are fully comfortable with and feel fully safe with and therefore drain from every moment of your life uncertainty and fear because you are able to tack back to what unity and away from the idea that you could ever be a threat in threat threatened the idea that there could ever be an end to life or your life. The idea that pleasure could be accumulated and that it could offset pain somehow and so that is I think where what love where love emerges like when you love someone when you fall in love with someone. You are gaining such a degree of comfort and intimacy with that person that you aren't afraid and that means if you spend time with that person. All the time you spend with that person is time that drains from your life the accumulation of anxiety the accumulation of difference the feeling of spinning away into nothingness and even when you're away from them. When you're in a time and something is stressful. You can think back you can think about them and when you have that idea in your mind when you can picture love in an embodied person. You can then project it outward not with the same degree of of of passion not with the same degree of certainty but but still qualitatively powerful sense of love to others and that means that when you react to the world you will react from a position of loving kindness instead of self-interest. Instead of the rat reptile reptile unseen drive towards personal pleasure more fun than not fun because I'm gonna die someday so I need all the fun. I can get work now like going door-to-door for a campaign or walking a picket line maybe if it comes to it like real conflict with the state become pleasures in themselves because they are pursued out of love the way that it's not work to do something for someone you love. It's not work to do something for to do for people that you love and that's the only way that you can bring down the the the pillars of the demiurgical reality which are every day reinforced. Every moment reinforced because hypothetically hypothetically you could snap your fingers and everyone could come into full consciousness of their unity for a moment come away from it be able to connect to each other immediately at like a base bonded level and we would have a new world. But that's not how it works because we're separate because we have different experiences because of the randomness of chance that brings us to different points in the social order when we emerge into it a deformed social social order created by the nightmare of every past generation we have to work towards it. We have to stumble into the hallways. We have to blindly find our way and that is the process of of class struggle that is the the dialectical relationship working its way through the human species never mind.

I guess. I just said it. I said. I wasn't going to say it today but I kind of got on a roll. I hope it made sense because I wasn't. I wasn't planning to talk about that today squibs. I'm really getting to the point where I have to sort of come to terms with the fact that I'm not getting squibs anymore and that I need to just decide to stop watching new action films or stop caring about squibs because this third thing where I just watch them and feel annoyed is pointless. Why do that I will hope. I think the the more mature thing would just be to stop caring about I mean. Obviously. The most mature thing is to stop watching movies of any kind certainly action movies. But I'm not ever going to get to that level. I don't think but more realistically. I could just get rid of my weird squib fixation but I will say though that um I do hope.

I understand. I'm coming to terms with the fact that if there are movies with squibs in the future they will be like um. It'll be like the lighthouse where they used old film from the 20s. It'll be a gimmick and that's fine. I just hope enough people do the gimmick. So I can get my fix once in a while. I would certainly hope that the safeties would use squibs if they made a movie. I did see let the corpses tan that wasn't it wasn't really my thing. But it was it was interesting cgi could get better but I honestly don't think it will. I think that's one of those things that just it can't it can't it can't simulate presence. The guest had squibs you bet you better believe that because the guests had squibs you're next also had squibs now wingard and barrett. Those guys are old school. I like them well not somebody asked. Why is it the point to be challenged by art. I don't think. I don't think watching bad action movies that are clearly intended for a foreign market because the scripts are written by algorithms and machine. Learning is really challenging and in sense challenging anything other than your patients which has its you know benefits psychically. But I i would rather be challenged intellectually um. I just watched the harley quinn movie.

I was just had it on tv you know. I was doing other things. I shouldn't have been doing that but but I just wanted some something under the background and at one point she's in the grocery store with a girl and she says. I need more groceries. I need more groceries no no. I'm sorry. She says I'm out of groceries and then she starts shopping and that hit my ear in the theater wrong and hearing it again. It hit it even worse. No one would ever say. I'm out of groceries right. I'm not crazy about that. Groceries are the stuff that you get at the store as soon as you bring them in your house and put them away. They're the individual food and collectively. They're food you'd say. I'm out of food or I need to get groceries. Groceries are at the store. You cannot be out of groceries unless you live in a grocery store and that's such a but the thing the reason that that's not. I don't think that's just being pedantic because when I say nobody says that I don't think anyone would say that like I think most basically human beings. English speakers have been wired to understand the difference between groceries and food so who wrote that line my suspicion is that it was like a algorithm or like a bot that somebody programmed and then even if that happened how did how did I mean. I'm assuming australians are human beings although that's still out as a margot robbie encounter girl. Maybe maybe they don't have groceries. They might not have groceries in australia. They're probably called grosseros or something but other people on that set director on down. None of it hit their ear wrong.

It none of it sounded weird to anybody. It's It's just it's. It's it's worrying to me that that kind of thing could happen and it certainly reminds me of why we get squibs all over the place because clearly nobody really gives a about any of this stuff nobody's putting any effort into any of it. Everyone at some level understands it to be machine line hack work which I have to say makes the fact that people put so much emotional investment in superhero movies and and and have to and demand people take them seriously is art either because they're gritty and realistic like dc people or or important and and representation if they're marvel. People is that the people making them for the most part don't give a. I don't buy the line that's about a foreign market because it's going to get translated anyway right but the thing that's weird about that and freaks me out about. It is that it's not. It's not a bad line in the sense that it's poorly written. It's not written like a human being who speaks english would write it. I guess maybe they're like a foreign first foreign first language person.

Okay fair enough then zack snyder cares because he the reason they love him is the same way. The reason that republican people love trump is because sanders snyder is one of them and they know it like you ever listen to a zack. Snyder interview. He is one of those guys he's just in better shape and richer and definitely more talented. He had this he had somebody was making fun of his movie and or he said that it was what was what was the tweet that snyder had where he said just to ao scott. He said you like movies for babies. I make movies for adults this movie's for grown-ups so. I don't care if you don't like it and it's like come on that's so perfect the guy believes the same. They do. He believes the same fantasy that this this stunted and deformed squasi art form known as superhero. Filmmaking is something that is for adults not something for children that adults watch because it's easier to make than stuff for adults because too much money is put into it for any singular vision to dominate or even a collaborative artistic vision to dominate over the algorithm of profit which demands 13 pg-13 pablum for the lowest common denominator and you've got a guy making these movies making 100 million dollar movies who believes this garbage who believes he's making movies for adults that are like dude. What if superman was real like what would that be like he's still gonna fight a space squid either way and so having snyder out there really believing that it makes the it makes them that much easier to have the intellectual the the emotional and psychic transference to to become a snyder stan and end up trolling and death. Threatening everybody who goes online to say that cider movies are bad even after you get what you want.

I don't know what the black enlightenment is. I know dark enlightenment dark enlightenment was was what people called the alt-right when it was just guys in capes. The sea people were a theoretized group of marauding mediterranean sort of pirate societies like vikings probably who raided late bronze age. societies like egypt and and helped cause the late browns age collapse. nowadays. It's usually understood that like with most social collapses the real causes were long-term soil erosion volcanic eruption and social breakdown but that the the sea peop these guys might have showed up to up for them and make it collapse oh who is the first non-liberal president. I mean it depends on what you mean by liberal.

I don't think we've had one do all right. I'm gonna wrap up here. maybe. I'll take one question boss baby two. I will come. I will watch boss baby two because hopefully it will involve getting more detail about the weird-ass boss baby world that that they created where the babies are manufactured. This nightmare like eternal capitalism ooh brutal. I'd like to know more like. I said do they drive to baby. Houses are there baby restaurants. Do they go to baby strip clubs. Do. They do baby cocaine.

I think ed markey's gonna win which will be very funny first competitive primary lost by a kennedy ever in that state. Maybe the the downfall of that dynasty can be a silver lining in the current moment but it would also be really really funny if kennedy won anyway. Oh is rfk junior at that rally in Germany against masks that's funny that guy's really interesting because he is sort of a he's a marin county like crunchy kook basically and it would be very funny if he did make the q jump because then you would have an actual kennedy at the head of this thing instead of instead of the fake guy pretending to be jfk. Jr. So that would be funny if rfk ended up running on like a q-party platform like q got so big that it broke and and so infused with like non-right non-republican and non-like self-consciously reactionary cranks like other anti-vax people like. I said if if if trump gets elected and starts vaccinating people you could cq depending on how levened it got with anti-vaxxers. decide that he got like replaced by a deep state robot or something and then hell that'd be hilarious and then like rally behind rfk jr that would be that would be hilarious that would be great.

We can't know things we can guess. We can guess we do trial and error and the way we test. It is what other people react how other people react that's why we need. That's why like the the root of technology is collaboration. No knowledge is siloed that's I remember I actually read atlas shrugged. I read the whole thing and I skimmed a lot of it obviously because it's so repetitive.

But the way that ayn rand consul conceived of of invention and technological progress was so insane in her cosmology. Every person who is like the inventor of a thing essentially is the is is deserves by inventing it all associated progress and that they can like dole it out then in exchange for like market share or something. It's and it you could take the greatest genius in world history. You could take any of the great innovators like edison or something if you had them just if you dropped them on the top of a hill like a deformed spartan child. None of them would invent. They would die of exposure maybe a few of them would be if be clever enough to create like a quonset hut. But nothing is created without people collaborating across the space of of unknown existence and comparing like nothing nobody could invent anything because because the they're at the end of a process that began with the formation of the language they're thinking in and the numbers that they're using to write with and every single element within the nested technologies that make up whatever the hell they're going to build on top of and that's why that's why libertarianism is just so laughable and why the idea that there are people who consider themselves like geniuses who who who take rand seriously and objectivism seriously it really does tell you that like there are different ways to be intelligent and that we are defined by our ignorance and one of the things that makes us define that ends up. Making us most defined by our ignorance is by our refusal to admit that we don't.

We aren't the full container of the world. We have to fill gaps and one of the things that makes love possible is that when you love someone one of the reasons you love them probably is because not because they exactly mirror your mind. What your preferences your experience but because they have had different experiences and come to different conclusions that fill in the gaps for you and then make it easier for both of you to navigate the world successfully because you're getting more information and you're operating from a correct premise because you've collaborated. You complete me literally in the sense that you fill the hole of perception because of the because of the non-overlapping experiences and and and sensitivities that we possess. If everybody had to act like a randian hero there would be no human existence. It would be a bunch of people with blindfolds on swinging katanas at one another in a room how would that turn out all right. I went over a little bit so yeah no someone oh just to end here.

Someone says is american libertarianism the basis for neo-feudalism of course because it says it takes the logic the liberal logic of the market to such an extent that because feudalism replaced obligations right social obligations with transactions but transactions are assumed to be between equal parties and all economic. theory and this and all libertarian ethics are premised on equal exchange but of course exchange isn't equal because of the accumulated history of exploitation that makes up the human race and human existence and so that accumulates social pressure tension and conflict ein. Rand's solution to the fact that there's so many people who are resent even though it's like isn't it irrational. Even though these titans of industry create the world for people. They're not happy with it and they whine about it. What's the answer to that her answer to that is they're dumb and that what should happen is you just tell them about it until their stupid asses understand it well guess what that hasn't worked and can't work. What's going to happen is you're going to create a a social order so fractured that the market will not be able to be sustained because you won't be able to sustain social order. So you have to replace social order with coercive bilateral relationships but this way totally detached from a social order a negative dialectic but as I and like you want to know what neo-feudalism is. It's going to be feudalism but without the time off or the friends or the family or the religious awe. The peace nothing you will be stimulus response.

You'll be desire and fear turned into a node. They're gonna prod you at one end with one or the other and it's gonna get behavior out of the other end. You're just going to be a neuron and there will be no more social texture that the the liberal order presumes this market that we exchange in no more money for that. No more time for that that is replaced by bondage by by compulsion but of course not entirely compulsion not just gun to the head like I said pleasure too some boobs on the screen some some chicken congealed patties to consume perhaps marvel film or two. If you're good all right guys I'm back back in the new york groove talk to you soon bye.
