Ah the Cadillacs a vine house in the yank favor they head in and they turn and  our IP - a real one. I think I could say that with full earnestness alright he drools maybe the realest one we've ever seen so obviously Bertie topped out today the back where we started eternal recurrence. It's a real. Syphilitic misogynist weirdo totally damaged there's no question that we live in them turtle. The Kurds that is our ate a lot of people are asking where do we open here. Fantastic Lancer I do not know the question all right. That's question did that the answer to all I can say about that is that the one good thing for people especially considering the real you know stressful crisis. Moment.

We're in for everyone is that now you don't have to worry. There's one less thing to worry about you don't worry about the presidential election anymore. Like you can tote it out you don't have to pay attention. There's no requirement for you to care about any of this stuff night and that honestly after it's one thousand four years or so of like like investing yourself of the ship isn't that kind of a treat that in the midst of this  and you don't have to care about the presidency you don't have to care about the selection it means nothing. It is the payment you can be put finally and definitively on the pay no mind list. We don't have to pay it any mind and that's really nice. I'm looking forward to that.

I'm looking forward to what we're gonna do on the show. Now that we don't have to talk about this topic which honestly at this point I'm pretty sick up. I mean what else is to be said about the  you know this this mummy. This undead mummy murdering people sacrificing like as a proof to their their faith of the Democratic Party. I mean what the hell else do you need to say about what's happening that it's more damning than what they're actually doing. So pay no mind so yeah beyond that I don't know what people talk about general strikes. It's like with who you know what army like if you don't have the people hopefully with the Cabrera campaign was to get some numbers to get some numbers behind this. Whole thing we get some like some support. It's a critical mass and now that's pretty much off the table. So now what to do next becomes a question but I think people who are like alright. Now we can do that direct democracy. Now we can do other ships like well. We didn't have enough people before this. We don't have a cup people now so maybe. We need to stop and think about that I don't know the answers I still have no idea. I forgot something I'll be right back. So I don't know what's happening put the pig on I listen.


I listen people say put the thing on it but the payoff like what kills me and makes me sad about. This is that for myself personally the reason I thought it was worthwhile to invest fully in. The Bernie. Campaign is because I recognized the chief problem of the left. In this country was saying was numbers was people was people who were invested and willing to do willing to beat activists and whatever way to make it way that man and to you know do the work or whatever that meant. Nobody knew because they'd never been an issue. We never had it. You know we never had the numbers haven't had him for decades. Bernie was about getting the numbers and getting the movement. Oh almost fell off that would have been epic fail ah it was to get people on board and because there's gonna be a crisis in capitalism you know it's like. I didn't really know what burning was gonna be able to accomplish this president. I honestly didn't think that much I wasn't really that I mean I he had a lot of levers he could crash but like he wasn't good at shape. He wasn't. Gonna make revolution or anything like that now what he was. Gonna do was what he was gonna do was great movement create a creative get an army get people ready to go ahead of time and as capitalism came closer to crisis. I mean what's killing me right now with this whole  was going on as the Paris to what's happening now which is we're getting the 2008 bailout on steroids. We're getting we're getting another massive corporate handout. We're getting a situation where what this ends if we still have an intact government in institutions.

Then there that's going to be we literally will use the federal treasury to keep hold the people who will just buy out everything that everybody lost during the course of this thing and that wouldn't I mean I don't know what Bernie presidency would have meant but this happening under Bernie president would not admit that I can say that for sure and if it hadn't been a virus if it had been one of the endogenous crises that are endemic to capitalism finally coming forward again which he was on the verge of happening I mean the  were going wild even before around the virus and there who knows if they're right have been another thing and and they know people would have there would have been like a coherent response. To this. There would have been a coherent notion of like a capitalist like an alternative to a capitalist restructuring that we're gonna get instead and that would have been true with a Bernie presidency or post Bernie moment when the crisis came and now the crisis is here and it's just too  early and that's too bad so the past is still the same that it was without before Bernie but now without Bernie. The question becomes what replaces Bernie as the mechanism for recruitment and mobilization and I don't know it's way too early to say we'll talk about it. People have ideas stays Ling I know you don't I don't know I know. I think it's too early. I think anybody love you buddy anybody who's claiming to know is  selling something but yeah like one way or another. They keep the fact is is that is that we're not prepared for this moment and Bernie represented the best chance to get people prepared for a moment. Like this it didn't have and that's the real tragedy here.

I'm not as for what break could have done differently. I think anybody arguing for any kind of specific like oh you should have done XYZ. It's really just arguing from their own like personal crossing where they're like oh. This is what I always wanted him to do and coincidentally that's what he should have done you know it's like come on. Why would you need to engage with Biden supporters the Republican. The the the the presidential election is no longer a zone of contention. It's no longer a contest. It's no longer a place to put energy why care who gives a  don't want to be in a situation where you feel you need to honor that when it happens you need to have already put this in your rear-view mirror. You've already need to put up the pay. No mind sign so that when Bernie does endorse lighting and they start banging on you to vote for him you can just say not. My problem look what they did to make this happen look at the norms they violated look at the lives. They literally lost and kill look at the people. They literally killed to do this. It's it's it's an illegitimate process from start to finish. Not one you're obligated to  acknowledge. There is also in anyway so pay no mind just forget about it.

You don't have to care about the presidential election anymore fill that hole with like scrimshaw or collecting jazz records or just doing more drugs whatever you don't have to care about the presidency anymore so that's fun uh uh yeah. Like Bernie. There's certainly versions of the Bernie campaign that would have been more fun to watch and participate in. But I don't know if they would have been any more effective because because a of the degree to which Democratic polity the Democratic Party be the degree to which non voters are committed to not voting and see the degree to which Democratic Party voters are high are in the thrall of mainstream media and the party itself which they are so that means like people say Bernie should have been harder on Biden and should have gone harder on bite well yeah. But that also would have been treated like all of his mild attacks on Biden were as him trying to undermine the Democrats on behalf of Trump because for Democratic voters things are all 0. Some things either benefit Republican Democrats in an attack on a Democrat is something is Republicans that's just the way they think so there's no guarantee that that would have worked and especially when the media was willing to take - to give everything the benefit of Joe Biden's spin on it as like the assumed thing to do whereas like the actual reality like they just were like whatever the Biden campaign.

Spin on this is is the one that we're giving prima facie credence to and birdie has the benefit asked to do the he has to match some burden of proof to get his point of view across. I mean that's a fundamental difference in the way that they were treated by the media that was going to make it impossible for him to get enough of the Democratic electorate who watched TV and believed that  to follow along unless they stayed separated which they did until Obama made two phone calls and brought them all together which is them together unprecedented intervention in the process that was done on the specific purpose to defeat one candidate. Then you have what they did during this. Primary in these all these these these primaries that they from Iowa on even before the coronavirus think they've been illegitimate but the parties still accepted them as my as legitimate. All of these like five polling places in Milwaukee there during a  pandemic those delegates are gonna get certified.

What difference I mean there was no way they were gonna. Let it happen the period end of sentence. Nobody else wants to do an emergency chappo. Today they want to think some more they want to get their thoughts fresh. They want to get their toss like in order. But now I just want to shoot off the hip cuz.


What the  third party politics for the presidential level is is a cookies for cranks. It's for cranks. I've said this before but it's still  true. It's for cranks third party. Presidential races are for burning light not have been a crank because of his position. I'd run third party he could have been viable but like these guys no one knows Jill Stein Gloria Leu la Riva. It's crank.

Nobody knows it's just it's just a  vote forever. You want I'm not voting for Biden. I don't frankly I don't I don't know if I'll ever respect anyone who does vote providing them honestly. So vote would just as a personal thing of like you know how it wouldn't respect somebody who you know likes pineapples on pizza or something just like a thing. That's personally it's repulsive to me so yeah voting for him is a sign of a weak character I guess. That's what I would say so do what you want. I'll probably bite it Bernie if you want to write an e that'd be funny if you could get like if you could get like a percentage or not like not a person si realistic. But if you get me like a half a percent or no like a fraction of a percent that'd be pretty. Funny I don't know whatever doesn't matter not our problem not my problem who care as the great Dave King Dave said Big Dave himself says who care doesn't matter that's a mem that's a wipey not an MP so that's one thing you have to worry about so the cast of the Bernie campaign now still has to be done which is organizing people. The thing that's going to help that in this moment is that politics is about to stop being a spectator sport for the booj wha and start being things that regular people have to contend with every day of their lives.

But man it really kills me to think like all right so you're in the situation. Now where you have these where you have these wildcat labor actions to try to resist you know literally having their lives put on the line by their employers like like the Amazon warehouse is in instacart well. It's like you guys aren't giving us protection and we don't we're not making enough money to risk. Our. Lives imagine how I mean right now like people are excited for it but like what has happened you know. Amazon fired one of the guys who was organizing their walkout in Staten Island and said that it was because he violated the social distancing rules which is just hilarious and like it seems like a lot of them are not happening because people are  if it doesn't work and it probably won't work imagine if people were in this situation if people were at these vital bottlenecks for like the resources that we need to keep this.

Sanders as president imagine what that would do to their their lay their leverage against their bosses. It's I mean if that's if we didn't see mass nationalization so honestly. I don't think they're even out of the table off the table in a situation like this and more importantly than that you would have met millions. Millions of people would voted for this who endorsed it who had some sort of investment in its success as a project so that's what's really big. That's what pains me is to think about what we could have had and now yeah. We got people trying to exert leverage in a situation where if they get fired they're going to be cast into a reserve army of labor that now numbers 30% of the population or soon will it's tough. It's very difficult which is why I see people saying okay Bernie's go on time for the general strike. Okay Bernie's gone. It's like time for the revolution. It's like if there weren't the numbers in America in the in the facts the fat happy heart of the world Empire if you didn't have enough people willing to just go and vote for Social Democrat Bernie Sanders. In this country you really think you have the numbers to. Like out of the out of the economy. You really think that that that the numbers exist does make that happen come on man come on there. That's why the chief thing is the question like Bernie went loose Bernie losing or whatever and does not change this to such a challenge which is getting people getting people on your side and beyond that getting people willing to act. That's it. That's it.

That's the only that's the only thing all other questions. Strategies tactics they need to be subordinated to the question of that. What does that annoys me right now is. I don't. Know I know there's a lot of people with theories. I have not been convinced by any of them doesn't mean any of them are wrong does it just means that I don't really feel confident. I just know that that's got to be the goal and I definitely know the presidential politics at this point are not. Gonna get it done without Bernie. They're trying to get people to write in Orono get people to vote for Gloria reliever or get the  Green Party to 3% or something that is just a waste of time because you're not you're not expanding anything. There you are pitching to the same gallery of disaffected cranks who always are looking for a third party to vote for as opposed to the mass and mass mass. Mass of people who don't vote. Only hope is there and only hope is with the frawls. That's Winston Smith said means people say a third part of new party to discipline. The Democrats which of course is that's more promising than the idea of them.

Competing with the Democrats it would have to be a complete overnight collapse. Like the wigs. Wigs are the model here calmness as the wigs have specific historical context that made that happen and that is the main one is the split that happened that destroyed the wigs was was regional which meant that when the wigs broke up over slavery basically the entirety of the northern wig electorate everyone who's voted wig in the north was already. We're all already pre organized to join the party that would embody wig principles and be anti-slavery and that was the Republicans. In fact it was the emergence of the Republicans and their success early in Fremont that made the wig collapse happen because people saw an alternative but the thing was it was it was self-organizing and instantly coherent along state lines. If you lived in a northern state and wear a wig you were probably anti-slavery because the Democrats basically were the party of the doughface party of collaboration with the southern slave power for the most part before the Civil War. The the northern if you were against slavery in the north. The Democratic Party was not really for you that's why there were like things like the Liberty Party and the Free Soil party. The eventually the Republicans was because of that non-existent Democratic home for people who were in favor which meant that basically every wig in the North was ready to vote for the party that would basically be wigs - slavery which was the Republicans. If this were to happen. Now. The split is ideological and it's it's it's not as clean and it's not state-based. It's not like they instantly were able to take over not only half of the Whig party but the the half that was in states where they could run the table which they did that's not the same thing here. So whether it's party politics or not. I don't know once another another thing that I that I don't and yeah the other big differences is that if this did this split half this split that happen to the Whig party you're not really there's not really a conflict at the top there because you're you're all capitalist. The question is whether you're a capitalist who think that we should accommodate slavery is a component of the supply chain. That's it. This is what would be a capitalist party and like it's anti capitalist wing breaking on and that would make it the enemy of the entire establishment which did not exist with slavery of course.


So all I can say is that right now. I am a shrugging emoji guy on all questions of tactics policy what to do next not the least of all because we're in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic and economic collapse. Two things that have never happened and certainly never happened during an election year I mean this is people say well you've been living in interesting times. My god. This 20th century 21st century has been absurd and specifically the last year Jesus like just Trump got in. It really has been someone put a cinder block on the  gas tank gas pail and now we're in totally uncharted territory so that's another reason why I hesitate to say X Y or Z is the next path forward because we don't even know what the state of play is going to be in what even six months from now six months four months. Two months who knows they're even real election in 2020.

That's a  open question to me that no one has really asked answered to my specifications. History is turning wheel of history is turning something's gonna do something something. We've got to give that's no there's no question about that. What what that thing will be is don't ask me. I'm just a girl that's gonna help. You. Stacey said honestly the most realistic left formation to emerge really like from the American context. We have like imagining the different types of revolutions we have left-wing revolutions we could have in this country. Let's rank them by likelihood of actually happening. I would say least likely the the sucked em fantasy of a like electoral reform because we know obviously before you get anywhere close to the real engine house of power. The state comes in the apparatus first and foremost the capitalist class.

I mean the intelligence community them like the Mafia version that could break the rules because even if you're winning by even if you're winning with within the rules. They can always decide that the rules don't exist with the help of institutions like the intelligence community so that makes that very much it just happens take through honestly less not maybe a little more likely but still wildly unlikely is the idea of any kind of Maoist like peasant or or or m/l like style Bolshevik coup just wildly improbable to me given the Commission's in this country I mean we might be neo peasants. Right like I've said that the American like lump in person in this country is basically. It's basically a medieval peasant with in terms of their relationship to to each other in media and things like that like they are not. They're not the industrial subjects that Marx imagined having a revolution but they don't live like peasants.

They don't live on the land. They live disconnected completely from the land. That's why I said instead of potatoes in a sack. They're Pringles in a tube they've been processed. They've been chopped up. They've been fried. They've been put inside a carton. They're totally disconnected from their natural context so therefore they can't fend for themselves that makes them vulnerable and makes them incapable of the type of action where we're talking about that a peasant.

A like army could like those landless Hakka tribesmen of southern China who made up the bulk of anti-imperial insurgencies all through China's. History we don't have those people they don't not where you gonna go. You're gonna go out. You're gonna. Let you're gonna go camp out in like what the green belt behind your. Of the of the houses yes in Bushwick. So that's also unlikely honestly still very unlikely but more likely than either of those is some sort of middle level three officer to within the military like like Egypt had with Nasser or like the carnation revolution in Portugal. That's more likely than any of them is those those those icky troops. Like some some mid-level radicalized officers sort of like chopping off the head of the snake and and instituting some sort of like barracks socialism in in during of course. During a moment of deep crisis oh it wouldn't be a soft - I think a soft it would be like just the suspension of like the forms of democratic government which they modestly might do to Trump. I'm not leaving that out they might not like. It's claimed that they might have already done bowls an arrow if they haven't been at the Trump. Yet they might and if they do he would be really relieved. Honestly. You don't think Trump would be relieved at this moment yeah I think he's terrified of being president right. Now you don't think that he would love the chance to not have this responsibility and have the military of his beautiful soldiers. My beautiful soldiers look at him like a man some generals they want to take over the same I could take it back the same think of it yes president.


Davis have just talked about how like the only model we have for any kind of social organism that like I talked about Institute's. The notion of a social self instead of erratically individualized neoliberal self is the military. It's the only institution now if it adds to that like fascistic ship and like a call to violence and death of worship and imperialism and all that stuff. But it also has the idea of like an esprit de corps. I'd like of a collective project which note which we do not have in which is one of the chief obstacles to try to organize among people because they don't think that way. I know I don't I know I struggle to like build that notion in my head because it's just not something I've built into so yeah man. The free officers are there free officers do we have any free officers of the house. Are there any free officers you might want to consider like doing like a Smedley Butler type deal. You know not the business plot but when he exposed the business plot I mean if you've done like a counter business plot. Sadly I don't really think so honestly. I think I'll be like anti-war. Like all the socialist troops are like podcasters. You know I think that's the height like the highest ranking. An tight like genuinely likes socialist troop in the army is probably yeah like that.

Knows I think they might be switching their love to Newsome from Cuomo just because the fiction of Cuomo being doing such a great job is just becoming harder and harder maintain in the face of the continued disastrous New York. Response and horrifying death rates. That's why it's like cuz. It's like they didn't pick Cuomo because like they necessarily wanted him. They  put Cuomo there as a backstop as a last resort as an in case of in case of trouble break last situation because he had a buy-in with the media because people saw him as this decisive figure. Thanks to his press conferences. It was like they were looking for any port in a storm and he was looking good now though couple weeks later and the failure of New York to see the bend the curve bend at all he's not looking so good. Meanwhile the curve does seem to be bending in California and so Newsom's looking good and so how it's gonna be him. He's gonna be the backup but that's just shows you. It's like. They have an overriding desire to have a backup to Biden because they know he can't. He can't hack it but like who it is specifically is contingent on public response and on facts on the ground. There's only so much that can be massaged like you can take a like a genuine phenomenon.

Like 1200 frances. They've got people like feeling good got people feeling like will reassured after watching the president just get sweaty and start freaking out and my like speaking in tongues that was a real thing. If so they they tried to have dry rot away their treasures. They all good good good. We got this but then he just he'd get  cutting Medicaid well the bodies keep piling up while it's still the highest in the country. Meanwhile you got another Democrat across the country who is seems to have whatever maybe probably through luck more than anything has actually dumping. Although apparently he's also like San Francisco. Two things very seriously unlike New York and that wasn't just Cuomo that was de bungler oh let's not forget our own two bungler to bungle the  out of this thing he was telling people like two weeks after we knew for a fact that asymptomatic carriers could transmit it that if you were feelings weren't feeling sick you couldn't transmit it and so you should go out EPIK just one of our greatest bunglers. One of our greatest bumblers honestly more of a bundler than warm of unliving a bundler actually because at least the old Butler got to be president for two terms. Welcome the bums are all got two terms as mayor and then to bungled the  out of the presidential race. Uh D Butler do I see a place for a propaganda of the deed in a post burning left.

I'm not sure officer. I'm not sure if I want to commit right now to endorsing criminal acts on a public space of a recording that literally NSA could be watching right. Now. I know this is separate. This is uh oh this I have a medical exemption. I have to do this to prescribe this to have for having a podcast whose hip and this helps me so please officer I've just I'm just going about my day sir please please sir yeah. What about doing crime sort of come on man I don't know about propaganda of the deed. But I can tell you about propaganda of the weed.

Huh what about sudden strikes ceasing means first of all I love that as a tongue-twister sudden strike ceasing means but how does that not beg the question of where do you get the people to do the sudden strikes like once again. People are talking about tactical questions and you're all assuming a can opener you can opener you're assuming is a organized critical mass of radicals who are gonna all do the same thing at the same time. That is the can opener that all questions of tactics assume and so I'm saying you can't assume the can opener and you have to start asking that question before you ask any others. You'll ask how do. We get people anybody. Any anybody asking any other questions has skipped a step and they're assuming a can opener. What about sudden strike ceasing means. Sun strikes teasing means strengths like seasoning setting strike seasonings. A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

The arsonist has oddly-shaped feet yeah what bell rang much to the pay. I'm doing another Spanish read. I'm enjoying the Spanish Reds lately fine spends. Their bold is a thing and they've got a nice mineral taste to them. I know this looks like it's a ganache. A tooth of a now. The mixture good give you a reason to be happy at all sir that is beyond. My paygrade. Happiness comes from within I cannot make one happy. Charlie I don't know watch the little feet documentary. Now how big of a tool is david axelrod. His name is literally two tools an axle and iran those are both tools. His name is two tools. How did you know happiness is right action happiness is knowing that you're on the path of the beam. That's it. Happiness is feeling a Concord between your deeds and your spirits.


I mean maybe yeah maybe do some goo thing baby boo baby. Boo fit up shine a light on me. Oh don't know where Virgil is don't care. He submitted something for us to show put on the show and we didn't do it because it's like he's not talking to us. So why would we do it so sorry. I'm not gonna bother with him. How are we this all of a sudden finding the  out every two weeks I guess. It's a new group of young people finding something I hate being reminded. There's a new group of young people. There's always a new group of young people every day well. Zoomer Psychopaths the Republican Party becoming the Left Party. No that's idiotic now the left body. The Republicans will not be the left party because then they wouldn't be the Republicans. It's like a ship of theseus thing. Like the right. The right exists to the Republican Party exists to actually exercise power on behalf of capital as oppose the Democratic Party which exists to provide a formal sort of ritual. The Democratic Party is there to perform like a ritual consecration of that action like a literally like manufactured consent for what capital wants to do that's why the Democrats exist so the Republican Party literally is. Job is to function as capitalism's civil manifestation how could it be the Left Party regardless of what like people are trying to gamify with like Tucker Carlson or  or like are intellectually talking about or trying to Brandes.

Whatever what's gonna change that function reality maybe if you're in a situation where capitalism is so dire that like there has to be some sort of crisis a crisis accommodation made with the people right and like they'll be like all right. It'll be like Bismarck. It'll be like how bismarck instituted social welfare in in late 1800s Germany to forestall the Socialists and say say they do that like even though this is an expression of the state. It's like we're willing to what live with this just forestall losing control of the power. If that's the case it's gonna happen regardless because it's going to be in capitalist interest to do it. It's not going to be based on game a fight  and memes and like people watching Tucker Carlson or like Josh Hawley doing like a town hall meeting. It's gonna happen because capitalism is in a dire enough crisis point and it mayn't if you the thing is is the reason. I think it's meaningless is that if we get to the point of that deep of a crisis I don't think capitalism is going to be interested enough in maintaining the the the need for the need for a a mask of consent to matter it'll just rule directly. The whole ask we'll drop and then that's what I'm talking about.

I'm talking about like a direct military dictatorship or some sort of like civil. Some sort of like corporate like basically like a Masai legged. The question is like will the US military like nationalized Amazon or does Amazon by the US military whichever way the mechanism goes the same result. The result is the same profit extraction of the barrel of a gun by a corporate military dictatorship and that's gonna be the trick that's going to be the abbey of abolition of politics and that means that all these like left-right distinctions mean nothing so. That's why I don't think that's the thing Singapore is a good example. Yes Singapore is a very good example that's per Singapore's perfect example love love that love.

They love the viewers real politics is gonna start and that's the thing to be excited about. It's the thing to be scared up too because nobody knows what to do it. We aren't as far along frankly as I thought we needed to be. That's just the fact I thought the whole point of the Bernie thing was to get us on track to be in the best possible position for the crisis that was what I really thought being in the best with the best hand with the best organization the best mobilization to bet the best control of institutions when the moment came and now the moment is here too early. But I don't think it's necessarily fatally too early. It's just. It's it's. It's just. It's just a simple fact that it's not as far along as I would have liked or thought necessary that's it. But I don't know I was just guessing we're all just.

It's not I skepticism about mutual aid is that it has to scale up and I don't know how it does scaling up is the key because it's like people say well. We can use mutual aid to get a critical mass of people. But you're still talking about uncoordinated activity by people spontaneously and hoping. It accumulates to something and historically that hasn't worked in this country. I don't know where it has honestly but a sure  hasn't worked here. You guys know that Lundrigan was established under Franco right hard to imagine that it could be a real threat to capitalism or an alternative to it if it was allowed to exist under Franco.


So now my good news for the day is guys. You don't have to worry about presidential politics anymore. That's my take away so you gotta have a take away if his name feel like bad feeling owned hate-filled and honestly more than anything don't you feel owned. Don't you feel like all those globe emoji. Like gloating right now and that they're posting memes at you. They're posting the gun at dancing funeral guy means that you they're doing it. You know they're doing it right. Now. We're all taking a break from having the goddamn Ghana me and God given to us by  globe emojis and never Bernie housewife's. It's happening and that sucks but at least you don't have to care from now on and you can watch the amazing amazing transcendently great.

I really hope we get him I the main thing that reason. I want them to be an election in november is because I want them to be debates. I need two dates and I want a bunch of debates and I don't want just want three debates and I want them all be different. I want like five or six debates and they all have to have different like obstacles like in the five obstructions like there'd be a debate where where they get all their medication taken from them and they can't take their medication for the 24 hours. Before. Then they do one where they get double the regular medication they do one. If they do one like standing in a pool of water and of course we would be the sons debate instead of the VP debate obviously and that would be so much fun and you know what I mean I watched those debates with Bernie with my heart my chest screaming thundering. I'm gonna take Chinese research chemicals and like  air conditioning freon and I'm going to watch those debates and just make my brain turn like gets peel it like a potato and just let the raw  cortex oh one where they swap medications that's great. See you guys they're all coming up with great ideas. Too look. We're collaborating right now guys. I love it. I love you guys oh yeah. We will definitely be streaming. Those debates. Those I hope I honestly will break quarantine if it's we're still in quarantine and we're not dead. I won't break quarantine to go with my homies and watch those debates while my brain is just being annihilated by high-level hallucinogens in large doses yeah.

I'll take the Hydra chlorine. I know I 100 versus Eric and Don jr. They should be able to tag team and they'll still both get annihilated. I want it because that's the perfect way to just show how superior he is to that is. If he's better. He could be both of them with one hand tied behind his back and the other hand smoking crack. What would I say if Matt Iglesias was here oh boy redacted redacted parody. Parody redacted parody. The one thing I like about Matt Iglesias and this is an honest fact is that I obviously have a deep strong powerful hatred in my heart for very many people at DC specifically the media class scumbags. Most specifically the media connect scumbags I grew up watching and like observing from the sidelines during the blog era like Klein Iglesias. These guys. This is these little Craven little worms who just went from supporting the Iraq war to to just becoming these just how old man is hollow stuff meant and so I abused them all a lot on the internet but the thing like Josh barro guys like that. But the thing is I don't know to what degree. They care like like Josh. Barro blopps me as I've said I know you see me. But I don't know what his attitude is like Eli Lake of course.

Obviously people make fun of him because of his way. He's like oh the trolls lol oh you guys. I love your passion oh. I love your passion and you can kind of like be like oh. I bet you really are annoyed by this but honestly I don't know if he is. I don't know if he like actually cares. He might he might honestly think it's all funny cuz. He's one of these guys who just doesn't give a  about himself and that's why I know that that he has seen everything I've ever said about him and that he hates me and that makes me feel good. I'm glad. He hates me. I'm glad I elicits that feeling for him and I know he can say it's not true. But I'll never believe him I mean. Maybe that's difference doesn't matter that but honestly I just I like I'm a little bit and so I have about kind of a I have sort of a fondness for him. Just my version of the fact that I know I've got to it from hell's heart. I stab at thee for hates sake I Spit my last breath at thee.

Uh some guy. There's this guy on Twitter who just started a new account. And I think it's called iglesias takes and this guy is going around and he's finding old doc tweets that people have done about the Glacia. Slyke jokes at his expense and stuff like that uh and so he's been like retweeting a bunch of my old tweets about him that I've totally forgotten about and I just wanted to read some cuz cuz. They're pretty good. I'm not gonna. Lie I think so we said yeah. Man I do that not a lot of these that are that good. I'm still looking for the good one I guess. This is this was what I did in like 2015 that I thought was just very. It wasn't really a joke.

It's just an observation that it's a hundred percent true. Man. Iglesias is haunted by the knowledge that there are one a hundred thousand wonkish. Ivy grads with his exact voice and skill set and that I think is the reason that he has got a chip on his shoulder and hotend so hostile is because he is aware of the fact that he is a  mediocrity and that he is 100%. A case of nepotism. His dad went to Harvard and then he went to Harvard. It's that simple like that that explains 99% of his success and he knows it and it haunts him that he's an interchangeable that he's literally another just another egg. In Washington for Christmas Matt Iglesias God has made a coupon book good for hundreds of dollars of savings at her favorite local restaurants. I forgot my balance I thought I was pretty good somewhere in suburban Virginia Matt Iglesias is browbeating an Applebee's waitress into accepting an expired Chili's Groupon. One time I would absolutely ham on him and and borrow because they were joking about how Brown was a lesser IV because they both went to Harvard but both of them were legacies in fact barrows. Dad was like in the Harvard economics department when he was going there like think 1,000,000% nepotism cases and these ways are chortling about how Brown is a lesser ivy and I just lost it. I was like you are such sniveling scumbags you little  honest than whatever this concern trolli like civil society. If actual work was and value like was the right like your if your monetary of your job related to your competence you'd be. Lucky like you were interchangeable. Cog Merrill black me for that it has not unblocked me a sense. Lacy has blocked me for a little bit. But then I think people made fun of him for it and like root said hey what the hell don't you like you know ideas and then like as a show of generosity. He got black me which I love because it means he's seen it. He's see that everything I've ever said about one of them. I really like was this is based on that movie. The box with Cameron Diaz have anyone seen and it's a guy oh. I'm almost all right all right well. I guess making fun of Iglesias will be the end of this but the last joke was the guy from that movie. The box goes to Iglesias press this button and he will get a million dollars but someone somewhere that you don't know will duck and then he just presses a button and he goes wow that was really fast.


All right guys I gotta go tot it. The clock is up so listen. I hope you feel better about a bad day and ready to do whatever needs to be done as the conditions change and as as we realized what's happening around us and resolved to do what's necessary to liberate the human race whether it's shackles of oppression. Let's do it. Let's get that bread guys let's get that bread. I'll buy.
