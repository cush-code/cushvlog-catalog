Hi Lana uh probably not gonna stay on too long a night probably not gonna do the whole hour. I would do some other stuff and I'm honestly not feeling that good today. Yesterday felt better today. Not so good isn't that the way of the worlds during the quarantine feeling all right. It feels like you can take everything on. You're feeling like you could take on the black of chance and then you wake up the next day and you're like oh right. This is all still this situation and nothing's gonna change for the foreseeable future and you start wondering how are you.

Gonna make it so today's that day not feeling great guys but whatever happy to take questions to avoid feeling thinking about how I feel favorite Attitude Era wrestler. Uh I actually watched I don't watch it anymore. I'm not one of those  people who watches wrestling from the Johnny is good tweet. Here's welcome to Twitter. Here's a copy of a communist manifesto and also a season pass to what WrestleMania I'm not one of those people. But I did watch it the Attitude Era and uh yes stone cold I mean the guy knew his weight the guy if you want to give a noxious about it. I'm honestly surprised that there hasn't been like a painfully cringe-inducing jacket. An article about how like Steven Steve Stone Cold Steve Austin's like a model for workers because of how confrontational he was towards his boss you know like you should be willing to go into the Stone Cold Stunner your boss and that you will be able to do that under socialism or something. I think that was pretty good. But I liked uh mankind - and the rock was really good like if you saw him wrestle. It's not very surprising that he became a huge star. It was very very charismatic. My all-time favorite wrestler is from what the old WWF superstars days Rowdy Roddy Piper. None will defeat him in my heart doesn't hurt that he also starred in the John Carpenter classic. They live also the less classic but still pretty fun hell comes to Frogtown.


R.i.p to rowdy roddy piper a true king but the thing is all right that's actually an interesting question the question about  revisionism because like when does the revisionism stop because as many have pointed out like if you are a Soviet apologist like basically for the Soviet Union post the death of Stalin. Then you're a revisionist and honestly if you want to get really buck wild with it. Social is the one in one country was also revisionism from what the Bolsheviks thought when they actually seized power so where the hell are you supposed to go back to the find. The non revisionist. Pen was was pretty significant revision so where the hell is this pure. Marxism supposed to be that you're revising from the book itself the books. The works themselves sorry that doesn't that doesn't cut it cuz that's just uh now you're literally talking like Bible. I'm talking about like now you're you're like a fundamentalist for the for like what Capitol pretty dumb.

So yeah. I don't think that word means anyway that's actually an interesting question. The Steep from I understand the consensus among Paulista political scientists is that he would have won without parole because parole would have table took more from Republicans than from him and I think there's probably something to that. But who knows I don't know red pill. That's another thing. I don't know what that is either. I don't know racists is that what red pill means misogynist. Only the Coen brothers don't get enough flak for how many duds they have. They have basically like one dud and that's even that one you could argue about idiot well. I mean obviously every term has value from like an epistemological perspective but I mean in practical terms. I don't know what anyone means when they say you're revisionist oh oh okay so it's anti-semitic. No no that's dumb anything that tries to claim that there's some sort of class other than capitalists. Running things is stupid just. It's not like its Jews that run.


Culver's is doing a menu items. Like what poutine I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Poutine I got the cheese curds already. I don't think it's gonna be worn for VP just because like I obviously she did her job for the party and she helped me cap Bernie and you know she's looking for something for that. But I mean I don't think they trust her just because they've had trouble with her in the past. Like a lot of reasons that like a lot of reasons that people who should have known better sort of gave Warren the benefit of the doubt. I mean it. Some of it was cynical. But I honestly feel someone who was earnest is because of her antagonistic position towards Obama during the bailouts and I feel like that's not gonna be forgotten. Not when you have options and not what you don't have to give it to her. I mean what's her. What's her what's her leverage right now. She's already endorsed Warren. She has no leverage so. I'd say it's probably somebody that they have there's been like they're more confident of like warlike Harris. Possibly I guess maybe it comes down to how scared they are Bernie people sitting out although the idea of them trying to mollify Bernie people by giving it to.


Hilarious I'm gonna have an uber inebriated past hopefully within two weeks about Upton Sinclair 1934. I like that Whitmer is trying for it by like turning Michigan into a police state. I think that's pretty funny like notice me senpai kind of  you guys ever notice that when you if you want to see something I'm Netflix or whatever it's not there and then when you do want to see it it or what you don't want to see it. It is it's really amazing shut up cold war movies well. I've said that if you're doing a cold war project you should show two movies back to back to illustrate where the two countries the two main protagonists of the Cold War psychologically and were after it so you watch to show America you watch. Kelly's heroes bunch of dudes going on a fun adventure in Europe where they come back with a bunch of gold and come and see where the Dirlewanger Brigade does. Genocide and the village of Belarus and some poor kid has to like live with the memory of seeing it.

I hope I'm honest least as entertaining as a stupid cat well doctor. I mean obviously doctor  know man Bobby.

Kennedy is very interesting to me because the forensics of that case are very odd and also the the history of Sirhan Sirhan is very interesting as well. He literally was treated for a for a head injury that he suffered falling from a horse because he was a jockey at a hospital that was received again scale MKULTRA funding and then you look at the automatic writing in his diary which is very much different than like something from say Arthur Bremer or some other mentally ill assassin where it's like you know instead of it being disordered thinking it's not thinking at all. It's just like reciting words over and over again almost like trigger words and then you have the fact that you know stippling to the back of the head and the claim that the fight shot was fired from in front Haney Jean Caesar and his 22 caliber Iver Johnson pistol that uh that he claimed he sold before the assassination and then when they finally found Doug found the guy he sold it to who had a receipt for after the assassination very interesting but anything like that I've kind of decided that knowing the doing yes or no is sort of pointless because it doesn't change anything and it doesn't even necessarily change your analysis of like political actors. Now there's no way to know so I just gotta do shrug emojis I do like reading about it and stuff like that and I was find it very interesting might do a Southland Tales episode. I was thinking of that it might be good.


I don't know man doing something about the Whitlam government in Australia. I mean it's Australia for God's sakes how seriously should anyone take anything what happens. They're not a real country at all. I haven't actually found any really great books about typing. I found a recent book that I read that was okay but it was like for the point of view of like American diplomat or from a diplomatic history because his beat his thesis basically was one that the Taiping rebellion failed because Western powers after arguing which one to pick sided with the king the Qing Dynasty - that they should not have done that and that the Taiping were better than the king and that's interesting but it doesn't really give you. The whole thing in. It definitely focus to something like this last half and it's not really for the point of view of you know the people within it. So it's hard and then there's a couple. Others I've read that kind of focus. A little bit too much on like the specifics of the theology which is kind of boring. So I have not heard of anything great yeah. It's a fascinating topic and a wildly under studied and under written about and under note about considering that it killed like thirty. Yes well thank you I asked about the natural law party and a number of people let me know that it was all about like TM like Transcendental Meditation and like westernized Hindu  grand remonstrance from Parliament.


John little burn  pike pike and uh ya ain't feelin England perfect ah the Covenanters. The Scottish Covenanters tumbledown dick Cromwell come on if the southern one is Civil War the CSA would have joined the axis that very theory is postulated in the Harry Turtledove. How if you remain books which partially southland Civil War the US and the South being engaged in World War one the the the the treaty system that went under World War one with the u.s. being part of the the triple I believe on top of a no-no Triple Alliance. It's so pressuring they're both its turbulent on the Triple Alliance but the triple alliance with Germany and those guys austria-hungary and the and the Confederacy joining with England and France because those are the guys who gave them their independence and so there's trench warfare in the u.s. like long Virginia.

It's like the Somme and the US and Germany austria-hungary and the Ottomans win. In this version they impose an auto respond England and France in the US and so then a Hitler like figure emerges in interwar. America socialists rise to power in the US and world war. Two happens with the axis with with the CSA being in the axis but in this one instead of the axis being Germany in Italy in Japan. The axis is the Confederacy France and England because they were the ones who lost the theory being that that's what led to fascism was basically losing World War. Two we're losing World War one in Germany anyway. Italy it's a little more complicated anyway so yes that's a long way around to say this. CSA would definitely have better the axis and subversion of the axis. If there had been a World War.


Two alright I got a few more minutes here shut up. It's cool there's like 11 books and I read them all although not really because the thing about Turtledove is that he's very repetitious so you can kind of like skim. I basically skimmed them for plot developments. Baseball is of course the best American sport come on I actually know in the books its president. Uh Eugene Debs never becomes president sadly but it's like Upton Sinclair now nuts. Upton. Sinclair Sinclair Lewis is the first socialist president of the United States and then like one of the will Follett's and then Al Smith is the socialist president when the war starts. Chomsky is an old man who believes in parties. Phoner is good. Fun is pretty good. What's your name who's your daddy is here is like look.

I did not prefer I like red wine. I got I accidentally bought a bottle of white wine. Cuz. I wasn't looking so I'm stuck with it. I would prefer a red any any port in a storm. Get it of course. You know to speak of these of course to speak of these Instagram life deep performance of an ego transcending itself into language. Of course. We see we see within this the the the the failed recapitulation of the self expressed through the commodity. Merlot is good if it's bold and I like a big bold wine and a big sassy wine. I don't understand why everyone wants me to wear a different jacket. Do you guys not wear the same jacket every day like you guys have 50 well winter jackets. Oh. Someone says I look unhealthy that's not good in what way like I'm gonna die. I don't have the road. I don't think are there any doctors in the chat. If they could like remote diagnosed me with anything and I okay am I gonna die oh god oh boy oh man.


That's I would really like to read something where Protestantism doesn't exist because man it's it's very easy to blame Protestantism for a lot of bad. There's no question about that but at the same time it seems like the like you know those forces are not like the forces that create Protestantism are not are not ideological or spiritual. They are material you know like the emergence of capitalism well. I think would have happened in the absence of Protestant system so it would have been interesting to see how how Catholicism could have absorbed that kind of disruption to its traditional relationship to like the land and to labor. It's interesting. I have no idea you could argue maybe that the Protestant that the Reformation would have had to have happened maybe not then and there but with eventually maybe it happened differently. Maybe it would have been more peaceful or more violent but I think it would have been inevitable because if capitalism is going to come when modernity is going to come and you can't really have Western modernity without Protestantism. You know it's like the it's the it's the 11th urban spice and I would really like to talk about how by the time Protestantism gets the United States it's not even Christianity anymore. It is legitimately not Christianity.

It is a pagan like cult of like a quiz acquisitiveness. It's literally a material cult. It is Moloch worship. I mean it is. It's it's the great stone owl. It's it's Mammon. It's everything it's everything evil and then that's the ultimate expression of American Protestantism is of course Mormonism which at this point is essentially just a marquee market multi-level marketing scheme. They have the highest participation of multi-level marketing schemes in the world. Utah. All they do is go to each other's giant unfinished basements and sit around with all their children who have 15 wise in their name and exchange and sell each other different MLM products like it's a part. It's like a barter economy but exchanging uh like yoga pants and Tupperware and sex toys and that's not that's that's what Christianity is or. That's what American Christianity is because it fuses with capital at some point and it fuses with capital at the point of diffuses with capital. At the point. The acquisition of the United States that is boundless it is material.

It is a pee really causative ability beyond bound as in an entire continent that could be swallowed up by anyone who will take it that is a that demands. Its own religion totally done Lord from the from the the bombs like the socially bonded nature of European Christianity. It's just not. It's like it reaches an escape velocity and pull off because it has to accommodate the speed. Catholicism couldn't accommodate the speed and even European Christian Protestantism couldn't new religion needed to be created a new religion needed to be created that would be a cult of the individual a cult of the cult of the individual and specifically the cult of the the enrichment of the individual. That's why this Felix Gilman's books are so good the way they talk about like. It's it's kind of steampunky. But it's it sees the the development of like the West.

As like basically the merit of the human psyche being like turned into material reality like mature like literally the earth being brought into the mind. The space created by the people who colonized America Islam honestly maybe who knows alright guys. I gotta get off I think this is Beth Beth. This is a bit okay. I think I'll feel better tomorrow so oh there yes so. I'll see you guys soon buh-bye.
