Okay this is not ideal but I don't know what else I'm gonna do. I've been trying to find a good winter spot to do the streams and when I was trying. I guess doesn't work. I couldn't get the enough signal so I guess. I'm gonna have to do it in here for now. I don't really like this angle terribly much but we'll figure it out. I'll figure something out patience please ah. I don't know sorry I should have done more research before. I started this but what are you gonna do what are you gonna do. I don't want to be a cam boy. I don't want to cam it up. I don't want people seeing my groin. I'm trying to be loved for my mind not for my my eroticism.

This isn't the living room anymore. I didn't like that. I didn't like that. I don't want that trying to figure out a new space for the winner. I'll find something but for now this is good enough. All right quality is killer oh good. I thought you were saying a killer and I was gonna have to jump out of a window. I'm not going to do a jeffrey tube out.

You don't have to worry about that happening. Okay um. So it's been a while. It's been a while since I've been talking to you. It's been a while since. I've been doing stuff here. I don't what does combing your beard mean. I don't even know how that would work. I do have to trim it. I will. I will trim it.

I don't have a theory on the nashville bomber because how I don't have any more information than anybody else. Does and theorizing in. The absence of information is just giving yourself mental illness and I'm trying to prevent that I've done that enough in my life. I will say that the story as given seems really implausible and now we find out that the police had known about this for a year that his girlfriend said he was building bombs and they put her in the mental hospital because of it and amazingly people are taking this as an opportunity to say we need to talk about white terrorism and this is terrorism and they should have put this guy on a watch list. As though that was the issue and not the fact that the government has all of these dudes on string apparently that they can pluck at any time. The thing I can't get over and once again. I have no knowledge or information. I don't know what's going on. I can't say definitively one way or the other what the deal is here. But if you were the government or some faction within the government and you had cause to blow up a data center and the 5g whatever the hell they did and you want it to look like a nut.

The nsa's access to the information of essentially every american is such that you could build a profile of a plausible suspect and then just find one go through social media. Chatter go through posts go through personal information until you found someone who could be realistically sold as a perpetrator and then at that point it's trivially easy. I mean apparently they're just they identify this guy from some dna. For all we know somebody showed up at his house. One day stuck them with a syringe full of cyanide stuck him in the van and then blew him up or hell. Maybe they didn't even bother doing that maybe they dug a hole and put them in it and just put some of his like scraped skin cells onto a article of clothing and the that's just a terrifying reality is that the one thing that kind of pushes against the claims that a lot of these terror attacks are false. Flags or you know provo provoked by the government is that well a lot of these guys they are. They do have screw they do have histories of making posts that are erratic or paranoid. The thing is there are millions of people that that is true of there are millions of people who could possibly be framed as a domestic terrorist from their just from their social media posts alone and if you could do that you have you have if you can find someone and you can pluck them you've got a yes. I am jacking off what else do you want me to do you asked somebody asked me about the goddamn thing. I don't know any more than you do why why would you ask me. What do you want out of it. Literally all you can do is ask questions.

There's nothing else except what I should say we should really talk about white terrorism as though the coming austerity nightmare of the biden administration is not going to be a perfect opportunity to take the totalizing surveillance and police coercive apparatus that was put for use and has been put for use against minorities in this country. From time immemorial to now apply it to white people too and and ha. And we have a and this is not going to provide a ready-made narrative to justify that it's it's just. It's a scary time that's all I know and when like this happens seeing people just pay for more surveillance and pay for a more hysterical media. Response to justify further you know a more what a more just distribution of police crackdown and calling that justice. I mean people have been saying that that's the trajectory for years that privileged discourse leads to an argument that boils down to It's not you're not really going to realistically get the state to stop killing minorities when they're disproportionately economically disadvantaged but you could get to a place where we're killing more white people and then you've lost the element of discrimination and if that's the problem then you've solved it. And if we're looking down the barrel of you know a nightmare austerity realignment of politics and the economy of further immigration of everyone. A further dissolving of all labor relations that are not last-minute just-in-time gig economy survival that the idea of having security in work is becomes as much a a relic of the past. It's like a pension that's going to have consequences people are going to be pissed about it. People are going to react violently one way or the other and are we going to allow. I mean. We are going to allow there's no question about that. But we are going to watch as as all of the language of diversity and justice. Social justice are used to justify the police doing what they've always done just more egalitarian a more egalitarian distribution of violence and repression. I mean look at the thing with the two thousand dollar checks why is all the elite against this.

[08:27](https://youtu.be/1njyVS_dc1Q?t=08m27s)

They know the deficit is not real. They know that the money could be spent. They we've already dropped way more money than that at the top of the income level. Just since the coven thing happened we could do it again. It's just numbers on a piece of paper and it would stimulate consumer spending which is the literal lifeblood the literal organ of our economy. But it would also give people a little more leverage against their maximally. Precarious employment people would maybe be less likely to take these jobs and the conditions that these companies are willing to offer and that is the business model the business model of our our consumer economy. Involves paying people the minimum amount with no benefits maximum flexibility and the one thing that stops people from taking those jobs is if they don't have to take them and even a little bit of breathing room and certainly if it's established as a precedent and and becomes something that could be politically activated through pressure on elected officials it changes the coercive mechanism. It makes it harder to get people to do these jobs and so precarity is one stick.

The other stick is our total surveillance police state and they're working hand in hand to ensure that the economy in the aftermath of covid is maximally coercive and maximally exploitative to to workers and yes that is also someone says here that's why they will. We will not provide houses for homeless people because if being homeless is a condition that does not leave you in total abjection if you are not if if being homeless if losing your ability to pay your rent does not mean well you're gonna sleep in the streets you're gonna sleep under of your overpass. There's gonna be spikes on every flat surface to prevent you from doing anything other than lying in a gutter and then the cops gonna come and beat your. Jobs because that is the worst thing that could happen to anyone in this country is to become homeless. That is the nightmare that is when you are no longer a citizen. That is when you become a homo saussure from a gambin and and that is that is a fate worse than death and it is the fear buried within the mind of anybody who does not have control over anything other than their ability to work and that's most people in this country and if that goes away if that's less terrifying if the hey you know. I might not be able to rent my apartment anymore but there's social housing.

I might be able to get well. Grocery store company that says you have to work in a covered hot spot getting coughed getting your mouth coughed in for no benefits. Like these are all choices and they're all pushed and they're all choices that are made on the same terms and to create the same situation which is people who are cowed politically and also economically cowed by their employer cowed by the political class at every steps. And that's why they're trying to get us to a vaccine herd immunity situation before they have to start shelling out real money.

They have to avoid that at all kinds at all at all costs and that is the beauty of eternal chancellor mitch. Mcconnell's position here you've got a deal where basically everybody says give people money democrats and republicans even in congress and the president and the guy who's supposed to be coming in in january. At least has said his mouth the words that he wants it but because of the distribution of veto points within our system. This one guy mitch mcconnell who is answers to nobody and has no cannot be checked by by public pressure gets to say no and then everybody gets to act like he's the reason it's not happening and he's fine with that. He doesn't care. He doesn't care about being popular. He has the state of kentucky wire. He doesn't it doesn't matter the same way. Harry reid had nevada wired these guys those guys in those positions who are essentially the prime ministers like that's.

The thing to know is that we are supposed to have this weird presidential system where the head of state and head of government are the same person but on the domestic level anyway at them and at the level of domestic policy. Over the last 20 years we are now in a situ. We have created a situation where the senate majority leader is effectively the prime minister and the president is effectively a constitutional monarch or figurehead elected president in a parliamentary system and so mitch mcconnell is the actual head of government. But he is not in charge of some you know electoral coalition that is that has to rise or fall. Everybody gets to run individually purdue and lafleur get to run on yes. We're in favor of the the two thousand dollar checks even though the guy in their party who they elected to be majority. Leader is opposing it and of course. The only reason they say they're for. The checks is because they know he's there. It's the same reason. Biden says he's for the checks because he knows mitch.

Mcconnell's there if mitch. Mcconnell wasn't there in this situation and there was like a real like like public accountability for a decision like whether or not to give people money in a time. Like this. Then then it would be much more difficult to avoid it. But here it's the perfect structure to prevent anyone from being accountable for the decision to let people starve and and there's no and it's and the constitution essentially exists to make this happen and a constitutional order will only provo promote procreate situations like this because that's the point of it. That's why it was conceived and at every level it's been modified and changed both without through constitutional amendments and then through in within through. The the evolution of like internal senate rules has created a situation where there can be no one responsible or the person who's responsible gets to take all the blame gets to eat.

[15:20](https://youtu.be/1njyVS_dc1Q?t=15m20s)

All the sin gets to put all of the hatred into his neck. Waddle and everyone else gets to wash their hands of the thing. It's very. It's it's it's ingenious and it's why the constitution needed to die after the civil war and the fact that it didn't is. One of is is like the signal political failure of the american project and I keep going back to that and that brings us to brings us back anyway to the republic for which it stands which I read the rest of chapter of part one fourth of the fourth through eighth chapters where we really get into some good stuff with this with in these parts that we can really sink our teeth and teeth into when talking about the way that elites structured the political response to the civil war in such a way to prevent democracy essentially from taking place and one of my one of the most interesting parts of the of this section. I think is in the first chapter gilded liberals which talks about the hegemonic ruling the hegemonic ideological domination of liberalism.

19th century liberalism which in its particulars like in in its policy proposals like hard money la zai faire is what we would consider republicanism nowadays conservativism. But the personnel who make it up class wise are the same people now who are progressives who are liberals in the in the 21st century sense and we and we we talk about how like oh that's like these terms have changed meaning but the liberal social position has not changed since the civil war. Like liberals then are the same people who are now opinion makers writers professionals. Professors theoreticians the people who create the ideological framework that goes around that packs just the machinery of capitalist accumulation and in the 19th century that their arrest after the civil war the recipe was laissez faire gold standard all that stuff then after the gilded age. After this book concludes you get the rise of the progressive movement where it's the same people maybe not the same actual people but people in the same position who have recognized by that point that their dream of creating this small holder democracy where freedom is freedom of contract alone is no longer viable. Given the fact that oh freedom of contract alone has led to the mass accumulation of power by these unaccountable robber barons and huge immigration of workers and regular people and the death of the smallholder well. Then we have to adjust because what's important to note is even in the lozai fair. Mid-19th century. They never.

There was never any um belief by anyone that that that meant real laws unfair because that's not a real thing government intervention is dif. It's it's inextricable from economics like the government makes the context where all economic activity takes place. So government intervention is non-negotiable. It's all about degree and at every point what what liberals who then became progressives Demand is a the degree of government intervention that will maintain the stability of capitalism and that changes as conditions change right. After the civil war they thought gold standard. No government intervention is enough of course railroad subsidies are fine that's in fact necessary. I mean we might be a little annoyed by 

You know these guys getting this but you know well. We gotta we gotta put this money somewhere and we just can't give it to people that's the main thing is that is that the the the imperative of like a a ideological ruling political ruling class is to ensure that economic decisions are made by those who hold capital and those who hold capital are those who are at the at the top. Essentially the though that it is concentrated in the hands of those who can be trusted with it white talks about how the fixation on the home and the ability to make a home which of course is just a a filigreed and and romantically infused mystification of the ability to you know control capital at that point after the homestead act. The the thought was that all the capital anyone would need to sustain that home is a little bit of land and so people should seek that and that like the exploitation of wage slave wage.

Relationships which were now taking over from slavery after the end of the civil war were temporary but of course the maddening thing is the refusal to extend that logic to the recently freed slaves to extend the logic of oh you know a home requires a capital in the form of land in the form of the ability to reproduce one itself. Then former slaves need that they need the land and there's no argument. You can make that they don't that they didn't work for it because they literally worked for nothing their entire lives but that would be government intervention in the market and we can't have that um and what that boils down to. I think more more specifically than more than racism and of course racism is hugely important but because of racism but also because of the the reality of sectionalism after the war. Like the the domination of the south. By the north former slaves were just not considered to be part of the citizenry and all of these ideas about home and all that they only applied to citizens and of course that's not sustainable because people who these people.

The the gilded liberals considered citizens are considered to be like uns fit for citizenship. Former slaves urban catholics native americans. We're still there we're still part of the american project and over time we're going to assert their rights as such And it's that failure to recognize that that really defines the relationship between like a political ruling class and the the people who are subject to that political rule is that there has to be the maintenance of a sort of a choke point where where people are turned into citizen or not and that and that is necessary and in fact vital to maintaining the divisions within the social order that allow exploitation to accumulate and allow and allow capitalists to literally set people against each other to avoid them coming together to assert a broad right to capital to to the fruits of their labor. But the thing I wanted to talk about is specifically the the the establishment of the gold standard after the civil war because during the civil war the account the the union paid for the war by printing money just printing some money. That's that's what they did and that's what they had to do. And they they they put out a bunch of bonds and they and they back those bonds with greenbacks after the civil war. Though there was an insistence by the republican ruling party which was dominated by ex-wig merchants to reduce the amount of money in circulation and get the money that was in circulation over time to be backed not by the cred credit of the government not by fiat which is what we have now and which they were terrified of having with gold and I want to see if I can find the part and there was a bunch of arguments for why that was necessary why we needed gold and a lot of it was was put in moral terms. It's it's not moral to to to back exchange with just force with just the promise of government you needed real value. You needed. Real intrinsic value of course gold does not have intrinsic value.

[25:54](https://youtu.be/1njyVS_dc1Q?t=25m54s)

You can't eat it. You can't do anything with it that sustains your life which is what value is. All you can do is melt it down and use it as an exchange. That's the value is that it is something that is durable and can hold its value. That's it it's not. It is not intrinsically valuable. The idea of intrinsic value in gold is pure ideology. It's pure mysticism it has. It does not reflect any reality It is just something that liberals told themselves and told other people as a way to increase the power of finance capital at the expense of regular americans. That's it and there's two things about the gold standard that I wanted to talk about one is that having a gold standard okay so it going to the gold standard gave a huge windfall to the people who held government bonds. I'll read this part from 185.

 the government had not specified how the wartime bonds principle would be repaid since at the height of inflation. In 1864 a greenback dollar had been worth only 34 percent of a gold dollar redeeming the gold. The bond in gold represented as much as a tripling of the original investment in addition to the interest. Already paid bondholders would reap a wonderful windfall if the government paid in gold taxpayers would assume an additional burden. If however the government redeemed its bonds with greenbacks. There would be no windfall and so the redemption of government bonds in gold gave people free money if they held the bonds which was the richest americans which was the the financial institutions and even though the need for gold was supposed to stop the horrors of fiat currency.

Somehow even though now we are at the end nightmare state that these mid 19th century liberals would have hated of of fiat currency. We have a similar situation now where bankers are able to insure money through the discount window at the fed which allows them to borrow at a lower rate than they lend out and keep the difference and it's the same people in charge. It's the same institutions that made money off the gold standard when it was introduced and now are able to ensure profits no matter what conditions if economic what economic conditions obtain through in in this era of fiat money and now very few people want to go back to the gold standard but but the the moralistic language about debt is still there.

 but the most interesting part about the the gold standard. Is and the real reason that it was pushed for beyond the need you know to to provide a windfall for bankers and the only really like non-ideological and non-self-interested argument. For it is the fact that the british were on the gold standard and they were the biggest economy in the world at that time and trade with with the uk was vital to america's economic fortunes and they could essentially punish those who did not use the gold standards. So from 187 here with the gold with the gold standard. The united states would in effect seed control of its interest rates and money supply to great britain the world's largest creditor nation. The gold standard depended on a country having access to enough gold to redeem its currency on demand when london controlled a large portion of that gold great britain and the bank of england acquired inordinate influence over the fiscal and economic policies of other governments.

The gold standard created what economists have called a golden straight jacket debtor nations would exchange control over their monetary policy for capital mobility and stable exchange rates. Although the cost of borrowing abroad would fall the united states would lose the ability to drive domestic interest rates below international interest rates. Gold dollars would flee abroad if interest rates elsewhere were higher now if that sounds familiar to anybody that's essentially every other debtor nation in the world's government's relation economic relationship to the united states. Now we cannot we have whoever is in charge. Whoever is the headquarters of global capitalism has a veto on the economic poli the fiduciary and like monetary policy of every country that depends on them for trade and in the 19th century the mid-19th century it was the uk that called the shots on that now in our in our fiat world. It's the united states or broadly the institutions that the united states basically controls and even though this current situation is a nightmare for the people who imagined that they were creating some stable system post-war and if you got him in his time machine and showed it to them.

[31:49](https://youtu.be/1njyVS_dc1Q?t=31m49s)

They might be horrified. Their descendants defend it with their lives because all that really matters is that the bankers the banks are in charge of money not people so that's interesting I also want to just say that the book has a lot of great pictures of 19th century. Political cartoons which really are great and it does feel like they got a lot worse over time. I think the reason people like ben garrison so much is that he is sort of almost one of the few political cartoonists who has like a 19th century verve to him. Part of that is labeling everything but I just wanted to point out this is probably my favorite thomas nast cartoon at least of the ones I've seen and it's in here. It's an anti-catholic ad as you can see. Here. There's crocodiles coming out of the river the american river ganges but if you look closer their crocodile mouths are actually miters because they're catholic bishops who are coming on shore to attack the children with their potpourri and I gotta say knowing now what we know about the catholic church.

 he nasa was a little prescient there but that's in there because nas talk because white talks about one of the signal. Conflicts of the era between protestants and catholicism which emerged over the fund the public funding of parochial schools and he stresses something that people especially people on the right who who fixate on the questions like of american secularism. Really miss is that we did not get secular public schools out of some drive of like godlessness. It's not like people just people at the top just decided actually We don't like god and we want to dethrone him. So we're going to take god out of schools.

What happened was is you had a situation after the civil war where you had huge catholic majorities in some urban cities and and a demand for catholic schooling that would and have catholic you know social teaching and biblical interpretation in it. And you had public schools which had bible study and and biblical instruction that was explicitly protestant and the catholic said that's not fair if we're we can't. I don't want to send. We don't want to send our kids there. But it's not fair to make us pay for parochial schools. When these these are public schools that are funded by public taxation and the the secular model for education essentially came out of a desire to to neutralize the conflict between those those two systems. Because the protestants did not want to pay for catholic schooling. It went against their their principles or whatever but they in the courts anyway were not able to consist to able to coherently argue that there should be some dual standard where protestantism is enshrined in public schools and if you want catholicism you're gonna have to go to a private school. The solution was let's just get god out of stool entirely and that was the reasonable compromise like what people are mad. At that. The compromises that come the secularism we created was an attempt to accommodate religiosity not the absence of religiosity and also by the way the way people talk about islam now is exactly the way that mainstream protestants talked about catholicism in the 19th century because these are just cycles.

[35:48](https://youtu.be/1njyVS_dc1Q?t=35m48s)

These are cycles of assimilation and anxiety that recur over time so other things from the section. We read as much as I have a very soft spot for us grant and I feel like he did some good stuff as president. The section on grant definitely underlines how he the job was too big for him because this was the moment. This era was when like what american political institutions were gonna look like came into being and he had no idea he had he was. He had no actual political convictions and you know that works at a time like say 1952 when eisenhower comes in there when we have like a solidified new post-war new deal consensus to operate off of but in the ferment of the post-war era grant was was not really the ideal guy but he did some good stuff. He was able to destroy the clan when he really tried to but the real hope of the republican elite at that time was that they could sort of let.

The south figure it out by itself and really only dropped the hammer when the redeemer violence got too outlandish for them to ignore too horrifying and too too bloody like after the colfax massacre in louisiana but it but republican orthodoxy essentially for swore. Any inner like consistent intervention on behalf of ex-slaves and if we're talking about counterfactuals and how things could have gone differently um. You essentially would have needed a different you would have needed a different political coalition than the one who ruled because who we ended up who ended up on top of the political. Heap. During this period was a republican party that was des divided large basically between orthodox liberals who were trying to create a lazar fair economic system that would have doomed the south black and white no matter what and the stalwarts who were basically who who were more populist but had as the flip side of populism a motivation of of corruption and they are really two sides of the same coin in that the the corruption of like the the democrats under tweed or the the um republican stalwarts. And the anti-corruption of the liberal republicans reformers were in both cases driven by economic incentive for the liberal republicans safely enmeshed in in in or near finance. Their drive for clean government and anti-democratic institutions was on behalf of the emerging merchant and capitalist elite. There was more populism to you know a guy like benjamin butler or or tweed but and and they spread their.

 . Their wealth more you know in the scent like tammany putting out patronage jobs and and giving money to the poor but they were similarly beholden to existing economic powers. They were just coming in the back door like the liberals were coming in the front door all nice and legal. The the stalwarts and the democrats were coming in the back door but everybody had a handout to the people who had accumulated all that capital after the civil war and and after the the emergence of the railroad-based economy the railroad speculative economy to come afterwards so any kind of counterfactual post-war post-work post-civil war america would have had would have had to have created a third a different force. A different coherent organized demand that went beyond the parochial demands of you know. Like this irish catholics in the city or or whatever and imagining that happening requires a lot of a lot of things falling differently and maybe it couldn't have happened.

I don't know but you know there always had to have been something else that could have happened because if not there's no point to anything. Now there was eventually an emerging force in the form of the labor movement and the populist movement but they came too late. They came after like the working class became a more coherent and larger and more effective self-conscious political actor and when and after you know the farmers of the west were able to sort of do a a smallholder version of working-class organization but by the time they ca emerged to resist capitalism. Capitalism has become a complete behemoth and really what you needed to change. The equation was the ex-slaves. The the the the integer that could have changed. The political equation of the post-war era was the political awareness mobilization and coordination of of the friedman people inc in alliance with smallholding whites and the urban working class that's the only way it would have worked and by the 1890s you know the the failure of reconstruction had ensured that the kind of connections that would have been necessary to build such an alliance were impossible so books good.

I'm enjoying it we're gonna talk next wednesday about let's do the first let's do the first four chapters of part four for next wednesday. This book I love when people ask the book how long what are you coming in because the republican household that was supposed to be the the modus operandi. The the the generative motive for creating you know the the the los zai faire gold standard wildly corrupt political structure that came after an economic structure that came after the civil war. It the people that it refused to recognize as as as republican subjects were the ones who needed to come together to oppose it and they were never never. It was never close to happening. What hath god drop rod is very good by daniel howe that's that's part of the same the oxford series of american history. Those are all I recommend all of those james. Mcpherson's paddle cry freedom is another.

One of those what's fun is that they all have the exact same font although I gotta say. I'm not a fan of the fact that they do footnotes which is another style thing for the oxford americans. I don't know why especially like they're not. There's never anything in the footnotes. I don't know why you wouldn't just go with endnotes but yeah. I'm gonna keep thinking about it keep thinking of a way that they could have clapped.

[44:50](https://youtu.be/1njyVS_dc1Q?t=44m50s)

They needed to just clap the the s the slave. They needed to overthrow like legitimately overthrow instead of just like mildly inconvenience the slave holding ruling class of the south and as I still think that it's interesting to think about how lincoln would have dealt in a second term because the republican notion that we're talking about the small holder republic with the lazar fair government where where it's it's unhealthy to spend too much time as a working-class person that it actually means it's kind of a bad sign. It's bad. It's a sign of bad character if you work for somebody else for too long because you should be working towards a homestead and a farm of your own lincoln embodied that like lincoln believed that because he was the perfect example of someone like that he grew up on a literal like log cabin poor kid drunk father and he worked himself up to becoming a railroad lawyer and then the president of the united states and he believed in it but you know the thing about. Lincoln is is that lincoln changed as conditions changed and that's not true of most of the people who have been president. Now most people have been president have not presided over such a period of ferment that that lincoln did but that's one of the reasons that he was so uniquely fit for the challenge of being president during the civil war and that is why the idea of him being present during reconstruction as much as it doesn't guarantee anything because he did he was well committed to a lot of these. Notions that ended up creating you know the black codes and jim crow and robert baron capitalism and a railroad. A corrupt railroad speculation based economy but he was also willing to adjust to changing conditions and the conditions of reconstructing the south would have been very fluid indeed so anyway.

It's interesting now one thing that I think is clear though in terms of what if is that if the federal government had more effectively and consistently applied the use of troops to the south they would have reduced the number one factor in the collapse of reconstruction governments which was a white supremacist terrorist violence where where the where the troops went where this cavalry came in. The clan was broken up and and freed people were safer it. It worked they could do it if it had been more universally applied and more consistently applied it would have and it would have had an effect. The thing is how do you establish a political will to maintain that investment because it costs money and those troops people who were pushing across to the west. Those troop those people they want.

They needed troops to protect them from those pesky indians who kept asserting rights to the land that they had always held. One thing that you would need for any kind of useful reconstruction would have been a huge slowing of westward expansion which of course has again cuts against the prerogatives of the the republic presiding republican orthodoxy including what lincoln embodied but another thing you see after the collapse of the economy following the panic of The panic of 1876 is that economic precarity exacerbated racial violence in the south and undermined reconstruction governments and that those collapse that that economic failure was caused by all the things that the republicans had um had created as the economic and structure of the post-war era speculative railroad investment as the engine for for economic expansion and then austerity and tight money.

In the aftermath of the collapse. 73 yes sorry. It's interesting to imagine you know a a loose money a greenback based american economy after the civil war what would having england have done because england had an ability even if you weren't on the gold standard to to discipline because of the need for trade all right so I've been talking so. I want to see if anybody asks any questions if anybody was asking any questions about the book. I will try to hit those but I've been talking. It's hard to talk and look at the chat at the same time yeah. That's the thing we have a greenback standard now and all the same ruling elites are in charge but that's because it came after all of the capital formations that the gold standard allowed in the late 19th century like everything all the changes gold standard. Then the the creation of the federal reserve that the suspension of convertibility of gold and then finally the final abolition of the gold standard were all done at not because of popular pressure not because of a working-class demand but out of the necessity to maintain the existing financial structure.

I don't know chief. I don't know anything about chief keef. He's a rapper who do you think I am why do you think. I know anything about rap good lord was the panic about national debt back then more sincere. I mean you can maybe argue. It was a little bit just because you know ma economic economics as a discipline was relatively new.

A lot of the stuff was theoretical but foundationally if they thought it was it would have been good for them they would have been fine with it. I mean that's the end of the end of the line. That's that's the end of it all if if they thought it was and the thing is that no matter how how horrified elites are of debt. They take it on as needed just in a way that never seems to increase economic democracy somebody's asking about the gilded liberals thinking that the republicans could just be supplanted is that like this socialist thinking the democrats could be supplanted. I guess in a way in that they're both the byproduct of insularity right. The gilded liberals the liberal republicans who nominated greeley and split off from the republicans they in tonight.

In 1872. They they assumed because of their totality of control over good opinion that they had some sort of purchase. Beyond you know writers and and professionals and it turns out no they didn't and in the same way like modern socialists. One of the main problems has been the fact that because political um thought is so constrained by the like bubble the epistemic bubbles that pop up in the broader you know social media sphere and how those are not connected really to to any anything concrete and and people who aren't opting to have those conversations. It gives people sort of a a a unrealistic expectation of what people want and and and how people are gonna respond. I still think that that the democratic party has to collapse that's for sure But it's not going to be because of any political formation that has made as. I have said that's that's coming that's going to come along through online any more than the liberal republicans were able to overthrow the stalwarts because a bunch of newspaper editors thought the gold standard was a good idea. All right. I gotta get off soon apologies for the technical issues. I'm figuring things out. I never know what to do on the internet what will be the tipping point for all right.

This is a good way to end it what will be the current tipping point for currently constructed capitalism. Do you have to acknowledge the real possibility that there will be no tipping point that that that it will things will get worse. Obviously and fewer and fewer people will be able to find any sort of livelihood under capitalism and more and more people are going to be kind of spit out and turned into on people outside of the borders of of civilized commerce but that the structures will maintain their integrity until the very end until it's you know until it's just a couple of underground amazon warehouses controlled by robots but if it does that the end of the petro dollar will probably would do it. I think the if if if the us if the dollar is no longer the reserve currency you'd have some that would cause a crisis that the system is not equipped to defeat. But for that very reason. It's unlikely to happen in the near future because the ruling elites of basically everywhere on earth depend on this current system and none of them have any alternative to it world systems analysis.

I'm a fan wallerstein. I'm a fan. I think it's it's it's a it's a very useful furtherance of It's essentially it takes like the the insights of the early marxists and like you know the leninist notion of imperialism and then extrapolates beyond that to the current system. The current reality that none of them could anticipate because it happened after they died all right. I'll see you folks later bye-bye. I hope that sounded okay. I'm I'm feel. I feel a little rusty. I feel like. I was stammering but I hope it was all lucid.
