Well if you'll notice I'm at a new angle. It's because our producer Chris finally brought over his telescopic articulated phone holder. So now we can do kind of more face to face as opposed to the weird downward angle. Let's sort of peel if we POV porn angle I was using but what this really means is that now it'll be much easier for me to do another grilling stream because the first time the reason I kind of decided. I don't want to do this anymore because it was too hard to pay attention to where the camera was keep it up and what's going on in the grill. But and yeah I drop it all the time too. So now I've got the fence over here. I'm gonna post it up on the fence. I get a nice bird's-eye view of my head and the grill and we can just go through a whole will do a little grill and chill so I'm coming sometime this week. So I was doing what I usually do not alone and I was thinking about the monitor and the Merrimack for those of you who don't know what that was.

It was the most famous naval battle of the Civil War which doesn't have a lot of great naval battles in it mostly running blockade running a like fleets running through like fort systems like New Orleans or Mobile damn. The torpedoes full steam ahead. There wasn't a lot of you know like broadside on broadside because the Union had such overwhelming naval superiority so what that meant was that the Confederacy kept trying to find technological. What work around force multipliers to make up for the fact that they had so fewer ships so many fewer ships and so they did very innovative things like they built a submarine. The CSS Hunley which was designed to be able to scho under water to a blockade ship attached a naval mine and then leave and blow up the ship and they tried it and they successfully blew up and sank a Union blockade ship but at the cost of the entire boat crew. So if those guys had had the if those Confederates had had the faith of like an Isis recruit. They might have actually been able to keep doing that if they've been able to found 12 guys ready to turn the crank and blow up in exchange for what I mean it was a good trade one. It was like 12 guys in a little metal turd blew up a ship and brought down what like 300 Yankee sailors and completely took out of commission a ship of line and so the other thing they did is. They experimented with putting metal iron on the sides of the ships so that the damn cannons would stop just staving in the planks of the wood and sinking the ships and what that led them to do was they when they seized I believe it was Newport News.

In Virginia. There was a u.s. Ship that was abandoned by the by the naval. It was abandoned by the US Navy as the the Confederacy came closer and it was called the USS Merrimack and what they did is. They covered it with slanting ironclad iron cladding that was designed to be able to absorb the blow of a artillery piece and then hopefully have it ricochet offered so the thing when it was a water. A boat looked like just sort of a trapezoid with guns poking out of it. There was you couldn't really were no crew members. It was all under behind and of course. This time US Navy ships and Confederate Navy ships all Navy ships kind of looked vaguely like Master and Commander open deck wooden sides and wouldn't keel or whatever and folk. Souls and such and gunnels all that's wood and then the masts and you know the cannons underneath the deck.

This is totally unlike that and so it rolled up. It steamed up to the mouth of the James River in Hampton Roads Virginia where there were a bunch of US ships. Observing the blockade of the southern ports and southern water lists keep them from getting selling cotton in the Europe and getting supplies and money and stuff from Europe or anywhere else. The ship rose up looking like this weird metal block floating in the water couldn't even see the crew it didn't even look like it was being manned by people and remember. This is a time when you know there wasn't a lot people didn't interact with the mechanical reality very often there was there was obviously there were obviously trains but train travel was still relatively rare. People mostly traveled by shanks mare or by horse so this ship rolls up and starts shooting at him blowing holes into these boats and they fire back but everything just glances off of them and they sink a ship and they they disabled another one on the shoal on the another one.

While trying to escape runs aground on a sandbar. They're out of ammo they're gonna come back. The next day. Fish are off sews imagine your crew on that boat her on that ship waiting a sitting duck to get annihilated by this monstrosity. This thing that cut looks like it's coming out of a different world and then the next morning can you imagine trying to sleep. The light comes up on Hampton Road and there's the Merrimack but then in between you and the Merrimack is this weird little floating teardrop plant-like thing. This metal I almost shaped with a little a little metal box on top of that much smaller than the metal box and much lower and closer to the waterline just poking out like the hump of a of a killer of a humpback whale or something and so now you gotta be thinking well.

What the is this where'd this thing come from. I mean you've already seen the Merrimack. Obviously the doors of perception are opening a little bit here now where more things are possible on this earth. Then you said thought maybe but now this thing what the is a cheese box well cheese used to come in boxes okay. They didn't have plastic packaging for things and you weren't just gonna have like you're not. Gonna just take cheese off the floor like off a shelf hold in your hand. So there came in a little box and add a little one little kid poop poking out a little slip and I'm sure you're holding your breath and then it moves out to meet the Merrimack and then it starts shooting at it and they spend the day just blasting. Cannon shells off of one another in a way in a way that no no contemporary wooden worship would be able to take and at the end of it there was an explosion in the in this in the gunsight of the of the monitor and it had to withdraw. But Merrimack was out of ammo anyway and it had to withdraw and they saved the boat.

They saved that the they saved the Union blockade ship that had been run aground and I just think about that. Sometimes I think about witnessing that either on one of the other ships in the in the Hampton Roads or from the land because there were people there somebody I'm on Twitter said it must have been something like seeing a kaiju fight like I do battle and like there had to have had substantive it had to have felt. Otherworldly it had to have felt like there had to have been some notion of anyone involved in that moment that something he was shifting that they were entering a new world and I think about how like those moments have been so hyper normalized that now we don't even notice them you know like we tweet weep. Anyone who's alive now has seen something on the psychically disorienting level of watching the Merrimack in the monitor of trade blows and Hampton Roads every couple of years probably. But there's just so damn many of them but yeah because I think it's hard to find another moment that disorienting because I mean you are already in a civil war for God's sake.

So that's so the ground was clearly unstable beneath your feet but they have that kind of thing burst in the middle of it. Somebody I saw a picture painting that someone Japanese like silk artisan or like the silk or the silk screens or whatever they did like to commemorate historical events and I saw one of of the black of Matthew Perry's black fleet oh that by force open Tokyo to Western trade in the 1860s and the it's. It's. It's a Japanese style of wood print or whatever and it's got the Japanese looking guys with the kimonos and the samurai swords looking out onto the water and then just a big black trapezoid looking thing no people no no. It's like you see this this rolling hill and these these flowingly robed figures and the ocean was the undulating tide and then these brutal angles and this unnatural black. It's kind of felt.

[11:46](https://youtu.be/jcUNq623k1I?t=11m46s)

Like that. I guess what I what I think about that is I just sort of I guess I envy being in a position where those sort of things aren't already predigested. You know what I mean like I feel like as insane as everything has been in the 21st century and they've just been getting more insane by like that by exponentially almost none of them really except maybe. Nine eleven have felt in the moment like they were uprooting anything. This gets to what Felix says the idea that everything keeps getting worse everything's the work. Everything's the same. But it's getting worse everything's shitty but just getting slowly worse even though it's the same what he's describing is that sense of having everything assimilated instantly by our our our awareness of the hyper moment that we're living in our consciousness of the the flow of the slipperiness of reality is such that things can't really throw us that way because we were instantly assimilating them into our understanding of how the world works. These things just become instantly part of our understanding in fact we instantly as soon as we hear about them. Our brain goes overboard to convince ourself well.

Of course. This is going to happen and anyone who is surprised by it. Wow what's wrong with you you didn't see this coming well. I guess some people weren't paying attention and I just like the idea of just being able to stand there on a sand dune and just watch something that has happened on earth and know that you're the first person to ever see it to see that I guess at this point you wouldn't want to get that feeling because it would have to be such a tremendous break that you probably couldn't handle it.

And this is the thing I keep thinking about with the internet like I think I set out here a while ago you know we all just assumed MKULTRA stopped because they got bored with it or the results were inconclusive. It just they ran out of experiments and they were never able to do a repeatable thing to create anything that could be useful out of it. And that's just what we assumed because you know all the information we ever found out about MKULTRA was on the CIA's terms. The initial the initial the majority of the documents were destroyed. We only know about MKULTRA because documents in an auxiliary warehouse were uncocks identity under later I mean that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence that we can really say for sure. We know what the progress of and what the findings of MKULTRA were and when you think about things like the Manson murders and and Tom O'Neill's book which is really really interesting and offers some tantalizing connections with the MKULTRA and the Manson murders and also litter and among the things he finds.

Among the things he found was a letter from doctor. Jolly West who was like the and what I like he he's. It's he's human die him and he he answered directly to dr. Sidney Gottlieb who was the chief necromancer at the CIA and he's and at one point and this is after a very odd mysterious child murder had occurred at the army base where West was stationed and which he participated in interviewing the suspect who claims to not have no memory of committing the murder but who ended up confessing after talking to West. West also talked to to Jack Ruby in his jail cell and after he talked to West he was never coherent again in any other interviews but he wrote a letter to Sidney Gottlieb. The Tom O'Neill found where he expressly says I have discovered a way to make people do things that they wouldn't otherwise do.

He says it and then when you realize it and then when you find out that he was also occupying real estate at the haight-ashbury free clinic where Manson well Manson was there in San Francisco in the summer of love and where he was seen and where he took members of the family on a daily basis. I mean it's circumstantial. But it's something it's something worth thinking about and the thing that makes me think about is. What did MKULTRA turn into and you know you want to get you want to get baroque and you want to get high modernist.

You could say oh they're like pumping it into the water supply or chemtrails and we're all getting like a synthetic. We're all getting like a propaganda dose of broadcast media. That is then we're made more receptive to by a perfect a perfect recipe of psychopharmacological ingredients that long research and MKULTRA laboratories and field experiments like Manson like Frank Olson like maybe Jonestown like that city that town in France in the early 60s that is suspected to have been dosed entirely an entire town in France has for years been assumed to have been dosed by acid by unknown people and now recently there's a new CIA document on earth where they talked about field experiments. I mean they did those failed controlled experiments like midnight climax where they had sex workers dosed their clients and filmed what happened and tried for tried to like pump it in aerosolized into a party. This is this is like with it with a significant statistically significant sample size of people and like that's why I think that that's a good an explanation for as any for things like the Mothman like when you look at the wild multiplicity of things that people in and around Point Pleasant West Virginia said they saw in 18 since 1966 and 67. It's not impossible to imagine that that was some sort of experiment and this time not just giving the mass and see what happens but giving them acid and then giving them a specific stimulus and seeing how they responded to it see if there was any sort of group cohesion around certain explanations like if they became susceptible to certain entreaties so you get a CIA guy with a like a hell it could be a helicopter or a frogman suit and you you give the town enough to LSD and then you see what happens but yeah so if you want to go high modernist. You'd say that look I would say you want to get digital with it. You want to get you want to get 21st century if the Internet is that is the acid of the current MKULTRA variant.

[18:59](https://youtu.be/jcUNq623k1I?t=18m59s)

If there is one the exam. It's. It's not like you have to pull the strings too hard to find the connection. I mean the entire internet was a DARPA project. It was a Defense Department pursuit. I mean yes we get a lot of stuff courtesy of military military. In fact most stuff. We got in terms of big technological breakthroughs through intensive military investment that gets turned into commercial use. But I don't think we can assume that that's the only reason that that the internet was pursued like Oh accidentally created the Internet. We just wanted to send missile plans to each other. It's just when you see what the Internet has done in terms of creating an entire new plane of existence.

I don't think it's too much to say a new plane for human existence. A new place a new dimension for humans to place their anima to place their human essence to put their spirit their emotions their soul their ideologies. There's your souls their Geist their new mana where they want to cram it and they can put it there. I mean it's it's. It has the same ability to to shape behavior and manners of thought as a new religion but more because it's not section sectarian. It's ecumenical. It's truly Catholic and that it it is perceived as a platform and not an actual framework like. It's just.

It's just a thing for you to have fun on as opposed to a fully realized social space determined by capitalism and by the state that watch guards capitalism in which we're allowed to play out our desires which are of course totally shaped by the market and and where we can we can substitute human action and human communication and human organization now of course that doesn't mean that people should absolutely shun the Internet I mean acid which the CIA essentially introduced to the United States in order to see how it could help to make people tractable and and you could argue that the acid influence on the American counterculture was negative in that it moved. It alienated people away from the sort of militant solidarity that you would mean for an effective a political movement in favor of individualized like soul-searching. But it also had I think positive effects I know personally in my life. It has and so you take the good with the bad but I don't think it's anything to anything necessarily too far to just keep in mind that these structures are allowed to exist the way they are for a reason and when you have a straight line up like the demilitarization undergirding the internet. It's it's its existence as an outgrowth of the military Keynesian state. I think that's a good reminder. You know that's a good way to keep yourself from logging too much on its to know. Like this is the enemies domain yep you are pilgrims.

Unholy locked and there's a total chance that like the forces they're unleashing here beyond they the ones that they can control and that's certainly true of ass like if I was if I if I wanted to do it not just a thing about the Mothman. The whole eye point was that there were no be no explanation. There would be interlocking narratives that would conflict with one another and reinforce one another none of which would be would be privileged or validated but one of the ones would be yeah. It starts as the CIA dosing this town but then their their their collective will to believe essentially creates a real Mothman like a Tulpa a psychic manifestation of this town of essentially of the Cold War because pleasant was built next to an underground munitions lab that was one of the big post-war or early twentieth-century employers in the area. They made dynamite for the military the awareness of global brinksmanship and nuclear a nuclear war and sort of the doom cycle of military buildup. They don't have that they're all tweaking of that at some psychic level even if they weren't aware of it and then they get dosed by acid by their own government to protect them from the Russians and give them a boogeyman what if they made it real. But it's actually the manifestation of the very state that they owe their prosperity to the dark side. The unspoken the shadow figure of the virtuous yeoman Republic that we thought we lived in or that we think we live in consciously or at least back. Then they did probably in West Virginia who knows see if someone says well.

[25:14](https://youtu.be/jcUNq623k1I?t=25m14s)

Hugh become real the same way I mean Hugh you can already argue. The cue has been made real. I'm of the opinion that the first cue post was probably a joke by an irony person and then the initial batch of proofs were by some hustlin right-wing forum dweller who figured out that they could make money from the back end by interpreting cue I mean there's there was apparently a video of one of these people accidentally logging on to cue using the cue name back when they were still putting cute proofs out and then they quickly realized they were on camera and turn it off and that seems very plausible but think most of the stuff that we now think of as cue. Cannon was not in any of the proofs like the stuff about JFK jr. That's all none of that is is cubed. That's that's a cue Splinter. That's that's that's Gnostic Gospels of the cue and now you've got cue. Members of cue cue believers are gonna be in Congress. In the next session imagine they become an actual faction and they get and there's some member of like the intelligence community who wants enough of their miranne power that he feels safe to come out could be a whistleblower and go in front of Congress and claim to be Q and and denounced the deep state. At that point.

Can you say that he isn't I'm trying to think of some of the other good. Hue Gnostic Gospels things that were pulled out of someone's ass. And then everyone decided were I think the thing that all the about Tom Hanks I think is not from Q because I don't think he's dropped of proof anyone I hear. But they're still out there and it's totally self propelling. Now they're not even responding to the initial signal anymore. Like once the firm that's the difference between the difference between occult. The real difference between occult and religion is that the fact the profit The Fountainhead either the deity or the the representative of the day of the or the wise man who founded it is still alive. It's a cult he's dead and this thing's still around then it's a religion if it survives beyond the the the immediate charisma of its founder. Then it's durable enough to be a religion and I'd say because it's been so long since Q is actually posted at this point. Given the speed of internet. He's effectively dead and Q still around so that means it's now a religion because these people are all now operating off of their own stuff like the Bible has been written. Now they're doing new stuff. Now they're doing commentaries now that writing their own versions of City of God the Summa Theologica the writing they're writing their own Vulgate.

They're writing their own their own Dead Sea Scrolls because at the end of the day what Q does is accused provides a psychic balm to the cognitive dissonance of living in a country that you love deeply and that it treats you like. And it sucks that is awful and it's terrible and bad and the thing is everybody's got to deal with that in some way the healthy way is to say it maybe this country isn't that great maybe it isn't being run from my interests not for the interests of some global cabal but but by the interests of the richest people in the country but if you have certain ideological matrix that thought will never occur to you and so you have to do mental gymnastics to imagine some some American Mahdi showing up to right all the wrongs and put all of the evil people away and validate your your suffering your imagined suffering because most these people are not really suffering but the less you suffer the more slights hurt because it's all you feel so they're miserable. They're in deep agony because of the country's failure to comport with their vision of it and they fill in the gap with cure. Like all the things that you see are. All the public evil is mirrored by secret good which is of course the opposite of what really any kind of public good is mirrored by a deeper and more mature more systematically a more systematically influential evil and so yeah there's their new king.

All the underground pedophile pet layers and yeah. One day they will emerge to judge the righteous and the guilty and if your name was written in the book of QED you shall have eternal life. I mean it's just. It's just like you could argue that. It's like the third that's like a Great Awakening type sight. It's like the third great awake.

[30:55](https://youtu.be/jcUNq623k1I?t=30m55s)

It's it's like you could you could cite starting like maybe in the 70s. At the beginning of the moral majority you could all you could track this whole revivification of political Protestantism don't like decrease. AK relized cuz. That's the thing like none of these people really believe in God. They have no spiritual dimension to their life in they're entirely material Matar and their vision of God. It is is there is is Trump. Their vision of heaven is the villages or Sugarland Texas. It's creating the material comfort to live now that's actually the pursuit of get heaven and and you could call this like the third Great Awakening. But like it's a it's. It's a deeper. It's a deeper sleep really. But it is a ravine implication of a new form of Protestantism that has shaken all of its spiritual fetters and become a total worship of the self and of the selfs material reward and material satisfaction. It's it's essentially hedonism.

No I'll I mean I'm sure they'd be mad. If I told them they don't believe in God but they've 100% don't believe in God. They think that heaven is like their backyard barbecue and that only makes sense if you do not have a spiritual dimension as in you do not imagine if you do not if you cannot extend like your imagination to a plane beyond this one. That's the only way any notions of heat heaven or the sublime or God or oneness or unity or anything makes sense is if there is another dimension of perception and they don't have that so it's not it's not. It's not a religion. It's not a spiritual pursuit.

It's desacralized and the thing is is that that's it's evangelical Christianity. But it's basically truth most Christians like most Catholics. Later like that now. Most everybody is because the secularization doesn't just affect your secular institutions that affects religious institutions as well. If you're substituting at every level material convenience and pleasure for any kind of social good. Then what room is there for a spirit. I mean we have defined. We have defined life as this is the accumulation of individual physical and emotional pleasure. You could say that's not true but that's well that is how we have defined life liberty and the pursuit of happiness all that all that abstract that could mean anything really given the different social context in this specific social context has come down to us now as as it must be the consumer of last resort for God's sakes. Of course this is our ideology.

This country exists to consume that is the war'll of America in the world system is to consume be at the end of the line and eat the leftovers and so that's why we have instead of having work worker control at because it is it's genuinely true. Americans have a have more wealth and Americans make more money than Europeans do by a significant amount and they get instead the big long vacations you know and health care and you could say well. It's not. We didn't choose this and it's it's complicated but at a certain level because we're still all living this way and we're still all we're not in revolts. We've accepted the logic of it at some level because we act it out. Even if we don't like it we acted out. We accept the logic that it is consumption is the sum total of human pursuit. No no spirituality can survive that nope no kind of spirituality can survive a world where that's the truth where that's the case and that is why socialism is is dead and why it's everyone's just breaking their. Mutt volts into the cadaver because socialism imagines as a baseline. A social order where values other than consumption have been brought in where they have been where consumption is balanced and Americans have a very hard time even conceiving of that because they only see it as losing what they have because the gains are theoretical and their social and their intangible so people don't want to give it up and that's why as I said the other the last stream I think it was.

There's this tendency of people on the left to insist I got to bring my ball. I got to bring my my whatever my personal system for sucker and and and pain alleviation is my opiate which usually ends up being some sort of consumer desire because that's the country we live in. I need to bring that along with me no deal. But we're trying to build something where that wouldn't be necessary yeah. But I don't know that I don't want. I don't know I it's part of my identity now and if I if I give it up. Then I'm not going to be in charge of making the new world and and people like me are gonna be discriminated against even though we're defining we're talking about something that by definition wouldn't exist so people wouldn't be oppressed because it would not be.

It wouldn't even be a consideration. We need to go back to Hegel that is correct I gotta say guys the guy knew what he was I mean he's you know you down. It's like it is really Marx and Hegel I mean in practical political terms. Political economic terms Marx is where you start. Hegel is it's more abstract but like if if if Marx turned Hegel on its head well then by definition Hegel is the other side. It's the it's the feet or whatever the fun that's one thing and two sides of it. They're both true and his description of the of the of this his notion of humanity as a being coming into consciousness of itself as a species the way that a mind comes into consciousness of itself as an individual. I think that's the only way to understand. It's the only way to put give meaning to it. To all this dialectical clockwork way. We can describe it's the only way to impart real meaning to it to have it mean anything more than just the bare description of its of the facts of it.

[38:49](https://youtu.be/jcUNq623k1I?t=38m49s)

It's that's the ghost in the machine bring back the Prussian Empire god no I see that so that's why he started to try to talk politics in its life. Okay. See now this is where Mark Karl takes over because no the highest the highest development of human relations is not the of the Prussians. The Prussians are and speaking of Walter Shai --dl and his his idea of you know Europe being kind of separate in development than the rest of the world due to its lack of proximity to to horse archery in the step and that's shaping the cultures. Germany is another good example the Prussians or the descended the depression-era sacristy anyway. The Yonkers of Prussia were the descendants of the Teutonic Knights who settled that region in the the northern crusade against the the old. The old bolts the the last pagan remnant and the continental Europe west of the Urals I guess and so it was like a military aristocracy like and and they descended along those lines.

Whereas the party Germans of Varia kind of nestled in the middle there near Switzerland. Not bothering anybody naughty didn't even really have to worry about the Ottomans. Austria had to worry about the Ottomans and that's why those guys have such huge sticks up their assets in Berlin. But in like that Ryan area it's just giant tasks of course demeanor and all of the encased meats you can handle what's not to like the Hohenzollern though that's one of the better I like the hole in cylinders. A lot I also like the the ruling house of Bavaria that ruled way longer than the Hapsburgs. The whittles box. It's a good one somebody's mad about me saying that they settled Baltic well. There's a lot of Lutheran German aristocrats in Lithuania. How'd they get there yes yes battle of lice Alexander Nevsky but come on. They took over a bunch of that area the electoral makeup of Weimar Germany even though Nazism started in Bavaria that was never there heartland of their electoral power because all the German parts of all the Catholic parts of Germany.

The most popular party was the center party which was an explicit cap Catholic party that attempted to do its own sort of Third Way Catholic thing of like being critical like capitalism but still being traditional and all that sort of Jake G K Chesterton Ian. It was it was the lower middle classes and and farmers with smallholding peasantry. Our beloved sack of sauerkraut I guess sacks of sauerkraut yes the pmc did were the were the were the party I always are the party of fascism. That's why I wanted. I'm glad that was brought up though because I wanted to say something about fascism. There's been obviously very heated debate over the last few years about like what counts as fascism and specifically what counts about us what counts as fascism about the current moment right. It's Trump. A fascist or the proud voice fascist are the cops fascist is what does it.

[43:39](https://youtu.be/jcUNq623k1I?t=43m39s)

Mean does it just mean Essaouira right-wing authoritarianism or is it more specific. It's too specific. Then it just becomes a historical descriptor that has no contemporary meaning at all and then of course. There's a practical argument which is well if you've got this the if all of your democratic niceties have been destroyed and you are now a being directly suborned to capitalism's. Jackie Foote isn't that doesn't it not matter what you want to call. It doesn't that mean that's fascism if we to think of fascism is like the ultimate abrogation of civil society and I would say that that's it's worth pointing out the distinctions and choosing out the meaning for one reason and that is that regardless of what people are operating from in their head when they imagine fascism. The description of it that they're operating from when they're imagining. A response to it indicates that they're thinking about it specifically in the context of its historical emergence because the basic simplified narrative or basic simplified model of the Nazis and fashion the rise of to power fascism was you had an embattled discredited existing border representing a specific national bourgeois collection of capitalists and then you have a rising and radical and militant left organizing in and outside of the democratic processes that existed and then fascism filled.

The gap protected the order the state and the class interests that the state represented from this mass with its own mass movement different composition more middle-class more rural but similarly mobilized similarly able to fight in the streets to control and dominate the political zones and they were brought to power by those embattled old powers as a way to protect them but the very mobilization and effectiveness of fascism at combining socialism. This ability to and and mechanisms for mobilizing worker or mobilizing people workers like in socialism transferred over to you know small shop owners or whoever students but then also with the support and aid of the richest people in the society which those left-wing certainly didn't have but that put him in a position where they were able to essentially absorb the state because they were more. At that point. The party became more powerful than the state that had summoned it to its protection and so it absorbed it and brought it to its own ends that is not possible in the current moment that can happen because Americans and specifically conservative Americans right-wingers the people who you would add the MIT through the petty-bourgeois specifically of right-wingers. The people most likely to make up a social basis for fascism are simply to demobilized to ever fill the gap. That way I mean yes the left isn't a scarier or organized as it used to be. But it's certainly getting militants in a way that's making it harder to conduct business and meat but what's happening in the streets what happened in the streets. This summer if we were in the moment of incipient fascism that people like to imagine and the people especially who specifically say that Trump himself symbolizes some sort of rampant fascist movement.

They would be. The street would be filled with paramilitaries fighting back and what has actually happened. You have some pathetic like three dorks of Hawaiian shirts. Standing around not making I can't Tai Chi eye contact with anybody getting like a couple shots for tick-tock and then going home a couple of insane guys who just come out of their cars to start shooting people. But this is the country of Lutton of lone wolves shooters we love doing that fun don't we folks no organized counter opposition really in the streets anyway from the citizenry. It's been the cops and that's just it is that we can see from the composition of forces that that right-wing mobilized politically politically aware base doesn't exist. They've been demobilized. They've been essentially intentionally demobilized as part of that worship of material comfort. I mean if you love America more than anything then you love consumption those two things are that's one is the expression of the other and so you are you've been immobilized by your own pursuit of pleasure and I don't know if this isn't theoretical look. They're not out in the streets. There was a march through some suburb and a bunch of them stood by the side of the road. Looking downward and a lot of people are saying they come here and they can't I thought comes here but they're not gonna leave because not only is it because their pleasure pleasure didn't.

They're also they don't know they don't communicate with each other. They don't have any kind of squad structures. You know they don't have any durable social bonds. Everything's on the computer now that doesn't mean that we are not in a moment where there might be a crisis where democratic institutions can no longer protect that jook gooey nougat Center of capital from the people. What's gonna fill that gap is the existing and more technologically intensive than it was in the 30s security state in the form of the cops and the military and why that matters is. It means the terrain of fight is different. It means first and foremost that anti-fascism as an ideological project is less important than then proactive workplace and labor organizer along along the axis of labor exploitation and the redress of grievances and democratization of workplace and increase of access to things like health care because my god if we're coming to that crisis point.

The only thing that's gonna stop the tanks rolling from the streets is if there's too many people out there to shoot got a couple more minutes here. Gonna anyone has any questions it's getting dark hold up check this out had I got some Christmas tree lights up. Here has anybody heard any more about the in Milwaukee because the day it happened everyone was like. They just uncovered a police run pedophile ring in this house and the cops like helped smuggle a bunch of guys out of there and there's been no follow up at all and that's weird because you know even if the police are trying to cover this up and even if the local media doesn't want to cover it. I would still imagine that the same people who were freaking out and tweeting about it two to three days ago have followed up and that there's some sort of someone pulling on these threads so that makes me think that we have reached the point where a escape velocity where we're never. Gonna find out anything anymore because it takes too long to follow up because we're moving too fast because everything is the next day or maybe the initial claims are being backed up and instead of people correcting them. They're just kind of not saying anything I don't know which one's true. But I would like to know either way. I'm very very that whole story is freaky well any. For example it was claimed that those two kids got those things rescued two kids from the house where are the kids that seems like something. Someone should know that doesn't require the journal sentinel'. The Journal Sentinel Pulitzer prize-winning investigative unit to figure out the committee.

A mass shooter is pretty. Crazy. I honestly think it's more likely that he just snapped from being a narc which is a classic thing that happens where being in two place being two people at once makes your brain break. But I mean I guess I could imagine. I just I'm always skeptical on mass shooter. Cuz I don't buy the motive I Canada already ask gun control and we have never enacted gun control thanks to thanks to mass shootings and the idea of like oh we need to keep oh. They need to keep doing that to keep us off our toes and to keep us disoriented and scared of one. Another I mean I honestly think it's a little naive to imagine they would have to go through. With that. We got we have more guns than people in this country as it is do we really like the formula the formula on the dominant on the chalkboard for a culture that would produce mass shooters. It checks out. You know there's no like extra space that we need to put false flags in now if you people have an idea that like no the the mass shooting is like a cover for something else okay. But I would need to have an idea of what the other thing is because I just can't buy oh yeah. We're gonna shoot a bunch of people or pretend to shoot a bunch of people so people can tweet about gun control for a couple days. Everything's already everything's moving so fast it is. It is so like horrifyingly to stabilizing how can you distinguish between the seeded events and the real ones and I guess. The question then becomes what difference does it make I mean I'd certainly think that the botched stings are responsible for a lot of Boston bombing first amongst those my patio is fine. Let me alone I could I could see the idea of like the gun lobby doing it to get people to bond more guns. But that's that's like that's like Oh. Hallmark invented Valentine's Day level of analysis oh boy oh boy oh boy. I got to go in guys. It's coming down.
