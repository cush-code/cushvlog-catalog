Um all right tell me if you can hear me. I have no idea. I might if you guys can't hear me at all. I'm gonna just have to plug off. I'm just trying to shoot. I have a had an issue today. I'm I have. I'm not able to use my microphone. Can you hear me at all or does this just tell me if I can hear if you can't hear me. I'll just turn it off. This is a test basically if you can hear me or not can you hear me just tell me somebody tell me if you can hear me oh good thank goodness because I'm having to. I things ran late and my phone was not charged. I thought it had been charging. It wasn't charging and so I have to have it plugged into my computer which I was means. I can't play use my microphone. So you're assuming. I'm assuming you're hearing me over the laptop microphone so whatever it is.

I'm happy that it's working so I think that the fym guy said they were gonna do a bail fund charity stream starting at seven. I think they're gonna do that now at eight. And I absolutely encourage anyone to keep watching them have fun with their hygiene spoofs and goofs and kicking some money if if you can and if you think it's the right thing to do. This is the most technologically advanced move. I've ever pulled while trying to do this job whatever you want to call it. I believe fym stands for. You mean so it looks like we're getting amy coney bryant amy kobe bryant amy joseph coney any coney dog barrett 50 caliber in the senate in that.

I honestly think they should just get it over with because it's just going to be annoying the whole thing is going to be very annoying. No everyone knows that she's going to get confirmed just just do it do it tomorrow one vote because I'm honestly why would I want to listen to any more of this it was bad enough in the kavanagh hearings. My god. Everybody convinced themselves that that was some sort of meaningful like rubicon being crassed as though anybody has any retention of anything for longer than five minutes. Amy cody bryant. So what's up guys what's going on. I wasn't online today my phone died. I was that far from my phone so I don't know what all happened besides people.

 ritually sacrificing lambs in front of the corpse of ruth bader ginsburg what else has been going on I saw clappy stupid bastards and that's swag see that swag. That's what hillary didn't have and that's why more than anything. I think. I mean besides incumbency working against trump this time I think that's what could save him and make him beat trump is is that he's got that trump swag which hillary never had oh yes ron. Paul also had a stroke on the middle of a live stream which I hope to do one day. I mean that's a true that's the demise of a true online posters poster right to go down while well vlogging. It's that's when you die like that you get to go to the feasting banquets of asgard. So if ron paul. Apparently he didn't die though which is too bad for him honestly because if he had died he would right now he would be at a table with murray rothbard hayek von mises and they would all just be wailing on poor people with paintball guns while just eating ordell on like chicken nuggets because he died posting he died posting for the ideas for the crack-headed idiot ideas of libertarianism. The I don't think han simon hop is dead actually so he wouldn't be there yet oh yes ayn rand. Also there god imagine if people actually were the way the libertarians say that they are how would we have us how would there be anything we didn't see anything you are only able to have that kind of delusion because you are so deeply embedded in a social network that has been abstracted away from you in terms of your day-to-day life and has been replaced by like technological stand-ins and symbolic stand-ins for a social order can you possibly get the schizophrenically insane idea in your head yeah. No the world is me even though I'm thinking these words with a language that I didn't invent even though.

[05:57](https://youtu.be/WLkrAwSAuXo?t=05m57s)

I'm only alive because people didn't sell me or take my organs when I was literally defenseless and the earlier generations it would have been nonsensical but once you've turned society into these symbols and removed it from your day-to-day experience. You can go off on any kind of insane tangents and then the internet comes around and it makes all those tangents not only seem non-insane but in fact rational because what's this we're all acting on this internet computer box the way that we are imagined to act in the market. We are individuals relating to one another relating ideas across a neutral public platform and buying and selling our wares and ourselves and our and finding our amusements there and all for a price that's your life if the internet is your life. It's no wonder so many of these people are deluded libertarians because why would if this is your model. If the model for human society is not actual human society. It is human society dimly reflected on the internet how the hell are you ever supposed to come to any other conclusion. Somebody's talking about how we didn't think unemployment run out. I'm telling you though it was always like unemployment will run out and then the will hit the fan. I think if anybody. I think the assumption that it wouldn't run out came from assuming that we had more just like running doing the bernie campaign assuming that there was more there was more resistance left in the band or You know a tread in the tires of of of like. An actual organizable self-motivating social form in america doesn't mean we won't make one doesn't mean the times won't help create one but it certainly isn't here.

Yet oh we got stuck got got a got a passion fruitful lacroix. Here it is amazing how lacroix. I don't know how it happened was it. The name might have been just. The name was able to be the brand that captured a social phenomenon that had nothing to do with it or its product had to do with just demographics. Millennials turned 30. Millennials turned 30. They couldn't drink as much empty calories as they used to without their asses getting larger and so they switched to seltzer and lacroix was the brand that turned that into a meme and not just a defeat you're giving in to your body's decrepitude and then it took over the whole thing and then it took over alcohol but it all started with verocroi and now you go to a grocery store. La croix is more expensive than the other brands and it's not better like. I think polar is much better polar's got way more bubbles but nobody thinks why is it more expensive why is lacroix expensive. It's like nah that makes sense it makes sense look at that look at that 80s.

Design look at that vaporwave that is some vaporwave. Dude is that what vaporwave sounds like. I don't know wow. I love that you guys can hear me so well. I didn't even have to buy that goddamn microphone. I could have just plugged the thing into the computer.

I'd say the most grill pilled sopranos. Character would be lil carmine just in the sense that he he didn't push it. It's like you could be the don he's like oh. Let's see then does it work out. He's like never mind. He this isn't driven by a manic. Need to to claim a throne that only puts a target on his back who are the musketeers the muscadines if you want to be if you want to be glib about it where the first proud boys of course the difference was is that it was. There were actual stakes and it wasn't pure pure entertainment they were They were the children of the upper middle class not the gentry not the old aristocracy but of the right-wing bourgeois who went on the streets in in finery and with with jewels and walking sticks and perfumed cravats and would beat up an attack and sometimes kill and castrate republicans jacobites. They were part of the thermadorian suppression of left-wing sentiment which was the first of a number of pivots that the directory did over its five years where it would essentially play whack-a-mole.

It would suppress the left and cosy up to the right and modify the right. But then the right would become overweeningly powerful and begin making threats to gain power either through a coup or through the legislature and then they would suppress the right and pick up the left and then the left would get too big for its britches. That's why it was doomed The center could not hold there. Trump was going to fill the gap and it ended up being napoleon who was a truly dialectical figure in the sense that he was the synthesized embodiment of the entire political spectrum at that point and the moment history on horseback is high go calm because his his reign was a was filled with ratifying the meritocratic and enlightenment like um government and concepts and and and he enforced like secularization of um of like the bureaucracy that the republic had instituted. But then he created a heart a hereditary monarchy with with all of the pomp and structures and circumstance of the old royalty and it turns out if the money is still being made and if the battles are still being won that's really all anybody on the right really wanted especially. Once he made the concrete out with the vatican. I don't think there's a monkey out there.

I think it's a chip squirrel or something man yeah. It's wild out here we got helicopters. We got some sort of shrieking ape someone's asking about that clip that was just being put around a while back about um michael hanecki saying that it's immoral to do entertainment about the holocaust that schiller's list was immoral. The thing about hanaki is he's he is an artist second. He's a moralist first and that doesn't mean he's a bad artist or that his work isn't bad. It is. It's just that's not a guy that I'm gonna go to for any real questions of of of like artistic aesthetic static imperatives cancels oh my god trump's not going to cancel the election and I have noticed by the way that ever since trump had his thing where he said we're going to get rid of the ballots bye bye-bye balance. People been rivets. Ever since then there must be a protest or something I'm guessing They're shooting rivets at the idea of a coup some situation where he just says like that atlantic monthly article.

Apparently it outlined an idea where they're just gonna tell the state legislators to pick their own slate of such the republican state. Legislatures are going to be asked to just pick their own slate of pro-trump electors to go and cast their boats which they can do like. They can do that you know like the the electoral college does not actually have anything in it about the electors being chosen by elections in the state. It just says that they will be chosen by the states and in the past that has meant state legislatures and they could just do that again you know but even though that could technically be legal. I think it would be such a breach that it would be in the realm of what people are worrying about or at least what they really think they're worrying about. When they talk about this stuff is some sort of you know tanks in the streets moment where this is the The state of siege has been instituted and the constitution is null and void. I think that could that could lead to that but then a lot of people seem to be backing off from that maximal position saying no what if it like more realistically. It's like okay.

Now. We're talking what if it's just like florida 2000 all over again and to which I say well then he won the election because you can talk about how that's illegitimate well guess what the 2000 election was illegitimate. No one did anything about it so that standard that can't be coup territory anymore that can't be the rules of change that can't be. It's running man. Now that can't be this is our apocalyptic moment. This is our apotheosis. I'm sorry if it's just a little more blatant version of florida 2000. Then it's just he won the election and people will whine about it and there'll be some protests but it'll be like 2000. So if that's what you're talking about then they're not really talking about a coup government in this country since 2000. We just let that go and you have to reckon with the fact that that has been absorbed into the system and no one in any significant number decided to mount the barricades in defense of democracy.

Then so how are they going to do. It now in similar circumstances just because I mean yeah people are madder and people are sadder. People. Our lives are worse as americans in general than they than they were in 2000 but were even more atomized. Even more confused even I mean my god. The internet was pets.com and the dancing hamster in 2000.

[19:22](https://youtu.be/WLkrAwSAuXo?t=19m22s)

Now it's our brains you know what somebody asked a very weird question the kind of question. I usually ignore in these chats like kind of the left field ones. But I thought it was really interesting because I had an immediate thought when he when I read it which was it. Said was the most cursed picture of a politician and I was obviously a ton of contenders but the one that immediately came to my mind without me even thinking about it. My first thought actually was oh how am I going to pick and then I just saw it you. Guys won't remember this and I'm wondering if I should like if I can show you on the screen here because you're not going to have seen this most of you you. Fetuses in this chat will not have seen this because it's 2004 when john kerry was running against george bush. An election that I was wildly wildly emotionally invested in hilariously because yeah the stakes now are both supposed to be so much higher and I care basically zero percent as much as I did in 2004 so it was him visiting a nuclear facility. I think it was some sort of clean clean room. Some sort of technological clean room that he was and he was crawling through a tube a white tube and he was wearing a white. Containment suit and his and his was his nose like this and he looked like a bunny rabbit. It was the cl. It's the closest thing a political. A presidential candidate has done to appearing is as a furry is somebody putting it in the chat. I bet someone is. I've got a helpful a helpful all right. I'm back. I don't know why that happened. It's very irritating. I don't know why that happens when that happens it literally just froze and dropped me off of the call off of the broadcast It's because trump is trying to stop the truth from coming out or biden somebody. I don't know but yes the bunny suit photo there's just something about his face that fills me with revulsion at myself for having ever cared about him being president at him for what a disgusting. That's how the level of our discourse a bunch of just easily amused toddlers. It's it's a very it's a bummer man. I know. I wasn't online. I'm. I was not talking into the void. I saw it knock me off.

He wasn't just secretary of state john kerry. He was he was decent. He actually did the iran deal. He did the the cuban entry cuban reopening which of course is now dead but he actually had I mean. He was much better than hillary clinton but obviously still very bad in any absolute sense not going to watch really. Scott's robots. What is he so fascinated with. It's not that interesting man. It's like. It's not that much of an artistic an interesting artistic trope. I just don't think so at this point especially not the way he's done done it like what is his insight. In all these movies what does the insight he have go beyond like. I don't know which one of us is actually the machine or whatever the the idea that he was snuck into without mentioning it the idea that he snuck into um prometheus that the aliens the alien space jockey people. The big buff pale albino guys they came to earth they seeded human life on earth and then one of them came down to earth to like make us stop being jerks to one another and that was jesus and then after we killed. Jesus they decided to send the a species extincting pod of aliens to wipe us out and as punishment yeah. It is in the movie. I'm sorry you it's not said that explicitly. But it said there's one point where they're like looking at the hieroglyphics or something and david is saying it's like.

This was supposed to depart 2 000 years ago. Now what happened 2000 years ago that would make the aliens send a an alien pod to wipe out humanity that they created who was around back then and you might think that's dumb yeah. That's ridley scott. He's a dumball. He's a dummy biden is focusing on venezuelan. Because he wants to win florida that's what they always do now of course yes. They want to overthrow these governments. Yes. There's a long-term interest in the united states to see all all op potential opposition certainly sitting on top of anything like venezuela's oil wealth. The largest proved oil reserves in the world that that imperative is going to be persist regardless of who's in power but biden is talking about it as much as he is to try to get floor.

I gotta say the stoned ape theory makes a lot more sense to me now than it used to be you know because the things exist right and all this exists in nature and it interacts with. Human nervous system and perceptive apparatus and people are gonna. They're gonna take it at some point and enough of them take it at the right moment and you have that that leap and not the only thing that would have led to human human consciousness is evolving of course but but I think like a one thread in a in a tapestry of phenomenon that drove humanity to that point But I think like the genetic bottleneck point. I think that had a lot to do with it too. The fact that one that all humans evolved are our direct descendants. We're not direct descendants but eventual descendants of about 5 000 human beings who survived a a massive climate catastrophe in in africa that had something to do with it. But I do and I also like it because it is a materialist. It's a materialist ex explanation for spirituality. Like the universe is a whole. The universe is a fully conscious to the degree that it is it functions being and then we showed up for one reason or another and maybe because of the co-evolution with other species that had chemicals some people theorize that some mushrooms have that effect on people because it makes people less likely to destroy them or something. I don't know but whatever it is. It would be a it would be an actual like material intervention into a natural ecosystem a a equilibrium a homeostasis creating an imbalance an over development of perception among one subspecies of animal that then just went basically insane which we have been ever since just screaming gibbering deluded maniacs because we are all essentially trapped by a delusion a a a a dissociative state and that is of separate individual consciousness that is this the essential psychosis of human of human existence. Why do I think do.

I think politicians pooping their pants is more common occurrence than they let on well considering that they don't they barely ever let it on like jerry. Nadler just you know that he just dropped anchor right like it wasn't like a shark. It wasn't a it wasn't a little trickle. It was like it was thanksgiving dinner in his underwear because he just immediately starts shoveling off. Stage does it in the middle of their stupid presentation. He had business to attend to and hey. I don't judge the man. But I do think that I mean for one thing. He's 75 another thing. He got lap band surgery. He used to be much bigger and he had lap-band surgery. So I'm sure his gi truck is an absolute It's a nightmare realm. His intestines are like the just think that's so alpha compared to please clap right.

It's the opposite it's chat. It's a chad. It's chad the way that trump was chat against hillary and you can make an argument that the best predictor in the modern era of who win the presidency is who's coolest because who is cooler hillary or trump well that's a no-brainer who is cooler obama or romney again. No brainer who's cooler obama or mccain no. Know the answer to that one. Don't we folks who's cooler than who's cooler between bush and al gore once again. D clinton was cooler than dole. Bush is not cool but bush was cooler than dukakis. Dukakis was a little stiff. I mean he had the picture behind the thing. Bush look came off as sort of like a pencil neck geek but he also had a real patrician gravitas because he was like the the absolute cerulean blooded american like a wasp establishment. He's a personification of like deep american money. The original american capitalist so that kind of resonated off reagan of course cooler than mondale cooler than carter carter was cooler than ford. Nixon versus. Humphrey is such an insane uncool off because you think nixon wasn't cool. My god hubert. H humphrey was an absolute spaz just he had he had kid in the front of the class putting his hand up because he knows all the answers energy and it was it was cringe and his name was hubert. Linda. Johnson wildly cooler than barry. Bill buckley types try to act like oh he's epically cool and I'm sure there are shirts you can get with goldwater and he's got sunglasses on.

[32:22](https://youtu.be/WLkrAwSAuXo?t=32m22s)

It's like oh epic and yeah. He was a rancher and all that but he was a square. He there's a in in before the storm rick. Pearlstein's first book which is about largely the 64 campaign he talks about how these group these crowds have juiced up young conservatives like the young american for freedom types. The people who burned you know they did the first like dumping the french wine out thing and that they would hold bonfires of soviet made products and they would be there. These young exuberants cheering on go the speech and there'd be somebody to come out and give a stem winding opener and then goldwater would come out and the room would just die. He had no charisma at all. He was chosen because he was the ideological heart of conservatism in the elected federal government. He had no charisma lyndon. Johnson had a dick he called jumbo. He had a aqua car that he would drive people into lakes with without them. Knowing it was an aqua car he wasn't a terribly powerful speaker either but he certainly had some swagger in his personal interactions whereas goldwater was very much a nerd and that's one of the reasons he played being a rancher so hard because he was such a nerd. I mean he was like a he was an amateur pilot and cb radio enthusiast and if he'd been like middle class he would have just been a nerd but the fact that he was you know the millionaire scion of a department store. Dynasty in arizona meant that he could play both he could be a he could be a nerd on the prairie and of course.

Jfk famously is more cool than nixon. Jfk won because of sam giancana bill daley and his coolness eisenhower was cooler than hadley. Stevenson truman is cooler than dewey dewey got murdered because eleanor roosevelt's er I think it was one of the roosevelts I think alice. Maybe said that thomas dewey looked like the little man on the wedding cake. He had a little mustache that was 1948 version of just an annihilation that's that's you're done after that Fdr was cooler than anybody he ran against obviously and biden is even though his pants are filled with any given moment and he doesn't even know where he is that has given him a ease with himself and that is what coolness is after all it's just ease with oneself.

That's what people are picking up when they say someone's cool. They mean that they are not in a state of anxiety relative to themselves or the people around them and I think that both and both trump and trump and biden's coolness is largely powered by their senility. At this point. It's why they're like trump is obviously a incredible narcissist and more importantly a deeply needy man who needs to be reassured at all points that but his public persona is one of absolute certainty because as much as he might be crave the approval of others. He has no instinct to tack towards anyone. He just is himself and then if you don't like it. He gets mad at you so I think though biden might be cooler. Biden might be thinking about it in this terms like if it's because trump is insecure in a way biden doesn't seem to be well unless it's about being perceived as to the left in any way. Biden is incredibly neurotic about that he will tell you. I beat the socialist I do.

I have any oh somebody asked about the debate I saw what the debate topics were and one of them is the actual integrity of the election itself and i. I do not think that's ever been a debate topic before which means that something is different about this. It's not pure hysteria because even if it was pure hysteria it's enough hysteria to impact things. It's like our discrete actions always just in the internet and like our our media responses. They do kind of just go into the ether because they are uncoordinated. But if you have everybody even if they're not on the same page just have a religiously ecstatic moment simultaneously. You can move the meal and I think that's that's the possibility there everyone just wills themselves into believing just making a quantum leap through sheer intensity of belief but like. I said.

[37:42](https://youtu.be/WLkrAwSAuXo?t=37m42s)

I don't think it's gonna happen. I'd say most. I'd say you know what's nice nice and likely is yes He loses the popular vote again by a bigger margin and he wins after a above statistical likelihood. Number of ballots get thrown out in a couple of states which by any stretch is not a legitimate election. It's the kind of thing that you would overthrow. I mean my god think of what think of what justified more alice's overthrow was some.

In our exit polls or something. This is literally yeah. Ten percent of absentee ballots were disavowed or ten. Percent of mail-ins were just thrown in a challenge and thrown in the garbage or lost or something that's that's that would if it was a strategically important enough area that would that would lead to some sort of direct intervention especially if it provoked a popular protest but it would still be business as usual for us it would not be the opening of the seventh seal that we'd still just be here grumble about it. Complain about it get real mad frothing angry about it post about it certainly protest yes but over time without protests leading to anything it leads to people getting bored or scared so wait. A minute. Somebody says that biden 538 has biden at 352. You mean 352 electoral votes that's honestly that doesn't seem crazy from the polling.

I've seen. I mean. He has a very s. I mean people like to say they were wrong in 2016 what if there is wrong now there's all these stories like I mean yes. But once again this is a different context. Trump is the incumbent president you've seen. This big shift in suburban voters away from republicans to democrats you've seen a big surge in turnout.

These things could especially with. I don't know the economy collapsing around a unnecessarily disastrous pandemic response maybe that's not true maybe. This is a real durable lead maybe. This is actually a lead and I think that will be the funniest outcome really if the wind just goes out of everybody's sails on election night. Like all of this animal has been built up to a frenzied pitch and then biden wins in a walk like they don't even need to wait three days for all the absentees to come in that's not saying that's a likely outcome. But I think something like that could very likely happen like okay. Maybe there's a couple days. It's a little touch and go there because they're still counting ballots but trump isn't able to to muster the horses to really try to go full hardcore just because of the frenzy pitch of the country just like we'll we'll save this card for later just because it would be a disaster for the markets in the near term. There's no question about that and it's like is that necessary do we like trump that much and like I have said. I don't think they do. I don't think he's not necessary to their to their ambitions and then a couple and then he wins and he's got like 300 electoral votes or more I'm assuming everyone's just going to. I mean you think people would be relieved. But I think it's going to be something else. It's going to be this emptiness. There's going to be this hollow echoing emptiness and people are going to be like robert redford in the candidate. What now and I think the answer for a lot of people is going to be oh yeah. I don't care about politics anymore which is going to be pretty funny thinking of all the people who spent the last four years whipping themselves into a frenzy and believing themselves to be political warriors on behalf of democracy or whatever the or anti-racist crusaders who are going to scourge the land like john brown after all that after all that edging and all that and then just the absolute failure to have any kind of apotheosis. I think they're just going to say it. I'm going to get into craft beers or something. I don't know if that'll last and I doubt it will. But I think you're gonna get like a a refractory period there where a lot of people are just gonna stop paying attention to any of this.

[42:43](https://youtu.be/WLkrAwSAuXo?t=42m43s)

Deny committee someone wants to know about they that was a committee that was chaired in the 20s. I believe to figure out why the hell the u.s went into war in world war one considering the fact that nobody really wanted to go. Wilson campaigned in 1916 on a platform of he kept us out of war and yet we still ended up going in why because of the zimmerman telegram and then I committee made a claim that it was essentially to secure the massive amount of loans that the united states had made to the allies. They lent money to both sides but disproportionately and in much much larger amounts to the allies specifically jp. Morgan among them the guy who had single-handedly saved the entire american economy in 1907 by underwriting a job a private sector bailout of the american financial system which is one of the things that led to the creation of the federal reserve because there was a understanding that they could not allow that kind of crisis moment to be in the hands of unorganized capital. It had to be capital at its most tightly supervised in the form of that executive committee.

That marx talks about and honestly. People might say it's simplistic but it makes a lot more sense especially if you're trying to put events in a I don't know historical context and relate them to other events and other things. Instead of just isolating them. It makes a ton more sense than well. We wanted to stay out of the war but then germany shot one of our shot a torpedoed one of our cruise ships and then two years later we went to war people forget that lusitania it was not like lusitania was sunk and then we went to war right after that like pearl harbor. The lusitania was sunk in 1915. The united states didn't enter the war for two more years and the zimmerman telegram oh yeah that was a real concern. They were the mexicans were going to invade the united states. I mean they were in the middle of a completely paralyzing civil war. At that time.

They were no position to do anything to us securing american securing american financial instruments considering the fact that the united states was like at that point a junior partner to like an anglo global market which worked. One was largely was largely about who was going to be able to direct that flow who was in charge and england won and we were on their side essentially from the sidelines for most of it and then we had to secure our investment which was a very smart move for you know the ruling class because it helped facilitate the eventual handover of the entire. Mechanism to the united states after world war ii when direct colonial control was no longer financially feasible and we replaced it with a dollar hegemony that's ruled ever since and that's all because as ottoman bismarck said the most consequential event of the 20th century or I'm sorry. The most consequential fact of the 20th century will be that the united states speaks english oh god biden potential cabinet picks who gives a I mean.

I'm only curious to see what klobuchar and buddhist got. I kind of want to see how good negotiators they are if buddhist got veterans affairs or something. I think he he got a little played. It would be funny if warren didn't get anything. Although honestly at this point. I don't give a vampires. I don't know what to tell you even if she even if you can convince me that her intention is not to rule like one of them. Her ability to negotiate the house of power has proven pretty conclusively that she's never going to be in a position to get one over on any of these. People no matter what she did in the senate not within an administration where she has no real independent base which you could have in the senate oh god. Sally ate says he that is a that is an underrated thing that people that happen sometimes is cabinet.

People are chosen as basically as a snap as as a own of the previous administration as administration um. There was a famous example of that with the obamas because obviously obama wasn't going to do anything about any of the crimes bush committed and those guys committed let bygones be gigons. Who hasn't broken a few million iraqi eggs to make an omelet he so he didn't do any actual accountability but in an act of supreme west wing symbolic importance. He appointed eric shinseki who had been I think the secretary of the army under bush and had he had complained. He had said something about how it was going to take more troops to to hold iraq than the government was saying. They were lying about what it would take to secure iraq in an invasion and he got fired and they appointed him.
