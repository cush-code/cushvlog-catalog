Foreign is everybody doing. It's unnervingly beautiful day in new york. Hey I was walking here. Hello sweatness my old friend. I've come to speak with you again. It was it was wet. It was wild how how warm it was so the last couple of streams. I've been sort of trying to sketch out a working theory for the political moment and I think I'm getting there. But I think I thought I'd just take a break from that for a bit let that stuff simmer a little bit let me think about it. I think I might end up expanding on it in a different space than this. I feel like it's sort of I've gotten as far as I'm gonna get talking about it on here so keep stay tuned for something else where I kind of flesh that out but just last thing. I say on the subject though before I kind of move on is.

I know a lot of people seem to be upset by what I'm saying about the idea of college-educated people composing some sort of cultural elite now like a class with with its own characteristics and I get why because that's a claim of a lot of dumbasses who want an excuse to become republicans. I mean that's the end of the day. That's what that is and I get that. I understand it and maybe it's my fault for not stressing enough that when I say it's a class. I don't mean an actual class in any marks a sense. I mean a pseudo class. We're talking about pseudo classes in that they have something that is like class consciousness and that it informs their political actions. I either vote which is all we do in america mostly but their political actions are symbolic and their class. Their class awareness is totally illusory and it has nothing to do with their relationship to production. It has nothing to do with like whether they're bad or good people because of their relationship to the mechanisms of exploitation. Like most americans they are both exploited and exploiters. It's all about how you see yourself and then what premises you operate from that opera that determine your political agency and traditionally classes are supposed to emerge out of relationships to production and because that's how you create actual class that can act in itself which is how marx defines class. This is something that or at least a a a stage of class consciousness class coming into being.

We don't have that here these are not classes and that marks a sense so no matter what mechanism they're operating on for their policy. Either republican or democrat and everybody is like I've said. Who's in this matrix is a republican or a democrat no matter who they vote for in any given election. It's about just a a set of responses to this governing cultural hegemony either pro or against and that leads you to symbolically represent that position in your vote which has nothing to do with any of the actual questions of distribution of resources and you know the role of cap of this citizen to interfere with the market as it liquefies everyone's bones. Those questions are not up for debate but both sides are fully invested in this cultural fantasy which means that nothing within their political activity in that political world will ever challenge that which means neither the democrats or the republicans are going to turn into a party of the working class in any way.

I'm not just talking about you know whether or not tucker. Carlson can make a hair involved democracy with white medicare for all. I am saying that no one's going to have to pitch what about this election is making. Anyone think that the people who are going to come after trump are going to double down on the economic populism that's not the stuff that hit that's not the stuff that sparked that's not the stuff that defined the presidency and did not define the race and did not get people to vote for him which means they're gonna go on the easy stuff. The culture stuff because it doesn't go against the interests of their actual funders and the actual structural incentives of the party same thing as the democrats. So I think people get mad because they think I'm passing judgment. On these people. I'm saying you are pmc therefore you're evil and you're why everything's bad and you're this you're the obstacle to socialism. No you're people trapped in a relationship just as much as of false consciousness just as much as working-class republicans are and and that has to be broken and it can only be broken from outside the political system. So I hope that I just want that to be clarified because.

I don't want people to think that I'm really saying that they're a class. They're a pseudo class all classes in america when we're talking about what is defined by the political structure of voting in elections because come on. That's what we're meaning when we're talking about this they are not a real class. They think they're operating off of like a shared value system but it is not based on their relationship to production. It's based on a position on a cultural question and that cuts both ways and across everyone. It's false consciousness all the way down because it's consciousness that thinks that this political structure. This political contest is meaningful.

That is unaware that all the real decisions that make their lives terrible and worse every year are being made at a bipartisan basis beyond the level of political debate and choice. But the thing is I understand why people get taxi about this because they've been fighting people online who are saying the other thing who are wrong and I'm telling you those people are wrong because all they really want to do is. Excuse. Themselves is is is carry is basically make sure that their clout is transferable when they would become republicans like they want to be able to turn in all those clout chips that they've accumulated while they were you know on the left until and the thing is. I don't think a lot of this is bad faith. I think that the terms of online debate will drive you.

In this direction. You will be driven to become the caricature of an id poll a care lord or a nazbal strasserite you will be forced to by the fact that within this debate structure and within these within this locked two-party system you can only can ever outbid yourself in order to maintain a position in the stream of ideas and takes there's always someone who can outbid you and since it's all a contest for social clout that can be transferred into real sustenance from gofundmes for medical care to a career in the parasocial media relationship. But that's all it is all right so that was just. I wanted to get that cleared up so that I feel like there are fewer people who are going to be in good faith arguing yelling at me and instead.

I can kind of feel like oh no if you don't get what. I'm saying at this point you don't want to because you're invested in this question and you don't want to move past it because it fighting it gets you off somehow just like the libs who are getting off on the prospect of trump doing a coup because they're just because he predictably is not accepting that he lost which everyone knew he would and now everyone's freaking out because oh my god pompeo said this and they're not they're not starting the transition in the executive branch. This is another case of people jazzing themselves up on a fight that they want to keep having because they didn't get the the orgasm they thought they were going to get out of biden winning. They just got this kind of sad seeping ejaculation and they want another one. Their refractory period is already up. They want another one and the reason. I say that is because the people who are most likely within the government structure that would have to carry out something like a coup.

The people who are closest to trump personally has been closest to his orbit like personally appointed by him or are highly sp. Our high high-profile public surrogates for him that that are in the legislative ramps like senators and congress people those people he could fire them at a drop moment's notice he could ruin their career the gop potentially and so they're not going to admit say that he's lost before he does. They can't do that and in the in congress the voters love him and if they see you cracking they will hate you forever so of course you have to you have to say that he's still in the running. The thing is though is that those groups of people the ones everyone's freaking out about because they keep kind of going along with trump instead of admitting the reality they have the least influence over the actual statutory chain of events that will be like the the certification process that leads to a president being certified like the the court cases and the count and the the legislative sessions and like the electoral college meeting. Those people are almost completely insulated on an individual level from trump in any way which means they are free to operate from the best interests of the party. The only way this real cause like there's not the only way this realistically evolves into some trump stealing. Its situation is if there's a is this through matt through just I guess the spontaneous the spontaneous moment a bunch of like career republican lifetime appointed.

Federal judges decide we're gonna do this and they and they accept some of the one of these legislation. The thing is there would have to be a whole bunch of them because this isn't florida they would have to bundle all and they have different mechanisms and different arguments. They would have to bundle them all into one to hog's breakfast of a totally conflicting incoherent case and get it in front of the supreme court. I don't think that would happen because those individual judges can make individual rulings at any point and end any one of them and make the bringing them together in the correct combination that could make it into one argument not even possible and if it got to the court. John roberts would do not and they wouldn't say he was wrong. They would deny they would deny um what do they call it when it's they would deny standing to the case. They'd say there's no standing for this charge or for this thing and they wouldn't even adjudicate it and the reason. I know that is because that's why john roberts exists in the system. John roberts is the figure and this is the reason republicans either hate him or if they're stupid or pretend to hate him if they're smart is that he exists to legitimize. The structures that are built are over time becoming more and more key to gop maintaining its minoritarian rule now of course.

If we see the continued realignment along educational attainment that's started here happen. They might not even have to worry about you know gerrymandering they might just win that's a terrible thing to think about. But it's a real possibility but for now they need these structures and the thing about a supreme court ruling that eval that validated that like monstrosity of a transparently illegitimate. Argument is that it would have to be enforced by some sort of suspension of normal democracy which would obviate the need for a supreme court. You don't need the supreme court anymore if if you don't have to worry about democrats getting in office or if it's like just acceded to naturally and everyone's like. I guess that was a ruling you heighten the likelihood that the democrats do take power again. They will neutralize the supreme court which means there's no incentive for you to do it because you have a 6-3 majority you have a 6-3 majority. What are you afraid of you are not some yokel hooting around in a woke gestapo showing up in his doorstep. Some antifa super soldiers are going to take him to get gender reassignment surgery in a fema camp don. John roberts does not knows that's not going to happen and with a 6-3 majority that they can essentially make sure that the experience of being governed by democrats is wouldn't.

You know it almost identical to the experience of being governed by republicans which is extraction at maximum velocity profits being stripped out of the employment contract as we understood it post lochner. There's no incentive to do it now so that means. I don't care what any of these yokels say they're going to keep saying it because he's right there and they can because there's nothing for them to do all. They can do is write angry letters. Now the only reason this matters or should be concerning you is if you think one of two things one that they're going to somehow turn this into a military coup which sorry nope the guy who just the guy who just said on election night. I claim these electoral votes and had jared kushner googling jim baker nope who thought that they were going to give. Vaccines to santa clauses and the malls to get people to take them unless that was all some elaborate screen and this world is not as it seems that's not going to happen. The other one is that well these guys saying this is going to get all those trump voters all riled up. They're not going to do anything. I think we know that by now but now people are still freaking out because well you know what they're doing. They're undermining the faith. In this election.

These people aren't going to accept biden as the legitimate president. They were never going to accept biden as the legitimate president. No matter what the outcome had been. They didn't accept obama as the legitimate president. The didn't accept clinton as a legitimate president. It's just the way they think about it. It's like the way they respond to the president's changing hands. It's the way they deal with the cognitive dissonance of living in america. America is a great country. The president should be great and when the president is someone they like hey. What's this the president's is legitimate the president's somebody. They don't like what's this the president is illegitimate. It's the way to deal with it without becoming a cue psycho and that's way most people process this stuff and it's the way they all are. This is just the specific narrative they're going to tell themselves well.

They just sit around bitching and posting on facebook which is all they've done and all they're going to do except of course for some crazy early cook colonels who are going to pop off and do some mass violence. But this is america honey that was going to happen anyway too. So when you see people talking about this stuff. It is because one the media is juicing it because they have to keep juicing it even if they don't want to even if they're horrified by the what they're doing and they really are. I think they really are horrified by a lot of stuff because they believe in norms they can't not do it. It's it's it's tidal gravity. They're being pulled into the black hole of this so they can't stop but at the people at the consumption level. I think people are they didn't get off on election night and they want to get off and so this time they have to tease out the struggle so that they can get another big unclench.

They can get another big zing moment of triumph but it won't be that good they'll never be that good because it's just ruined orgasms from here on out someone's birthday. Hi grace grace happy birthday. I am chill dude calmer than you are common you are dude. I'm literally being chill. I'm telling you people to chill out. I'm telling you people that this is this is theater and that it serves. Also it serves a purpose.

I don't think this is conscious but it just serves a purpose because everything serves its purpose and it's wipes you out over time the seesaw for both sides. Trump's winning now he's losing no chair. He's going to take it back. Now. He's going to lose it. Both ways. It's it's just it's drawing your soul out of you. It's it's turning you into just a joyless puppet of of a political autoerotic asphyxiation. So yeah calmer than you are calmer than you all are. I mean. I know are you really scared of trump. Doing a coup isn't that what we all really want. We want this thing to end right we want this charade to be over climate. Change is going to kill everybody in 10 years right. That's everyone everyone whenever people try to like you know create a narrative about the urgency of politics. It's climate change is going to kill us in 10 years. No human being on earth can look at the possibility of joe biden being president with mitch mcconnell being or chuck schumer being majority leader with a 50 50 senate and nancy pelosi in the house doing anything about not only climate change but thing at least trump shattering the illusion of democracy will will throw us into a new relationship to each other in the world oh my god and finally we can we can we could take begin the task of like living no longer carrying out a script of our behavior but able to be be negotiating. Alive and new frontier of course that's what people want but they're too chicken spectrum because they all have too much to lose because they don't really believe it.

They don't really believe enough in anything to die for it. What they really believe in is their own pleasure and all these structures of politics that are are built on top of that. They're built on top of pleasure. So when the moment of precipice comes what do they do do. They rush the gate do they risk getting mowed down by secret service agents and state police. They break out the karaoke machine in the barbecue grill because it's about pleasure. It's not about a felt sense of a shared material interest and the advancement of it and so no one's gonna die for this which is what we would need to be able to break out of this. This cocoon this this this political zombification that is having us that has us in an unalterable current trajectory towards annihilation and the the the optimism. I have is just that the the fundamental insufficiency is becoming so transparently true and I think even the pleasures themselves that we are offered in exchange for our quiescence are losing their luster. I think people are going to start looking around themselves. I really think they are problem is it's it's what the scary thing is is to admit the lack of your lack of ability to to direct that you can participate in it and we're all going to have to when the time comes.

But we cannot anticipate it and we cannot incept it at least not consciously consciously. We can only interact with the world around us oh speaking of the republicans. Another incentive for all the senate people like mcconnell independent of trump to keep the runoffs in georgia and it means that trump is gonna have more eyeballs on his new tv show. This is all about keeping the grip going because it's all. It's all a pyramid scheme. Like the multi-level marketing scheme is the defining is the defining post 70s american business model everything since the volker shock has been a series of interlocking and nested ponzi schemes and the reason that's viable is because when one bursts another one picks up after it because the money keeps flowing in because we are the consumers of last resort and we are the we are the police. We are the enforcers of the global rulebook and then we are the ones who gobble up all of the overflowing production at the end of the global process. So there's no production happening there's only consumption so we just have to swap things back and forth as the as the margin dwindles over time and so the exchange is. This is to spark these opportunities to provide a rent pure rent seeking the. The democrats fundraising for these senate races that had never had a chance in because they have a bunch of cucked poles that they either know are cucked.

Help make sure or cucked or are just happy to find that what's this the world we've created is one in which you can no longer actually accurately judge anything. Because you've created such an insulated cultural cocoon that only cocked people within. It will respond to the goddamn phone and you literally have a distorted view of the world around you. There's no incentive to change that because looks this. We can arbitrage that we can arbitrage this distortion in the reality perception apparatus of our political class and politically active people. We can take this this nat this built-in deformity. Now that's becoming gonna get more worse over time and use it to get these chumps to cough money up to us that we will just spend giving to each other as fees for services as campaign consultants and media creators and then to our friends in the media our. Our symbiotic sucker fish in the media get to buy get to get it in the form of money for advertisements and production costs to make ads and everyone. Who's watching has already determined their preferences because they're that's how they that's how you do it. You have an identity already the people who look at this stuff are just getting a weird background radiation that they got culturally and these ads themselves have no in no invest no ability to shape it but nothing can intervene as long as nothing intervenes with it. They're gonna as long as the money keeps flowing in. It's gonna keep spinning even though it's broken same thing with the entire tech sector and same thing with this keep you president and then when you're not president anywhere they're going to get you to be back in there now. I don't think trump's going to run again.

But I do think that he is going to try to maintain the spotlight and I don't know maybe anoint but don jr. Although he doesn't like him enough. I think he might anoint somebody else. It depends on how self how how bitter he gets specifically about. It depends on who he blames for losing and the thing is. There's no way to really know that right. Now it looks like he's blaming fox news for losing and if that's the case then I don't think he's gonna run for president again. I think he's gonna buy onan and try to out murdoch murdoch. I don't think he's. I don't buy that he's an anointed either because he doesn't understand things in terms of a legacy because he can't imagine himself ever dying because his consciousness is so psychotically narcissistic. He is so fully flattened the world into his own perception that he cannot imagine dying so he could never anoint a successor and the project isn't about a political aim. It's about his personal glory and when he's dead there can't be any more of that. So another reason he wouldn't care no object permanence so that's another reason. I don't know. I think he'll just be a media guy.

He might be dead. I mean he really could die before 2024. I mean I know it's like lol. He's alive but he did get. Scalia died at 80 remember. Nobody thought. Scalia would ever die that fat turd and then obama got him with the heart attack on it could be done.

You might go out like stan chair on what should the lumpen bourgeois focus their attention on the li on what's in front of them on their working conditions on the lives of their friends and family operate first from love operate from love. Not. A political motive operate from love people that you love and and if that conception of love is expansive enough to include people beyond your immediate family well. Then the ones closest to you are the ones you're going to be most likely to be able to figure out how to help because they're actually in front of you and then you can try to help them. You can you still listen to podcasts and look at twitter fights and be involved in politics and vote and stuff yes. But you should shave down its psychic value to you and and recognize that it is not fulfilling what the whole sensory apparatus is designed to fool you into thinking it's doing which is involved changing in some small way. The headwinds of politics like you're not even having a butterfly flapping effect you're in a vacuum that you don't know and so like. If you have things in your life issues. Like a union maybe. There is a union drive at your place of work where people are started talking about how pissed they are maybe you can reach into the ether of politics to pull something to maybe bring up but secondary secondary order not from not bringing it down saying hey guys this stuff.

Let's do this stuff because it's all it's all in a language that is not meant to be intelligible. It is meant in fact to mystify things because they teach you this. Because it mystifies you it makes it so that you that stuff that you see in front of you that is clearly evil and wrong. Maybe isn't. I mean my god have you seen these people who are talking about how talking about food deserts and like the fact that it's impossible to eat healthily. If you're poor in this country is anti-fat. It's fattest to do that you're taking the outcome of the monstrous pathologies of capitalism and you're saying that it actually is a an identity category that needs to be protected how the hell are you supposed to ever address real meaningful pain in people's lives.

If you have that kind of thought process which is inculcated by the the the college-based approach to to politics the college-based heuristic to politics it'll get you there. Like there's that classic tweet you know. I I'm a fiscal conservative but socially liberal. The problems are very bad but the causes are no. The causes are very bad but the problem no the problems are very bad but the causes the causes are good right. That's a classic tweet. For these people for this like new liberal like identitarianism that is around things like ableism and like stuff that a lot of it is the outcome of capitalist alienation. They think they say yes the problems are the causes are bad. The causes are bad. Capitalism is bad but the problems are actually good. The problems are the good things the problems need to be protected somehow. How can you go through. This rats maze to get to anything like a consensus politics that could be based around material ends you can't and so you can't bring this down. But when questions of like all right how do we how do we like do this how do we actually do this. We don't know there are people who do know and then oh here's useful information you can pull out of the ether useful information. Not this whole framework that is going to make it impossible for you to address the question but a directly useful collaboratively produced intellectual structure or idea or meme or whatever that can be applied to a specific circumstance. That's more than anything what I'm saying to people is that their relationship their the way they imagine.

The arrows flowing in the media lived experience dynamic have to change know spend all your time whipping yourself into being a political con consciousness and then trying to apply that to the world around you you start you stay. There you stay there and like it's like spiritually and personally you stay there as opposed to vent off onto the internet that much which you can only do because you're filling in the part of your soul that demands change and and loves and wants to see that see the people he loves which could be everyone happier. You have to start from that premise and this is our buddhism honestly. Takumi comes in because you have to be able to accept your own limitations and that means ex sitting with the anxiety that comes from not being able to feel like going online or voting is going to really help your destiny and the destiny of people you love. That's the real cause of all this online argumentation. I think is people are letting off the angst they feel the the underlying panic. They really do feel about the fact that we all know how bad this is and yet we can't make it any better that's horrifying and it's because people have a false understanding of their own ability to control this because of the false because of the amount of information about it. They're able to consume they're able to get a such information about things that they have no ability to control that they get this delusional. They have to they they try to even that out by imagining agency over it because to not do that is to just drive yourself kind of cracked. If you have all this knowledge of all this horrible stuff that's gonna happen and you can't do anything of it. I mean there's a she was a little loose in her shoes that cassandra because she kept she knew exactly what was gonna happen and nobody. Said believed her and that's the position of being online and so people make up for that by deluding themselves into thinking that they have agency on this plane and if they sit with their inability to change things and therefore they're not the fact that the fact they don't need to know this. They can reframe themselves around the life that's in front of them and not feel the need to flee to online to relieve the tension and relieve the stress you can sit with it and let it kind of steam off and then move forward. I mean maybe it's not buddhism. It could be christianity. It could be anything but it has to be some spiritual sense that grounds you and it can come from and it comes. It's a reinforcing dynamic between engaging the world around you and then seeing the rewards of that which are the more you pay attention.

The more you're able to pick up and it helps your ability to move forward. It helps your ability to navigate what seems otherwise overwhelming and bad about life and what sucks is that there's no guarantees and it's all very scary. But I do think that there's no good to come from scaring yourself even more than you need to be. I think there is a reason for everyone to be concerned about the moment. I mean real people's lives are really at stake it's not a game you know. I don't think we're going to see some sort of collapse in our lifetime maybe in our lifetime but right now everyone's life is hanging like closer to a thread because of how how dysfunctional this system is and how how critically the crisis within it is but the version of that reality that you get every day online is this five alarm fire of like immediate extinguishment and it's like you got to imagine that if you have like a terminal cancer diagnosis you have there's a higher likelihood that you can come to a point of like dying with less with without fear than if you're on an airplane in the wind. The wings fall off you know what I mean like you can you can come to terms and of course. It's like are you saying come to terms with death. I'm just saying like well that is what all you know life is so on a personal level yeah that is coming to nerves with death because that's what allows you to live. Because being afraid of death is what drives you to literal distraction and what drives you to feel like you can make things change on here and drive you into thinking that what is you know is a bad situation is a is. A crisis is somehow the terminal crisis which leads you to not like take terminal action but to rather to just flee into panicked paralysis.

Because remember at base of this is just the pursuit of pleasure. You don't want to feel bad so you try to feel. Good and online is the only place you can feel good and you go there to feel good by making yourself feel bad. It's some sick and we're all stuck in it and I am my god not an exception. I 100 know. I shouldn't be on here at all and I see people saying like you know oh.

These religious traditions have all been used by power to maintain itself. No material relationships of course. They are there's nothing untainted. There's no pure categories that can be critically uncritically at like a symbolic level. They have to be lived anyway. These are supposed to be low-fi beats to to whack off. I mean to to relax to relax to and do homework so let's check some let's check some stuff more. New religions are more political than the old ones inherently because when they emerge there's more politics in people's self identity like politics grows within a per like a person has a greater degree of like a political self-conception. The greater degree that they live as a liberal subject so like religiosity is literally drained out of your like personal practice of life by your removal from a social context and it's replaced with politics and so there's a political assumption baked into it and yes. I think that is one of the big reasons that islam is. The most inherently political of the big. Abrahamic religions is because it emerges latest. It emerges at the latest like level of of social atomization because there is like sort of a city like pull away from communal bonds that like subs you don't need to be rational. You don't need political reasoning to sustain religion when it is carried out at the at the level of like a fully bonded social order because what's going to interfere with it. It's only when people are broken out of those networks that that the symbolic order like the the granularity of the symbols becomes less like the pixels get bigger basically and it has to be filled in with like a secular morality basically and like the enforcement of secular ethics so yeah like.

I think that if we do get some sort of global working-class movement that somehow like cuts off the head of this this slowly you know communing asian and american and atlantic capital formations. Let me somehow cut that head off it's going to be religiously diverse but religious it will be religious. It will have to have a religious character to it because only religion of some kind not not as a structure but as a feeling can sustain you through the un glamorous. Not pleasurable work of politics both both even if that's true if we're talking revolutionary confrontation with the state or the slow grinding of hard boards through electoral reform. Either way you need an engine of of religious something and it doesn't have to even be. It doesn't have to be supernatural. It could like it could be completely stripped of that it could just be like an objective a a moment-to-moment communal identification between yourself and humanity broadly construed like you could be a hegelian and none of this will impact your material analysis. Because the material analysis will not be driven by an underlying supernatural delusion. It'll be driven by a desire to help everybody a desire to help us overcome. These contradictions within our society and provide a general welfare for the first time in human history. Solidarity is a religious concept yes even if it is completely secular.

It is still religious in that it involves a feeling not any kind of um consequentialist ethic or like utilitarian. Utilitarian ethical formulation and I'm thinking and the reason that this movement would be ecumenical is because because people would be coming to it not from a position of installing and dogma but from helping each other's material conditions when people across religious lines get together. They're not going to be asking about religious litmus tests because they're not worried about that they're worried about putting food on the table they're worried about making a families and that the only situation that will allow them to continue perpetrating any religious practice and so they will over time and in the aggregate if not in the individual case religion religion will maintain its centrality to a personal personal life while allowing them to participate fully in in a non-sectarian political practice and if that's not possible. Then there is no future for humanity if that sounds insane to you then show me on the board where anything else happens other than the common ruin of the contending classes. Qnon is not secular at this point. Q anon is a religious movement.

I mean I've realized now that the question of that a lot of people asked of what do they do when they realize it doesn't happen was always kind of silly. Now. I must say here that a lot of people are going to just stop paying attention apparently huge like. On the actual q websites is dropping like traffic. I get it a lot of people for a lot of people like I said this is a this is like the horoscope or like a a sports team that they follow and now with trump gone and like the the psychological math different you stop paying attention but for people who are really invested in it. These people are not like standing at the precipice of like this great disappointment from the original idea of q which was the deep state.

Pedos are going to all go to jail in a week which was the original pitch between then and now they have had so many moments of disappointment where they have had to convince themselves to continue believing that they have done religious practice over four years to have convinced themselves to take a leap of faith over almost any specific instance. They have they have created religious a religious logic to this thing now over the spending four years being disappointed and then reapplying reasserting oneself by creating a new bound of faith getting to the precipice and stepping through it. That is creating a religious practice and a religious and a spirituality or in a lot of these people's cases transferring or act like activating a spirituality. Because remember. These guys are all christian but we have talked about how secular christianity is now. It is american christianity is just the pursuit of heaven on earth as as a as a material squalid pursuit of pleasure accumulated in the now. It has no there's no engine of anything but self-interest and pleasure. What they're doing with q is turning that original self-seeking understanding of the world into a religious one by creating a a real spiritual communion with not everybody in the world but with the people who aren't demonic with the saved and that's because they've spent four years convincing themselves over and over again to take another step. So they have reinvigorated christianity. They have awakened christianity from its materialist slumber so it is a in my opinion or will become a fifth or fourth great awakening.

But what that means is of course up to debate a lot of people think that means oh there'll be a political movement with power. I don't know if that's true they might it might just stay in the culture. Because remember. This is all culture and the political element is to give the culture more juice to give you more pleasure out of consuming it. And if you have religion you don't really need culture so much so who knows they might. They might just turn it into like a a a They could go violent but and I think some of them will but a lot of them the ones who are relatively materially well-off the ones who aren't really on the ranger's edge of sustenance and aren't really feeling precarity. I think they might develop it into like a a a um a quietest faith like a pre-pre-political christianity like until like crit like the way evangelicals were in america until the 70s where you weren't really supposed to get involved in in politics that could happen too don't know don't.

I'm not trying not to do predictions beyond broad broad sweep stuff because I feel pretty confident about the broad stuff because that's the level that I'm consuming and sort of formulating it's it. But like the thing you can never account for is is contingency and contingency only matters in the moment so you can only give full shape to something after the contingencies have all been resolved ah so yeah that's as far as I'll go in predicting cube. But I do think that that's the that's the line we're on with those guys and I think that a similar thing will hopefully happen on the left because you know q didn't start really within the political process. It started online maybe. Some sort of materially reflected version could happen and then be brought into like the into the media superstructure and then and then sort of reflected and organized like within the media but sort of also orthogonal to it because it's not constitutive. It's not depending on the same structures that like recoup all of the all and like enforce like hidden. Ideological demands on all speech within the bubble because it will not depend on those networks. Those patriots networks though those media income streams those those clout networks those like I those groups of people who have like a a series of Every every faction online is made up of people who are simply passing code words back and forth to determine who's good and who's bad and that's why they'll never be able to coalesce into a meaningful political project.

Something will have to emerge from below engage burst into the political consciousness but without any commitment to those group shibboleths so that when they start throwing their slings and arrows they just bounce off you have no power here be gone because the argumentation and the the the incentives within this structure are that either republican or democrat it's the same republican or democrat remember. This you're rewarded to the degree that you can threaten to credibly kick someone out of the tent. That's all you're doing you're not making a argument with a good faith incentive towards um resolution of an issue to make something happen remember. This is all entertainment. Your. Your incentive is is to just keep the gut fight going so your only power within the fight is to be have enough of you who are scared enough to follow your line to punish people who don't follow your line. But you have to care about your role within the ecosystem your clout position or your media signature for that to work which means if something comes in outside of it and the people within it have a self-generating interaction. Like they have their own clout network. They have their own funding network.

They have their own infrastructure that when those arguments are from both sides turn to it they will bounce off and then the people who are captured by these narratives will maybe be able to look at something freshly and not have them have something immediately like rejected because it's not ideologically like co presented in a way that like they recognize as good because that's all they're doing is trying to recognize good bad. It just it'll be like oh look at this good. Five five years now six years now ah it would be funny if trump did a mishima just got up on the on the balcony of the rose garden and just started eating cheeseburgers just never just not stopping.

The scariest gladio group is no question that people who've carried out the brabont killings holy. I've talked about it before on the stream in the late 80s right around the end of the cold war. There was this insane six month. I believe crime spree in in belgium where these this group of three guys in a panel van were carrying out incredibly spectacularly violent robberies of of gas stations and grocery stores often in broad daylight in which they would just open fire on crowds of people inside these places for very little money for like cash register. Leavings and it was never solved which is insane when you think about it. It was the entire country was in a proximal of terror like am I going to get murked on my way to buy some disgusting cheese and people connected to the glad like the established gladio networks like the right-wing paramilitary groups that were made up of many nato's troops who were found in possession with nato weaponry and and even classified documents were connected to weapons caches of that were found of the vermont.

Killers might have been connected to mark dutrow and his his child kidnapping ring. Ooh that's the that is the group that's the like the real satanic heart of the whole thing like the is almost cute compared to that stuff like oh yeah. It's like they're doing the strategy of tension and like they're doing a bunch of terror attacks and blaming them on the left so that political repression will ranch up and the the communists will look bad and oh yeah. Although moro might make a compromise and bring the communists in the government well we'll just frame the left for kidnapping him and then kill him that'll it's all just feels like a good old-fashioned realpolitik. But the. It's like what what's going on man what are they doing in there because I have not found any of the theories around what the point of the verb killing is very persuasive. I mean strategy of tension in belgium. It's like okay but they weren't even like political. They didn't even like use a false flag political justification. It was just make everyone jumpy. It's like I guess but did belgium really need that at that point in time. I'm not. I don't know enough about belgian history. Maybe that was a crucial like hinge point.

Like maybe there was some government that was going to come in or something. Maybe it was a cover for an assassination although they've never been able to find any connection between any of the victims very baffling and then when you can and when he connected with dutrow incredibly sinister the darkest the dark heart of of the atlantic beast the atlantic beasts that we must all which we must all root for the defeat of we must all pray for the eventual conquest the defeat of the demonic atlantic beast the seven-headed nato monster by the by the the dragon head of china. There's so many pedophiles in the catholic church. For the same reason. There are so many pedophiles among leaders of cloistered religious communities all over the world because if you have a situation where a position of that sort of intimate power exists people who seek it out will put it towards the ends that it allows for that's why power collects the worst of us because you have to be bad to want to do these things it's going to go through these things and with the catholic church specifically. I mean john paul. Ii spent his entire reign looking the other way on child molesters because they were anti-communists because he was kept. He was all in on winning the cold war all right guys.

I want an answer from you guys say that I'm totally wrong and that they're doing a coup like it comes on the radio count has been suspended. Trump has been sworn in like they just swear him in what do you what are you specifically the person listening to this. What are you going to do. I'm not challenging you. I'm asking you like you hear it. You hear the news. What do you do right away. I'm just curious. I'm not challenging like you hear it. What do you what is your instinct to do. I don't even know what. I would.

I'm just asking okay so if we assume that if not what we would do but what we collectively would do would be insufficient to stop this from happening. How would our relationship to politics change how in our relationship to the way we consume media change would we keep listening to pod save america and chapo because they wouldn't ban them would we keep going to work. We keep paying rent if you think there's any question there if you think that it might happen here's the deal if you think it might happen if you think we might actually coordinate a resistance to this that has a chance of doing anything other than being symbolic and short-lived. Then they will not try to do it because why risk losing when they don't have to when they've got this thing by the balls and they really just have to deal with this guy's ego and you know his dumb followers. He's riled up like that's really all they have to deal with if on the other hand. There's no chance that we could possibly stop them. Then they don't need to do it. See see what I'm saying either way you can free yourself from this pentagon if we think we know what's going on I guarantee you that like there are pentagon planners who have run the numbers on like the our civil our civil capacity for resistance in the face of just the overnight abnegation of the democratic process and there would be a percentage base that they would have on how high the like. The attrition of that would be how low the stock market would go for example and I don't think it would be in any one nobody's actuarial chart is going to have them decide to do that unless they're like oh yeah we could roll over them well.

Then why bother why bother with any headache at all. They're not a danger. They're not a threat. They're happy with their bottle put biden. In there let everyone get mad at him because there's going to be no pressure from the bottom forcing this. That is what I must stress. There's no just like you would do nothing like.

I said if there was some if if biden somehow like did a did a coup on him. I don't even know how it would work now that he won but like when he's declared victory and they all feel like it was a coup because think of it this way when biden is finally like sworn in it will feel as much like a coup to them as the supreme court like nullifying a bunch of votes and giving it to trump would feel like a coup to you and what would they do and the answer is the exact same one that you would you have given so there's no pressure from below. To make this happen. It would have to be a cold calculated move from people whose investment in the system goes beyond donald trump's personal ego and the thing is about this that I'm so happy about is that if I'm wrong if I'm wrong then it doesn't matter because I'm sorry if you're trying to own people online about how they were wrong about the coup if you're trying to score some points and get some clout off the fact that the coup actually did happen and you didn't none of us stopped it then. I'm sorry you are the loser you are forever and eternally the loser and even though I was wrong. I still win because I don't have to minutes on a cricket phone in a refugee camp to post on like whatever's left of twitter in code about how you were right so yeah if I'm wrong it doesn't matter. I still spent my time before that happened less anxious for no good reason less with a little not my stomach that I was tending like a little instead of feel like no. It's my civic duty to feel upset right. Now. It's my civic duty to feel bad about what's happening that there's going to be a coup. Do you see why this is nerd test and that you're going to get a grade on how you did as like a citizen. You think that you secretly think there's a someone grading you and there's nobody grading you. There's no teacher anyway calmer than you are dude calmer than you are peace.
