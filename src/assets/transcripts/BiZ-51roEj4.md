I won't be coming home I gotta start a new life. Let's Take a Letter Maria address Loves a Woman. It's hard to understand how she could find more pleasure in the arms of another man. I'll work nope um was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life all work and no play has just cost me a wife. Take a Letter Maria address. Gotta start a new life. You have been things but most of all good secretary to me it just so happens. I'm free. Tonight would you like to have dinner with me that sounds amazing. It's a huge violation of sounds a huge a huge. violation of HR directives for any industry. He's like well I just broke up with my wife what are you doing tonight Oh someone said I'm looking like Sam Hyde damn. No I need to get a haircut. I need to cut I need to take care of this. It's far too much. I'll do it. Soon I look very nice and very very presentable. I can clean up a little bit but yeah I look. I look a little disheveled today. That's fine.

But it's true. I should I should do better are these streams AstroTurf someone else that's an interesting question. What does that even mean at this point like is am I being paid secretly to do them. If I am I don't know it. That's all I could say which does not mean that I could not be a a unwilling dupe a useful idiot and I think I probably am to some extent but not to any greater extent than anyone else. So therefore no reason to sweat it at home. I got it started look. It's gonna have to just be Twitter forever okay. There's no escaping Twitter. It is. It's the vessel. It cannot be shattered without unleashing spirits that are otherwise going to destroy the Republic. So it has to be embodied. Somewhere. The energy has to be channeled through some Crystal and none of these other ones can do it because they are a reaction to the thing itself and that means that they by definition. Miss some element of the thing.

They're just this broke off shard so you got blue sky which is like nice. Twitter right is that the idea like what if it was nice and it had nice people there and then threads which appears to be brand Twitter and because those two those are the two things that are being shed by the current Elon Musk Twitter right are the sensitive Souls who don't like all of the elevated based content and of course the advertisers who are similarly alienated from that sort of presentation and so blue sky is hey what if we all were nice to each other and then threads is hey what if we got all those Brands and celebs back and they were just posting about how awesome it is to use their product and yeah. You can see what your stupid friends are saying but the the the the focus the eye of Sauron is fully fixed on the um the glories the brands and the celebrities and so you get. These things that don't have the whole complement of possibilities which is I I think that eventually the Saudis are just gonna buy it out just like they did the PGA. The Saudis have brought billions of dollars out of this country and now they must bring it back. It is ebb and flow title gravity.

At this point all non-extraction Industries are lost leaders for petro-capitalism. They can't run a profit. The government can give them lend them money to keep them afloat but that is it. They cannot make money on their own terms because our productivity has stalled and collapsed. This is what happens at the end stage of a mode of production when its contradictions have clogged its innards and when you have a broken the conveyor belt between human energies and productive economy. People are not motivated to produce at any level and so they don't motivation means many things for a long time. In America it meant a promise of a higher station and it's just it's gone away like the belief in the system has gone away and so the energy you know it is the rate of the profit to fall is is one of the really more mystical Concepts within Marx because like you can say on a on a billboard. Oh. It's you know only humans can create value and therefore if you have a system that does not have has diminishing human inputs. Then it can't create profit but what that actually means is human mind put to the task of production and it just it can't go beyond a certain threshold. Once the positive Energies that are Unleashed by Society turn into just pure pathological back blowback which is what happens when the productive engine stalls out because this problem is at the heart of capitalism.

It's displaced by creation of Empire the spatial fix as David Harvey calls it but over time that spatial fix is overcome by the totalizing of capitalism there's nowhere else to spatially extract outside of the system and so it's going to start eating itself. It's been eating itself for about 40 years. Now. I mean it was eating itself the whole time but the massive destruction of capital created by World War II gave the United States an opportunity to create a new or a relationship between subjects and their government and their economy as though those are different things I mean the government the economy anyway. they're only refracted you know culturally as two different things. They are of course a holistic thing the one one organism.

But that relationship was temporarily and and expanded. The concept of citizenship and rights was temporarily expanded a a net a safety net undergirded how far you could fall but at the same time gave real potential benefits to advancing that was all predicated on the ruthless bringing into capitalist. supply chain the economies of the rest of the world where instead of having the same process happened that happened in Europe where you have a domestic capitalist class like build up capital and then reinvest it locally. Instead. You have what what is better for the center of that system which is just extraction of raw materials at the lowest possible crisis so that they can be created at the high Capital intensive industry in the center drawing out from the from the periphery to the center like literally blood sucking. But what that means is that there is no growth here in any sector other than the stuff that push keeps the thing moving itself the blood of the blood oil and so there's still piles of money to be made in extraction and so that money is going to have to more and more directly subsidize that portion of profit making in in the core countries that the government is basically inflation limited to continue because Twitter this thing that is now a load-bearing part of a huge segment of like the media ecosystem and media subjectivity of many American citizens.

The ones most likely to vote and actively participate in the Civil Life. was built by the US government just giving free money to The tech sector extraction is an infinite. Note. No it isn't that's why it's the whole thing is starting to shudder but but for now it is the only thing that has real value and so Twitter was created in this context where money was essentially free. Profit was a second secondary consideration which had never been true in any other capitalist. Enterprises but now if you didn't have that guarantee of free money there's nothing worthwhile to invest in nothing is worth the risk because the returns are not big enough talking about motivation again the motivation of the people in this system to carry out their their assigned task of lending money of building economic growth and so Twitter. Not it could have stumbled along I mean it would probably be doing better than it is under musk right now just because he he bought it for such an inflated rip price and then put that debt onto Twitter's books.

But they would still be in like long-term trouble if like there's anything you can even conceive of that in this current economy. As if there isn't only the kick the bucket next quarter But it was. It was only made viable by that government infusion and now where the government is no longer infusing. The US is trying to bring interest rates up there might bring Capital into the United States and that means bringing in this money. From these literal money spigots in the Middle East.

They're buying out the institutions and they'll buy out Twitter too probably and in this context we have this new wild where the neoliberal globalist Market the the the International Community the United States had built to replace the Cold War. camps is now being dismantled in the name of energy Independence and like green transition so the United States is now essentially declaring a trade war on everyone including its allies including its Japanese Korean European allies and and essentially forcing them to either drastically change their degree of government investment in Alternative Energy technology or be cut out of the market completely which means we're back to multi-polarity I mean people who are flapping their their flippers together every day about multi-polarity and the need to be multi-polar well. It's happening like you can cheer or not like it doesn't really matter. This is just now where things have to go to keep this thing going because yeah what replaces this and it's direct investment in infrastructure spending the old the old way but without but that can't that cannot sit with. This supposedly you know global economic order that does not have that that actually had at its heart.

The assumption that the United States would de-industrialize like that was the premise of the 70s. sort of reorientation of global capitalism was to say the us is going to go away from being a con. A producer is going to become just a consumer and now to change that is to break up the entire balance of powers. So we're going to see what multi-polarity looks like. It probably looks like greater threat of thermonuclear war than we've ever had before. But we'll see but now I mean we're in a situation where it's it's just a bunch of State capitalist Enterprises trying to keep themselves afloat. You. I don't think you should think about any any ideologies anywhere including China or anywhere else you have existing power infrastructures made up of bureaucrats in government and outside of it in the private sector.

Some like they're essentially networks that lace between organizations. Their people positioned in different organizations who don't just talk to each other in their organization but talk to other members of other organizations and those lateral networks are where power actually resides within the greater edifices of the system. They're all fighting to keep their phony baloney jobs. As Government lopetamine said in Blazing Saddles they are trying to keep growth up enough to prevent serious breakdown in their economic system. That is what they're doing. Everything is a more than anything a post-hoc rationalization of what they have considered that they have to do that transcend political consideration and ideology just to keep the lights on which they think of as unideological and therefore they don't deliberate about ideologically but of course it's deeply informed by ideology because the assumption is the only way to save Society the only way to save my nation or my race or whatever. I however I consider it is for this specific or structure of power that I am in to persist that is the assumption that is wrong that all of them share and it means that they will Act in the same way to maximize growth full steam ahead with total Global. conflict economic competition that we have not seen since Europe in 1914.

And honestly it's like the best we can hope for is for a new Cold War which is what they're already starting but like an actual stable fronted one. But the problem is is that the last Cold War was never not violent. Obviously it was peripherally violent I guess. The question is can. We reorientate towards a new cold war between the United States and China that has a similar level of peripheral violence now is that the best case scenario for Humanity probably not but it is what the people in power are going to have on the menu of options to power them as they frantically react to to things that are happening by their will but without their conscious knowledge. I mean yeah like in a new Cold War we would be in the position of the the United States. Vis-a-vis China would be in the position that the Soviet Union was vis-a-vis the United States buying time for an eventual dissolution. The only real question is does the United States at its heart have enough human blood pumping in its veins to avoid going down and bringing everybody with us by launching nukes at the last moment before the thing really dissolves or are there enough people at the heart people at the heart to say we're just going to have to change. We're going to have to change who we are and how we relate to each other.

That's what now the the Russians did that because they had a vision that was you know ideal in the west we we talked about it. As oh these are ideas of freedom and democracy that they're embracing and that was the popular gloss. But the people who grasp for power the post-soviet Russia were people who saw the prospect of plunder. They saw the prospect of the post-soviet world being one where they personally could be enriched and because the Soviet Union God love it had failed to produce a non-alienated subject not alienated from the institutions that they're embedded in plenty of people in positions of authority were like.

I will take that deal. I will I will let you buy out my human soul. I don't think Gorbachev actually counts. I think Gorbachev is a genuine believer in communism and he was left to frantically flail and and try to improvise around the material reality that the Soviet economic model was in terminal crisis and that to fix the problem at the heart of it would have required people in power to lose it and they didn't want to do that and so they let it fall apart and many of them chose the buyout because it was a better option. Now this time there will be no buyout China's got enough of its own people to deal with and and we've already. We don't have any more copper to strip but they had an entire State apparatus to sell off ah maybe. Some people can be bought into the greater you know sinnosphere but only at the very very top not through the middle. Ranks like was that like what happened in the Soviet Union. We'll see a leveraged buyout of the ruling class by the Chinese ruling class would be better for everybody although that's still on the relative timetable like the Soviet.

The the Chinese bias out demobilize our nukes and America does decline into you know a drastically lower standard of living place which it would but you know finds a social equilibrium at that point instead of launching nukes that happens you know capitalism will still be eating through the core of Earth and we will be dealing with that so like establishing that equilibrium is going to take a lot of real. Real Horror I think that's what has to be effaced is that whatever is coming will require transformation which is scary because we've only ever known in our life things being different to be worse that's part of the general structure of psychopathy that the culture reinforces that you are the only real thing in the universe that everyone else is fundamentally at odds with you except for maybe a few people that you love you know and by loving them you get to affirm some sort of like connection to a human project but then you also use your love for them as a way to deepen your hostility to literally everybody else Upper Volta with Burgers very funny darwin69 420 very nice Darwin yes America will be Upper Volta with burgers but I think yeah it's all going to be fine for all of us. One way or the other and the reason I believe that is because the opposite belief that we're all doomed and that there's no point leaves me in the exact same position than I would be otherwise with the exact same other belief I don't know which one of those beliefs will guide me to action that I know deeper than reason are good for me that's an easy question that's not a difficult contest.

Therefore the one that is true reveals itself because truth transcends reason. It has to like the reason that we think of as reason is actually self-motivated. Psychopathic individualism and it's not anyone's fault because we live in a machine to create Psychopaths where the only social behavior that is rewarded by the structures of it our Psychopathic ones oh man. Someone wants to talk about the Maghrib oh very very depressing. I don't know I don't know what you're even supposed to say that doesn't seem glib. You know like there's Horrors. But there's you know always Horrors and you still have to live and how are you gonna do it. The answer is never going to exist out there at that level from you.

It's always going to be closer to home. Now. I mean nothing new happened. It's just that they have a they're in a cycle there that is particularly vicious. It's hard to see anything intervening with just a a downward pressure. You know because it's a it's. It's it's in the sniper scope of the whole. Global illness that we're suffering. France certainly didn't help.

I think my favorite Western someone asked will have to always be the Wild Bunch because I saw it at a formative age and it was really really cool and made me read the Sam Pack and Paul biography that was like 600 pages. I read that in like Junior High I think that's normal is that normal I'm just gonna go out and say it's normal. It's gonna will everyone agree with me. Good. I did read Quentin Tarantino's book which you know would not have been published at all if he had not been Quentin Tarantino because it is very rough and we have very conversational. You know the man's a born podcaster.

He himself has said that a podcast that existed in the early 90s he wouldn't have been a director and that is terrifying to think of but absolutely true because you know it's the lowest way. It's the easiest way to like get yourself out which is you know the whole urge behind that like I need others to see this this thing coming out of me and you know yeah. But the the only like the least only the laziest and lowest of character are gonna are gonna succeed there podcasters. I honestly think Tarantino is talented enough that he still would have pushed past that barrier. Now though he's made 10 movies. He's proved his point. Now. He wants the podcast and he does have a podcast which is amazing after he made up that Rick Dalton died. He did a whole podcast about Rick Dalton and his career retrospective analysis of movies that have never been made and then did a fake interview of himself as Rick Dalton. It's like it's embarrassing I guess if you're a you know want to be a dork about it. But it's it's just cool to watch somebody. Just vibing.

You know he's clearly having a good time but the book is very interesting because it's essentially his fablements instead of I think that yeah he could never unironize enough to do a movie about his childhood in the like. The direct way that Spielberg is able to but It's the same idea of showing you through his experiences as a child how he came about having the weird. That's in his movies. Like It gives you a key to read them psychologically and that's the most interesting part because he talks at length about growing up in LA with his mom who left his dad and then he had a stepdad but then she broke up with him and started exclusively dating black guys and she was moving around in like it's clearly a It's clearly not a stable household. He talks about like having to live with roommates and his mom and and he just gets immersed in like the black community in like Inglewood California and befriends like her.

Her mom's sisters like fail brother named Floyd who becomes his like surrogate dad and it just he's just giving you a prism to see the entire. Like psychology running through his films just like Spielberg does with families which I enjoyed it's not great. It's not one of his best films but it is as a Spielberg fan. it is an interesting and enjoyable experience just to see you know the sparks fly as he's trying to give you. His obviously sanitized version of the deep pathologies that drive him to make films including wanting to bang his mom. Apparently and people have talked a lot about the last shot and I gotta say It's great it's a wonderful last shot. I actually laughed. It's. It's It's fun yeah.

Like you watch you you think about you watch that movie and you watch his mom like literally getting in a car and driving towards a tornado and then having to like leave the family and then you think of Close Encounters have a Third Kind which was the last film before Fable men's that Spielberg has a writing credit on and it's like oh. He is he's his mom he's identifying with his mom look at this and of course. There's a thing of plant chat in Crystal Skull having the same haircut as as Spielberg's mom but that honestly feels like that feels like a red herring that feels like a chaff thrown up to protect the deeper. Truths. That of course are not to be found on the glossy surface of a movie like that because like obviously he's lying but lying in a very revealing way like because like while he's lying. He's also you know showing you how he thinks and that is fascinating yeah and I can't stop thinking about that what Ford says at the end if the Horizons at the bottom it's interesting if The Horizon's at the top it's interesting if it's in the middle.

It's boring as. It's like damn homie. You broke it down very excited about the new Scorsese. Also oh my goodness. I'm so excited well Scott's Napoleon. Yes. I'm not a huge Ridley Scott fan as people might know but I am a sucker for Napoleon and I don't even care that that Joaquin Phoenix plays him from when he's in his 20s and you might go oh the guy's 50 but there are absolutely zero 20 something actors in Hollywood that could project Napoleonic swag. Just can you think of one who could who could project that that energy if you say Timothy chalamet I will up I watched that Dune and guess what he stunk. Sorry Army Hammer is like 45 now and that what he would be able to do it. The kids I mean R.I.P but you know he might be a cannibal but damn he's got he's got old-fashioned energy. I do not get this chalamet thing I do not get why he is good. It seems like he is good for the same reason that pop stars are. They appeal to pubescent girls and it's like that's fine a movie star should and should make pubescent girls happy. They just should not only do that if you don't do the other quadrants if you cannot inspire libidinal engines of the other quadrants. Then you're not a movie star but now as the whole concept decays. It makes sense that now we have a fundamentally only pop stars left in in the guise of movie stars they're saying you can't judge him until the next movie. I'm sorry how about a movie be a movie.

One time I know I've said this before but my God. Vehicle probably the most influential automobile of the last 40 years and what's fascinating is that after World War II we did get a military style vehicle enter public use. That's the Jeep but the Jeep was always sort of an outlier. It was like its own thing but the Kia and they could run over an entire Kindergarten class without anyone seeing it happen above the Hood but my God. If you want to talk about bringing the war home that's how we brought the war home by cosplaying in these things and these things got huge after 9 11. We wanted to bring the war home and we are we continue to in stages. We have an installment plan of bringing the war home. Okay.

 the Hummer is a high Mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv used for cargo or troop transport. It can be fitted with the tow missile launcher system as an anti-tank vehicle as a light attack vehicle. It carries the mk19 automatic grenade launcher and the 50 caliber machine gun or 7.62 millimeter gun with armor protection for its crew hell yeah. I gotta say a huge fan. Of the mk19 automatic grenade launcher the thing I know I'm saying oh our horrible militarism but got to give it up. For that thing. It looks like a T-shirt cannon and you can just destroy an entire building with it. manufacturer LTV missiles and electronic group that sounds like somebody did that sounds like it's from some of these basement they just put out a shingle like yeah. That's us the having this done on Fiverr speed 65 miles per hour range 300 miles primary function cargo slash Troop Carrier crew one and seven troops remember when they weren't getting the armor.

This was a big Scandal during the bush years when you couldn't directly challenge the war itself. We all were in we were all imbricated with that blood. We had all agreed that there would have to be a blood sacrifice after 9 11 that Afghanistan was not sufficient that we needed a spectacle of Redemptive violence. That is what we all understood that's why honestly at the end of the day you talk too much about the specifics of you know who was selling the Iraq War. What else could we have done someone that had to die for 9 11. There had to be a blood sacrifice and it had to be commensurate with the the wound created by it. The the degree of cultural fixation had to be matched. Afghanistan didn't do the job and you had people in power who were in exact position to direct that flow of anger so instead of criticizing the war which of course John Kerry the candidate in 2020 2024.

2004. voted for there was a minute where they thought it was going to be Howard Dean but everyone realized at the last minute. We actually all liked the war. We actually all thought it was a good idea. All of us we kind of did and I'm not saying everyone you can say oh. I marched against the war people marched against the war. There was yes but among that crucial center of gravity of American voters home owners. They were in favor of the war broadly and they didn't want somebody running to shine a shameful light on that decision they wanted somebody who would let bygones be God bygones and that's why they settle on carry. At least that's what that's how they thought maybe a left. anti-war person could have like cut through the bush so these scandals about the war were all they didn't do it right. They didn't give them enough killing supplies and one of the big ones was that the Hummers were not adequately armored. In fact there's a joke in Arrested Development about a The like the golf cart this golf cart having better like a golf cart mobile thing having better body armor than a Hummer Okay. So we've got a military skill first aid. It's true somebody's asking about the dean scream.

I was there. I'm older than most of you people. I was a dniac obviously because I was a little. I was a little good little left liberal still am probably in my heart. Let's be honest. What else am I doing with my time. But when Dean collapsed in Iowa like the two weeks leading up to Iowa as everybody got cold feet which is basically what it was like part of. It was that Gephart basically decided to do a suicide run against Dean to stop him from getting. The nomination dumped all of his money and because he was the union guy he had just a spigot of money from the unions dumped all his money on trashing Dean but it only worked because the Libs got cold feet. Maybe maybe gephard help remind him of it but they were probably never. Gonna go for it But that collapse was so instantaneous and so dramatic. He went from first by a comfortable margin to sucking hind tit in two weeks that the whole thing was popped.

There was no way he was going to win another major primary and that Dean scream was really just him acknowledging that him letting out the barbaric Yap to recognize that he the thing he was grasping for would eluding and then we backward masked that expression ah as the cause and I think that's honestly how we think about. That's the main problem in our understanding of causality especially when we're talking about politics and history is that a lot of the time what we're taking for causes are actually effects of things that have already happened and the dean scream is an example of an effect that became causal because it was a specific incident which is much easier to understand and arrange in a line with other incidents into a causality than an ambient thing which is like hundreds of thousands of Iowans just pussing out because maybe they the they heard somebody call him a latte lip lipping latte sipping liberal or something. I I somebody says they heard sucking hind tit for the first time since their Grandma I probably said it because I I'm rewatching Deadwood and Al just said that find out how much tolliver's paying woo I don't want to be sucking High tit on disposal fees so yeah the dean scream. I think is what I would lead with if I was doing a any kind of political science. seminar I would say here's the thing that has been historically remembered as the cause of a campaign's collapse when it is actually the consequence of a deeper structural shift and I think all of our jobs as socialist. Social scientists is to not even like argue about it but just try to try to document that terrain the deeper terrain than of the incidents. It's to drill deeper than incident which is hard and it goes against It goes against information's utility because we can only really use information if it directs to the sort of causal thing that something like the dean screen would be part of and and that's the thing political stuff for the most part is not actionable and so we don't need to extract that level of specificity we cannot go. We can rely on the general because we're not doing anything okay. The military skill here is first aid. First Data is emergency care given to the sick injured or wounded before medical personnel arrive. Many lives are saved by the quick effective actions of people trained in first aid. The two basic concepts of emergency measures are stop. The bleeding start the breathing. In addition it is imperative to prevent shock and dress any wounds to avoid infection. All military personnel are schooled in first aid. Civilians can learn about first aid classes by contacting their local Red cloths. Cross or Hospital I mean what do you say about that yeah. Correct don't really have anything to add first aid it's important okay.

This is another this is another repeat I think of an of the reserves card. I think we did one about the reserves so I'm not going to do that again. I think we talked about Kent State. did we have Tel Aviv or do we only have Jerusalem man. There's a lot of stuff about Israel. In these cards. It's a day in the early 90s this big brick. House I think he was actually like the grandson or the son of the New Jersey. police State Police commander who investigated the Lindbergh kidnapping anyway. I'm talking about a guy and I don't even have his card that's why how much we need Schwarzkopf anyway yeah. I think we did do Tel Aviv too business intellectual political Center of Israel yeah scud missiles. We know the deal there should not be this.

Many repeats very annoying here wait a minute Austria again did we get Austria I swear to God we got Austria again I swear to God. We already did Austria I'll just skim it. Otherwise 400 years until 1866 it had been a continental European Empire. They really dropped the fumbled the bag. There. Vienna was considered the intellectual capital of Europe in the 18th and 19th century yeah. There was a time in the early 1900s when Trotsky Stalin Freud Hitler all live there. after World War One Austria was reduced to its present power in size. Oh sorry Austria Austria joined the United Nations in 1955. For Operation Desert Storm Austria Friday Transportation use of airspace well isn't that nice of you we propped your country up after World War II. it's 32 374 square miles population is 7.62 million. The language is German the predominant religion is Roman Catholicism thank you Ferdinand II capital of Vienna government type federal republic and the head of government good old Chancellor Franz ranitsky.

I don't know what he's up to probably dead. Here we go. This is a badass airplane. These huge planes are really cool. this is a B-25 or sorry B-52 strato. Fortress a Navy pilot like just belly flopped into a field at an air show. Anyone know that story somebody knows that story somebody shouted out into the comments if they remember that guy's name. It's like Barnett or something B-52. Strato Fortress for more than 30 years the heart of the Strategic Air Command. The B-52 is a long-range heavy bomber that can fly at altitudes of up to 50 000 feet with the use of aerial refueling the straddle. Fortress could stay in the air almost indefinitely. More than 250 B-52s remain in Readiness throughout the air command and 48 through hundreds of sorties during Operation Desert Storm. So they just annihilated places. I believe these are the airplanes that are being refueled erratically in the opening of Dr Strangelove. I'm looking this up since nobody's helping me yes that's it Arthur Bud Holland. That's his name good old Bud Holland yep a B-52 strato Fortress if anyone's ever seen the video of that you just going sideways and then just move right into the cockpit amazing love.

Our military manufacturer. Boeing are good friends at Boeing. You know Boeing is one of those guys where if all capitalists acted like Boeing you might be able to advance through productivity problems and like actually you know intensify like meaningfully technological inputs in a way that you know fixes things. because what capitalists don't do is is once they have an industry. They basically try to sit on it and use their influence over government to protect themselves as incumbent vendors. Boeing came from a family that made their money in Timber which was the first big boom of the post of the 19th century. Pacific Northwest like Seattle was a Timber town and the boeings were Timber Barons and then the and he just goes down and like begs to be flown up in one and eventually pivots to Aerospace. He puts his company's Capital behind like the development of this technology which now none of them do. There is no room for that kind of of risk because of the the general declining condition of profit. the speed 595 miles per hour range 10 133 miles armaments four 50 caliber machine guns and up to 60 000 pounds of bombs or 12 air launched cruise missiles. they've got machine guns. What are they for are they going to get like shot out of the sky. Do. They got to do like the flying the the Memphis Bell type.

You're not strafing anybody in that are they all right we've got noise light and litter discipline look. At this nerd. They literally have a card about being a good boy and picking up after yourself in the Army and the guy they got on the cover is this dork ass private Joker. Look at this. It's very funny somebody. This is very funny he's like ah excuse me let me pick up that what are you doing don't leave that MRI I'm already there during missions so please be quiet. I'm gonna tell the sergeant that you're being loud during missions. Soldiers take every precaution to avoid giving the enemy Clues to their position damn right. They reduce Noise by avoiding unnecessary movement turning down radios and limiting talking. They cover reflective items and concealed flashlights. At least this guy does he's the hall monitor who makes everyone does that make everyone do that soldiers stake all litter such as empty food containers to to collection points or carry it until it can be properly disposed. Of survival is the reason for keeping litter to a minimum whether you are a soldier or an environmentally minded civilian.

How many of them actually did that I would like to know how many how many piles of Mr opened. MREs are just left scattered around the Iraqi desert. actually sir you said that you'd be having us do 200 more Jumping Jacks. At the end of the of the Run sir you forgot to give us jumping jacks. Yeah also burn pits much how about some Gulf War syndrome intelligence file ooh Palestinians ouch another touchy subject. I think I already said this one too. Yes. We did this one too. These are too many doubles I am outraged. This is it should be a full set what is Gulf War syndrome. That's a very good question. I don't know if there is a conclusive answer to that one reason to suspect that is because it's called A syndrome which is once when medicine kind of shrugs. Because the syndrome is a constellation of symptoms. It does not imply a necessary single cause and a lot of times that means that it's made up you know and to what degree is Gulf War syndrome just PTSD that is manifested physically by people who can't confront their trauma who knows I don't know but we certainly did love.

Burning trash pits of carcinogens we love doing that I mean Beau Biden didn't get cancer after being around burn pits and Iraq God that that is the most somebody really needs to do something good and interesting about the the Biden brothers because it's just it's too perfect. You got this guy incredibly ambitious Senator who's want to be president since he was a kid fueled by this deep sense of inadequacy which all these guys have to have and then he gets. These two kids with who of course are born with the understanding that like this is their legacy this is their Birthright and so one of them the older brother accepts the challenge like he's gonna go on the hero's journey much like John Joseph Kennedy. Senior did similar situation also a Shanty Irishman dealing with inadequacy issues and raiding a brood and wanting them to advance and in the case of the Kennedys. JFK was a sort of a dissolute Cad and also riddled with disease and injury. His brother Joe senior was a all-around square jaw Chad and Joe Jr rather and he was the father's choice to become president and then when PT 109 happened where dumbass Kennedy allowed his boat to get cut in half by a Japanese Destroyer like way to go. he did some heroics like swimming a guy to safety and he gets you know a medal and he becomes a war. Hero Joe Jr hears about this and he's a pilot in the Atlantic or in the 

In the European theater he's in England and he volunteers for a suicidal bombing run with an overloaded plane that as soon as it takes off fails to achieve total lift and smashes into the side of a cliff. In a similar way. Hunter he spits the bit he can't handle hack it. He's going to be dissolute but Beau takes up the challenge and what does that mean it means volunteering for the National Guard and then it means going to Iraq to be a Jag officer like Lindsay as the only Heir. It's an astounding narrative. Now the real drama would be if he was forced to take power but right now he doesn't have to. He can just sort of take his dick out which speaks to our general lack of catharsis as a society like previous generations of this guy had to try to take power like JF like JFK after his mother died like RFK who is a very similar type of guy to Hunter Biden. He did not accept the burden of Public Service as a young man he's did heroin but now late in life. He's like coming to it. He's because he's coming to it through watching it on television and you know he's not coming at it through having taken the burden by Hunter will probably never do that but like he's just floating away into space and he just loves filming himself smoking crack which means it really shows how literally stunted. He is because you know that is some man why what why why do you have to reach out like this and it's like because of the essential loneliness of his heart fascinating character. As I said and I do love the idea that Republicans believe to a matter of existential certainty which is that if a few more people than currently do found out about Hunter Biden they would vote for Donald Trump.

They would switch like they genuinely believe that like the ones who don't believe in you know like literal the ones who don't believe in the literal argument for them ringing the election because they want to appear more reasonable less kooky than the ones they're talking about Dominion voting systems and also they don't want to get sued they will say well of course. I don't think that there were any tampering with votes but the state suppression of the hunter Biden story is tantamount to rigging an election. That's the that's the smart version of that argument and it's premised on something that's just as delusional as um as the voting machine. Thing. Most people don't pay that much attention to stuff and when they see the president's cracks crack smoking Sun. They go oh that's too bad and it off probably reminds them of their own crackhead fail kids and it makes them just feel sad for both Joe Biden.

It makes them feel bad for him and like him more even and you have like people compared to the Anthony Weiner thing. But first of all Trump broke everything and you have to acknowledge there's a pre-trump and post-trump era that Trump changed the The audience's best word for them honestly electorates the way that they metabolize stories of Scandal and wrongdoing among politicians you just widen the aperture. He blew out the O-ring so you can't compare those media environments. Secondly you have the world historical unpopularity of Hillary Clinton that Joe Biden does not share. Joe Biden was personally popular at that time and the fact that with the with the email story as overblown as it was you still have a thing that the candidate did. Hillary Clinton deleted a bunch of emails that were that she had privately stored that's the thing she did and then when the Anthony Weiner letter came out that was about the emails that she and of course you could say oh. It's absurd to care about that kind of stuff well. People did the hunter Biden story was. He's got a dick. He likes to jack off and smoke crack and you can say oh no bursima and on the illegal money. That is that is a um Thicket of wilderness. Nobody is wanting to wade into that like you're being hoist by the same patard of like spectacle destroyed like pixie stick children that you turn the electorate into by unleashing Trump on them and then you want to complain about it. It's like I'm sorry people aren't going to care about that they didn't care about about Smirnoff van drop-off and the Boris and Natasha doing Shenanigans in Ukraine. They didn't care about that with Trump. They're not going to care about it with Biden but for them it's like no. This is a thing that happened with a Democrat and therefore if it had happened again. We would have won again and it speaks again to the same. confusing of signal to noise to cause and effect that plagues our understanding of politics who left the Coke in the White House is probably some.

 young trying to be cool staffer I swear to God. We had Italy too I swear to God. We got Italy God damn it running low on new cards. I'm glad I like the litter one though that was good. So. I'll take that we got the dud indeed. Yeah. I'll probably vote for Cornell West. I don't know if my vote might not it who cares live in California I do like filling out the form that is just a thing that is true of me I I got in sourceled by the ritual of public awareness at a young age and that meant having the active voting turned into a meaningful Act and it's hard to kick that programming and I gotta say they do mail-in out here. In California. It is the least satisfying way to vote because my favorite thing about voting is putting it in the machine God.

I remember so when I was a kid in Manitowoc Wisconsin Manitowoc had a voting machines you know like the kinds that New York City had where you have all the levers and you go click click click and they pull a thing and it like puts a ticket out. I was and they had a little model of it in the in the newspaper. Like before an election they would show you a sample of what it would look like and show you who was on the ballot and I was just like I cannot wait to pull that lever you know. I I get to Signal my autonomy my my Consciousness. my civic virtue I get to seal my own worth by doing this cool thing and I my first vote was at college and they did not have the machine they had the Scantron. But I did like putting it in the like the I do like that and then eventually I moved to New York and I was so excited because they had the old they had the machine and then I got there and they literally changed that next year to the scantrons.

But I gotta say like the reason that Chomsky is right about voting for Democrats. It's not about it's not the logic of voting for Democrats that is actually probably wrong. I think his whole he does. He doesn't understand the dialectical relationship between Democrats and Republicans. He doesn't understand that you aren't really holding anything back by voting for Democrats because Democrats winning elections is part of the process that brings us to catastrophe and that generates catastrophe every day. But his reasoning for that is it takes five minutes. It's not a big part of your life so if you think one party one one candidate would do less bad stuff vote for them and that is morally deflationary of voting and that is what you should think about when you think about. Voting do not think how will I you know stay my escutcheon by voting for a bad person or you know how much I'm I'm validating. All of the positive traits that I imagine myself to have by voting for the right person. All that is just It's just pettifoggery. None of that is actually adheres to the vote. The vote gets thrown in the Hogs loose with all the other votes so treat it like that treat it like the hog sluice thing and it's like if oh.

It's the only political thing I do then how am I supposed to get a political identity and maintain it. You have to find something else and that's good because maybe some of that will lead you into Cooperative action with others. I think political identity just means more than any actual content. It is the idea of oneself as a political agent and I think that that is one of the many sorts of subjectivity that this flavor of capitalism allows us to access and the degree to which we are attracted to that mode of embodiment and con. Self-conception is going to be determined. As most of these things are demographically and experientially things are going to happen to you that are going to drive you towards a relationship. An emotional relationship to the concept of politics and the concept of being a politically expressive individual and the underlying assumptions are of a recognition of oneself as a co-equal member of something some social organ like I believe that I am part of and that my Act of voting is an act of participation in the churning of these organs that we are part of I voted I voted for Hillary in 2020.

I did not and I I had a lot of time a lot of fun doing that that I thought that was a really good pick still do she could win if you vote for her. Okay I realized something to close out here about the Republican field. We've said for a while that um DeSantis is the Warren of the 2024 election. I think that's pretty clear since the overvalued media friendly internet candidate who's thinks they're leading a thing but is actually trailing it. and now this guy RAM Swami is the mayor. Pete we thought he was going to be the Yang and he might still be the Yang but right now he is making a real push to be the mayor. Pete and you might say Who's Bernie. there is no Bernie because Bernie is good so why would there be a republican version of him absurd all right folks. I hope we had a good I hope you enjoyed. It. Hope you had a good time talking to me. I have a good time talking to myself bye-bye.
