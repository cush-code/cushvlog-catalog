Oh getting some erectile dysfunction with my guy here not having having a little difficulty there we go he was having. I had to do a little uh manual stimulation of the of the phone holder there to make that happen. I have a little bit too much chest here might be too erotic for some of y'all. I don't want to get you all sprung as the kids say or they used to say back. When I was a kid. The kids said sprung now. I don't know what the hell they say uh heated or is. That too old are we done with heated already. Uh chewed what about chewed chiving. What do you say torqued I like to eat it honestly. I thought eat it was fun.

We're totally blurped man. We're totally blorped. I know. I'm blurped. We're all very blurped to be here scro something like that news got me feeling. Like this damn it  youtube which isn't yours uh. But that's always the case right. Everybody thinks that so I wanted to start off talking about the big thing about woodward in his speech and his uh. A particular thing about woodward and his the thing he recorded trump saying which is once again. It's hilarious. It's trump at his best just flying out going. It's very deadly it'll kill you you cough and the very important thing is is the air you got to breathe. You don't have to touch somebody the way he has to explain it. If anyone has read it the way he explains to woodward how how like uh like breath bubble like air droplet transmission. The way air droplet transmission of disease happens versus skin-to-skin contact as though he invented it as though he had to crack it himself. Just he's one of the dumbest people on earth. It really is funny and people say no no he's smart.

It's like he has he's one of those people who is completely he completely his his transparent need to be loved his transparent and deep and abiding uh emptiness that he has to fill at all times meant that he assimilated what celebrity meant in this country faster than almost anybody. In the in in. We have he just the one talent he has shown in his life is being famous so that is a skill that is an intelligence by any definition. That is genius you could and the thing is is. People have to be able to be thought of that way. Like trump is a genius if you want to talk about genius as the ability to ins to process quickly some vector like some way of some question. Some array like there are physical geniuses who are good at sports. You know they're mathematical geniuses who can master uh you know the implications of numbers and then they're geniuses who understand what it is to be famous and then make themselves that way a savant. But the problem is is that the job of president traditionally has not been that of savant in that way in the way first of all not in any way the president being a savant is a terrible idea. The president should not be a savant in any one thing because it means that they're wildly wildly incapable in all the other ways because it takes too much concentration to keep yourself pointed in that direction especially when you're dealing with the  rotted oatmeal that is trump's brain at this point but because we've turned politics into a spectacle of course a genius of media. A genius of fame would of course take power of course he would and he did so. We've got a guy who is who is a genius at staying famous look at what he did with his modest gifts without ever planning for it.

He did something that the greatest minds policy and politics have set themselves like a  guided missile for their whole lives and come up short bob dole spent his whole life trying to be president my god henry clay. The guy invented a political philosophy he forged like wiggery like was the was like a transitional fossil in the creation of like modern developmental uh our modern like keynesian economic theory like it all kind of started with clay. He he gave us like the he gave us the model for like the post um. The model for henry clay gave us the model for what like the state should do in the liberal conception. Wiggery he invented that  never got to be president never got to be president ever he ran got. His ass kicked his own party at one point when they thought they could win when they thought with van buren dealing with the crisis of 37. In the 1840 election.


They thought we can actually win this one. We don't want to put clay out there to get his ass kicked again and so they denied him the nomination. They said look we love you but we want to we want a general. We want a beautiful general somebody who can reach beyond the nerdery of the of the dorkish wigs a guy who just fought in the big war remember. The big war that we opposed and uh you know because the whigs were not the party of westward expansion that was the democrats. The wigs were the party hold on a second wait. A minute so harrison was like an embodiment of like the democratic frontier aesthetic but he was also a genuine wig and that he believed in the american system and so they give it to him and henry clay got so pissed that when they offered him the vp he didn't take it. He told them to  off and so they just decided to do a further bit of bridge building by extending the nomination to john tyler who was not a wig. At all. He was a southern sectionalist. He had broken with jackson over the question of nullification and they brought him in under the theory of the big tent which is exactly what ended up biting the republicans and america in the ass with andrew johnson. It was a similar situation. They got a guy in there who had no no truck with the republican platform and he explicitly wasn't.

He was a democrat but he he abided by the principle of unionism which was transcendent the way that the whigs in 1840 wanted anti-jacksonianism to be the the the providing ideology and everything else was subsidiary to it and then of course. Harrison dies at the poopy water almost immediately and instead of having clay the actual founder of american wiggery in power with the whig majorities in the houses and senate. They get a guy who doesn't buy any of it and and vetoes their entire platform. I mean my god my god what a blunder one of the biggest blunders ever and it was clay's blunder to make because at that point. Harrison was the oldest man who had ever would have run for president. He was 68 at a time when that was like the life expectancy for a rich guy higher was lower than that where there was a giant stagnant pool of human  100 yards behind the white house. This is a recipe for a dead president yo movie remember that one and instead out of peak clay says no and then the entire whig agenda is destroyed and it eventually was recaptured by the republicans like the republicans continued the wig tradition for sure but like that wig republican engine is has been the mechanism why whereby capital expansion through america has been ratified from the bottom uh from the bottom through like popular consent.

Like that's been the the the connection between the state and it and like the economy the political economy that is the that was the chassis for modern liberalism which has been dogged by its antithesis which is like the remnant jeffersonian jacksonian yeoman theory. The yeoman concept of minimal minimal uh minimal government maximum personal liberty in a context of uh of essentially free ex-corporation of land i.e settler colonialism. It is a pre-figurative remnant of that that's been clashing in one warmer another ever since the emergence of the republican party after 1865 and now as the ability for that structure that had been created to actually deliver anything like political legitimacy to the system that it's supposed to it might actually fall. It could potentially fall finally to the infiltration. In this the return of this jeffersonian conception of at maximum liberty for property holders which would then be fused with the remnant of what we have created now to become a synthetic like neo-feudal reassertion of like the the antebellum.

Uh rulers of this continent only now without even the necessity to create a social network or political legitimacy. It will all be replaced with technology and technology will fill that space that was filled by popular popular uh participation and legitimacy. It's now filled by coercion and technology and surveillance more than anything more even than the  like drones surveillance that will lock you down that will lock you in place in a way that believing you were part of something called america that had values and there was a dream you could participate in even if you were personally in a bad job or unhappy in life or unable to find opportunities. There was a hope for you and one of the things you could do to make. Things better is participate in the political process and you believed that and that kept you on the path of a regular citizen like paying bills doing a job or if nothing else not being violently opposed to the state in a way that required it to smack you down with actual authority by spending actual money on you and that space is now just going to be the fact that well. I can't do anything else because they know where I am they they are.

They are the only reason I'm not dead because because I have been so alienated from the ability to reproduce my own life and the means of production and consumption are completely dominated and you have to enter into contract with some provider in order to have mere sustenance and that and then what you give up for. That is total uh total social transparency. How the hell are you supposed to fight that so yeah.

Like this this this like the thing bernie and even biden and like the never trumpers are trying to hold on to is. This last stand of this cracking and fracturing and destroyed uh government engine. This political structure the two-party system and the three representative branches and the  states the whole thing the entire political structure. It's worm ridden and termite infested and it's cracking and collapsing and they're holding on they're holding on because they don't know what else to do and because they're they're the captains. The ships might be going down but at least they're the captains and they want to keep that position and so they're going to fight to the end. They're going to fight in the rubble like it's berlin 1945. Uh but eventually they will be subsumed by some sort of like cockamamie spectaclized like fake fascist. Maybe like populist trump-esque entertain pure entertainment politics that just subsumes all practical considerations and then brutal brutal miseration at the point of life but in a way that is totally isolated from ever creating uh meaningful resistance. Because everyone's alienation is directed towards this intensified deeply felt like almost three-dimensional political reality that is politics as we understand it the electoral system.


The particip the the the the checks and balances the constitution blah blah blah blah all that happy horse  and what and the thing is is what's drawing this down with making. This happen is that we've entered the lifeboat that that previous model worked with expansion as the as the undergirding understanding we will always have frontier to give off like the first thing. The republicans did the first real thing they did in power besides raise an army to put down the rebellion in the south was a sign the homestead act which opened a vast swath of the louisiana purchase to the uh to the homesteading of anyone who put down stakes and stayed there for five years. Free real estate on a scale never before done in any western civilization that kind of land reform took generations and in fact never happened in most of europe in latin america. It has also largely been fought and almost not happened because we imported a european proletariat rather than enslave and then colonize or colonize and enslave an indigenous proletariat which is a difference between northern and southern colonialisms. But that meant that we could keep people on board even as labor was being exploited even as war was being fought on mechanistic levels far beyond everyone's consideration. Even a few years previously there's always land of give and once the land gave out there was just at that moment the possibility of global domination. The america being the world hegemon just a time to take up for the frontier thesis being closed being being read out of history boom. We have we have the new frontier and then after the after world war ii my god it becomes it becomes a count. It's beyond empire. It's it's like global subsumption something never before even considered by alexander napoleon or hitler but that broke apart in the 21st century.

On the rock not of 9 11 9 11 gave us the conditions to pursue our final icarus-like flight into the sky. Our final mad thrust towards control before the  richtus set in and our blood vessels started bursting. The last grab of the dying man is the as a he gets pulled down deep by the heart attack that was iraq. Iraq was going to be where we made the future safe for america by betting down the demons we had unleashed by 9 11 which had infiltrated us to the molecular level and it did the trick but it was dependent on us winning and guess what we didn't. It was not because it's it's because they overestimated their their capabilities that old collective dunning-kruger effect kicked in they'd spent so much time building themselves up for propaganda purposes to themselves to the people of the country the people of the world. America's indomitable power that they had to assume in the moment of need that it was there and then oh oh. What's this oh oh no maybe. I had a few too many  steaks after all boom and that's why we're now in this that mad gasp at the end. This grasp this horrible realization that we're not no longer sailing to the frontier.

The ship is sinking and it's grab what you can and go overboard and that's the that's where all the white nationalism comes from uh and that's where like this nascent socialist spur spurt comes from. But the sad thing and the terrifying thing is that um these are just epiphenomenon like these political cultures that we think are so important. The new left the left the alt-right or like ethno-nationalists. Pepe is whatever you want to call them they are. They are steam venting off of a social structure that is inert. They are just the most femoral tendrils because they are the overproduced elite of the dying middle class. They have the time they have the vocabulary to express their alienation. The vast majority are inert in the sense that they are alienated but they cannot give meaning or definition to that alienation and that means that we cannot win at the level of symbol.

That's the horror. There's a no argument taken place in the discourse. No amount of information no event reported on will ever give us any sense of power. We will continue to exist in the agonized state of eternal anxiety of trying something kind of knowing. It doesn't work but not having any alternative and so just crossing your fingers and hoping. It does that awful state that drives people to things like fascism the flight from the freedom of that moment that that uncertainty of like what am I doing and why is this even going to happen and that means it has to come from like the damn breaking because of some real material conditions in our case the rapidly accelerating uh uh horror of the pandemic disaster that we're dealing with this. This crisis that is very akin to 1905 russia in the sense of the legitimacy of the regime being critically compromised a regime that had like deep mystical connection to like the peasantry and our neo like coolock class that I talk about the the pringles in the tube.

The the last generation to grow up the generation to grow up in suburban splendor and expect that is like the standard the the pringles for them that's true but for most people. They're only experiencing this as alienation and and the thing is because we're going to get more alienation. People are going to experience things differently and the hope is is that that breaking of the dam will rearrange people and they will see things new and they will experience things anew and they will see the world with fresh eyes and that that sight will give them real understanding and I know that that sounds mystical and it sounds like a cope. But that's literally what I'm describing is is any revolution because you it works through the structures that exist prior. But it has to be powered in the moment by engines of in the moment emotional overcome. I am too I my heart cries out. I have no mouth but I must scream and it's that energy that powers movements. But the thing is it can't be spontaneous and that's the anarchist failure. The anarchist failing is you think without structures to direct the flow just exist waiting for the popular uprising will happen and you will get something that's non-hierarchical and won't have all the icky features of a army that's trying to impose power over and control means of production uh that's how it starts.

That's the that's the  like gas in the engine. But the only way that it catches is if it's directed by existing institutions and that's why the the the motto always has to be. If you're not in the exact moment of crisis and you have to be you have to like make a good faith effort to figure out what that is you have to be building towards one instead of expecting one or trying to incite one ahead of time. But the thing about this like reality is it's very very unappealing and that's why I was talking so much about how we have to act from love and not self-interest because if we act from self-interest the self-interested thing to do is take the bet that things are only going to get worse and then pile high make roads gather rosebuds while you may tune out politics literally become apolitical or uh or or just or give yourself over to just like the the libidinal gusher of like wild like confrontational violence apocalyptic violence and fantasizing about bringing that about or trying to bring it about it's going to. It's not going to be enough. You have to be like I am building something for someone who has to come later. I'm I'm seeding the bed because someone has to seed the bed not everybody can. Harvest. Some people have some of the people who sow are not going to live to reap and they have to. They have to feel in their heart as much love for the person in the future who might be able to reap than they as they feel for themselves or at least enough to direct them towards that goal rather than personal satisfaction. And I'm saying. I'm not there yet. But I'm saying that's the that's the challenge we all have to face to like initiate enough of a kickstart to this process.


This is all. I realize an incredibly long and detailed and and uh oh my god half an hour long um uh digression from myos actually going to talk about today which is the liberal response to the woodward revelation and the tape and it is obviously I understand why people were morally horrified. At what woodward did. He is a creep. He's a spook he was likely cia asset. He wrote a whitewashing cia book. He like launders money like trump does through his fake foundation. Uh he was a naval intelligence officer but until right before becoming a  washington post star political reporter just in time to destroy the presidency of a guy who just happened to be abrogating to his personal self. The entire prerogative of the deep state foreign policy and defense policy the things that are not the presidents to have solely to his own power. It raises a lot of questions and anyway. He's a creep and doing what he did was purely self-interested. Like the guy is a moral slug. He doesn't think of things in moral terms. It's all transaction to him like you give some you give a good you give some guy a puff piece. Here he gives you a good goosey juicy scoop. There you're not judging any of it. You're just weighing it. You're just you're a middleman. That's and that's the way they see themselves.

And that's the old journalistic idea and you can argue with it. But it's what they think anyway people are mad at him because he didn't think of like the fact that people needed to hear this and I understand why they're mad at him. But I do think it's interesting to see how visceral the response was in terms of people who said basically that all the people who died of covet in the u.s. The 200 000 and maybe 500 who will uh are on woodward's head because hypothetically if he had released the tape in february while trump was saying it's not a big deal and he said yeah. But you said this to me that that would have somehow stopped what happened from happening and to that I say. I don't think a single person who think feels that emotionally could explain to themselves how that could happen realistically like what what what's the thinking here you know like people see oh. Trump said one thing behind closed doors and then he did another thing what I guess the thought is.

People wouldn't be able to lie to themselves about covid and they'd be like well. I know he says it's a phony here but he said this that it's real or that trump would be forced to be like you got me. I take it seriously now that might have changed the contours of the distribution of the pandemic. But I don't think we would have escaped pandemic spread in this country. I will say that we would not have and and beyond that it's like well you're talking about random chance. Now like what are you really mad at and for people who are acting like. This is like a moment in history that could have changed the river of time. I'm sorry no way and I think the reason people have an instinctual even if they understand it logically that it doesn't make sense.


They instinctively think that this is a real possible thing that could have happened because they are still they are completely captured by politics as a spectacle right like you can say oh no they want you to vote. But it's like yeah. But remember voting is just this symbol. The voting stands in for four years of obeying the law like you spent four years being exploited and having that exploitation then rendered into like a culture for your consumption all year and the thing that makes you consent to it is that you wait in line and you  put a vote in that it's the ritual. It is an actual action. It is a ritual as much as watching a debate or arguing about them are. It's ritualized behavior in that it's not meant to actually interfere with the real structures of power. Now those things do activate at the level of the politicalism people we vote in to do that then do exercise power and influence that does direct history.

I think that's true but they're doing it with only the faintest whiff of momentum. Coming from below the real engine is the is is the is the the real governing is done at the level of negotiating between firms because those are the people who have access who are there every day we select the people to go and do it. But then they do the real governing with the firms and the stuff with the firms is made invisible and then all we see is the is the puppet show. I know this sounds like a cliche but I mean. This is literally how this stuff works and those are heavy-handed metaphors. But they're also accurate because the crucial thing about that metaphor is that something is a whole and is operating as a mechanism.

But we culturally only engage with the mechanic with with the front of it with like one gear spinning rather than the entire machinery and that's so that we keep thinking that's the entire thing. I mean. It's sleight of hand. They think that now even now even as we have seen the erosion of reality in front of our faces as like everything gets hyper normalized before it even happens. I mean like you could argue that blade runner 2049. Hyper normalized what's happening in california already because everybody thinks they're like blowing people's minds by showing pictures of blade runner and being like oh my god. This is blade runner what they're actually doing is they're recreating this ritual of recognition and then ascent like oh yeah blade runner. That movie that was kind of that was a fun movie that was a good movie and you know what there were still cool cars. There was a guy in a with a robot girlfriend and a gun hey harrison ford's here. It's still our world and so when we see it.

It's like a recognition that is relief so anyway. That means that we are engaged totally in the pageantry of this thing and we give it meaning which means we have to think that on its terms it works and so the way they think things work is that if enough people at the right moment hear or see something bad or good about a leader that it will change their minds in such a concentrated way that it it literally cracks the foundation of reality like it stops the gears of history and breaks them like uh perfect because a miniature example of this is um um. Mr. Smith goes to washington where um uh jimmy stewart has to do a  uh filibuster one-man filibuster to protect the funding of some like boy scout troop uh which honestly now after everything is very sustainable. It's like why do you like boy scouts so much guy you've been talking for 40 hours about boy scouts. This is finally his throat gives out as it must and he collapses and the reason he wins is because the evil senator who is in charge of the thing botches a suicide attempt and confesses because he was moved by the words and every political story that we tell ourselves has that ending where something bad has ended by everyone becoming aware of some something bad and it changing things the moment when the police march in and march away. The bad guy and we all think that that's possible and even with trump disproving all of our notions of political reality in front of us we still because we don't have an alternative. We think that's the whole show we think participating at the level of voting and this passion play is the only way we can so if those buttons don't do anything we're  and so we're just going to keep hitting him harder.

But so we have no example so imagine a fantasy counter example that cannot be disproven. So. I don't think it's likely that anything significant would have changed if that had happened but to a liberal. Even if he doesn't think of it. He can imagine to enough to at the level of gonads not even at the level of a conscious. Uh fantasy uh a situation where this thing gets revealed and overnight. Trump's approval rating drops to zero everyone on fox news distances themselves from trump and it's essentially what happened in watergate which is the actual model. For all of this like watergate is the one time it happened that they have now modeled the rest of the world. On even though time has passed and the political economy we had and especially the partisan constituency of congress which is a huge huge part of it and also the the state the like the the um hegemonic status of the media. As a trusted third party. Those are inconceivable. Now those conditions do not obtain but that fantasy of watergate is the fantasy that motivates everything and it's even beyond the election. It's even beyond the election and that was always what impeachment was about and that's what all of it boils down to is. There's one version of reality where something different happened and we got the final thing and so they're mad at woodward for not having a thing worry out like what would have happened is. They would have done another impeachment and he would have resigned or been arrested.

Right. You have to admit that's what you're thinking because what is any other scenario that changes things oh. Uh ted. Cruz has to go on tv and tap dance for a little bit and pretend to not understand the question when asked about the president's comments. Trump just bebops and scats what really happens is that the structure of america at this point could not accommodate  coronavirus. We are a rickety goddamn carousel and everyone knew it when trump talks about how he didn't want to make a panic. He didn't mean like people running in the streets like it's war of the worlds and they think that the radio is real. It's the market collapsing the market collapsing the prospect of all of that capital disappearing overnight without giving people chance at the people at the top time to hedge time to make sure they shorted that  and that would exist no matter who's in charge so hillary clinton. She would not have gone outside and said it's a hoax. She never would have done that but we didn't have the rapid response to deal with this thing. We didn't have the capacity to make enough mass in time if we told people to get masks. The reason we told people not to get masks is because we didn't know we had enough so that's the thing we couldn't have done so. It might have reduced the spread but the spread was inevitable look at the performance of the democratic governors. These guys were supposed to be the heroic alternatives to trump. These guys have the most blood on their hands and it's not because they're uniquely evil.


It's because they're big states that got it early and what happens when you're a big state that gets in early is the economic reality of just just annihilating that much value overnight over something that might happen because what if we catch it in time what if we catch it what if we stop it what if we contain it what if we get a quick cure oh. It's actually this old thing oh what if we get a fast cure what if we what if it just dies out what if it goes less lethal people don't know that much about science and that's what trump did and that's I would say what any of them would do while doing maybe a little bit more to put the brakes on the economy. They would not have slammed shut on the economy the way that we would have been necessary to stop the thing from becoming what it became. We would have slow rolled our way into it one way or the other because we could not stop. The  wheels from turning. This stuff is all borrowed money. It's a bunch of water wheels of debt that have to be serviced in a moment by moment both basis and that means constant inputs. At the end of the road of this constant world. Machine is the american  time they gave them time they gave them time to hedge their bets.

They gave them time to get out uh they made it time to for them to even make money shorting the  congress people did and so there's so we know for a fact that nothing would have changed absent trump just being like blown out of office and even then you're just solving the problem of trump you're not solving anything having to do with coronavirus you're just actually fixating on getting trump out because nothing else has worked and you're afraid that you  scared they're. Gonna lose again and so they're imagining oh my god. What if we got him back in february they'll lead him out and I'll lead him out of the white house in handcuffs because what could have happened but what but what trump did is what any of them would have done. They would have said oh god we don't know if we can contain this economically. We don't know if or or like with infrastructure. If this overcomes us that's like a doomsday scenario.

But hey we have no way of slowing this economic machinery. We and we don't have the infrastructure and resources to combat it from the point of view of state action because all those limbs have atrophied we  stopped uh creating a uh like a reinforcing structure of like response nodes out of like the bureaucracy of the state uh employees. It's all been sold off so what trump did was stall and try to hope that something miraculous would happen and he keeps saying that oh it's going to go away. It's going to go away bye-bye. It's going to wait because they cannot conceive fixing the problem and that is beyond trump. Now trump is a particularly unimaginative. One of these guys and so he had even fewer ideas than anybody else which made him more of more in denial than other people. Because he was so sure he had no alternative. They were all in some stage of denial and I would argue that that stage of denial coupled with the actual impracticalities of imposing the system like this on us because even if trump says it's real you look at q and on like how many of them would take his vaccine.

I don't think that many or certainly not all of them so you have these rips and trent and splits that could be uh uh exacerbated by the fact that for local officials it will always be more make more sense to kowtow to people who want you to stay open because they're going to be richer. They're going to be more important to your electoral future. The people who are most at risk are mostly the most expendable that calculation runs no matter who which party you are or what level of power you have but of course. The response to this is well if there's no level of symbol that will work if the thing is on grooves so that there's nothing trump can do to be interfered with which implies because a lot of these people assume trump will try to steal it. At this point they now think that anything he tries to do he will succeed at and I gotta say it's a hell of a track record.

He has not failed at much that he's really tried to do. I mean how he didn't even become  president through effort. At least I mean there was trying there but it sure as hell wasn't him. You know now. He's uh he's he's flailing away at it and of course. Once again. It wouldn't work against another opponent like trump is adjusting to his opponent's weaknesses and um because he went after hillary for being crooked and part of the establishment. He started doing that with biden if people remember he tried to do like the crooked biden thing and like look at hunter and all that stuff. But he is now singled in on because he watches the news obniffers omnivorously you saw today he talked about how in the midst of a pandemic he spent the entire day watching television. He watched fox news for nine hours and he was bragging about it amazing amazing mind uh so he watched all this tv so he knows what the moment the the feel of the moment is. He gets the grooves and he sees the trunk the binds thing is where is he biden's thing is what is his actual response to this everything looks.


In turmoil. We want something better but are you actually safe. Harbor and his answer has been look jack. Uh you know uh bye thumbs up emoji uh. Here's me in farmville. He's reinforced every uh every concern that he's an empty. A literal empty suit like just a scarecrow man um and and that's like a real thing and the thing is I don't and and it's exacerbated by the fact that the democratic party is not in a position to make any promises to anyone because it knows it can't even try to  keep them because it might win too much what if they really want what if they were back in the obama position they wouldn't be able to do what they need to do. They want to avoid that they want divided government above all else because they do want to make sure that trump doesn't just like personally take over the government because hey they had to deal with republicans. They didn't have a deal with trump and that's like the real split here. It's the people who've accommodated the accommodated themselves to trumpism as a third force in politics that is like now remaking the landscape or the ones who uh are sticking with like the old fragments and trying to weld them together like the the old republican party like the up until romney party to the democrats and they don't want to take power under a moment of like in uh of like emboldened progressive demands. That's why they had to destroy bernie at all costs including the cost of thousands of their own voters. For christ's sake.

They had to  stop him no matter what and it's really frustrating because like it shows that how much work there is to do because bernie got real far with the media entirely against him and with that media having a direct propaganda line from the democratic party to their own voters. They're like a baby bird. They were feeding voters their own beliefs incepting them every day on msnbc and on cnn uh and on the internet in general like the respectable sites that they would look at not q a nonstop and he still they still did really well. But uh they weren't breaking through to that second layer. I talked about and that's why I get so frustrated with people who take the discourse seriously because they say well. The discourse powered you know bernie and brought him down but like bernie was still reaching out way farther into that repressed loam than the  discourses. Online are and it still wasn't enough which means you're way farther away from it and I guess. The thinking is if you try harder you will like create a bigger political structure. But I don't think the evidence persists for that. We're going to have to go back and refocus our energy people are going to have to refocus their energy. That's going to be I hate to sound like a crystal guy. But we have to refocus our energy and as for whether biden wins or trump loses.

I don't know and this is the important thing about the democratic fantasy. The liberal fantasy of like having the discourse make everyone's mind at once in one way like just flash frying us. Some sort of political consensus that transcends the moment that brought us to trump being in power is that if he loses the election and goes in any way he will still be. There he will be banco's ghost. He will be the nightmare jester. He's going to have his own tv station onna baby. He's going to be the man every night. He then q anon is going to be growing and this will be the specter that haunts them and that means that they have to increase their fantasies and the richness of the fantasies of those what-if moments those counterfactuals where it could have been different which can never be disproved because they never happened and they never happened because they were impossible.

This is cloud cuckoo land what people like to call yeah. I saw that anti-fuzz now to blame for the fires that's of course going to happen because it's all a unified field. It unfolds eventually everything because what it is is. It's a discursive map right. It's a map of territory. It's it's mapping reality which means eventually it is.


There it touches everything you touch if if reality is your understanding of like the media. Then eventually every like that's why they like they talk everything's about celebrities. They have to incorporate a huge part of their life which is celebrities. They observe through celebrity culture and through media things they watch. They have to be part of it. Everything politics has to be part of it. It's totalizing so of course if there's a bad thing that happens especially if the other answer is lies. George soros lies like global warming like that's especially if if there isn't if there's a non-political explanation maybe you don't have to get to it yet. But if there's something happening that is part of your media diet that does not have it does not have an explanation within the rubric of cue.

It becomes an irritant and you have to neutralize it and so oh somebody makes a fake post about anti-fun guys getting arrested uh for setting a fire and then they send it out and even that person doesn't have to be uh cynical that person could be earnest. That person could be could say yeah. I don't know this isn't technically true but I know they did it and I am justified in doing this because it serves the greater good of getting out the truth and then every and that's why you could never ask anybody who retweets any of these old q people who post insane  for a lot and I must you know decapitate your blonde. Children wait what what the  they would say yeah but you know she thinks that you know she thinks that and that's all it takes because it's worth it to get it out there because otherwise they're she's gonna cheat and keep it from you. So now antifa and apparently people are patrolling ground areas to keep out antifa. They're way more likely to start a fire by like firing off a few rounds into the apparently. There was a fire caused by some guys shooting off guns uh in the vicinity of a of like dry timber. So they could be out there shooting at fake antifa guys and light their own fire. Things are getting way too on the nose man that's really the moment isn't it. The moment now is all that is subtext rising and replacing text. It's uh. It's a bummer man. It's a real bummer uh. I saw the adolf read thing um. I thought it was really funny the number of people who go immediately after he starts talking oh. They got to him unless you're like these people think all of them id people too they're. I their concepts are essentially uh. It's uh things spread by like viral patterns.

Like you you either replace someone's brain through some combination of social pressure and uh their own desire for advancement and then they just become zombified versions of themselves and I think that might happen sometimes but for the most part people are acting out of earnest self what they think is good faith. They just have different priors and that you have to resolve them through engagement you cannot resolve them by declaring them heretics and just reinforcing every time. Something happens the same old arguments because you drive yourself further and further away and that drives people towards these absurd positions like the new ruling class is like. Blue checks like the real ruling class of this massive world bestriding colossus is me is is anxiety brooklyn blue checks that is an absurd concept to me and I reject it fully and I think that the embrace of it is an attempt to to turn the uh that deformed spectacle of twitter that like this island of  and so people drive themselves to absurd conclusions and as I have said on all sides. People have to have a point where they reach oh am. I just doing this because I have to get more and more psychic pleasure and enjoyment out of out of higher and higher staked arguments because I feel less and less of power in my miserable life am I just coping strictly and not focusing my energy at all on redirecting like away from just reinforcing this sick need this. This fake angst where half of my pleasure is pain. Half of my love is hate as in like consciously as in like half of the love. I feel in the world is actually the hate I feel for these other people and that's what drives me. That's that's sterile and it eventually overcomes your reasoning and you are no longer right you're not even right. It's one thing if you were arguing these points and you were right now. You're not even right. You're off the.

But you'll never know because anybody who tells you you're off the beam. They sold out. They got to them and now you're floating off into space and all. I can say then is bye-bye. That's why I don't engage these questions. I say bye-bye and this is why if anno free did say that somebody got to angela nagle. I don't think that's true either because he's using that reasoning that got him there to continue moving on even though he realizes oh. I'm like really just reinforcing an argument. I'm having on the internet I'm not trying to get to the truth if she does something else. It's because someone got to her because I'm still thinking in those terms. I'm still thinking in in like there's the pod people and there's the real people. Not. We're  moving from different priors and grind banging grinding off of each other and bumping and grinding off one another. Both of these are wrong positions.

I think the people with those people. I've been some of them have been making money and some of them are willing to sell out mussolini style on both sides like the number of people who are just like total scammers and absolute nihilists who consider themselves super woke and id paul and like uh the most sainted pure being of like white prejudice recognition. They take that fact the fact that they have a pure understanding of racial dynamics. Even though they're white they've transcended their white their white taint their guilt. They've transcended their guilt well because that I can see things clearly and america is too racist. Everyone else isn't as good as me nothing's gonna get better so I get to do the same ego piling on selfishness as like the  disgusting chug monsters who like alex jones who are just gonna sell supplements. While the world burns. They're gonna laugh themselves to the bank because no no. I'm a good person. I'm not just being cynical. But I'm so good that. I know that this can't be redeemed and in the meantime it's good for me to advance myself. If you are poc you can say anything. I do to advance. Myself is justice and if you're a white person who has like fully acknowledged their privilege or is so aware every moment that they could never acknowledge their privilege. Then you deserve it for being better than all those off other awful white people.

Those dynamics reinforce each other and the thing that the main point I'm making is. None of it requires anybody to be got to either by deep pocketed insiders uh like hedge fund guys. Uh um woke capitalist corporations like nike or  gay or or the gates foundation. Those people do exist like one of the leading prison. Abolitionists is underwritten by the ford foundation does anyone know that is anyone aware of that fact. Ford foundation grants for prison abolition. We're going to have a ford company but we're not going to have prisons that's that's the world that they are trying to sell you. But that is not everybody and going from the assumption that it's everybody will leave you like spinning around in a circle trying to find a wall to avoid getting stabbed in the back because you can't trust anyone and trust is the beginning of everything because trust is what builds trust is the basis for love uh and of course people say there's no left-wing heritage foundation. No no but there is uh. I mean. There is a meager scrap of of clout to be had. There are jobs there are there's streams of revenue. There's you could get a  uh woke podcast awoke uh patreon uh woke awoke only fans there's something to be had. It's not as much as you could get from the heritage foundation but you're good enough to not want that you have enough principle. You are better than those people in a fundamental way. You've not given up the fight to the degree that they have where they don't. Even they think the fight has been won. That's how bad they are. But you still stop short of like decentering your ego enough to be effective and then you want to defend that position. Everyone's got to defend their position. It's grim. I know. I keep saying it but people need to keep hearing it. I think because I'm getting new listeners presumably. We're going to start on our own stream. Now. It's going to be podcast available so presumably a bunch of people who don't  all right guys. I'm gonna go peace.
