Foreign okay so hey we're in i. I was sorry. I was making sure we were in. I'm hacking into the matrix hacking into the matrix It's raining out so. I'm not out in my splendid garden. I'm in here and not for too long I'm not going to be able to broadcast or I'm sorry broadcast force of habit for too long today. I've got I've got time constraints for other media non-media related reasons. But I didn't do anything this weekend. And I don't want to go three in a row days in a row generally without doing one so I was just going to put a little a little nugget in here. A little cuibi for you guys a quick bit which is apparently what the way people love to consume media.

According to noted super genius. was it jeffrey katzenberg. The the god those guys have so much money and they definitely deserve every cent of it. So so. I just wanted to say. I might not don't talk about. It might what else I might say but um so okay. I want to start with this so I said last week that I really didn't like the new show on showtime good lord bird with ethan hawk as john brown and I got a lot of pushback. People said they really liked it. A lot of people have said it's great and I decided well maybe. I just got off on the wrong foot with it. I watched I the very beginning of it when someone when the character says some people. Black folks hate him and think he's a white savior. It hit my here wrong and maybe. I gave the whole thing an unfair greeting because I was primed to not like it because of that moment early on. But so. I started watching the second episode with good faith and it doesn't really change any of my opinions about it. I gotta say and in fact I one specific moment happened that I think crystallized some of the specific problems. I have with it and it was so at one. In the second episode.

The main character who is this young boy former slave boy who is part of brown's band but then separates off and is in in cross-dressing as a woman They ends up in missouri across the border from kansas as among slaves and enslaved. I think at a brothel and a character refers to the ruffians. The border ruffians who would go across the border to rustle cattle and intimidate and attack free staters and vote. Most importantly vote in elections for things like you know the the the various slave state constitutions from the one of the two competing governments that was always being established in the kansas area and she refers to them as rebels and it just clanged off my ear and I thought who are these people rebelling against this is 1865. I'm sorry this is 18. I believe this is 1856 when this thing is set. the south has not seceded. Abraham lincoln has not even I believe been elected not Abraham lincoln has not even been elected yet. the the democratic party hasn't even shattered on the issue of slavery at its convention.

Yet are they rebelling against in the in during bleeding kansas. The federal government under the doe face wretches franklin pierce and james buchanan who were northern men whose entire political fortunes depended on absolute obsequious ob essence to all slave power dividers that was how they maintained power the urban machines in the north plus the slave power. In the south. They couldn't they because they were the most demanding constituency on the issue of um on the issue of expansion and the the fate of slavery in in new territory because slavery slavers self-consciously understood that the future viability of slavery as a system depended on continued expansion that was what drove the conflict that led to the civil war wasn't slavery. As such it was slavery in the newly acquired territory and so the governments that oversaw bleeding kansas by the democrats pierce and buchanan whose northernness connected them to the free so state electorate a part of the coalition but whose policies were always enough to guarantee the support of the south so that incentive structure meant that the federal government consistently recognized the con. The pro-slavery legislatures in kansas and declared the free state constitutions illegal which meant that the laws passed by the pro-slavery legislatures had the force of law insofar as you know if if the pro-slavery forces enforce them with violence the state in the form of the local and very small federal troop deployment that was there at forts leavenworth and one other place.

I can't remember right now but dodge. I think um would it would intervene on the side of the pro-slavery factions. If anyone was a rebel in kansas it was the free state faction. They were in the disfavor of the federal government which was the arbiter of power there and the because missouri was right there filled with drunk dirt farming southern whites who hoped to scratch a few dollars out of the soil. after coming a cropper in in the settled territories. Those settled states would just pour over and overcome everybody with numbers and violence if numbers wouldn't do and I think the reason.

This is not just nitpicking because to me that rep that for one thing reflects a misapprehension of the strategic situation that john brown found himself in when he did things like perform carry out the pottawatomie massacre which is considered the blackest stain on his reputation and the thing that makes even people who support him like as figure him to be a a progressive or virtuous character in history have to acknowledge was a over-exertion of of of mania caused by some sort of an imbalance and his pursuit of the harpers. Ferry raid in the face of any plausible route to success rendered him in the minds of even people who would support him inherently mad and because I think more than even his erratic behavior or violent behavior. It is his very clarity of faith not in god as an abstraction but as in god as a lived reality. That is what rendered him insane to people is what renders him more than anything insane to people and that the insanity they depict in this movie show is an insanity that is just an inability to recognize a more spiritually bound and therefore deeper human spirit to use get abstract and goofy about it. Just it seems to chop it down to a recognizable framework oh religious mania plus like well-intentionedness equals. kook or something like that and this small thing about rebels is indicative of that. John brown carried out things like the pottawatomie massacre in a framework where it looked very much to every observer especially right after the sack of lawrence which was when the patawatomy massacre was carried out that the pro-slavery faction in kansas was going to win was going to take over the entire territory have it admitted as a slave state look what was happening in washington the the president.

The the presidency was in the clutches of a democratic party that was fully invested by the power of the slaveocracy which meant that that combination would guarantee that future states would come in as slaves and the only long-term hope for ending slavery in any realistic fashion. Short of the spontaneous war was cutting it off creating a cordon sanitary freeze territory around the south to eventually weaken and destroy the beast thy starvation of land and expansion and that's what the south understood which is why they were fighting so hard in kansas and why when the issue of kansas galvanized the north so much that they elected lincoln over the issue of the compton constitution. That's what the compton constitution is what broke the democratic party into three parts. What ensured lincoln would win and what guaranteed the republicans a stranglehold on the vote in the northern states such that lincoln was the first anti-slavery candidate to carry every northern state which meant he would have run even probably without the democrats splitting up why was that the issue why did they vote that way. Why did the south then secede because they saw that the writing was on the wall because of what john brown did in kansas and then in harper's ferry which means that assuming that they were mad or or bloodthirsty or or erratic assuming that not knowing it through textual analysis which come on nobody reads anything you're just going off reputations you're just looking through the prism of history through sort of a broad humanist lens.

What you're doing is you're failing to see the tendrils that bound him to the earth in such a way that he could be sane in a land filled with insanity that he could see the deeper reality of human human interdependence that was invisible to everyone else and that he was and that what he did pushing at the boundary at every level of what was acceptable and going beyond what was practical or even moral in the pursuit of the next level of engagement with the issue. The next concrete move towards the actual eradication of slavery was predicated by him asserting reality in the face of a lie and so any art that seeks to deal with him. I think should deal with him from at least understanding that in this show to me it seems to me that they haven't even thought this way they had it. This stuff has not even occurred to them honestly.

I think what it comes down to more than anything is that the new left-wing social position that you see in things like a showtime movie with a prestige cast that's going to get written up in all the good online periodicals and was going to form the a part of a balanced cultural diet for a you know late empire. over-produced elite in our media in our country's media.

Centers and centers of the creative class is that we have now internalized the same thinking about race that the dunning school perpetuated through american society at the turn of the last century that was when the prevailing understanding in culture was that john brown must have been insane because he thought black people and white people were equal. Only only an insane white man could think that therefore john brown was insane. Now the new cynical afro-pessimist sort of t tn thc coates received wisdom on race is that john brown must have been crazy to think that white whites would ever treat black people as equal that they could ever actually affect equality in society because why would john brown want to see. Slavery ended unless he thought eventually human equality could be could emerge out of white and black living alongside one another. Why would he have done it if he didn't think that could happen and would happen as a result of it and that's the part of it that they now think renders him insane. It doesn't mean he was a bad guy that's the difference the old dunning school people said he was mad and bad the new afro-pessimist liberal.

 cultural. hive mind says he's bad because he couldn't recognize the inherent wickedness of white people or the inherent intractability of of white supremacy because you can't because the inability of white people to actually empathize with black people at a deep enough level to treat them instinctively as a person that that is an impossible thing. Even though he felt it. He felt it as deeply as any man could feel anything that makes him crazy that's what makes him crazy and this show is about that it's about how he was two. He was two. He saw the forest great but he missed the trees like the whole first thing.

The first thing he does is that he rescues a a slave from a from a slaver in kansas. Plantation in the process gets her son her her husband killed or I mean sorry his gets. His father killed then takes him from the plantation and in the process of taking him over. Here's what his dying father says about his name to think he's a woman and just assumes he is a woman because he can't see her. I mean sorry him. I keep forgetting. It's really him. He can't see him. He can't see onion.

He can't seem henry for who he is because he is too mad to recognize to his own white supremacy to recognize his own white frailty and so even though he's going to act on behalf of black people it will never be truly him acting as it will be on their behalf from a position of inherent superiority that he doesn't even recognize because it's drowned out by the voice of god and that's that's going to that's the complicated modern take on john brown that that acknowledges the reality of slavery and white supremacy in america and it is more truthful and doesn't go in for white savior tropes. Meanwhile you're embedding in people's mind. Even deeper of course it doesn't matter you know it's all noise. But it's just an expression of a culture that in every way reproduces the idea that and capitalism is happy to do it. That's race is irreparable on the end for reactionaries. It's it cannot be reduced because it's real it constitutes an actual difference of some sort of spiritual or or genetic. disjunction that that cuts off the obligation between humanity says you are not part of it anymore. The other says that white people believe that too much for it to ever actually be defeated which then means there can only be conflict. There can only be conflict over resources and victory and defeat. There can be no reconciliation because there could be no equal terms for a social contract and the question then is who's going to win that fight and given the numbers in america. If push comes to shove and that's where everybody gets pushed either by the right or the left.

The answer is going to be their own kind because it's who's at the end of the day. They're going to trust so anyway not a fan so far. We'll see I'm gonna watch all of it. That's okay. I'll keep watching that garbage as our friend. Donald trump once said I might be wrong. Like this all might be getting complicated and turned into a rich bullier base honestly. This is one of the faults of television as a as a art form not kidding about this. I think that one of the things that makes one of the many things that makes television a lesser in my opinion art form than things like film or literature is that the way it is viewed and the way it is reviewed make it impossible to view it. The way people want to prestige. Television is supposed to be this narrative that unfolds over time and yet you are seeing it in these intervening chunks honestly binging is the way to watch it all.

The the gapped out way that we we are used to that's actually worse in my opinion because it means you have to have a take on everything before it develops and then you decide oh this thing in this episode is bad. I didn't like it. It makes you like the show less. It makes you less likely to watch the next episode and then what about later if it's redeemed as turn of a broader whole and you realize it needed to be there. But you already watched it and you already formed your shows your opinion about the show based on that and you're not able to adjust or it's harder to adjust anyway than when you're viewing something as a seamless garment anyway. I will continue to watch this garbage and I'm willing to say it might be better.

I will say this though I do not like ethan hawk at all that is not about the artistic intent or the historical value or any of those higher questions at a pure technical level. I do not enjoy his performance. I didn't think he was a good pick for it in the first place and I think he's bad in the role. The way he's playing the character forgetting whether it's insulting to brown as a character by making him this comical madman. This don quixote figure um just the way he performs it is to me uninteresting. It's just this centaurian rattle with no red with no deeper. no deeper connection to anything it. Just it just seems to be blood and thunder just absolute to the rafters. He seems to be just trying to mouth religious piety through a a kind of an empty performance of like a tent revival preacher. It just feels very artificial. It doesn't feel like it's coming from him 

I would really and the thing is what about first reformed if he'd played john brown like he played father toller. We might be getting somewhere. That'd be an interesting play on the character. He's not he's the opposite of reverend toller in this movie and he is as bad in it as He was good in that movie so that's another big hurdle for me is that. I don't like him in it like the scenes where he's owning slavers and yelling at them and going. I am here on a mission of redemption and then cam. Steve zahn gets blown off with a camel cannon and he owns epically 50 slave owners. It doesn't even have any kind of oomph to it because he's just never robbed of this sense of sort of comic opera buffoonery that means that he can't even get any badass moments off. I think people are just reading it at their want. Oh they just want to see the slavers get epically owned because it's just another performance of the same puppet show of antifa versus a proud voice that we're all psychically investing in instead of engaging in politics and so I see why people want to get off on that but he can't even give it to me if it had been. Mountain of doom is is like the the voice of justice itself willing to also be realistic with john brown's voice and make it like high and crackly um.

He did not have a deep booming voice actually. He was like he's like abraham lincoln in that way. Lincoln is thought to have or was before the daniel day-lewis role defined. The character was thought to be very deep and resonant like sam waterson. No it was high and reedy and and danger day. Lewis went for that because he had the confidence and he knew he could work with it. Ethan hawk. It's like no it's not badass enough and so he ignored the reality to give him this and I understand. I understand that the real point of the show is to take him as like a figure in american history. Like a figure of um our mythology like um like paul bunyan or pecos bill or john henry and like that's his role in this. Like that's why there's that's you know. It's. It's john brown as a as a cultural folk hero. If that's the case. I don't like the aesthetics of it at all. If that's the case you can't go with ethan hawk. There give me somebody who actually feels like they would be bigger than life. I'm sorry ethan hawk even though he's been good in things in the past and is an underrated actor generally he is not larger than life so you it from the beginning. If that's what it's going for. And I've heard people arguing that that's the lens to view it through no no. This isn't john brown. This is john brown if he as paul bunyan. This is john brown as john henry this is john brown as an american folk character brought down through generations of like retelling of you know the the american history. Then he needs to not be ethan.

British ian mcshane but the ian mcshane is one of those guys who can't do an american accent. That's why they had to put those funny little bits in of extra dialogue around they had to lampshade it. In deadwood. They had the lampshade that e mcshane was british by having ellsworth at the bar. Go is it true that you were descended from english royalty because otherwise why does he sound like that. It's like how in in schwarzenegger movies he would like to be talking to a date and go yeah. So I was born in austria. We moved here after the war after my father. for some reason decided he needed to leave germany.

Nick cage is john brown oh god honestly with the way this thing is like winkingly self-referential and very of the moment and honestly just it's the same tone as all this stuff that's my main problem with it beyond anything even ideological is it's just the tone is this arch fully socially like the problem with wokeness as a concept when applied to art is that it implies this world wariness and like full understanding of history that honestly just ends up coming off as cultural as capitalist. Realism. It's just more just a wary snarl and a and a wink like oh no we haven't metabolized the whole pageantry and horror of human history without having imbued it with any emotion beyond our pale reproduction of it. Our our quotation marks ironic appropriation of it. So I hope those people who still like the show will engage with this critique because I feel like. I've articulated some genuine issues and I would like to see some people who like the show like I'm seeing some like people. I'm generally very sympatico with saying they like it. I haven't asked matt carpe but I got to find out what he thinks I'm going to text him. I think after this steve scheripa there is a go that's good but anyway it couldn't be a mcshane because elsewhere engine can be british.

I guess but john brown is american. In every sense is the distilled promise of america and and all the things that made him genuinely mad and I would agree that he was mad in the sense that he his personal perception of god was so imminent in his like moment by moment life. He was so imbued with it that he basically was hearing voices. He was not in our consensual reality or at least off enough of it off by enough to constitute being unable to recognize the same reality we do sure but only because he was driven driven that way by the need to assert principles. Deeply deeply actually lived and felt principles of equality in antebellum america as it became more and more overdone by slavery because the other thing that drove drove brown through history was the accumulation of the power of slaveocracy and the in the expansion of slavery and the rise of slave influence over government. My god the day after lawrence kansas was from south carolina who was too cowardly to even let him stand up for himself because he was over six feet two. He probably would have starched him and was received and received in response. Bouquets of cane sent to them from the good people.

The good gentlemen the good well-bred gentlemen of the south. Sack of lawrence was validated by state approval. The difference in was that the difference in moral calculus boils down to this. John brown's violence had a threat of being met with state force which meant he was risking something by it. The violence of pro-slavery people was engaged with casually because there was no fear that there would be any kind of state intervention against you you'll serve. There will be no consequence for this. So it's free to do get get get drunk on corn liquor drive. Some hotel loot a printing press have your way with a farmer's daughter. It's all in good fun because who's ever going to stop you john brown was operating under no legal sanction which meant he was risking. His violence was a risk to himself so that means it had to be pursued by a deeper belief than the mere belief in indulgence of the ruffian scumbags and honestly. Like the the answer to this might be maybe you don't make a movie about john brown maybe you won't make a tv show about problem. Maybe some things are sacred maybe some memories some some people. Some stories can't be adulterated by the moment by all the intersecting baffling demiurgical delusion of the current moment that we live in maybe. We don't need to imprint it by creating a new document that people can psychically organize their understanding of an idea around and thereby de-sacralize it and pull it out of its context and render it. Cheap and tawdry maybe that's the answer to this maybe you don't do it at all. It's not everything in the past but maybe there are some things that you just don't with just why. I believe this. I honestly believe this and people can get mad at me if they want to.

I believe that in an ideal society there would be no death penalty for any crime committed against person or property but that there would be the death penalty for the wanton killing of certain animals because you have to have an enforced and understood social conception of sec sacredness. I'm not saying execute people for putting john brown on television. I'm saying that just maybe have some respect for things some things and you know it's up to you to figure out. What those things are all right guys. I'm going to wrap it up here. I think I got my. I think I set my piece if you want to if you want to hit me up in the dms to rap about it. I'm always open for business ciao bella.
