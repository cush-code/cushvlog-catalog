Hello oh my back hurts today oh just riding myself today that uh before long I'm going to be in some sort of hover based contraption. Most of the time got bad back bad hip got bad legs which some of you might know about all of which it's gonna. It's gonna add up to me being a hilarious gentleman tooling about and there's some sort of device I would like it to actually hover. So the year 2020 I would hope by the time I need it that it would actually hover. But I'm not I'm done holding out of anything cool happening at least not sci-fi cool of course plenty of cool stuff will happen in the Sean Moorhead Cool Zone vernacular as in the kind of things you'd like to read about in a history book after it happens but not experience. How's everybody doing very nice out very nice today. So that's been nice summer's gonna get hot horrible. But I'm a preparing for it mentally. I'm girding my loins to just bake quietly. Although the debug ler today hilariously the D bungler.

They're talking about how you know people are going to the beaches and he said don't go to the beaches now if you want to sit there with a chair or something that's ok. But if it starts to look like a beach well. Then oh hi Lana I always could see you in the chat. He said go at the beach but just not in too many of you oh. How that's not a thing that's not an answer. That's not that's not a solution to the issue. That's that's just throwing up your hands and being oh. We can't stop them from going in the beach but we have to look like we care at all about transmission of this thing. So we're just gonna. Let you decide how many people are to be the beach at which point we're just. Gonna send the cops in to arrest. Everybody I guess or drive him off with fire hoses. Apparently the Atlantic City beaches are completely packed and you know what I just don't know what we're waiting for anymore. We've really we. It all these people who are yelling at everyone to stay home.

It really does feel like they basically don't get how  fast casual eateries but the fact remains is that there's no solution to this issue. There is nothing that's gonna happen other than I'm just shrugging their shoulders and sending everybody out and no amount of like insisting that you're staying in is gonna change that you can stay in if you want but you're gonna be a smaller and smaller group of people who are gonna have the privilege of being able to do so. Everyone else is gonna have to get out yeah people seem to not really absorb the reality of the cheeto in the White House and just the absolute threadbare nature of America's medical infrastructure. I mean it the exact moment that more people need access to health care and an E in American history. A concomitant result of that is that tens of millions of people lose health insurance and access to health when they need it for them for the safety of the entire country. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine designed to kick you in the balls. I do love that Sweden just decided to allow everyone to die and I really think it's because they're Swedish and they've been all been kind of waiting for that begging him secretly praying and now oh thank god this thing I either live which fine or I die which thank God thank God yeah. They call it winning the lottery when you get the covin and die of it in in Sweden when you go when someone says hey hey how's your how's your grandpa.

They go yeah at the Cova and they're like oh yeah. She goes yeah he made it oh that's too bad for them. I'm sorry maybe next time I'm having a weird weird. New Seltzer. Now there's a million Seltzer's these days I don't understand. It's a perfect. Example of just this is an at this point considering them that they all taste exactly the same. The the branding advantage is basically nil what the hell are you getting out of having this on the shelves well part of skin.

A Navy ever. I don't actually know I I don't think there's I think I don't know. I only did the 23andme wants for an episode. We never ended up doing about genetics in the  and it said Northern Europe. I don't know it was pretty. It was pretty. It wasn't very specific Hank Denmark. My track jacket. Someone wants to see the track jacket I can put it on. It's over there. People really want to see it. I could show it to them alright. I'll put the track jacket on in a minute. Someone wants me to stop staring at you. I can't I can't I'm looking at the questions guys. It has. It's been a bit since. Someone asked me to post feet that I gotta say people are lucky that I stopped getting so hammered on these because now there's basically no chance. It's ever gonna happen and you should be  thankful because you do not want to see it.

I keep telling you that and you just do not you just refuse to believe me but trust me. It's true Oh God The Cider boom that was before the cider boom was the last big like alcoholic beverage craze before the Seltzer's and it's all the same thing. It's. It's. It's a less beery alternative to beer that's about the same alcohol content as beer but that does not have that beer II taste which a lot of they think they generally considered to be women but plenty of men don't like and so cider was the answer. For a while. There were there were seven million signers and now I think a lot of that energy has moved to the Seltzer's I think because people realize the Seltzer is too sweet. There's. It's too sweet and they realize oh I'm gonna get AIDS or not. I'm gonna get diabetes for this. No thank you because that's something you need to get stuff for people once they reach a point of realization of their mortality and that's where you go from cider which is good for like 22 year olds to Seltzer which is good for 32 year olds. But cider was with the pioneers drank much much more so than beer beer didn't show up until the German immigrants. In the mid 1900s. They I mean not in large numbers anyway in large mouths. It was it was all  cider alcoholic cider and whiskey of course and so much of it. Just so shit-faced 19th century. People were insanely hammered because most of them the amount of work they did in. The day was just walk behind a donkey so it didn't require a lot of hand-eye coordination and it's boring as. So it helped to be drunk and of course. Water was not very reliable or pure so having fermented was a way to guarantee that it had a certain degree of sterility. It was big in a in the UK but in uh in New England anyway it was cider because it wasn't really they never really were able to establish large scale agriculture in the New England because of its relatively inhospitable soil. So there wasn't really room and no England to make to brew to get the even the requisite wheat for beer whereas there were plenty of apples apple trees so boom squeeze. Those  get some get shit-faced you know there's a reason that the three American cities most associated with with beer and we're the big brewing. Traditions are Milwaukee Cincinnati and st. Louis form the three points of the German triangle of immigration. We're in the mid nineteenth century especially after 48 that happened to up till the turn of the century. German immigrants came mostly from Bavaria but other places as well right. There. There's Milwaukee up there. Here's Cincinnati there's st. Louis yeah Pier one Imports closed today.


I mean people been talking about the death of retail for a while I mean those kind of things. This is the kind of situation where you have if you have a wheezing dying creature. This is the moment when you put the bullet in the head or someone puts a bullet of its head or something where it just it's too much for it to bear and it's hard not to see this as a potential domino effect. Especially since I was seeing today that oh look at this a huge percentage of the of the retail real estate market in this country is undergirded by fraudulent mortgages that were based on false and manipulated profit statements and projections Oh No when does that ever happen before false information propping up a mortgage which are then sold and resold no I mean that's why like I said that's why oh that's my soft bank  bailed out - did a private sector bailout of we work was to keep the retail sector retail rental retail real estate economy afloat and now you had an undergirding. We have a realization that there's an under grading unviable 'ti there that was an overlook just like it was in the house in the housing sector with this massive massive collapse in demand and in or in and in profits. I don't know I don't know how you come back for that quickly or easily. It's gonna all get very cool very quickly. That's the one thing I know I mean. The good news is is that that bubble bursts hey that's a lot of unclaimed real estate that could be used to.

I don't know how's people that would be crazy who would imagine housing people in a city where 25% of luxury apartments are. Unsold and sit there or and and a huge chunk of the rest are not. The primary residence of the or any residents at all are just used as a place to sink money that was where capital fled as as other sources of investment dried up and became less profitable. The safe money over the last 20 years has been urban real estate and so that's where they put all the cash and so these places are just sitting there empty. There they just built this monstrous.

I think it's the tallest building in Manhattan. Now apartment Q looks like a huge Lego block. It looks like the long Tetris block and I don't know how many people are supposed to ever who would ever live in there in any one moment I'm actually sleeping there besides like staff members because I'm sure it's got its own concierge service and  army of maintenance people but in terms of actual people who have owned those build. Those apartments how many you got a couple of dozen. Some kids hanging out like some Saudi fail son is just playing fortnight for real with like homeless people that they abducted and then put microchips in their brain. So there's this insane amount in every year of an area of this speculative real estate that has never been. It was never even - supposed to be lived in which is monstrously terrifyingly distorting and awful in a place where there's limited space and therefore if you take a bunch of real estate off the market for any possible use by people you wildly reduce the amount of actual available of living space. The city has this happened to every  over just crack them open and is go in and then oh look people can live here. That's great done. What are you gonna do about it.

I do think that if the u.s. Collapsed yes the middlee the Midwest which yes is sort of the Balkans of of the America I think if it ever became part of one coherent political bloc. So a lot of people say what that would be like Tito's Yugoslavia. I honestly think that would be optimistic for the Midwest. I think holy roman empire are much more accurate yeah. The Midwest would be the Holy Roman Empire that uh and then the New England and like the mid-atlantic all those scary coastal people. That's that's the Ottomans oh thank you for saying I look cute. I know that I look very uh bedraggled. The problem with the Midwest is that people are gonna come for that water. There are already tried to comfort others a group the Great Lakes compact which was done because people  were asking after Midwest with late Great Lakes water and they're not gonna not gonna not come knocking so that's gonna that would maybe force it to be more politically coherent. Maybe so it could be a it would be able to withstand the pressure from outside to get that water to get those pipes in there to keep Phoenix from just drying up and blowing away in Las Vegas. Now everyone must swear to give their life to defend the Great Lakes if it comes to that not allow. To get our water Venice yeah I Manhattan I could definitely see being like Venice ie halfway underwater and an independent a trade empire yeah.

You could this you could do like a heavy handed thing like a medieval retelling like a tent like retail or in medieval tale in a post collapse America New York City would be the Venetians yeah New York City's the venetians Midwest is still the the Midwest would still be the Holy Roman Empire and maybe New England would be the Ottoman Empire. See people say well America will maintain its structure because it'll just get hollowed out that's true that I think that's what would happen. If there was any give left in the institution's. The problem is is that it's just too  brittle. There's no way to change anything. There's no way to accommodate to change using the Constitution and of course that's been fine for the most part because people in charge want it that way they want procedural roadblocks to any kind of reform through the political process.


So they love that fact but in moments of significant crisis. Those that brittleness gets put under pressure and then it breaks up. Somebody asked what the cool zone is. It's a it's a tweet from Sean Morehead who's a very good tweeter I highly recommend anyone who doesn't follow him who wants to be on Twitter. If that's your bag go follow him but he said if you see a 30% unemployment. The country suffers 30% unemployment and massive lack of trust in its political institutions. It will enter what historians call the cool zone as in when it's fun to read about not so fun to actually experience though because we have a thing where there is a significant crisis of actual political legitimacy in this country and the reason that it hasn't been a problem so far is because everyone is too comfortable and yeah that has been the pervading Nepen. The. That's the that's the  opiate. That's the narcotic that has always seed soothes all of America's cultural and political illnesses. There is free refills free land and then free refills. Let's the land ran out but if the free fills if you've got if you go to Chipotle and they say one soda no refill and you get one piece of ice. You don't get all that you don't get as much ice as you want I mean of course. This is a metaphor but I mean that's that's when those systems come under significant pressure that they've never faced before there. It is here's the tweet if unemployment exceeds 30% and distrust of the political process becomes widespread. There is a danger of the United States will enter what historians call the cool zone yes that's exactly where we're gonna be because there is no unified conception of the United States at all. Magga. People and lives live in different countries mentally and and of course geographically and that difference has been papered over by free refills. There's no free refills. Then I don't know what happens and neither does anybody else and I don't think it's gonna be the form of fascism or armed uprisings from the population because they don't even know how to think that way and the ones who do are mostly faking it.

But I do think you could see crisis at the level of states within the country or between the United States and other countries oh boy people keep asking you what to do man if I knew how do I tell you we're gonna do an interview with the author of The Jakarta method. People were talking about in the comments. I think this week or early next I read the book if it's very good. It's a very good book I highly recommend it. He sent me a copy which I I read Vincent Bevins. It's a really good book about a very under discussed topic the 1965 Indonesian military coup and how its shaped Cold War responses to colonial anti-colonialism or a decolonization. Rather I mean I should ask him if he's related to ninja. I do wonder about somebody well. Someone's asking about John Brown and they said why can't more people be like John Brown people. I mean I don't think John Brown was a maniac. I do not think that he was insane. I think that studying school propaganda I think that he was he was certainly a fanatic but a fanatic for the right cause is one of the most noble people that we can conceive of and one of the most necessary for any justice to ever occur on this.

Christians in this country don't really believe in God. They don't have that they have completely D spiritual eyes. Christianity. I mean that that's why American Protestantism isn't promised isn't Christianity at all because at a certain point it becomes an attempt that attempt to create heaven on earth becomes literal and you've you you are now just trying to experience the pleasures of eternity. On this on this plane. It's it's pure. It's it's disgusting but so even those people the people who call themselves very religious to go to church all the time they don't really believe they don't have like the fire of God within them. Certainly not enough to do a thing like go to a  armory and steal a bunch of guns and try to go to war with the entire United States government to end slavery with a thing which if every white person in the North didn't want slavery had done they might have actually accomplished it because so few were touched with that sort of holy fire and I mean it doesn't have to be Christian obviously but there has to be some sort of belief systems some sort of transcendent belief system undergirding your convictions for it to be ever possible for your your performance of those beliefs to have full fought full force behind them. The way a guy like John Brown had full commitment and and and maybe his commitment is scary and it is but it's because his faith is skinned to us because it's not something.

We recognize it's not a way of seeing and feeling and thinking that we can see ourselves in and you can say you know no you know. I want what's good for other people for purely purely material reasons whatever and sure you might we all we we're all working towards some sort of a mature through a material understanding of the world a material understanding of what makes human happiness and all that stuff. But if there isn't something else behind it. I just don't know how much your will ever gonna be willing to sacrifice for that belief because you're doing it for yourself. At the end of the day you know you're doing it so that you can live in a world that has certain characteristics in it and the idea of sacrificing yourself for so others could achieve it that requires a certain perspective. I guess that is harder and harder to come by that agree to which you are tethered to life and it's and material existence as like the sum total of life and I don't know what that means I'm just thinking out loud here.

But when people talk about John Brown. That's the main difference that strikes me John Brown had gorilla mindset that's 100% true and the thing is is that somebody says you need martyrs. I don't think that would work either like somebody says the guy John Brown John Brown helped cause the Civil War. There's no question about that I think it was Frederick Douglass who pointed out anybody who says John Brown failed at Harpers. Ferry looks to the fact that a year after the guy after he was killed executed within a year of the execution of John Brown or two years. The guy who sentenced him to death of the military court was in American custody and charged with treason because he'd been captured out of Confederate boat trying to get to England to negotiate the recognition of the Confederacy. As God the Trent affair. He was in American custody was in an American dungeon so in two years of John Brown's execution. It's hard to imagine it happening without that that crucible event and that that sharpening of the distinction and sharpening of the stakes at play we've had people like that now in this moment there's the guy who tried to attack that ice facility right. We got shot there's the guy. They're a couple.

They're better cut a number of people who've set themselves on fire. A couple of uber drivers here in New York at least a couple. Here there's a guy who set himself on fire Prospect Park to protest global warming. But the thing is is because there is nothing behind any action. There's no movement behind it. There's no I there's no greater understanding being represented by it that is understood by all sides.


It can't have any real power. The reason that our that Harpers Ferry struck such a thunderbolt in the South was because of how many Northerners they knew agreed with John Brown how many Northerners had sympathy for John Brown. There was there was they were all throughout the north especially in New England. Church. Bells rang in commemoration of him after he was executed a guy who was sentenced to death for treason and who had fired on American troops and they knew that the stakes were real and that they needed to break off from the United States as quickly as possible so that they could prevent the slow and Steady's usurpation of. Slavery by those people which they knew is inevitable now whereas any action taken now is not taken be it on behalf of any constituency that has any form than anyone recognizes well. Somebody says what would a right-wing John Brown figure look like the closest thing to John Brown in the in like the last 30 years just in terms of being a religiously inspired terrorism homegrown in the United States is Operation Rescue and anti-abortion movement. The guys who killed George Tiller those guys think of themselves as John Brown figures. Kansas embraces John Brown largely not because of race but because they see it as they see his actions as a as the embryo of their attempts to end the Holocaust of slava of abortions. I love someone says Joshua Josh Stoller Matt Josh Holly and Matt Zoller will lead a national Workers Party that that could only make sense if you are on Twitter basically exclusively. Those guys are  pencil neck Doris that nobody knows whatever Trump whatever form trumpism takes it's going to be in his shape which means it's going to be about just pure libidinal enjoyment.

Not not an ideologically coherent project which fascism never is anyway. It's gonna be. It's gonna be one of the clowns. It's gonna be one of the goofballs. It's not gonna be one of these. These these ideological little gnomes sitting back thinking that they've squared the circle on maintaining conservative governance in a more diversified country. Tucker is to see Tucker could Tucker is the only one of the people that has brought up in this vein that seems even mildly my only possible but honestly the thing I think of is. Tucker has the Bernie Sanders problem if his long as Trump's alive and not president anymore right imagine. This Trump still alive if he thinks that Carlson is in any way not on his side doesn't like him. If he gets jealous of how successful Carlson is on the campaign trail he could decide to denounce him and if he denounces him it's  cooked if there's battle between Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Tucker Carlson will lose.

It doesn't matter if he's the one who's actually got the ideology and he's actually gonna carry it forward and he's got the vision to no. No no don't you see. I'm really gonna implement this stuff. No no no I'm the one I'm the brains you think he's gonna win if Trump gets offended by that if Trump la ifs Trump thinks that his campaign is implying. He didn't do a good enough job making America great. All he do is be. He would have to. He would just have to say I don't like him and that's doubt in the end because the spectacle overrules everything I would say Don Jr has a better chance to be the next Republican nominee than a guy like Josh  Holly and Mike Pence more than any of them not cuz not Mike Pence has juice or anything but just because for them for the Biden effect of he was just there for eight years or four years. Whatever it is and they just like the vibe that he brings cuz. He reminds them of the guy. They really like yeah everyone senator by the weird triangular shelf. I have here. I don't actually know what the deal is. It is very oddly shaped.

Trump ye somebody says Trump doesn't have any of our pence doesn't have any of trumps. Energy. Joe Biden doesn't have any of Obama's energy. It didn't matter the only thing that would defeat that is if somebody was like more connected to Trump and more viable. So that's why I say I think Tom Jaudon. Jr. would probably beat Penn suspect but the funny thing is Trump might not endorse Don. Jr. If he ran which would hurt us and you know 100%. He wouldn't I got to say there might not be an election in November and anyone who wants to scoff at that one look at what just happened in Georgia.


They just cancelled not postponed. They cancelled a state Supreme Court race and then the governor Republican governor just appointed a guy for two years. They just canceled the election unilaterally and I mean what if that happened especially if I mean by Neff November you could be in the beginning of what is predicted to be a second much worse wave of coronavirus that's gonna be hitting right. Around then you're gonna have some states that are gonna have made made preparations for that by allowing for vote-by-mail like California but a lot of states their entire political architecture of power is dependent on voter suppression and making voting difficult. So they're not going to give that up until it's too late and then you're gonna have a system where you can't safely vote in half the states they're gonna have a plausible argument to just. Say we're not to having the election right now and more important than that.

I asked you if they said that what would stop them realistically. What would prevent that from happening I've thought about this I don't know if the Joint Chiefs aren't on board and like I've said those guys are absolute. Yes men just lunkheads or enough of them are that anyone who had any problems would probably swallow their tongue hell. The  Democrats would probably sign off on it because to say this is what it is would break the system and they don't want to do that the same way Gore didn't really contest what happened in 2000. They would have to sign off on it because if they didn't sign off on it then that would mean that the system was irrevocably broken and they could never accept that so even if they  said even if Trump himself the Chito in chief that goddamned life-sized cheeto the cheeto creature foodstuff put into a suit orange dust covering the white house. The orange house were like even if he said we're not in the election because they know the only alternative to acquiescing is what filing a lawsuit and one way or the other suggesting to the American people that the American that the  system of government is gone and that they no longer in a democracy which they've.

Their entire existence is to prevent people from realizing that they don't live in a democracy why would they change horses in midstream. The entire point of the Democratic Party is to not let people realize that American democracy is non-existent so if they made the final move and just canceled the election what would be in any their interests to stop doing what they've been doing the whole time BAM. Yeah. I think that's true I don't think anybody realizes a degree to which this is all. This can all go away and of course there's a lot of reasons they don't want it to mostly related to like.

You know bond rating and things like that and and how and how far America's credit can go and and the necessity of these institutions in preserving that but if you have a bad enough like real economic crisis they'll probably just throw the  bones and see what happens so yeah until the last they would say we are disappointed. We are disappointed that we could not figure out a way to make the selection safe we're hoping to come move forward and find a solution that it's bipartisan and that ensures fair elections for everyone and that we will have a voice in the our form of government blah blah blah and at that point you can just kick that can down the road. All you want every year just postpone. It every year postpone it until you look around and realize no one's even expecting it anymore and if you have something like that though depending on what party it is in charge.

The thing you might see you might see some secession like if Trump did that at the national level what I said goes but gavin newsom might decide that he wants to. West. Western seaboard may you know that that now now maybe and it Biden wins by the way at all and they gets in there or the Democrat whoever it is cuomo hillary I if they don't if there is no resolution to the significant like structural collapse of the economy right. Now you will see very quickly the Secession movement blow up a real one where some  hot tub dealer talk radioed underpaid. Who's conned his way into a governor's mansion from Texas to Georgia to Florida wherever is going to have every incentive in the world to push all social unrest and anger about the state of the economy on to the federal government which will eventually create a movement of demanding conflict with that government. If things kept keep getting worse and eventually they're gonna have to say actually no.

It's not all their fault. It's actually a lot of my fault. We don't know what we're doing or you have to go forward. Then you have to go through with what they want which would be some sort of attempt to break away from the country once again as I'm saying this is all predicated on a unrestrained economic collapse and so if this doesn't happen you don't get to be smug and say Matt was wrong yeah in the sense that that didn't that that level of economic misery didn't persist. But I don't know at this point what is more likely that something's gonna come in and rescue us or that we are in for a long dark night economically speaking with a less and less durable political order that has less and less communal consent behind it yeah. That's the other thing that might happen is even with all that going on. They could just have the election with half the states not having at any kind of functional electoral infrastructure and within less a 30 percent turnout at which point you basically crossed the same sort of Rubicon of failing to observe even the forms of the system.


Huh man the vaccine guy the vaccine. It just seems so perfect that all that a  tip tip of the cap to the showrunner who came up with the idea that this season of America would end on a cliffhanger of whether or not the country would take vaccines which I mean if you seem contagion. That's the whole thing they have a similar world destroying although much higher lethality rate flu type 2 thing that rips or America rips through the world disrupts everything and then is we're all saved by the vaccine because all the anti vaccine crazies like Jude Law have been proven wrong with their fake scam drugs that they only want to tell people to take because they haven't stock in the company got. That movie really is hilariously prescient uh-huh and everyone's gonna take it and be fine. AAA in this  come out and say hey yeah this this disease that just showed up two years a year ago. We've now got a vaccine for it. Everyone take it now in a country where people weren't even getting their  knows and then you'll have the amazing cognitive dissonance of Trump telling people to take a vaccine when so many of his supporters are anti-vaxxers and he has been in the past one too but of course at this point he doesn't give a  about that he just wants things back up and running yes need the vaccine and like I said he's got to call it a potion or something or a tonic or or an unguent because the word vaccine is just gonna cause they're gonna freak out I mean maybe they'll end up taking it.

But it's gonna cause a deeper level of cognitive dissonance. That's gonna require acting out even further. So they'll take the vaccine maybe. But they're gonna be even more insane by doing so but a big chunk of them. I think won't because I've already seen. Some people say if Trump tells me to fake a vaccine I'm not taking it. I'll know they got to it and there's gonna be plenty of that I guaran-fucking-tee you. Heep comes out with the vaccine. There's gonna be plenty if they got to it because those are foundational beliefs. Not everyone of course does a lot of them love. Trump more than anything. Those are foundational beliefs and then there are a bunch of liberal  vaccine when they don't get their kids vaccinated yeah. I don't think that's happening I do love that they're already warning people that this is probably gonna be a fake vaccine and that it probably won't work and it'll probably kill more people. But hey we'll have it and once we have it no one has any excuse to not go to work and shop and then you got dershowitz out that are going.

The government could make you get vaccinated and shovel and shut needles in your arm. It's like god damn. What are you trying to do man are you trying to make people not do this thing but yeah this whole plot coming to a head around the question of whether we can convince enough Americans to take the  vaccine to get her immunity at this point with this degree of complete paranoia and social mutual mistrust interesting times a cool zone you might call it highway to the cool zone dude to do highway to the cool zone. Yeah I've got to say scariest this time is its. It's also man can you imagine not having gotten to this point. In the story can you imagine not having got to the game show host president presiding over the Black Plague part of the American story. You kick yourself if you're you're up there in the imminence spirit with all time and space communing together and if you could just pop in for a second pass where your life ended and got to this part you'd be like got there.

Like hitchens how do you think Hitchens feels right now. Oh shouldn't if I can smoke so much dude shouldn't if I can't drank that much he might still be around to see some cool. I could see him being a absolutely being ya know pre-opened guy no question. He would be 100% or re-opened. Guy show your manly he'll show your masculinity. Then he would get it and immediately die just absolutely die instantly. He would be the only Phil celebrity to die of it sometimes I'm like oh no I wish Bill Hicks was still here to see this but of course. Then I realized he that he is he's still here for us all and he's having a great time.


That's for sure so mayor is asking about Hegel and something from the phenomenon of geology of the spirit about how the grille pill notion. Essay is a futile attempt to compensate for your inability to act on the world and I would say that Hegel that's that's true to the extent but that in the real situation that we face and the real attempt to negotiate a world that has so much symbolic a spectacle to it. That is so removed from our day-to-day lives that I would say that it's doomed to fail if it's sterilized. It's doomed to fail if it's the only thing you do but if you use it as a practice to get you back to a place where you actually can engage with the world around you because you haven't been insurance or --sold you haven't been in source 'old by the fifty thousand screens you look at everyday a thing that Heigl and Hegel could never of. Conceived of then I think it's something useful as a as a practice to refocus attention at energy closer to you. She know Christ stupids are cheat oh Christ. He's a stupid SAR cheat.

Oh Christ stupid czar. He's a stupid Tsar guy. He's Jesus cheat oh Christ Superstar goddamn. It you guys reminded me that there's a cheeto in the White House that really did not want to hear that can't believe there is a Cheeto emote. We're gonna need to work with that we're gonna need to get a Cheeto emote going in the chat right. Now all we have is a Dorito which is not quite the same thing because his head is not triangular. It's kind of roundish oh yes vibing this calling Trump President Tweety very good very good very good. The thing is you don't have to do that you shouldn't do that you should not try to own Trump. It's just the battle you can't win. You kind of come in from a different angle that was the whole burning idea. It was Bernie was gonna come at him from a different angle. He wasn't. Gonna have to call him president Cheeto but now with Biden you know asserting a absolutely dead consensus on the Left. What the  out of them Nancy Pelosi starting it.

But of course of course she had to do it in the most. The premise most bloodless Democrat way instead of saying dude you're a fatty boob a tea with them with him. Too I wanna look at them titties Lou TVs bouncing that shirt look at that gun. No she says he's morbidly obese a clinical term. A term of a doctor would use to subscribe a condition that you should really you're. Gonna have to do something about that just the fridge just a I finger-wagging judgmental clinical tone. So he's so loved from Democrats instead of just calling him a big fat. You wear a diaper look at the baggy ass pants you had a diaper under there you  himself. His face scrunched up any what and then I smelled it and then he waddled out of the room.

What's he gonna do deny it. Yes. He's gonna deny it all day instead. You got these Democrats you got got grandpa Simpson getting into the sassafras and going president Twitty bird over here with them with the flip-flops on the trip trap. Okay can't get him out of the Telegraph room and then we got Nancy Pelosi just just tsking him. Someone needs to someone needs to call Trump what Mickey Rourke called Trump in that one Instagram post I know he's not on that hydrochloric Queen ship but it would be so funny if he was like if he was actually taking it if he was that committed to the bit that he was taking it but also very funny if he thinks he's taking it and they're giving him. Placebo I think he's just lying I mean that's what he does. He's like yesterday yeah. It's great I love it. I love it but I would love it if it would be amazing if he was  just getting Pez and they didn't even take. They didn't even bother not to give it to him with from the dispenser. He just thinks that's how it comes yes. He doesn't even know. He thinks he's on it. Oh because look at that. It's done fader a.fader oh my gosh but a little prescription tab on the side. He thinks it's real. It doesn't matter if he did die though if you really took it and he got a heart attack from it for his. Just car battery filled with Velveeta ass heart to burst.

Wow that might be the funniest thing we could happen just purely funny like not even lol. Hellworld. Funny I mean seriously how funny would that be what would the riffs be like the day that Trump just  his heart explodes like a bratwurst in the microwave cuz. He gave himself the fish cleaner drug I mean yeah. I don't know if you couldn't top it for comedy. It would be the funniest thing ever and yet very few people would get good jokes off about it. That's the thing cuz how do you top it almost every joke would suck all the beams would be. All the bits would be suck all the podcast episodes trying to riff on. It would suck because none of them would compete to compare to the actual thing just the reality of the thing man and can you imagine the Liberals trying to like recalibrate their whole world. Now that he wasn't there. They're having to reapply all their hatred on the dull as dishwater time serving gray pant pleat Mike Pence oh my goodness.


He is not an enemy worthy of the name. Donald Trump is the ultimate liberal nemesis. He is their Moby Dick. He represents everything that they love. He represents every every element of culture that they're repulsed by everything about this country that makes them uneasy and contemptuous and nauseous. Trump represents all of it in one gaudy package and they have therefore been able to invest this hatred into him that they could never even muster for George Bush and because he sought to stoke it which is one of the things George Bush was mostly oblivious to the hatred of liberals.

People around him loved it and made and and would tee it up. More tees it up. Bush was oblivious if anything he was probably a little annoyed by it. He even wanted to be liked. Trump through sheer fixation is able to completely invest them with intentionally with ever increasing amounts of rage that they directed him and for that to just go away like that with no judgment no cosmic judgment he wasn't defeated in an election he wasn't arrested. He didn't poop his pants on pump in public and admit that the Putin is his daddy. Just died on the toilet. It'd be funny for a minute but then the goddamn gaping halt if that would leave inside of them. What would fill that what could possibly fill that Mike Pence could never ever fill it and that same Hall in the other reverse that same positively erotic Association. The conservatives have with Trump that he is out stalking in them the opposite and equal delight to the liberals to have that emotion relationship just snap severed instantly with no apotheosis supposed to be directed on to  Mike Pence. It's gonna cost it would have to cause an explosion in some way how could how could people reconcile a life with that such that big a part of their emotional landscape gone with no context not resolved into anything else just gone just imagine it. I honestly think that it could cause a national nervous breakdown think about that. I'll see you guys soon. I don't know maybe tomorrow maybe the next. But we'll have another one pretty soon trying to do two or three a weekend at least so talk to you guys on the flippity-flop.
