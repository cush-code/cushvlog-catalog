Um all right. There we go hi guys uh today. I have nothing. I have no agenda. I have no takes. I don't have any bombs to throw. I'm just very excited to show you guys my next level of grilling. I've been grilling up a storm. This uh early summer been doing mostly delicious blizzies but also hamburgers steaks. I had will over here to do a beer can chicken but you know oh that man's reach should exceed his grasp for what is the heaven for. I decided even though I am a grilling neophyte that I'm gonna try to smoke pork shoulder that's right. I've had this puppy on all afternoon. Uh. I've got the gang coming over in a bit to eat it but in the interim I got it on there low and slow. I have no idea if it's working. I do have a meat thermometer. So. I'm not going to kill anybody and I have backup glizzies if it doesn't work and also we can go. There's a store open still if I know I'll have time to get something else. But I think it might work and will has told me that if it's taking too long you can always put it in the oven at the end so for now though I want to try it. I want to make a good faith effort to try to smoke this bad boy and in a bit. I'll show you what he looks like because I'm gonna have to spritz him with the uh with the apple cider. Uh soy sauce combo so you're gonna take a look and I gotta say uh even if this is a disaster. It's gonna look good on the stream because it looks real good right. Now in my opinion. The skin is getting. It's got the crackle. It's looking great uh but yeah no not making any promises. I actually get it done but that's what I've been saying about this.

It's all about the experience. I've had a lot of fun tinkering with this trying to get the the right amount of fire. It's engaged me. Uh kept me grounded. Uh made me not feel that anxiety that ennui that restless torpor that is the dominant mindset of the idol late century nietzsche and last man or woman. It casts it aside because I am I'm committed to a physical task so in a little bit here. I'm trying to wait maybe another 15 minutes. I'm going to try to. I'm going to open her up. I'm going to spritz her down. You can take a look you can take a look. I think it's gonna be good.


Uh the marinade. Uh it's not a marinade. It's a rub and it's uh will's blend actually. Uh and it's proprietary and it's delicious. He's uh. He's a great great great griller way better than me was final days.

The nixon movie. I'm always ranting about oh no no the. The nixon movie. I am always ranting about is secret honor. It's a one-man show starring philip baker hall as a nixon in retirement writing his memoirs consumed completely by shame. It's great performance directed by robert altman as a student project at the university of michigan. I think it's a tremendous movie and it gets at nixon's psyche. I think better than anything because uh I was talking about like nixon's with somebody recently and about how like the rare really good ones. Philip aker hall is one of them but there's a couple more. I'll try to think of. It is that the thing that gets you from an impression to actual embodiment of nixon. Is is there's like an extra register of because he's very tight right. He's very hunched.

He's very stressed. He's armored in the reiki incense uh but he reaches a level of exasperation and anger where he kind of cuts through like the quaker waspy sort of social buffering is cut through with just this lightning bolt of of drage and god love him but langella. Although I really like that movie he doesn't do it. He kind of he teases it but he never really hits the hits the note and I don't. I don't know if uh if I could ever say that uh I'd have to watch it again. But I don't really remember uh.

What's his name anthony hopkins doing it in nixon either and I'll tell you right now kevin. Spacey sure  didn't figure it out uh in that elvis versus. Elvis meets nixon movie he made with michael. Shannon did you know that there are two movies made about the one time that elvis met nixon. How is that that interesting how is that worth one movie oh yeah this. Uh this insanely drugged out megalomaniacal. Uh we're a hillbilly millionaire recording artist has a weird idea that he's gonna become a drug enforcement agent. Probably so he can score the best uh downers in town wants to get like a federal firearm since it goes to see the nixon and it's like it was a five minute photo up and there's a photograph of it and that's who gives a  nothing interesting about it. And yet they made a a movie with bob gunton uh as nixon in a showtime original in the 90s. I forgot who played elvis in that one does anyone remember has anyone seen that and then a few years ago before it all fell apart for kevin spacey. He did one for theatrical release with michael shannon as uh as elvis and of course. I've seen both of these you know. I'm complaining about this horse.

And yet. I have to watch it because screen nixon's are compulsive to me. I have to see if there's one out there. I'm eventually going to find it out because I find it fascinating like john cusack for god's sake blake. Nixon in the butler also did not get the register but spacey wasn't very good and shannon wasn't very good honestly and I love michael shannon. I was. I said on twitter that I was bummed that this uh john brown show on showtime is starring ethan hawk instead of willem dafoe. I actually retract that I think the best guy who could have possibly played uh john brown was would be uh would be michael shannon but I gotta say.

I have a hunch about this movie. I have a hunch about this movie uh or the the showtime series like from the voiceover and the c in the trailer. It looks like it's trying to be funny which means that it's trying to be like uh a contemporary gloss on the historical moment right like oh john brown and those guys well what did what what was it really like and then it's it's sort of like that whole genre of you know like what if oh what if jane austen had a twitter account it's trying to contemporize a historical moment and I think that that's sometimes very useful and can be uh invigorating and like reverse sort of state expectations. Uh. I think in this case. It's I mean. This is the first cinematic john brown we've seen since what uh  van heflin in the santa fe trail where he's an insane maniac and ronald reagan who plays george custer and then his best buddy. Jeb stewart have to go uh stop him from raiding harper's ferry and the fact that now we're getting a essentially soifed a a contemporized meaning civilized meaning desacralized meaning disenchanted john brown and I think that the only movie about john brown that could be interesting is one that took his religious faith seriously. The same way that the only kind of movie that would make be interesting about nat turner would be one that took his religious faith seriously like with the way that the witch you know that movie the witch. The whole what's great about the witch is the witch. It tries to answer the question what was it like to be a puritan because and that's why the witch is real and it's never a question that the witch is real which is established as real as almost in the beginning of the movie because to them the riches were real. Satan was real you're going to go in there and be like oh well look at these idiots. This is you know oh they're clearly they've got scrafula and they think it's the touch of the devil. What's the point of that. We know how we feel about this. What's interesting artistically is imagining what they were feeling about it and so I would want to see a non-jokey john brown a john brown that took that that was for the point of view of a character who had genuine world-shattering faith in the righteousness of his cause and that implies like a supernatural uh uh a mysticism. A spiritual dimension that contemporary culture lacks completely and anything made with temporary contemporary culture in mind is going to be uh fraudulent and of course that attempt would fail you know we're trying. We would be making that movie there would be a degree of condescension but maybe with condescension and the passage of time. There is a deepening of understanding and you're able to tease out layers of empathy that you wouldn't be able to get making it into a cartoon. All right about five minutes guys I'm going to open her up and let you see what she's looking like and you can hear the sizzle as the as I hit that puppy with my spray bottle well.


The horniest founding father is pretty well established to be benjamin franklin right. There's no real competition. There. The man was a uh profligate hornball and in fact he was a member of the hellfire club which is a group of upper-class perverts uh in england who would do uh black masses basically that involved mass orgyastic desecration of of prostitutes dressed as nuns and he was uh. It's a cornerstone of like q lore that and and really like all that. Franklin credit union that that whole like vein of conspiracy that uh the house that franklin lived in when he was on diplomatic mission and when he was inducted into the hellfire club was found a number of years ago to have a collection of human bones in the basement from that period. So yeah one way or another. It was franklin to one degree some degree or another. He was worshiping his own his own uh erotic satisfaction.

I'm going to read ulysses. I think. I need to read a couple more. A couple more big novels right now. I'm stuck. I got caught by reagan land. It's consumed me. It's so good and it's so big but when I'm done with that. I think I might actually read russell banks's uh uh uh cloud splitter which is a big fat book about john brown. Not the book that they based the uh. The snow show on uh and maybe that'll give me some of that. Maybe that yes. I have red vincent. Bevin's book. It's great uh. Apparently it's sold really well uh which I hope to think we had something to do with. But then it was sold too well. They sold out the first run and it took them forever to do another printing. So if you can't get it hold on. It will be back in stock please buy it oh man. I didn't know they did a dollop on sean brown oh that's that that's going to be fantastic. I can't wait all right guys.

You guys ready to take a look. Here we go here. It comes all right all right gang gang gang. Here we go donna see that hear that sizzle you hear that sizzling guys yeah. Let's get a quick. Let's get a quick temp okay. It looks like it's on schedule skill. Gonna have a bit more like maybe maybe. I think a couple hours uh but yeah. I think she's got a couple more hours yeah the heat's coming off so if it doesn't work that's fine. I've got hot dogs. I've got hot dogs. I've got hams. Burgers life will go on and I will have learned from my mistake. That's called growing what can. I tell you folks. I'm a grower not a shower. Uh. I've got a hoisin sauce that I'm very excited about with some garlic. In there a little hot little uh little pepper for heat um. I like the I like the the uh asian pork preparations very much uh. I just have some watermelon. Nobody ever wants sides when I come over here. For some reason. I just want the meat. I do have some watermelon though oh no someone wants me to explain dialectics as though they were a child.

I guess. I would simply they say this there's time and then there's space most systems of analysis in the west. Certainly capitalism certainly like the way uh rationalism as we understand it uh certainly like the every ideology that undergirds the providing ideology of the moment. Uh considers things in one or the other states but never at the same time they know they do not contextualize events in time which means the three-dimensionality of the thing. The fact that something is the way it is because of preceding precedence uh you can. A lot of people will will sort of grant the truth of that statement but it does not inform their actual thinking uh and when you think that way what you end up. Doing is you end up grinding space against time in a process that is essentially uh the persistent conflict of opposites until you resolve a remainder that's the dialect. That's the dialectic that's the engine of history like in the liberal conception of history. We are all powered by little individual batteries of soul or spirit unmoved movers. The things that make me do what we do societies ideas cultures. Systems are built by self-imposing will on the world. Dialectical materialism says no people are humans are formed by the resolution of opposites and then they work in the world. By resolving opposites. There is no unmoved mover. It's just the flickering. It's the kinetic flickering of of energy through history. I hope that makes some sense and it's the resolving of those contradictions that the dialectical contradictions in the process of resolving them you leave a new thing that is part of both but different from either. That's the synthesis and it isn't so.

It's never a question of one proposition or another being correct. Every proposition basically certainly in sciences and certainly in social sciences is correct. The question is is it correct in this context is it a tool that works on this machine. Not. It's true or false. It's always true but is it true now and I'm sad like it's very hard for people to get this because we don't teach it. That way. We teach the idea that there's a right and a wrong answer to things and wrong. Things are like in a bucket of wrongness that they can never be rescued from and they get rejected and then you leave the that you leave the  to create the third thing you'd throw it away. And that's why it's so hard for people to think about this stuff.

That's why so much political discord discussion ends up becoming a sterile moralistic argument. Like there's a moral. There are moral claims and material claims in every situation and the presiding ones from the standpoint of wanting to change them are the are the practical ones the moral ones are secondary. The moral ones are just a reflection of the conditions and they can only be changed by addressing the conditions you can't address them at the level of of uh of of of morality of at the at the spiritual level at the symbolic abstracted level and that's what we all do like uh like everyone's screaming. About like if cops are good. All cops are good or bad or not. It's like okay maybe they are they probably are you can make a moral argument that they inherently are does that matter though not necessarily not if you're in the position of trying to negotiate yourself towards a meaningful change in the situation. A meaningful change in the material reality that is destroying the world and destroying all of us in it. If that's your consideration. Then you have to ask well. What usefulness is this truth as a motivator of action. It's good but is it something to insist on to everybody in the face of the need to create a broad as pro brought a possible coalition of people to not just believe a certain thing but to act on it. That's the primary issue and everything has to be folded into that and online makes it possible for people to say that they can have their cake for dinner and that they can have their purely moralistic argument that keeps them purified that sanctifies them because it keeps puts them on the right side of history where they you can fan. That's the only place that you can convince yourself that you're not actively hindering things and making things harder. No actually I'm doing the good thing. It's because you're not engaging. Both ends of the horse and the thing to remember is that when I say the the thesis and the antithesis are coming together remember those two are both synthesis themselves.


Everything is a synthesis but then eventually it they the the motion of of time of space going through time and vice. Versa shapes things the stochastic eruption of butterfly-like events shape those systems and change them and it's the degree to which humans can get into that process and will things in one or another directions that ma that counts that's the only thing that counts that's why mark said before today philosophy uh was about describing the world the point is to change it. He said we want something different than the old idealistic argumentation that tries to create this category of how things should be without any consideration of turning it into reality. But we because the internet allows us to fly to the abstracted levels as possible as quick as possible on on digital wings. We've all forgotten that truth and are like no actually the point is to describe it as as just as detailedly as possible and make people feel a certain way about that by reading me the idea being that like there's going to be some spontaneous uh transcendent enlightenment because a bunch of people read the same argument at the same time. That's that's liberal that assumes that these things are kindled in people's hearts that you have a change of opinion.

No you are pushed in one direction or another by the flow and ebby of time. It's like the boat's floating and you and it's gonna go towards one or another port. The good one or the bad one and you're behind it blowing on the  boat and we're explaining where it's going on the current. I'm not using this person's saying am. I is it wrong to say that we need to get rid of the ego because uh it's a war against between ego and id. I don't mean ego in the in the in the freudian sense. I mean like the conception of oneself as having a separateness being separate from everything. That's what an ego is and it is just part of that and it is an expression of that of the phenomenon of being that kind of being. It's the pure uh.

Uh you know impulse the closest to the gangly impossible urges that satisfy that satiated us against the the nightmare horror and pain of being alive. It's it's our opium. It's the the it is scrambling for the nearest provision for some level of relief from the terrifying discomfort of being alive. But if you don't have an ego or you are able to tame the ego there's nothing to defend there's nothing that needs to be soothed. There's no fear or there's less fear and there's less fear of pain and there's less fear of death because there's less sensation of these those things as having value there's less there's less you put less emotion behind the idea of being in discomfort because what is discomfort and it and reduces your fear of being dead. What is being dead being dead is just to be renewed to be returned to the flow.

My my separate from is entirely illusory and if you have that then that id can't be used as a  uh as as the as the marionette strings by capital to keep you dangling what is my take on kanye's presidential bid. I didn't say a word about it because I thought this isn't real and then people. I saw for weeks took the stitch seriously enough that you had libs like doing songs about how pissed off they were at kanye and like chance the rapper is going off on a whole thing about whether kanye would be good for like how did none are you people like lobotomizing yourselves so that you could be interested in the news that you care about like is it so boring and and predictable in reality that you have to hypnotize yourself and into removing a crucial like uh part of your brain that recognizes patterns. No he wasn't ready for president. He if he was if you want to run for president without a ballot line from a party that already has access to a ballot. You have to get uh signatures that vary a number from thousands to tens of thousands. In all the states that you would need to cobble together the requisite electoral votes for it to even be a possibility for you to win but even to do it in one state would be an incredible lift. This late in the  pandemic you guys got an album coming out his entire career him having the maga hat him doing this him marrying kim kardashian him becoming a cult leader. They're all just branding because he is at the level where his his branding is his ideology like he.

He is so so fully absorbed the idea that he is a singular genius that the propagation of his genius and the awareness of genius is his evangelicalism that is he is evangel. His evangel is himself because he's fully assimilated the notion that he is the the god of the universe and the most and the most intelligent being in it and the thing is. It's very easy to do that. If you're spinning at a high enough frequency. I mean. I felt that too because the thing is if god is as. I think it is all consciousnesses that ever will or have existed that means that every one of us contains with it you know if you know like in a fractal the same thing. So we all technically because we you know have access to the collective unconscious that that is synoquinon with god means we technically are god too and we could you can convince yourself well everyone's god. I understand but I'm better at being god than anyone else. So I should be and that's I mean and when you have that and the thing is the thing that stops you from taking that too far is having limits bumping against the material reality and when you're a billionaire  running for president.

I don't just. I don't it's just. I think people were they have to have been bored but how can you be bored right. Now my god everything on earth is happening and you need to care about. Kanye west you need to care about the letter have the same conversations and the same arguments you've been having against the same people for five years now without any variance in any of it without any single word exchanging being any different without any argument changing without any minds being changed my god. It's like you're caught in the in a net in a maze and and you have you've solved all the puzzles so you have to take the stickers off and rearrange them.


Uh it's someone's asked what. I'm grilling. We're smoking a pork shoulder. I'm not sure. It's gonna work but I uh like. I said it doesn't matter if one way or the other. We'll all be here. We'll have fun and we can always put it in the oven am I a dud or an ernie.

That's good. That's a lot of 49 question. I think that i. I think I'm like uh oh man. I think. I'm like I'm benjamin buttoning because I feel like. I was ernie for many years and now. I'm done weird okay. I would like to actually talk about this so apparently some weirdo trad cath guy found a tape for me when I did like a  periscope from my apartment in cincinnati. This has got to be four years ago and it's like a clip of me saying how much I hate some group them because they're trying to make the world worse for people and the the guy. The guy just said they he he wants us dead and I think people I it just shows like the the amazing way that that the speed of twitter is such that there are so many syntactic leaps that you make instantaneously like just analyzing a thing you immediately figure out like what the meme format is. What the s what the what the surface uh meaning is what the underlying meaning is uh and uh based on who said it and what memes they used and of course the thing is.

It's entirely wrong. You're you're diluting yourself into thinking. You're figuring it out but you need to have some episteme you need to have some way to filter everything so. But that's why people end up making insanely bad idea of conclusions and just being baffling to me like so. It's just that they and someone I guess just because that guy's catholic everyone thought that meant catholics or even more specifically trad cats. I was talking specifically about  ross dalton and like if I broadened that to uh like his type of conservative. I was talking about the people who were the influencers who were trying to delude people into thinking that there was some way to tame capitalism through christianity. It's the idea that yeah.

I'm unlike previous generations of right-wing christians. I will admit that capitalism is actually kind of incompatible with our values previous generation the guys who made the modern conservative movement and that made uh uh uh american religiosity now in the in the latter. In the in the early 21st century. They uh absolutely 100 thought that uh capitalism was inextricably linked to uh the to christianity because in the market one could express only in the market could one be free to express oneself from the heart. Only in the market could one freely live as a christian because the market facilitates all transactions. Uh now we've had enough years to know that that doesn't work that that's that's the  wheels are off of that thing and some people are still doubling down and being delusional about it. But there's a leading edge of conservatives who are like all right. Let's let's try to like tame this beast by acknowledging. The capitalism is in fact destabilizing but convince them that the application of christianity at us at a at the level of policy uh. I mean yeah they talk about reform but it's very very mild. It's it's all just like tamp down the worst of the inequality but do nothing to deal with the accelerating rate of it. Uh mostly though you want to create a civic a civic. Uh architecture to support faith basically just. It's it's it's neoliberalism for uh christianity like give them. Some tax credits give them some. Uh health shirt and insurance savings accounts or something like it's means tested. It's like let's get. Let's let's just do the nudge but for uh christian values and that's the flimflam that's the  scam. And that's not that's to be contemptible that is gross. But I mean.


I would not say I hate people now like one thing. I think I'm genuinely different. I'm a different person now and we all are everyone changes. It's just a question of how much how perceptively and whether good or bad change. I think that I have changed significantly. I think I've changed significantly for the better. I would not say broadly. I would hate anybody but even because I feel like everyone could be empathized to one degree or another because they're humans like us and they did not choose to live how or when they did. They. Their their reactions are so limited by the happenstance and the randomness of the universe that it's hard to blame them individually. In fact you can't really blame them individually but you have to acknowledge friends and enemies in the public sphere to be able to fight and you need to put energy behind that and sometimes that translates into personal distaste and I think that needs to be acknowledged as necessary fuel but just remember remind yourself that it is just that that it doesn't reflect a greater truth a greater existential judgment of them.

They're just. They're god's creatures. Just like you they are god just like you. They're they're as helpless and tossed by time and space as the rest of us. But even that I would say guys like douthit at the doubted level. The puppet master these  cynical uh christianity pimps. I do have distaste for them. I don't want to wish them physical harm but I do distaste for them because they do bad. They use the they they manipulate genuine. Human yearnings for freedom from the alienation of of this materialist hell that we've created from capitalism and they just cynically fuse that to the  uh exxon or something to to endorse their like clean energy initiatives. It's it's it's moral. It's laundering immoral uh politics. It's wandering in the immoral economic system that you're propping up boo thumbs down see they're saying see. It's just someone saying reimposing christianity.

If you could do it. It might inhibit the flow but you can't because how are what is the plan to actually make people believe. The  state enforcement doesn't do it the most hegemonically catholic countries in europe. Historically the ones where this religion was most thoroughly pushed on the people from above are the most atheistic because it's alienating you can't do it. It's not that the goal is necessarily evil. It's that it won't work and if you don't know that I guess like you're ignorant and I should give you some sympathy for being a dumbass. But I think a lot of these  know that and are being cynical about it. What I'm saying when I say that we need spirituality to infuse the new left and it absolutely has to happen. It's going to be the sinews. It's going to be the nervous system. It's going to be the the electrical impulse system of whatever movement. We create. It's going to not be any of these old any of this old. It's going to be. I don't even know what it's going to be because. It's so emergent. Yet it hasn't emerged. But it's necessary and it's going to be syncretic. So attempts to like demand that it fits some category. It's like all you're going to do is justify you're going to you're going to endorse the state. Capital.

Fusion to the degree gives you the gun of culture and then you can wave the gunner culture around and force people to do what you want but guess what you'll never win their hearts. You'll never convince them and culture will continue to drift away from you and then you will blame them and then boom you're just a fascist so right now. Let's focus on the reality of what's going on how about we focus on the the fact of the 30 million perhaps people being kicked out of their homes at the end of the  month. How about that how about the fact that we've got 150 000 people dead and maybe another million coming all of them pulled from the most vulnerable parts of society because we got to keep the  disgusting machine slicked with blood how about we talk about that and honestly if you can't acknowledge. The the the emergency right now if you can't emer the actual absolute uh vitality of this moment if you can't if that won't convince you that maybe your thing that you care about even if it matters might matter more to you morally than to the moment and what the moment requires and that's why. I can't say one way or the other. Whether I think we can really get our way out of this because I don't know how people are going to respond as the crisis deepens. I don't know if they go inward or they turn outward and everything all our incentive structures to turn inward and that's what's that's what makes me less optimistic. But I'm more optimistic because I recognize my own  scraps and on my cons and my like uh my my rasios. Nation is is larded with personal uh.

Uh prejudices biases and uh and perversions that I don't even know are there that are layered in deeply at the subconscious level a level that I have no way of accessing at this point in my life right now of course. I don't know what's going on and times change everything and so how can. I say with any certainty that oh. I'm black-pilled. I am so black-filled really wow you're the one guy who knows what's going on is the one person who isn't piecing  together mostly from sugar packets. You're the first one. I've met then if you are.


I'll tell you that no no you still someone's asking if getting rid of pain means getting rid of joy. You can't get rid of pain nor should you. Because joy is is. Life can be joy if that's what you give value to you won't not experience either. But only one of them will will resonate. You can like pick the frequency to make it so that pain is not painful because you can to contextualize it away. Uh suffering can be soothed by your mind not by trying to soothe it in the way that your your your reptile brain wants you to by flitting about and and trying to seek uh unsustainable physical pleasure uh or soothing through through consumption or anything or through emotional. Uh catharsis thanks to the internet that those things will eventually that's never going to get you where you need to go. But you can soothe internally by contextualizing all your pain and then when good things happen you can just feel them you can just feel the thing you can feel the sunshine and not get the sunburn because you're transparent you can become transparent at a moment's notice. That's mindfulness.

I'm certainly not there. I'm not even close. But I'm on the journey. I'm reading the books. I'm doing the the daily meditation. I think that I am. I feel remarkably uh even keeled and at peace considering how things have only gotten way way worse and more uh more volatile since the beginning of quarantine and I feel a million times better. I was miserable at the beginning of quarantine in a way that I couldn't even articulate to myself and now when all the sort of worst case scenarios. I imagined and kind of assumed would happen in in uh april are now all coming true. I am less nervous about it than ever because I'm less. I'm less uh tightly holding on to this architecture of self-soothing. But it's certainly tenuous and I could definitely fall off the beam at any moment. But what makes that not anxiety producing is knowing that I know what to keep doing at any point that I fall. I can just recognize myself falling and stop so that's good and I'm not saying that whatever.

I'm talking about is the synthesis this like I am the prophet of the new thing absolutely not. I'm far too limited I i my experience is far too uh individuated to ever have that kind of ability. I'm really like talking out loud about what I think will happen. And if I have any effect on it it will be. It will be that whole snowflake avalanche thing that. I was talking about and that's how I try to like remind myself. That's how I can avoid becoming kanye. You know it's just knowing how absolutely limited. My perspective is even though it's touching on to the entire gossamer fabric of reality at any given moment. I am just. I have a grain of sand on the beach. Is there anywhere. I'd like to travel outside the u.s. I've never been uh. I get yeah. I think everywhere. I haven't been. I have some sort of most places. I have some sort of interest. I can't think of anything that really sticks out is something that I really really yearn to see though. I would like to go to japan just to see like the future while it still exists before it runs out of energy you know.


But of course the joke is as an american. I will not be allowed out of the country for a good couple of years and I have to say I there is a a cheap but beautiful irony all right about um the fact that the trump administration began and I know every liv on. Earth has pointed this out but it is such a just perfect rod sterling level bit of ironic reversal that trump came into office and his first year was entirely consumed with questions of keeping people outside of the united states trying to get in mexicans illegal immigrants of any kind illegal aliens whatever they wanted to slander them with uh and muslims and now his term is ending with amer. The american passport gaining you access to like 21 countries down from 180 or whatever we're actually we're not allowed on most of the countries in the world that's just the perfect karmic boomerang. It's too. It's too uh tidy and neat which of course is. What's so unnerving about this moment like at every moment that the the the uncanny feeling of this era is reality becoming uh the joke reality reality conforming to the exact structure of a joke. That's that's like chilling. It's like oh like reality is is interceding. It's going beyond it's breaking through the imaginative level. It's it's actually breaching the containment between like our collective like unconscious and reality actual physical reality and when that fusion completely happens. Then we have been assimilated. That's that's the  singularity the bad one when capitalism literally turns us into uh nodes in its neural brain. We become part of the robot brain of a of an absolutely desacralized capitalism that does no longer serves humanity because uh it is no longer composed of humans. Humans have been reduced to pure stimulus response units pure desire and satisfaction energy input energy output that's the human part of this neural net that'll be that that'll be where we end up if capitalism is not stopped of course if capitalism is stopped and we are ever able to get to a point of technological synthesis it flips and we we fuse with. We we breach that barrier between the imaginative between the spiritual and reality on humanity's terms on the terms of a fully self-aware. Uh species being that is as unified as like a transcendent individual spirit is using technology to to achieve oneness to arrive at nirvana heaven or hell socialism or barbarism all of it meaning the same thing. The end state the end state of transcendence where all humans have been stripped of anything that makes them such and turned into cogs of pure desire. All their least their least noble elements just squeezing out of them like a toothpaste tube or where all the best all the best remaining all the best synthetic goo remaining from squeezing all the flesh out of the human race. We'll be. We'll be will be what we consecrate that would be heaven. I hope that oh boy. I hope that made sense. That's. I got pretty uh pretty abstract. There.

The food is still going to take a while uh. It's it's going to take a bit because it's boric. I think it's got to get to 190. In fact uh give me a second. I'm going to go uh. I'm going to go check the temp. I'm going to check. I'm going to check the temp so she's coming along nicely. Oh wait a minute. It's not 190. What's it supposed to be what what is. What is the thing. I thought someone tell me. It's not anywhere near there yet. So I'm fine. It's not like. I'm going over overcooked. I just need to know so it is 169. Oh you. Turkeys 145 okay you guys are pulling my chain. You guys are pulling my chain 165 if it's 165. I'm on perfect glide path to success. If it's 1565. I think it's gonna happen gang what but people say 145. All right. I'm going 165 because that's what I'm on a good path for I'm ignoring all other advice but thank you for giving me that. I'm very excited besides will's coming and he'll know too. I'm just trying to before he gets here. I'm trying to keep it on the good good tip to know that. I'm on the good point. I'm I'm on a good oh yeah. It's going to be good guys. We're going to have some good old dangled pork oh. I'm not doing pulled pork. I want to stipulate that. I'm not doing that. I don't like about pulled pork. Uh. I want. I want to yeah. I want to just like get it off with the skin and everything so I'm going 165. Thank you guys because yeah now. I know the information all right oh boy okay all right. What do you guys anybody have any questions. I got a little bit of time left for uh for I guess to get start ready for the grill the grill party. What's going on doggies. What's up cats and kittens anybody have any non non pork related questions for me.

I have not totally stopped drinking. I definitely drink less than. I did though because I used to go out a lot and I would drink a lot when I went out now even when. I'm here. I don't drink as much and now. I'm drinking uh more color. Less calorically dense beverages because now I'm a claw boy. I love a good claw. I'm so happy to have those little guys. I get to feel like a real housewife's child. I also chief of course. I chief more yes. I'm also smoking more uh of the gods of the gods chiba. It's from the earth thank you for saying. That was a good episode with uh david. I thought that went really well uh. I love having him on he's one of the best he gets trump culture. He gets trump's mind better than anybody. I think it's because of where he grew up honestly like he's a tri-state boy. He's northern jersey and he grew up in in the exact in the exact shadow of trump's public persona. So he's he got all that gamma radiation and it's turned him into a analytical hulk. Uh I like the sativa of course most of the time because I don't like getting sleepy but I like to have a little bit of the old indica around if I want to make sure that I can get some z's fred trump was such a monster fred trump is an evil man and that's one of those things that uh that makes you have to give compassion to everybody because you think about how awful donald had it growing up and how he had to compensate for that then you think that that means fred fred trump had the same thing nobody's the prime mover of their own evil.

People are passing through all the trauma of every generation before and and to touch them and we have to people have to be responsible for themselves because no one knows that no one can be aware of all the forces that shape them. So they're they're still prisoners and that means they're still dangerous and they have to be corralled and they have to be stopped but judged is where we get wrong judged and then morally condemned is where punishment becomes punitive when it becomes not a question of making things safer making a person less of a danger making fewer people less dangerous. It becomes about punishing the person who did the thing and that creates a cycle of worsening social violence and and it's and it creates this vast pool of human misery that has to be submerged and taken off the streets like what happened with the the drop in crime in the 90s is we didn't really like eliminate crime what we did is we we legitimized crime. We took a huge amount of social violence generated by our collat the collapse of our uh of our urban industrial economy. We took all of that violence all that social trauma and we legalized it by turning it into mass incarceration with its attendant sadism and violence and exploitation and black markets and the creation of  black guerrilla family and aryan nation or aryan brotherhood at every level. This attempt to sublimate the trauma instead of work. It out creates only more horror and trauma and that's because we lost we lose sight of the social context of people's actions and that's where punitivism that's where punitive culture gets unleashed. It's not good folks and that's why that's that's why you have to contextualize everyone and everyone's actions and know that you are that even though you have to act as though you have free will you know that everyone else doesn't and you don't either. You just can't tell how you can't know what is making you do the thing you're doing you think you're guessing and that is free will and that is also consciousness. They're inextricably linked and the further you can strip down to that level that level of awareness of contextualized action and contextualized restraint the less you can feel the need to judge someone and get mad at them and want to punish them for something they did. And that's what robs the punit. The the the the necessary the exis the required existence at least as long as there's social trauma caused by capitalism which is going to be a while as long as you have the reality of social dysfunction coming from that you're going to have to have a system to deal with it and it's going to probably have to involve it to some level incarceration because people right now are very very messed up and traumatized and therefore violent that violence has to be contained because if it isn't you undermine the legitimacy of the project the state project you're trying to do and it won't last so you have to contain the excess trauma. The the the the trauma that is reinforced by all previous generations and is still being reinforced though lower levels as you're trying to reform the systems uh so you have to be able to have some sort of a a carcerial state. But it has to have but you know. The scandinavian system is largely drained of punitive uh energy because they don't you don't you understand at a cultural level.

Oh there's a social reason for this and of course. One of the big reasons that we don't do it. That way is racism because race is one of those things that mystifies our relationships to one another and we would extend a certain degree of social understanding to people that we love like the more you love someone. It's really just the more you're aware of why they do what they do the closer. You are to someone the more you know why they do what they do and the harder. It is to get mad at them and like empathy is just extending that outward further and further and of course like the greatest transcendence would be to love everyone as you love. The people closest to you because you extend that understanding of their context and what made them do what they do as far out as possible. If you could do that you would have transcended the emotional baggage of the desire to to punish and so in a racialized society people will extend more to their racial group and then they will not extend it to another racial group and so they blame them to for their crimes at a greater degree than they would blame their group for their crimes and so when prisons fill with them fill with these people. Prison conditions get worse and worse. Not only does that not bother you you think that's good. They have it coming and a political issue becomes about how much you can punish them more take away their uh take away. Their gyms take away their weights take away their museum their libraries. They deserve punishment as though any of that's going to fix anything. It's purely. It's just more and more trauma. That's going to have to be recuperated in the culture you're doing more and more damage to your own society wildly flailing. But you don't recognize that because you don't recognize those people as part of the same communion the same social order and so it that's reinforced over time and that's why a multi-racial working-class movement is. The only thing that can break this thing off of its moorings and the question always has to be not the morality of a discrete issue not who's right and who's wrong at the etheric plane on every discrete issue. But in the moment right now what combination of truths could be arranged to put enough weight and around the effort to move the  wheel to to push to get momentum actually pushing things in the real world.

What is it. I don't know where it is right. Now. We're still floating. We're like a floating kneecap just gliding on the goo. But it's coming into being august is going to be a nut cutter. 30 million people might be out on the  does that cut through the self-serving libidinal wanking. I don't know I do have to wonder what would if it didn't what would it take but like I said i. I accept my my spec-like ignorance of the the grander machinations of world history and accept that anything can happen and that means anything means good too. We're still we're still riding the edge between that we have not foreclosed all hope and as long as that possibility exists you have to keep going. There's no alternative you either go or you destroy yourself through guilt and loathing because you know you should be doing something and you're not. I can't go on. I will go on all right guys any other questions. I'm going to tend in my meat here. How did. I get so cute I'll never tell buh-bye.
