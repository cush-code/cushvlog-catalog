That was a young man. I carried my pack and I lived the free life of a rover and the mary's green basin to the dusty outback. I think they're cool my matilda all over till. In 1915. My country said son it's time to stop rambling for there's work to be done so. They gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun and they sent me away to the war and the band played wolfing matilda as we sailed away from the cave but amidst all the cheers and the shouts and the tears we sailed off for gallipoli great great tune we all love it don't we folks. We all love it and I'll be a normie. I like the pogue version the most. I like the I like shane. Mcgowan's voice not gonna lie. I'm uh. I'm a plastic patty at heart even though. I'm fairly sure.

I'm basically not any of the I don't have any hated bogmen in me according to my pointless uh well. The thing is they're all germans anyway. Everybody's crowds everybody's a  crowd even the celts so. I want to start by addressing a question that someone asked yet last week that I think realize on reflection. I didn't answer terribly well and it was they asked me about um about idealism versus materialism as like a way to approach life and history and you know everything else reality even and they said well isn't the notion of class consciousness uh idealist because the idea is it's an idea. It's oh there's a class consciousness that we have to operate from and then that changes our behavior by making us join uh unions maybe or do strikes or fight a revolution. That's all ideas and I kind of got hung up on the word definition and I i think and I think it's just because you know certain people come at questions from a different like uh understanding of the terms involved so they're going to like ask you questions that sort of hit you at an angle but now that I thought about it more. I think the key to understanding the distinction here is to say we've got to cut. For example.

We've got the constitution right uh yeah. We're gonna talk about the book tomorrow uh by the way. I'm I'm almost done with my with the section and I'm very very enjoying it. I'm gonna go through probably chapter by chapter on that one because there's a lot of really important stuff like uh the  on the uh. The strike of uh 1877 is very important but anyway we have a constitution in this country right. We have constitutional order now why is that why do we have a constitution. Why is written the way it is. There's one theory that says well. It's because the founding fathers believed x y and z about natural rights and governance and that that's why it's the way it is. That is an idealist understanding of history.

There is another that says these were the richest people in north america at the time they were fighting essentially a separatist war the same way that like the trade federation was in the prequels to get a better deal and the global uh market for their product which they saw as a local product because it benefited local ruler local uh elites. Landowners large landowners in the south and uh and merchants in the north and they fought on behalf of their prerogatives to extract money from the earth to turn america into cash. They didn't want to give any more to the global trade system or the demands of the crown taxation or more importantly uh reduction in the amount of trade that the us could uh carry off the boston tea party people think of of as some sort of protest against the tax on tea that's not the case there was no tax on t that led to the boston tea party. What happened was that for a number of complicated reasons the british had decided to unwind or had decided that they needed to recapitalize basically the uh. The uh the the east india company which was producing tea and vast quantities in the indian subcontinent and was then having to you know send it around the world as part of our beloved triangle trade uh and that uh as a way to streamline its operations the crown said look. All tea is gonna come through uh not through individual uh uh purveyors that you make deals with as individual merchants in boston which allow you to act as a middleman for the global. Uh trade we would like you to get all of your tea from the uh east india company which you know that's a guaranteed revenue stream for them props them up essentially a public bailout of the private company.

But they are not really. They're the same thing basically the state and these these like corporate organs are at the very root the same thing and that was a that's a conflict of interest between the the the uh like the british economy as a thing in which america's colonies like colonies are part of and the new local domestic elite. The large landowners and merchants in north america to who did not see it that way and so the austin tea party was a rebellion against the uh reduction in the freedom of trade of merchants. Not even the tea not people who got the tea people who buy the tea and then resell it and the fact is is that the tea act that was being protested brought tea prices down. It was more efficient. It reduced overhead what it did is. It cut the margins of the  boston merchants so if you understand that you understand the constitution is the way it is to protect in the interest of power to protect the people who hold capital to make sure that we have enough of a facade democracy to allow for um.

You know the expression of political demands that are channeled away from real centers of power and towards structural epiphenomenon like the political system. So that's an idealist but so that's why that's the actual materialist understanding of why the constitution says what it says why it values what it values and the thing about an idea. But the thing is is that whether it's materialist understanding of that historical moment or an idealist one me saying it is an idea. It's still an abstraction. It's still an idea adhering to it is adhering to an idea but it is idea that it's generated by an understanding of reality as a material interaction not as an idealized place where ideas are disconnected from the material conditions that uh generate them and so class consciousness is simply uh workers going from believing what the superstructure of capitalist society tells them to believe because that's the beauty of that's why idealist history is reactionary. That's why idealism is reactionary because it serves capital by neutralizing dissent from it all of that alienation. I feel as a alienated and exploited capitalist subject gets steamed away because I believe ideas about what what like what the constitution stands for what good and bad are we how what happened in history that ripped me away from the reality of my daily capital exploitation when I've come to the realization that oh it is actually material. Interests that shape this stuff that the constitution doesn't have value beyond its cl ability to assert class rule and that therefore I am in opposition to these systems that because the content of their ideas is meaningless and you are you then are uh put in a position where you can banish the ghosts. The spooks of the constitutional order of democracy of patriotism all that stuff and it's because you have adapted an idea. It's still an idea that you drive through every day and that takes you know individual experience and gives an order and gives turns into an ideology and a praxis. But it is generated by real experience of real oppression not by being convinced of ideas. That's secondary that is why liberalism will always be uh at the fund at a fundamental basis incompatible with um with marxism with socialism and will have to be defeated. It can be negotiated with and used against itself because it's ruled by that non-class class that lower middle class that is the party of politics that's the political party. It's the lower middle class. Because the super rich politics is beside the point. They just sign checks and for those poor. It's beside the point because they have no power all power when you have all the power none of the power in a political system you have no reason to care about it. It's in that middle strata that we convince ourselves that there's meaning in this politics because we do things like have jobs that are positioned in tension between proletariat and uh and capitalist and pull us in one or another direction and that push and pull is what generate politics as we understand it so does that make sense the difference between id uh of uh idealism and materialism. The middle class is is the political class and they and they're the ones who who assign values to this stuff and then fight over them because that's what keeps them literally paid. That's why we have uh professional politicians. That's why we have a professional political media. That's why that stuff exists. It's to keep everybody and also at a certain level. You steer the ship you are able to exert pressure but it isn't a very faster move and the more removed the more. It's ruled by idealistic understandings of ideas and not materialist understanding of ideas and values. But that's uh one thing that's interesting about. I'm not going to talk too much about it because we're going to talk about it tomorrow but the section of uh the book that we're reading that I'm reading uh the section of uh the republic for which it stands is in the process of talk. He does a very good job of talking about the the uh.


The history of the ideological war that's being fought among the you know the middle class throughout that period and he he essentially is able to very very elegantly explain to you how the word liberal went from being in the 19th century. Uh conservative classical liberal to meaning now progressive whatever we want to call that and he explains the process and it is one whereby the same class of people not the same individual people. The same class people go from believing in free market laws fair economics to becoming so you know uh uh opposed to you know in favor of like radical state intervention on behalf of class and race discrimination right how does that happen and what happens is that we went from a time when liberalism was corresponded with the idea of positive change in revolution when it had revolutionary potential because remember the first part of the communist manifesto is all mingles and marx praising capitalism for the way that it uprooted old traditions that uh prevented humankind from reaching its potential that like when he talks about all that style of melting in the air you know uh at that time a lot of that uh cr destruction was truly creative destruction in the shumpertarian sense like that was part of capitalism's potential and it did shape things. They created institutions and ideas that were going to go on to challenge. Capitalism like marxism couldn't have had it without capitalism emerging to to define itself against and like the idea of taking the unleashed energies of like a more rationalized economy a more technologically intensive economy which means a less sacred economy which means a more exploitative uh economy because it it abstracts human potential and human life away and makes it fungible like it makes slavery something like antebellum american slavery or not just the united states. But western hemispheric slavery was uniquely terrible in the in history of most slave societies because it was the most uh.

It's the one where slaves themselves were. These that were the most uh fungal where they were turned into an exchange. They were like. They became capital and that had never really happened before not necessarily because of like an evil of intent but just just a rationality and efficiency of exchange being entered into the mechanism so that's terrible. But it also has. It's what gives us the technological innovation to store surplus and and allow ourselves to build like build culture which is to say the ability to come into recognition that we are not individuals or parts of clans or something but part of a human race. The the the coming into itself that that hegel speaks about and that marx describes as like the the ideal arc of human consciousness. Not necessarily one that we will get to common ruin of the contending classes is the ruler in the clubhouse right. Now ladies and gentlemen get your bets in while you can. But there is still there is a teleological heart to that and it requires us to harness these things instead of allowing them to totally over overpower us and overcome. Us. So in that era liberals were in a sense revolutionary like during the civil war.

They said we must uproot this hoary old feudal concept of buying and selling people which was now interacting with capitalism to create something horrifying that was worse than anything ever seen before because you're taking a feudal concept of power like a mystified coercive concept of power and electrifying it with the  profit motive and with uh with modern uh technological uh facilitations of trade and monetization and financialization of capital. It was it created a monstrosity that it never seen before but when it was harnessed the right way you had the yeoman fantasy of north america. You have the small holder who is himself free of superstitions free of old institutions free of lords free of government of any kind able to exert himself freely on the land sure it required the displayation of the indians but hey eventually once they got with the program they would become citizens like us. They'll all become citizens like us on the long line. Everybody becomes a citizen which means an autonomous being and that was an idea of liberty a liberal idea of liberty that is anglo-american in origin because that is where capitalism accelerated off of the plane and created its own thing that then recapitulated across the land through the ever tightening crank of wallinstein's world system. But it promised liberation but then by the 1870s and 80s after having used the power of the sword to end slavery but then refused to use it to allow uh the former slaves to become integrated into the political system and to the the social system which could have been possible but would have required the the subordination of capital to a social end and the powers at the moment did not align to allow that to happen. Instead. The social end was was sacrificed to the creation of a a new leviathan of public and private power that used that power to immiserate to bash away. The the tendrils of connection socially that it had been allowed to uh build and also hack away at those those freedom tendrils that that's that the ability to be a yeoman sufficient farmer even who would never have to sell his labor that's gone because even the farmers are are  working for banks or railroads and what at when what was the result uh the return of uh despoilative monstrous coercive labor and racial apartheid in the south.

The mass emissionation of peasants uh in in the uh of former peasants rather who would pile up as refuse in the eastern cities. The catholic uh peasantry turned into a hyper-exploited urban laboring class devoid of any ability to to raise themselves up to the idea of like a middle class american standard and then um out west the slow but steady massacre of the continent's uh. Uh original inhabitants the the civilized army coming in and literally destroying a people uh people who even these liberals could see held virtues in their social order that were not to be found in the in the course soil of this new society they created and what happened is that over time the liberals got pissed off and became conservative. But the younger liberals who came up after them who started believing their the same ideas came from the same social milieu which is important and when I say that I mean the wig social milieu of middle class um polite society in the east coast boston philadelphia new york that's what we're talking about the shermer horns of fifth avenue from uh from uh gangs new york by the mid 1880s or so the the the liberal idea had failed so comprehensively that you either became a conservative. You either just decided that you were reactionary or if you were younger and you were see coming into life seeing the failure of the ideas.

As they're being told to you. You accommodate the new reality that okay there's to be a level of state intervention greater than what we think in order to allow capitalism to exist. Allow individual freedom allow contract liberty. The things we worship. We have to have longer uh. We have to have more of a state intervention or else the whole thing will just collapse into savagery savage domination. Like the kind we banish with the civil war we thought and that's when you get progressives and it isn't. It's the same social group. That's the important thing to notice and then the changeover is one of that is the one is the same sort of transition over time through attrition. The one funeral at a time um progress that thomas kuhn talks about in the structure of scientific revolutions when he says that scientific change doesn't happen because people are convinced of new by new evidence. The old people die and new scientists show up and they learn the right thing because they're they don't already have the wrong thing in their head. It's the same thing with the social sciences which is essentially what we're talking about these po. These the political groupings around the parties and the uh the institutions of uh like consent manufacturing in the mass media. Those things are all part of that um there are part of that same class that's in class that gravitates around the finance capital of the east coast uh cities and so they become progressives and that progressive vision over time that like eventually it has to absorb race because the the crisis becomes too deep along racial lines for them to imagine civilization that is civilized capitalism to exist.

They're the forces within capitalism trying to insist on social uh on a social piece that is short of the naked authoritarianism of the slave owner. They're essentially trying to clothe the slave owner's steel hand with the velvet mitt of democracy and rule of law and all those things. But the thing is is that that habit of mind comes from living in polite literally polite society and since the beginning of american history they have been a battle with local ruling power that is not as connected. Uh may be connected in the fence that it needs eastern capital but not intimately connected in its dealings with eastern capital local power. First the slave owning south and then the petty barons who made up the uh counter new deal reactionary corps took over the republican party. The beautiful boaters they're the unsheathed uh fist.


What is this for uh a theory reaches crisis. Then the different new theories emerge to replace the old one exactly you get to a point where new  comes to light because of experimental models because of crisis is within the prevailing ideas and then the old people insist. It's still uh wrong. But then they die and the new people who become scientists adapt to the more persuasive model. That's what happens among social scientists. But they can only go so far because they are all committed to capitalism sustaining itself.

They are always assuming that this is to keep society functional and it's because they are civilized because they're in the drawing rooms of the east and they're connected to global capital flows and they're connect they're connected to the global system and they get the highest education. They realize that a lot of the stuff that is blood and thunder in politics racial distinctions. National distinctions are actually meaningless and that capital is the really the only thing they essentially get inducted into uh the room in network where ned beatty gives them the talk like they get that talk through their genes and their blood and through their social interactions. You don't get that in the frontier and the american political contest is basically except for the period from like 1933 until about 1979. Uh when the working class asserts itself as an actual force in politics. They are the only two people arguing. Those are the polls that politics is argued around and that is now how we have the alignment that we have and what we're seeing with the non-college educated people entering uh uh into the electorate and voting for trump and voting for the republicans regardless of their race to some degree uh. Uh at least outside of you know the definitional character of black america.

Although even there you're seeing a small trend. It's because for a lot of those working-class people. They were never convinced by any of the of the cultural stuff. Any of the cultural  about democr the democratic party they were there for the actual uh working class part. They were there for the work the assertion of working class uh uh interests. But that's gone and it's only the shell of the democratic party that still has it and people are essentially losing their brand loyalty. They're seeing like the the. They're they're seeing a can of accelerated capitalist exploitation but with a gloss of social values that they were never inculcated into because they're not part of the political class. The college going to polite class and the reason it's confused is because there was a third force here that broke these a lot of people regardless of where they got their culture uh to the democrats and that was articulated working-class influence on the political process which started with the great depression and ended with the crisis of the 70s you could even argue it.

It honestly ended with the purging of uh the uh communists from the cio in the early 50s. If you want to like get real uh class technical with it. But it's one or the other. It starts in 33 and it's over by at the latest reagan and maybe even by  eisenhower. So there you go those are the those are the forces that work those are the fighters. Those are those are moriarty in homes going over the falls.

It's urban middle class finance capitalized culturally uh progressives who used to be in the 1850s liberal in the classical sense because that's what constituted revolutionary thought at the time. But the contradictions within liberalism required a new answer and progressivism emerged from that conflict and then the liberals all died off or they're. Their real inheritors are cranks who turned into conservatives from that position but those people are perverts. They're not part of the same process. So what you have now is an alliance between the perverted middle class the perverted college educated and then uh the non-perverse reactionary who both rich and poor. Similarly the left uh the democratic party is um. A few middle-class perverts who are like perverted are no I'm talking about like okay no if. I'm talking about like actual no no no no middle-class perverts because the thing is is that you think they're perverts because they're against capitalism. But that's just it they're not. They're the ones trying to keep this thing going. They're the ones trying to clothe this thing in enough human skin to keep the  villagers from fleeing. They are actually working in capitalism interest. So they're not perverse they're not perverts at all. The real perverts are the ones who decide that they are actually opposed to capitalism in its entirety and therefore the liberal project of sustaining capitalism. But they still are emotionally invested in the democratic party and people within it and root for them. On a visceral emotional level. There is some perversion so there you go. Those are your working middle class perverts within the democratic party and of course the gruipers and the  pepe types are the pervert middle-class people among the republicans and then you've got the people who still think that the democratic party means something but it doesn't anymore. Democratic party does not mean anything. The the this was there when the working class ceased to be a coherent pressure group within it.


It was over oh man that google union. I don't want to. I don't want to talk out of turn too much because I don't actually know the specifics of the thing uh. But so google has announced this union drive and from what I understand correct me. If I'm wrong. It's a minority union that does not have the ability and I think is actually legally enjoying from negotiating over salary right and like. I think also most working condition stuff what it is. They've said is essentially a way to facilitate activism within google and a lot of the people who I've seen interviewed about.

It are inclusivity directors and the thing about that is is that those include all those inclusivity jobs that are in corporations that they like to point to like the diversity and inclu inclusivity uh director. The kind of jobs that uh uh people often demand get people who get like a lot of times you'll see protests at universities that they that that are about increasing diversity or you know minority representation and minority quality of life and they will demand like diversity officers and stuff. Those are hr that's hr that's the people whose job it is to find a way to fire you without losing without having to pay for it. That's their that's the that's what they are in the hierarchy. Hr departments exist to reduce liability of corporations. These have either employees their way to union bust and reduce liability of the comfort of the company to in employee behavior and they and they are also mostly used to intimidate employees. They are  hr officers then it is a company union that will only be used to get people fired for posts that will exist so that if somebody at google is complaining about something like I don't know working conditions or maybe like hey should we be building panopticons for the ci.

For the  phones or whatever hey maybe we should have more direction over the company's investments. They can there's something problematic. They said there's something that uh that could be used to say that they made a hostile work environment. Those people's job will be to find it and then when they get fired for troublemaking. It will be a win for workers power. That's the sickness in it. That's the sickness at the heart of this. This is why this machine is so dastardly and breathtaking in its power because everything is recuperated within it every good instinct every progressive instinct. If it's grounded in capitalism will eventually find itself ensnared within this contradiction because it cannot be defeated from within. It can only be defeated from without but anyway that's my I don't know enough about the specifics. All I know is diversity and inclusivity.

Hr people are involved and it doesn't have the right to actually negotiate over conditions of work and uh and wages that is all. I really know and therefore I'm skeptical and I feel like when news comes out about. This thing do not just start salivating like a pavlovian dog because you see the work union because it's like capitalism knows that all these things they know what you guys care about and they can  create uh. They are very good at where haven't we seen my god in the last few years the way that all cultural expressions of of like um of solidarity and and social uh you know the aspirations towards social justice are commodified and recuperated instantly into reinforcings of the status quo. You don't think that that would go towards unions too. I'm not saying it does but it needs to be considered just like don't just immediately have to defend something when you don't know the context when so much of this stuff is designed to capture and dissipate energy which is why once again broken record me disengaging from the discourse is so vital. Because the  google union doesn't really concern you there's nothing you can do about it. They're not going to stop unionizing because you posted that it was cringe and they're not going to keep doing it because you said go girl.

It's not really up to you. You don't have to have an opinion on it. What about what about working what about where you work what about what what about your relationships with other employees in your labor sector. The questions there are going to be closer to the ground and easier to answer and less less confounding and mystifying by their association with the this. Inherently. Uh distorting matrix of information dissemination but mainly I just wanted to say this to say diversity and inclusivity offices are they don't work for you. They work for the company they exist as organs of control. They're not your friend and I think that's something that is unarguable and if you see anyone defending that that's us because I do believe that you should always under admit good faith. You should always assume good faith because otherwise you just get into the cycle of where it's nothing but friend. Info and nothing is learned because you cannot dialogue which is the only way to generate new understanding and new meaning uh but man if you're.

If you're going to say that hr departments are not explain to me how they don't where are they getting their paychecks. I mean how much of their stock is lit how much of their  salary is literally stock options. How much is their personal political wealth connected to the ups and downs of the public estimation of the company they work for and how does that put them in your corner in any dispute with any other employee or with them oh. It's a bad take okay never mind never mind if you want to explain to me how that's how. I'm wrong tell me they're direct employees and also like if that's your job. If your specialty is hr. Then you can't really work in anything else anyway. So it's not like you can go outside of the system to be some sort of editorial hr some of the budsmen of employment because there's no one there to fund that follow the money is usually in banali.


The right thing to say about any of this stuff. The mothman stood at the intersection of idealism and materialism because the mothman I think can be understood at least in part as a manifestation of human mental energy literally transubstantiating ideas into material reality. That's why I think it's such a fascinating case and something that I think is due a much better much better filmic uh interpretation than that dog. Richard gere movie my god that was so clearly an attempt to just rip off the x-files. Let's do the x-files for a movie. But it's not x-files going with the very dark foreboding attitude trying to make it scary which huge mistake mothman is a comedy 1 million percent. Mothman is a goddamn comedy if it's going to work it's going to be a comedy instead. It was this like brooding scary like thriller that had like a few scary voice telephone calls that was about as scary as got like a voice going. Oh there's gonna be a bad disaster coming oh. No they're gonna be. They're. Gonna follow the river and then some eyes in the darkness or something dog. Terrible there needs to be a better uh mothman. We deserve a better class of mothman around this joint because I like the idea of like maybe it was an mk ultra sight you know and maybe it was at the same time as that it was a harmonic convergence of like electromagnetic fields or something that could get the human tuning forks ping to get our pineal glands juiced and maybe they actually created a  mothman. Maybe they made a real mothman pulled it out of the multiverse.

Oh influencer watch is that that kind of uh key wiki thing where it's supposed to be public dossiers of all of the left influencers who are making your children uh trans. They're supposed to be for paranoid right wingers to like keep an eye on us. It's pretty funny. I'm flattered certainly that they think I'm worth keeping track of I guess. That's the podcaster equivalent of 60s radicals seeing if they have an fbi file yes much much lamer. I know that's the point is that we're much lamer. We're not. We're not the men our fathers. We're debris. We don't even look like them like nixon's enemies list. Oh oh boy somebody asked me about the bronze age pervert. I really honestly. I get. I think about it for a second and I just think I'm tired. I can't I've never been able to will myself to to spend more than a second going like this at his profile like aspiring nude bodybuilder. What I mean how do you aspire to be a nude bodybuilder. What's keeping you from bodybuilding nude is it that like you have to go to planet. Fitness are you aspiring to the day that planet fitness drops its clothing necessary. Uh policies and allows you to go in there nude like you can't  lift in your backyard or something with no pants on and after that I just stopped paying attention.

I mean anybody who wants to talk who's like valorizing lebron and jade. It's like get out of here you're non-dialectical. I don't want to redo this  team. If you want to just chill in the goddamn bronze age sorry. You're on the team you want to advance the ball down the field. You're you're not. In it.


For stats will the internet ad market collapse. This is a very interesting question so I was talking about this with felix on twitter. Yesterday. It is obviously a fact. I think undisputed by any serious commentator that advertising as such doesn't really work. It never has it does not have the there's no proof that it has the relationship to production to purchasing that we think it does what it does. Though is. It provides a context for purchases it makes purchases possible. You cannot have a consumer society that buys as much as we do and associates our sad our freedoms as much as we do with our purchases without advertising not individual ads. But the concept if we are not being advertised to we will not be. We will not trade our freedom for purchases because they will not be emotionally charged. They will not be turned into fetishes by advertising. It literally does magic to our brains to associate not even specific things but categories of purchases as connected to pleasure as connected to self actualization. They manufacture the um they manufacture not just the consent but the self-interest that that consent is grounded in which is. I get this stuff. Why does this stuff matter because I'm seeing this art. I'm seeing this culture that produces these values every second and it defines my brain.

My brain wants what it's given to want so that's what ads do but specifically ads don't do anything and what we have with the online. Ad is a situation where the only thing that drives money through the silicon valley pipe because we all know that silicon valley is built on powered money. It's all really quality quantitatively ease money. It's just the fed just putting numbers on a board and tip. They they essentially put numbers on the board to create a bunch of money in dc and then they just tip the board of the united states over and it all oozes over into the  investments in uh the tech industry most of which are never seen again but where there is money to be made. There.

It is in companies that are almost entirely predicated on ad dollars google and facebook. The only one of these companies that actually make money and make the most money and and companies that sell and the companies that are like that and that do make short term profits that boost up mid like short-term uh interest. Short-term like returns for hedge funds all come from ad revenue based businesses. That's where the money comes from not from selling a real thing not from a real product. I'm selling eyeball space it doesn't do anything. They just found out that uh of the 150 million dollars that uh the that lift or that yeah lyft was spending or uber. Rather uber was spending on targeted online ads that they were overpaying by a hundred million dollars because the numbers were all just made up by these companies in terms of like look throughs and click through all like the stuff that's supposed to prove that people are actually watching it. It's all ginned up. It's all made up. It's arthur anderson stuff. It's mark to market accounting. It's enron and so they just found out oh. Here.

It is it literally a hundred a hundred percent of the money. We were spending no no two hundred percent of the money. We're spending on ads was wasted. It didn't move the needle at all but the thing about it is is that it doesn't matter no even if you knew this even. If this got out in some way and it became common knowledge. It wouldn't change anything because the ad dollars are not there to represent value in the forms of actual value for ads any more than advertisements exist to drive purchases of a specific product. They're there to create the flow of money through the system that capitalism necessitates they are the capillary action. It's that is what we have. That's the that is the real value. It is the same as the petro dollar. It is a data dollar. Data is the stored value where we hold the exchange thing. But it's just an abstraction of our relationship to the economy our relationship to america's uh government because it's all backed on america's state capacity. That is what backs all exchanges within the dollar denominated system. American state capacity specifically it's military and as long as that's the case there will be a wind of money pushing through as long as everyone agrees that these things represent ad dollars.

Now that means that it's incredibly incredibly unstable and rickety and could be blown over by a gust of wind. But also it is so crucial to the maintenance of the system as such and with no alternative really presenting itself in the moment means that it's essentially unmovable in the near-term future. No wonder everyone is always on the edge. All the time. Everything is in this state where you're reaching a deep crisis within these systems but they are more than ever crucial load-bearing parts of the system so what happens who's to say and the real point of the money going through the silicon valley turnpockel. It creates an actual economy in like the physical space a real estate-based economy in california that is essentially a buy-off to the ruling local classes of california. It's like yes yes sorry sorry. We're destroying the the country's economy we're turning it all. We're turning all jobs into techno feudal surf jobs where we've stripped you of all benefits and all uh control over your labor sorry. In exchange we will build it here and get your price values up through the roof so that every  south bay is now a millionaire bottom off but then what it does for the global system is it creates technol technology of control and coercion in the form of the panopticon that they're building with our money. They're literally building with our money.

The panopticon around us they're building the robot. The robocop is in our head is being constructed so that's very important and then there's another one too. I forgot. There's another thing that it's building like an actual thing that's being produced in exchange in addition to the panopticon technology ah. I forgot now of course they've been doing it since the 70s. This is all when this whole thing started in the 70s of course.


It did its roots are all over california. California is when the reaction began. America was this tide pushing itself towards the ocean and then when it hit the  orange county is is the is the birthplace of the modern conservative movement just in terms of the political structure. The defense industry that built the southern california economy is what we where we directed our keynesian spending after world war ii and which absorbed all of our social forces away from productive ones and towards war towards a creating a  empire as opposed to directing you know our surplus towards democratizing life in america by investing inward. No no we had to create weapons and it all started in california because that was the end of the myth. The real end we didn't get it the memo we haven't got the memo till now but the body felt it back then and it reacted instantaneously. The machine app operated to its own advancement because it is an algorithm.

It is skynet and only unless the humans get together to fight and subdue it. It will consume everything because that's the difference between capitalism and all previous modes of production. All previous modes of production at the end of the day were for human benefit maybe the benefit of a small click of people at the very top. But there was no one outside the human race who had a say capitalism is able was able to take over the world because it abstracts away from the person the violence of coercion and towards systems that led us off the hook for carrying out violence and that's why we're able to coerce each other through the machinery of turning people into modern subjects which is a violent destructive mech thing that killed everybody that machinery killed everybody from the deaths of imperialism to slavery to all the deaths under communism the  pole pot and the goddamn. It's all part of that same process of abstracting away from daily life literal sacredness god human spirituality and turning it into an abstraction and that charged that abstraction with godhood and capital is god in the sense that even if you got everybody in a room together they would and they all wanted to do what's best for everybody.

They would be compelled not by any person in that room. Even if they all said what they felt in their heart they would not find the traitor because the traitor is in their head. It's the market and that hat we can only by concentrating our  energies and and coordinated our activities against it can we actually fight it. I'm a libra. No wait a minute is that the main one what's the star sign capricorn moon. I think the capricorn moon is what keeps me so grounded capitalism kind of suss not gonna lie I agree shit's wack but at the same time like like ash in aliens alien you have to admire it's purity.

It is like it is the antagonist to humanity that we literally built to destroy ourselves. It's kind of wild like our inability to cooperate our inability to trust led us to create systems that allowed us to allow our guard down enough about our hostility and our essential zero-sum relationship to reality that allowed us to sleep at night which is to abstract them away into weapons and then into systems of thought and control that act as weapons or they coordinate the action of weapons and that created something that was greater than the power of any of us and that turned us all into sorcerer's apprentices and now we it's run away from us. It's captured us like you cut off a limb and it will grow back with this same algorithm. Unless it's uprooted it has to be pulled out and that's only by taking that which it has created and turning it into the best version of itself which is the most coordinated version which is the most spiritually charged version which is the part of humanity that is able to act really as one not smoothly not easily but socially to have the coordinated power of a single organism. Those will be the people who have broken free of of their addiction to to catharsis through entertainment which encompasses everything from uh pornography to politics to sports to online politics.

Obviously all right I'm going to wrap it up here. Anybody's has the last question. It includes everything I'm not saying that everybody anybody can log off completely. That's absurd it's impossible. It's part of us and it will never be logged off like you can't imagine that any future that's going to be able to redeem humanity is going to be one where we have a luddite cut a disconnection from one another. Digitally it has to be re and recreated and refounded. But it's it's it's part of the it's part of the flesh. Now it has to be worked from and through that contradiction it can't just be ignored yes. The solution is that we get all we all get headed up. We can cut it up and and just all have a giant chill down sesh. I think that's the key all right somebody asked. This is a good last question.


So I guess it was the best movie of 2020 honestly. I don't know if I saw a movie in 2020 because I didn't see any movies in theaters in 2020 and honestly without it. Even as a possibility. I just haven't treated any movie. I've seen like a movie. You know. I really do think of it as a separate experience in the cinema. Everything's kind of blunted together into one like vaguely disappointing streaming experience. 20 joker was last year or 2019. People are saying first cow but I don't know man that seems like kind of a seems a little uh feels a little homeworky. Maybe croods too maybe. I have to watch that unchecked gems was 2019. Too. 2019 was a really good year for movies. It was kind of a good send-off year capped off of course by uh once upon a time in hollywood which is  brilliant. Maybe that's fine maybe. Maybe movies are a different thing now you know. Vaudeville isn't a thing anymore. There really isn't like you cannot if you wanted to you couldn't really go out for a night and see a guy juggle what you used to be able to do maybe. Maybe movies will be like the juggling guy or the fat guy getting shot with a cannon special occasion things. And if that's the case fine but I feel we will have lost something and I will not really take these. I just won't give as much of my attention to these streaming movies at least. I hope not because I think that that's only fair that I give it less attention and less emotional investment. If it's going to be less special yeah streaming is too individualistic.

There's no group component and really art is at its most. I think popular art is that it's most magical. When it can be shared collectively which is why movies are better than tv shows damn. It. They'll always be better. Movies were better. We can say that it's not just being grumpy old men although of course part of it is that part of it is just being grumpy old. Man dang it get off of my digital lawn how about that get off my digital lawn bye.
