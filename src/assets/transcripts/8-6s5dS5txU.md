That should do it that should do it that should do it all right hello. Hey guys how you doing. We're back. We're out here quite overcast day but not humid. It's a miracle. It's a miraculous occurrence. It's all cloudy and and gray. But the air is not thick like a swollen sponge not bad. How's everybody doing.

I hope okay oh. No I got a cord. I got a cord flip here oh dear. I got a situation. I got a situation here. There we go measure twice cut once oh. Somebody says their entire state is burning is that colorado yeah that good if you've got trees in your state you're in trouble. But that's also where where the air gets made so it's kind of a kind of a bummer where are you going to run center man where are you going to run. I don't think there's anywhere to go but we'll see so.

I talked last time a little bit about q anon and I was thinking some more about q anon and how q anon really is. They call. They say they call themselves a great awakening right. They say that explicitly they genuinely are if you think about it. You could you if you wanted to squint through the right aperture. You could call them the third great awakening of american protestant christianity because you had a first great awakening in the colonial era when people were coming to grips with the fact that they were entering into totally new social relationships in in in ways that they'd never expected or had come to you know. Had been acculturated to and and that needed to be reconciled and so you saw this huge intense efflorescence of of religious piety to sort of deal with the dislocations of creating a new structure for social living. The second great awakening happened at the dawn of the industrial age centered as I talked about before on the stream and the erie canal area the spots in the in the yeoman farming heartland of new york that were being infiltrated with this. This commercial culture that was antithetical to everyone's understanding of the social formations that they sort of come to terms with and so another explosion of religious piety came up to kind of re to to reassess and restructure the relationship between the conditions of of a industrializing america and religion mormons who joseph smith being part of that burned over district movement being the ones who perfected it.

The most the ones who took it to the farthest and I think if you think of the way that the way q anon is structuring itself specifically and now apparently they're kidnapping people's children because they're free. Now. They're now they've taken family court which has been an incredibly fraught area and a huge nexus of alienation and and conspiracy theory and and and hostility towards conventional post-60s. Cultural norms father's rights movement well not only is your judge you know they're not just taking your kids because they're because they're damn feminazis. It's because they're going to have them be molested by the evil lizard people in charge. It adds an extra level to that to that narrative so they're getting more intense. They're getting more popular. We've got them in congress now there's going to be at least two q people in congress with the start of the next district.

Next the next congress so that's awesome and they call themselves a great awakening and you could really look at it as a third great awakening because if the second great awakening helped create the protestantism that led to prosperity gospel which is sort of the closest thing you could come to an american theology. If you want to say like what's the american theology. Regardless of any specific you know doctrinal issues. It's prosperity gospel but now we're in the era of lack of prosperity. Gospel like there's no more prosperity so how do you square that and their answer is with this. Hugely you know baroque narrative that that rescues the the holy parts of what they think of as america from the corrupt parts and and and joins them to try to purify themselves through observation that's why it's the third one. That's why it's that's why it's the pringle one. It's the one where we're already de-rascinated too much to turn it into a social movement partially because christianity has gone from sort of the text of social relationships to the subtext because we've secularized the culture and of course these guys aren't going to do anything they're not. They mostly just go to rallies.

But I mean if you think of those as like as a modern-day tent revivals it tracks and what's my favorite thing about. It is that I've talked about how cue is gnostic you know like we all are in terms of seeing the world as a as a fallen and deformed thing built by evil that keep us from the real thing as a way to make sense of the contradictions of life and they are the cue starts with the premise right. There's the real america and then there's this deep state that just deforms it but then trump will come and stop them. Trump will save us trump will bring about the end times but like with any millennia religious tradition which christianity always was. Early christians thought that the world was gonna end in their lifetime. The revelation of saint john is something that was supposed to happen in the lifetime of the people who were gonna read it and so christianity has from the beginning been able to constantly adapt to the non-appearance of the messiah and the way that and narcissism is one mechanism and with the the q anon people they have now created. They're now in the process of creating like a two-layered simulation like a matrix within a matrix because trump's in power but things aren't changing how do you explain that one way you explain it and something. I don't think that q has ever said about said but this is of course you know we're talking about we're well beyond the actual text. These are the people arguing it like the council of nicaea or something long. Afterwards there is a theory that oh yeah all the bad people a lot of them have been arrested and in fact executed but they've been replaced by holograms or clones or robots so that no one knows because the moment isn't right to reveal it well if that goes on long enough and if trump gets reelected especially and things don't change eventually the entire deep state and the entire apparatus of sicko pedophiles who run our lives will have been replaced by synthetic doubles but everything will be the same they will still be in charge. They will still be eating children but they'll just be a simulated version of it because that's the only way that you can reconcile the persistent failure of the apocalypse to arrive and that's why yeah there's going to be a lot of there's going to be a lot of violence. I don't. I think q is q's going to get violent for sure but not in an organized way not black shirts in the streets It's gonna be just a bunch of a bunch of psychos just who are already loose in the shoes for a number of reasons and who get a final push by this narrative this this all-encompassing narrative for why their life is terrible but it can never be the source of like an actual movement because it's it's very existence in the form of it are determined by the lack of movement and the lack of even people conceiving of creating a movement. That's why they create q anon. That's why they grasp to it because of a fundamental understanding of their own.

Powerlessness are there any good john wilkes booth conspiracies. I mean well technically that was a conspiracy. I mean there was there were conspirators they were hanging out in mary's sarat's boarding house. They had a whole plan. One of them was going to kill lincoln. One of them was going to kill andrew. Johnson. I wish that had succeeded one of them was going to kill grant and hilariously. I think it was george. Azeroth tries to kill henry william seward in his in his bed. But he had a neck. He had a neck injury in a in a carriage crash and he was wearing a neck brace and when he went to stab him in the neck he couldn't. He couldn't get through and he ended up just running away and the guy was supposed to shoot grant.

 just chickened out but if you want to talk about something that you know behind that that hasn't been revealed. I'd say the most mainstream is that booth was working as an as an agent of the confederate government and there is some proof. There is some evidence that he had contact with the confederate government and they were aware of his operation when he was planning to kidnap lincoln and that they might have provided him with with material support to do it. There's no proof though that they were aware of his decision to just go with the decapitation strategy. But it's not outside the realm of possibility if you want to get wackier. There's a theory that edwin stanton the um lincoln's combative secretary of war was actually behind the whole thing and it was because he wanted to become president and there's not much evidence for that except for the fact that the telegram lines out of telegraph lines out of dc. Mysteriously failed right after the assassination which people say oh that's like that's pretty coincidental and then there's the fact that there's a number of pages removed from booth's diary when it was recovered and no one knows what was on them and people build out of that.

The thing that that stanton did it. I actually the idea of lincoln getting kidnapped is kind of fascinating because he is one of like those great souls you know like lincoln's one of those characters you read about him in history. You read his words and you read what people say who knew him one of those guys and and I gotta say as bad as it is politically and and historically. The the spielberg lincoln. Movie really got that better than anything that his just like his his ability to disarm and you know it's interesting to imagine him interacting with a with with kidnappers who hated him and then maybe like trying to talk them into maybe seeing how that would be sort of like a it would be like a reversal of the ransom of red chief. Only this guy's too cool for us to kidnap he's too awesome but they were 

I mean they were foaming secessionist scumbags so it probably wouldn't matter but it might have been. It's a funny thing to think about another thing that actually happened that I like to think about with lincoln is that after martin van buren the little magician the old fox of kinderhook or the red fox of kinderhook was defeated. He went on a western swing to see the western states and and meet local political leaders and he went to springfield and he met a young whig state senator or state legislator named abraham lincoln and they ended up spending the night together getting drunk. I like to imagine that that seems like it'd be a fun convo and the thing is is that they were on the other side. Like at that point. Lincoln was a wig who were def like their entire party existed to oppose the democracy that van buren had basically created yeah. They just went they scissored like nuts. They went to town ooh the oh.

This is a good one the most demonic city. In america. This might take the rest of the stream. Ooh all right well. Dc is the obvious number one that's number one with a bullet that's number one. That's the obvious pick so we have to mention it. But we have to also go beyond it because we want to be interesting with this dc literally laid out by freemasons using a cult. A sacred geometry in architecture like compelled labor of slaves like the goddamn pyramids the home to which is like the the the the brain stem of of a all-world-consuming and world-destroying monstrosity of a economic and political hegemony and also it is incredibly unpleasant to be in they call it the city of magnificent distances but that what that means in practice is that in the summer you have just giant fields of dust that just fill the air as you walk trying to get from one thing to the other. And of course. All you know the entire federal area is is is all in this honestly pretentious and and embarrassing and kind of cringe. Neoclassical architecture come on dude get out of here oh wow. It's like ancient rome yeah. Do you. Guys have any ideas of yourselves anything at all. You're just gonna do rome again really. I don't know man. I think he could do better than rome. Oh wait a minute no if I can slave aristocracy with like a fake culture of honor to mask this brutality never mind.

I get why you went wrong so dc. Definitely very very satanic very demonic Obviously los angeles the city of dreams the city of of seduction. The city where where all of the pain and horror and exploitation of the life in america are abstracted and turned into a dream version of itself where all the pleasure pain turns into pleasure. That's pretty that's pretty demonic that's like. But it's it's so nice though you got the wet and they got the water right there. Pacific ocean can't be beat san francisco of course san francisco and la have both have a very sinister occult histories so either one of them is very evocative that way like san francisco. I mean my god bohemian groves right right there out of town of town founded by san francisco theater people. You've got oh in southern california. You've got jack parsons and the and l ron hubbard and the lava in in san francisco and the church of satan which by the way the fact that it's libertarianism should tell you something yeah. No they're both very wicked. Las vegas is of course like a pu. It's pure id. It's it's on. It's unpretensed. It's unpretentious it. It's it's the peeled banana but honestly that makes it kind of less demonic in that it's less of a It's. It's less dishonest. It it involves less seduc less trickery. It's a pure appeal to the to to one's base instinct which at least makes you have to confront those when you give in to them rather than wrapping a doom in some sort of damask cloth of of of imagined virtue and then allowing yourself to plunge headlong into the abyss did.

I like glasgow very much or glasgow. Yes didn't very much like glasgow I like edinburgh and glasgow but I honestly I feel like after having been there. Glasgow gets a bad rap as being like the ugly one. It's actually very very pretty and it's got a lot of intact. You know 19th century bones to its downtown I like them both I like scotland scotland's pro scotland. I think is the prettiest part of the united kingdom and I've been to all of it. I didn't go to edinburgh on the tour but I've been there previously by myself. I actually I got I almost bla. I blacked out and had a very bad. Could have been very bad but some very friendly scottish people. I just met were able to get me home because that was when I just started learning how to drink and I did not know how to do it. Yet. That was a bad place to try to to try to practice. Wales is very pretty too. But it's just there's something about the hills the highlands and there's the heathered. In scotland.

It's very I don't know it's It's romantic with a large r new orleans has a claim. I mean there's a reason all those iron that's the reason all those vampire people love. New orleans right like anne rice and that there but I gotta say it's like there's a there is a there is a continental resistance to efficiency in new orleans that I find in the current moment. Other generations of like you know protestants sort of said that's the devil itself but I'd say in the current concept context. Anything that resists anything that resists efficiency at least the way that we conceive of it is on the side of the angels.

What do you think the chances are that trump gets kicked out of the white house by the feds if he loses I mean if he loses in a sense like. I was saying if if he win if he loses if he is certified loser of the states. If they aren't able to you. Know get a court to determine that x number of ballots aren't valid or something or that like x impartial result is true which could happen um if if the mechanisms of state come to the conclusion that biden won yeah he'll in fact. I don't think they'll even have to. I think at that point he would give up because he's a coward. He would not try to make a phone call and get one of those guys to like put tanks on the street and I think even a guy like barr who's clearly fully committed to using trump as an excuse to like extend state prerogatives. In any direction. He wants them to at the benefit of the republican party would recognize that that would not be a useful field of conflict if you had a unified you know consensus in the public that he lost which is different than if you muddy the results that's different and now then all I kind of think.

All bets are off but I also kind of don't think that's going to happen because it seems like the kind of thing everybody worries about because it's it provides some sort of vision and more than anything. It provides a fantasy of an escape. It does it it brings up to mind the notion that okay this will be the final. This will be an actual rupture. This will be the one unlike all these other ruptures that ended up not being as dramatic as would have required to break loose the moorings of these systems of reproducing themselves. This is going to be it.

This is going to be a free a real frisian point and as always with any kind of big incident like this especially one where you've got corona being in the the x factor and the institutions crumbling before our eyes. Hyper reality just obliterating any need to have like a consensus a a a a k fabe of political legitimacy that's all real. But it also it lies on the outer edge of probability like I think more likely is biden. Wins outright trump mumbles and goes away or trump wins narrowly in a way that most a lot that liberals are mad at and that probably will involve what would it will be less legitimate than elections that we have sponsored coups over you know it would be less legitimate by far than any venezuelan election that has been won in by chavez or maduro vastly less legitimate than any election that evo morales won just it'll make a mockery of all of our. About about election integrity being you know the cornerstone of democratic legitimacy but mostly liberals will just whine about it. They'll just mutter about it and so will the left because they're not gonna fight on the streets on behalf of joe biden and even if they wanted to they wouldn't know what to do.

Somebody asked if. Kamala is the worst vp pick since lieberman. I think kamala is an absolute She is the kane she's basically she is as much of a a safety pick as tim. Kaine was just with a different slightly different political valence because he's because the because biden's different than hillary. I don't think it's a good. I don't think it's good or bad. It just is and I honestly think probably there is no such thing as a good pick. They're all going to be terrible and they weren't going to pick somebody. They wouldn't be able to control because biden could die at any moment and they all know that yeah. The union endorsing trump. The new york nypd union endorsing the trump yep like that's why that's why if if if there is that moment that people are fret dreading and also kind of edging towards that I mean make no bones about it. It would be enforced by the people who right now are operating under you know a thin social consensus but will be unbound by that but again if that happened. I think it would compromise a lot of cultural like super structural load-bearing members of like of if not legitimacy efficacy of of of market transmission that I don't think is anything that anyone who is really in charge wants because there is no threat like that's the big reason because it is really it would just be kind of like trump and and like the lumpin cult around him versus a versus like the broader ruling class because biden is not a threat bind's not worth throwing away the the throwing away.

The last shreds of you know manufactured social legitimacy over suddenly asked if somebody says the cops seem to be even. More reactionary than soldiers and that's true one of the big reasons is just demographics. Police officers are self that's a career right like that's a that's a career choice that is made by overwhelmingly white dudes. Whereas the military is sort of a broad last-ditch social welfare program basically so it's more demographically diverse. So there's just there's less like concentrated white reaction to even exist But part of it is the pro is is that is the internal culture even even all these christian psychos. I mean except for the real like you know what was that guy's name the one who got fired under obama. It was always freaking out about like dipping blood and dipping bullets in pig's blood to kill the muslims or something. He said he was a holy warrior. Anyone remember this dude jerry something anyway. There's those guys but like most of these dudes are just you know they're college graduates especially at the top boykin jerry boykin.

That's it and as such they need some sort of like architecture to understand their purpose. And it's about protecting america or an idea of america from a foreign threat and that means that they have to have a certain sense of america as virtuous as something worth defending in order to defend it cops. They patrol the actual streets with an attitude of hardening hostility and eventual contempt for the people that they actually are supposed to be among who are americans which means that they are not operating off of a idealized america that they are justifying their actions by referencing they are um. They are immersed in a america that they see as violently split between the sheep and the wolves or whatever the sheepdog whatever the hell dumb thing they like to talk about one way or another that like they have they've they cannot be their proximity to suppression of their fellow. Citizens doesn't allow them the same degree of ideological fantasy that sees america as a like single project to be protected as opposed to it just terrain of brutal race and culture war. The funny thing about the about the usps thing is like i. I mean it seems like they're trying to make it harder to vote by mail but I don't know to what extent but like the way people.

The way people immediately clatched onto it. I think it's it's fear but it's also tinged with like this oh god. This is going to be the thing. This is going to be the thing that breaks it. This is going to be the break the break that we've all wanted that we've all secretly feared but also craved in equal measure that the social death wish and so that's why it's hard to untangle you know when when when you're when your interaction with an event or a series of events is much less data related to the event than a echoing series of reactions from people around you. It's very hard to extract any real coherent idea of what's going on you're really more than anything taking in the emotional temperature of a group of people through echo location. I do say the people who are like going to buying stamps to support the post office. That's pretty perfect isn't it. I mean you couldn't get a better example of the of the consumer self-conception and how it's our only frame of reference for activism or a personal expression of any kind.

Everyone's saying they like my shirt thank you. I didn't this shouldn't used to fit when I ever got their shirt. I wasn't able to wear it. It was too It was too snug but now. I gotta say it's. It's actually kind of a kind of billowy.

It is very funny that the people now whining about the u.s. Post office on the democratic side are the people who killed it like the the post office is already dead. It's it's just. It's a question of when it's gonna finally collapse and it was killed by that this bill in 2006. It's a postal service accountability act or something like that that required them to fully fund their pension for like 50 years in advance which no other no private organization does and no other public no other public sector employer does it. It was just done to give them an unsustainable budget load that would eventually necessitate privatization and when the when obama and biden and those guys got in there those and it was bipartisan. They voted for it too because privatizing state industry is a bipartisan consensus. It's part of that unspoken consensus that forms the real terrain of politics while we fight over the puppet show and so the democrats might in the moment be crying crocodile tears because they think we all we might lose some jobs in the white house which is what we actually care about but and you know liberal elite liberals who have never been to the post office. Wouldn't dane to go. They support it with you know purchasing stamps and by hashtagging it But they have no concern when about the the actual trend towards privatization and undermining of the of the service. That is that's just something that happens directing it in such a way to pro to create one or another political outcome that is the bridge too far. That is the crime and it and it shows like there's a there's the stuff. That is there's the parts of our awfulness that are unique to party politics and part of the narrow set of interests dominating political parties as separate institutions competing for power for the people in them versus the broader agenda that that bickering essentially helps cover for and and helps drive through through the political process and you get a good example here between the two.

You've got the broader agenda of overtime turning the post office into into I mean into I guess. What would it even be there'd be no post offices. I guess it would just be taken over like we would just get rid of it or like because if they privatized it I guess it would just get bought right wouldn't. It get bought immediately by like by by like ups or something. Like it would be like russia. It would be like any anytime. They sold off a big asset and post soviet union. You'd just get bought up by an oligarch so it would just be. It would no longer and then boom. You know tons of people out of work obviously and and another vector for like any kind of resistance to privatization gone and that's fine that's not a problem The problem is for people who only care about the political zone and the and who they who they're rooting for in the political theater. What matters is that they're interfering in their minds with some sort of neutral arbitration of the electoral process as though that exists 20 minutes lottery instead of elections. I've long thought that was the solution honestly. I mean not to this system. You can't just replace elections with lottery now saying as an administrative as just purely as a as a representative a structure. I prefer the lottery to elections but that would have to be under a different economic model. Obviously.

I might have more guests when I do the thing from the office with chris. I bet we'll have guests because that's the thing that's easy it's easy. I can't really. I mean you've seen me try to grill while doing this. It's very hard for me to divide my attention so But if he's there we can definitely like get somebody in because. I'm just using my phone here. I don't even. I don't even know how to like pour it in another video. But once we're in the office. I think we could get guests that'd be fun. Maybe we could play some sieve together did.

I read david frostwall's last book if you're talking about the pale king. The one that didn't finish yes a lot of good stuff. In there it's obviously unfinished but there's good stuff pale king pretty brutally boring well that was literally the point. It was a novel about boredom as like a spiritual concept and I know that's dumb. But I i found the boring stuff interesting so it wasn't boring. It's right here. You see that best sequel. I'd I mean in my instinct is gremlins 2 because it's not only a great movie in its own right is is specifically a sequel and like its sequelness is the text like the idea of making a sequel is part of the concept of it. So it's like it's more of a sequel. See people say terminator 2 and terminator 2 is very good. But I'm sorry terminator is better. It just is the original terminator is basically perfect terminator 2 very good.

But it's just it's getting a little. It's getting a little of that a little lacrimos. It's getting. It's. It's it's that it's the first hint of that of cameron kind of getting a little a little mello what's melodramatic or corny. That's a good word for it. T2 is a little corny. I don't know how you could look at that compared to just the perfect instrument of term the terminator and say that it's better why because like he fight he drove a truck off of a overpass. That's an awesome scene but you know and there's a and the effects are obviously great but and it's a great movie. But that just makes us that should just make us appreciate the original terminator. Even more sentimentality is the word. I see I disagree about aliens. I think aliens is better than alien but that's partially because really scott is a garbage creature and james cameron's a five-star pimp. I don't actually like godfather 2 that much i. I haven't seen it in a long time but I kind of thought it was I don't know overstuffed. I'm everyone wants to say alien is better. I'm sorry I will not bow. I will not give ridley scott credit for anything aliens good which is more than I can say for blade runner yeah that's right.

I said it but both of them to me are just so absurdly valued beyond beyond their their their actual virtues. I do love dan o'bannon of course. I'll respect dan o'bannon. He's a king and I and I choose to believe everything good in alien is him and not really. Scott did. I read crack. I had a subscription to correct.

I don't know why I had it and not mad. But I i just I guess mad felt too Matt felt old-fashioned because mad was so old and i. I'm not. I'm sure crack wasn't even much less old but it felt more. I don't know dynamic even though it's all the same. Most zooted president is very easy jfk. John fitzgerald kennedy like hitler was absolutely flying on amphetamines. At all times. He had a guy a doctor feel good who just boosted his ass up with amphetamine injections on the regular because partially because he was riddled with pain He had the image of you know this. This this vigorous young jock the the new front of the new generation of americans born in this century but he was acting you know him playing touch football on the lawn with the with the boys.

But he was actually wildly ill his whole life. He had addison's disease which creates your eyeballs bug out and I think it's a thyroid condition and he also had courtesy. I think of the pt. 109 or something else just awfully bad back like and he was in. He was in a lot of pain basically all the time because of his back injuries. Graves disease that's it lincoln had. Addison's disease graves disease correct sorry um and he was just in pain all the time and so he was on medication all the time and he would get he would get boosted and then he would go score with two secretaries in the pool. Under the white house have affairs with the The mistresses of multiple mob bosses oh lincoln had marfan syndrome that's right. I always forget which they are no great you're right and it wasn't graves disease. It was addison's disease who the is trying to gaslight me. No he had addison's disease lincoln had marfan syndrome. None of them had graves disease.

I always thought a funny counterfactual would be you know like jfk is Jfk's dr feelgood comes in a little bit too feeling good himself and like overdoses. Kennedy and his heart explodes like on day three of the cuban missile crisis that's a funny counterfactual because lbj was not taken seriously during the cuban missile crisis or ever by the white by the by the kennedys which was bad in some cases because he actually he kind of knew what they needed to do to get civil rights passed. But they they thought they knew better than him on that. But when it came to the cuban missile crisis he was like the one pushing the maximal conflict line. He was saying we gotta like escalate this and they kind of just ignored it. But it's interesting to imagine that if he gets in there right like in the middle of the crisis if that doesn't change the outcome in a significant way Rfk's assassination is very interesting. I've said that I am a a agnostic on jfk and a lot of that is just because I i I got so much information about it at some point that it just it stopped having meaning really and I just kind of wondered if it's just one of those things where if you take any event of significant size and an effect on lives and you trace it out. You'll find like this pattern of stuff that appears to be like incontrovertible evidence of of a conspiracy when in reality you're dealing with something that is so multifaceted and multi-fractal that any any preconceived notion can be reaffirmed by tracing things that come off of it. But the rfk assassination is also very interesting in its own right 

He was shot right in the back of the head even though everyone in the kitchen was in agreement that saran saron was a good seven to ten feet in front of him they were cut there's conflicting our accounts of how many bullet holes and bullet wounds were accounted for relative to the number of bullets that were fired by the pistol or the capable of being fired by the pistol that he had. He asked the speckling and he had he had a powder stippling behind his ear and so he was shot directly behind his ear. Even though sirhan was right in front was in front of him. You have all the wacky mk ultra stuff You have the sirhan's own claim about being blacked out. Automatic writing which is very odd not very much like most assassins diaries because it's not like. It's not like it's gibberish or or like convoluted conspiracy thinking or like arthur bremer just sort of banal narcissism. It's just the same thing over and over again very odd and he actually was.

I believe he was treated for a head injury. After fall from a horse. He was a jockey at a at a medical institution in california that had mk ultra funding but who knows and then there's the fact that the guy who is standing directly behind rfk the private security guard who was hired out from hughes aircraft. Thane eugene caesar was in possession of a of the exact caliber pistol that was used in the killing was also and was employed by hughes as I said and the guy in charge of hugh's tool was the guy. This guy bob mayhew and bob mayhew is one of the most. Jerry james elroy asked characters in american history. He he is like a guy he's the guy when when when when elroy writes about guys in like american tabloid the government fixers and he's thinking of bob mayhew he was an fbi agent. He was also a cia asset. He coordinated the fbi or the cia and the mafia's attempts to kill castro and then he went to work for howard hughes. So it's very very eyebrow-raising but once again. I have no idea my business.

Okay is the soul real. Someone asked that's a good question is the soul real. I think it is. I mean the soul. I would say is defined as just our It's the human operating off of our understanding our awareness or lack of awareness really of what is motivating us. It's it's it's stepping through. It's stepping across the the necessary leap from a partial conception of the world around us to acting on that world. Even though we know we don't know everything. That's what continually doing. That is what accumulates the spirit so I mean like it's not a ghost or anything. It's just a if you you need a word for for the accumulated action. The accumulated choice made in ignorance of every human you can call that the soul but you probably can't bust it with a with a proton pack. No it's not the unconscious. The unconscious is all souls. The unconscious is all experiencing consciousness is all matter and humanity and time and space. This the individual soul is is is that that like revolves around the the partial perception of separateness that we all have by virtue of our individual perception of apparatus that creates an idea of a self and then we act according to that self which is just our accumulated. Perception reduced by our specific ignorance relative to the reality we're trying to perceive and that that and that there's a gap there between the reality we're trying to perceive and the reality that exists and we still have to act. We still have to be and making that choice is what creates identity.

It's basically about perceiving time right because like I've said humans. Conscious beings can perceive time three-dimensionally because we understand time in terms of we have a memory of past. We have a consciousness of present and we can project into the future but our projections of the future are limited by our data. We can only guess another thing is our guesses are better or worse depending on how much sensory data and ability to process it and compare it to other people's. We have so there is so. This is not fixed the gap right and it's impossible to fully bridge because if someone could fully understand what is leading them to the moment that they fully understand every influence on their on their moment. Every every every different thread pushing them well then they would be able to perceive time completely they would be able to project forward perfectly all things they would be able to see literally the future but we can't do that because we're we're our individuals and our our machinery. And our circumstances are all randomized essentially and and have their own distinct formation effects on us that prevent us from getting the full consciousness of time. And so we can only approximate we can imagine a future and then move towards one we want. But it's just a guess and we have to have some sort of belief. We have to convince ourselves that this is the thing to do and the thing that drives us to do that is our collection of desires conscious and mostly unconscious and that is what pushes us forward. So that is the spirit that's the soul and then like the the the task of life is to return be able to try to consciously return that soul to the unconscious collective soul because it's separateness that drives our fear of death and all the trauma that piles on top of that.

I've never done dmt to my knowledge. Somebody might have given me some without my consent. I mean. I took it. I thought it was weed but I didn't even have. I confirmed it was dmt. Either. It felt weird but it certainly wasn't enough to do whatever that people tell me it does.

I have never seen a clockwork elf. I would be interested in seeing one. Though is. I would love to go to cpac again. I would specifically like to go after biden wins presuming he does because I think cpac. I suspect it's much more interesting when the right is broken up and is competing for like a new competing between sects for for for prominence like in the wilderness because cpac was a trip but it was just a trump love fest and that was obviously it was grotesque to watch and seeing his speech is still one of the most surreal experiences of my life. But there's a fundamental stop like stagnants whereas I would think it would be fun to go there with biden in there and just see the different. The different prophets coming out to try to you know whip up support for their particular sect you know and and anoint a new messiah. I think that'd be interesting all right. I'm going to ask one more question and then I gotta get out of here surgery um. I guess there's no good questions. I'll just close on this somebody said somebody would announce. They were q on cpac. I would bet more than one person would have tried to announce. They were queue on cpac.

I could. I could see some like junior. Some like hack congressman or something be like hey. If I want to be president. I'll just convince them on cue that would be really funny. He had competing cues q fight all right guys. I'm gonna peace out see ya.
