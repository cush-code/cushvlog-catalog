This actually worked for once don't knock it over oh boy. There we go gone. We've got viewers presumably that tweet go out hot tweet action dude. It's indoors it's raining here in new york. It's crummy. I have to have class. I have to have recess inside not prep not ideal but what are you going to do we're going to have to get used to this one way or the other yeah. The beard's getting a little big. I'm gonna have to cut it again because I realize that especially on these streams my head gains 10 pounds after a certain density of beard and it's like the zardoz had shown up and spewing guns and sandwiches. I shave it down and all of a sudden. I look slender again. It's a it's a it's a classic trick all right somebody's asking for my steely dan opinion. I do not have one all I know about steely dan named after a sex toy. That's in naked lunch originally had chevy chase as the drummer before he left presumably because nobody could stand him because he's one of the least appealing men on earth that they're known for very beautifully and richly textured studio productions. They're sort of the opposite of the grateful dead in that ray regard and that they have very lyrics that are according to some profound and incredibly clever and brilliant sondheim and others pretentious as to the actual music. I don't know don't care haven't really listened to. It is dirty work steely dan because that is a great song all right well that helps I didn't know that was dirt. That was steely that I don't reeling in the years is them too right. I hate that song so. It's one in the other.

Then. I really don't like reeling in the ears but I really really do enjoy dirty work and I don't know why steely dance becomes the topic of internet conversation. Every three months. There are a few things that reliably pop up like old faithful. David. Foster wallace is one of them steely dan is another it seems a lot of it is about like this ritualistic bringing down of icons of p of like of some sort of perceived overlord cultural overlord because obviously dfw stands in for ma white male literary canon right and pres and I think steely dance serves a similar purpose in standing in for this sort of boomer era idea of like hipster rock and roll because steely dan I mean from little. I know about it just to given its reputation. It does kind of seem like the david foster wallace of rock music right like it's got a similar demographic only older obviously and it's got a similar cachet among similar types of people and gets a similar resistance similarly found to be cold and unengaging by those who don't appreciate it yeah. I have really realized something the thing about like hating steely and is about hating. It's like hating. Dfw is hating your boyfriend and hating steely dan is hating your dad so if you're online doing the discourse of bringing one of them down. That is the direction of your ire. So. I guess that's how you can chart. The lunar cycle is when the boyfriends are getting a little annoying it's time to remind them how much you hate dfw and the literary bros and then whenever you're thinking back on your. You know withholding or distant or in some way unsatisfying father figure time to drop a steely dan and then of course radiohead well yeah. No radiohead is the direct like your brother's band but they don't get the ritualized hate that steely dan does because it's for a different generation of dudes that they're mad at Somebody wants to go somebody wants to go over my birth chart. I know what it is. I am a libra capricorn moon leo rising earth wind fire. Nobody got mad at me for saying saying about talking about astrology.

It's not real. No one thinks it's real. It's just fun and more importantly. It's a way to talk about yourself with other people in a way that doesn't seem as self-absorbed because it allows them to talk about themselves on the same. In the same way it doesn't rely on personal experience. It's like this secondary category where you can talk about yourself sort of an abstract as opposed to events in your life and that gives it gives other people a chance to play along and it's not alienating the way that you know just a narcissistic way to talk about yourself would be. I will say this though that like if you do invest it with just the suspension of just belief necessary to care enough to like look into it. It's very easy to see how people get excited about it because there are traces and of course everyone knows well yeah. That's because these are just these are just collections of human traits into like groupings and everyone is going to recognize themselves in it because everyone has all of these traits yes. But you know humans are pattern recognizing animals and so when you see it you are going to be like oh. That really does track like. I gotta say that I do feel like a libra. I feel like that's right of like the sketches that go along with the different signs. I feel like yeah. That's the one that if you just said what do you think you are. I would think that was me but then again. I can't distinct pull apart the fact that I know that you know that's why it's not real but like I said fun but yeah. It's all fake but the thing is. It's no more fake than myers-briggs.

Personality test like how many people hate astrology but have like intj in their twit bio. It's all made up um. Cap moon is my disciplined side indeed to the degree that I have any discipline which is not much jung. Definitely is a based weirdo. There's no question. It's amazing how young and freud were both right like in broad strokes like in their understanding of like the way the brain operates at an individual level and then how that the fact of living among humans who all experience things the same way generates this third. This other dimension that that jung was able to to recognize like you're essentially talking about macro and micro psychology. There. I I was very bad. I I if I was going to learn an instrument. I I played saxophone for a year when I you had in my my elementary school your second. Like your fifth and sixth grade you had to join orchestra or band. You had to do it and I picked band and I picked the saxophone. I was not good and the thing is what killed it for me. I mean it was never really good and it never really felt very natural. But what killed my ability to keep doing. It is that they stopped letting me cheat and write the names of the notes on the music because I could not ever read the notes like. I couldn't see the little note and know what it corresponded to.

My brain is actually terrible. It cannot and I realize that what it is is that my brain is just words. My brain is just a bunch of words because it still blows my mind to know that there are people including people. I know and I know they're not lying to me who say that they don't think in words like their thoughts aren't articulated into language that is sort of heard in their mind and I'm like well what the kind of brain do you have what and yeah like there are people who just see pictures and like they get sort of these. Every my brain is complete words so like anything. That's that's not that not as good so notation. Um numbers oh my god. I am so bad. I almost didn't graduate college because of I had to take one math class and I kept putting it off until the last semester and I graduate until like oh like the last weeks of school. So it's weird knowing that you. I mean it's. It's true like that's one of the things that generates different personalities and different abilities is how your brain processes the information that's receiving and my brain for whatever reason compulsively and and and inextricably connects everything to a articulated verbal a symbol and visual symbol I guess but but like verbal in the sense.

I'm hearing it. I'm hearing it in my head. It's not seeing the words printed out. I'm doing tech support apparently Apparently the the rss feed for the podcast version of these is not updating. I'll tell chris about it.

[11:48](https://youtu.be/K-apxCrKLjY?t=11m48s)

And it'll be taken care of I'm sorry and it and that's how you you know you. It's how you end up with people with different skill sets and different understandings of the world and different like people might experience the exact same phenomenon in their life and have it activate the exact same parts of their brain in the same way and have the thing that comes after that moment lead them in completely different directions based on the way that their brain structures the not the information that it receives and that's why I have not like thinking about it. Now. I think that's one of the reasons that I am very I had a very hard time accessing the concept of spirituality for so long in my life like I couldn't. I could not get myself to believing in anything and it made me feel detached from every emotion. I ever felt and it made me feel. I used to say that if that. I thought that and now I feel like I've I've confirmed this for myself. That religion is a physical faculty in that it is parts of your brain processing the information and adhering it to emotion in a way that leaves you with a residue of this. This adherence to a system of symbols and I think that's correct and I don't think my brain worked that way and now I think the thing that was keeping it.

From that is the simple fact that I so compulsively alienate myself from all experiences almost instantaneously in the form of turning them into symbols and that means that emotions can't be felt and the thing I've really come to realize in the last six months or so is that there's no information. There's no truth that is not adhered to feeling that that emotions are in fact the fat emotion like unl like ben. Shapiro is an exemplar of like this kind of the kind of wrong world like failed you're to understand how reason works how like what epistemology is. It's the same failing that I had as the one ben shapiro has and one that many many people do have because we are more and more symbolically oriented over time because of our greater alienation from our lives and our greater dependency on a symbolic. You know simulation of emotional connections in the form of engagements online which are inherently symbolic in a way that physical engagements can are not physical and physical events physical interactions but even my physical interactions were alienated to that point and so for a while. I remember when I first heard the phrase facts don't care about your feelings and it felt like oh. I get why people like him because it appeals to that notion that there is such a thing as truth that is independent of emotion and in fact now. I realize no ben shapiro. You. Little. Facts are feelings. They literally are feelings. Hume was correct on that point all understanding of facts all understanding of re.

All reasons motivated by by feeling and even mine was but it was through this. It was through. It was through like a muffling you know it was. It was through a bed sheet or a or a towel stuffed in the mouth. You know it was gagged because I just could not access the moment. As soon as the moment passed. It was transmogrified into this symbolic representation of itself and as a result I felt like okay. I'm just going to be a miserable materialist piece of who tries to distract himself from the knowledge that he's eventually going to die which will over time drive him insane because he will not be able to conceive of a world in which he is not in because he is completely detached in his mind from all other things in the universe which is in every level a delusion of senses. It is a delusion and a failure to actually perceive the world around you. It is the it is the fact of of the happenstance of your brain chemistry and the life you live creating a situation where you cannot access reality. You access a shadow literally reversed mirror funhouse mirror of reality in which no it's not sure that you are absolutely intertwined with every living thing everything period that there's only one substance in the universe. That death is no more possible than the extinguishment of of time and space you don't um. You don't feel that you feel oh no. I am the only thing in the world the only thing in the universe. So the universe's end and mine are the same thing and since I cannot conceive of that one.

I can't conceive of the other and so as the reality of it comes in contact with the fantasy of your eternal selfness. I just I spent so much of my time as a hypochondriac miserable person because that sense was always there that sense of looming annihilation like. I had my first like. I had my first heart attack in my head when I was 14 years old at a junior high assembly. I mean and then I had my spinal injury in my teenagers years which completely threw me off track and and led me feeling like anything could happen to my body at any moment and that only made it worse and so I i live my life trying to distract myself from this reality and then I could do it for the most part but my failure to do it completely. My failure to completely sublimate was evidenced by my hypochondria by this nagging sense of annihilation which was just my body's awareness of its own finitude that couldn't be integrated into my brain's insistence that such a thing is impossible. No. I'm out of dualism. I'm saying that that was what I was and now. I'm I'm out of dualism. I mean obviously. I rebound to it in moments of instinct. Moments have accumulated you know habit that have come through that fixed life tunnel. But it over time it's being reduced what I'm saying is the dualism in my mind. I think was was determined by the material reality of my brain which for one reason or another experience and and biology nature and nurture is unable to feel without symbolic abstraction.

And that's why it took psychedelics for me to break through that it took my. I took a technology that just took the part of my brain that wasn't paying enough attention that was instantly that was not being engaged while everything else was turning the world into symbols and made me made me observe. It made me actually sense it and that extended extr. That that expanded sensation broke through this wall that had been there that was this symbolic order that over awed my my senses and my real feelings you get over one thing and then the other one that's a hundred percent correct. I would go through spells because I have a lot of pain associated with my back injury including I'll be real with y'all some gastrointestinal issues that lead me to have a lot of pain in my abdomen. Sometimes for a while. I was convinced that I had pancreatic cancer. I had colon cancer and that would stick in my head for months and it would kind of be this background anxiety and then I would rationalize to myself well if you had it you'd be dead by now and then. I'm able to be like yeah. That's right that's not real. But then you know.

I would have some sort of arm injury. Some tingling in my fingers a nerve issue because I have a lot of spinal issues with my I have a lot of nerve pinching and stuff. I have big herniated disc so. I would convince myself that various chest pains and arm sensations. When I was gonna have a heart attack and then once that was not no longer logical to me. I would go back to cancer and I was on this cycle and the thing that broke it was this realization of where it was coming from more than anything and now. The main thing that stops me from getting in those cycles is that I'm not afraid of the thing. I'm not afraid of what it would mean if that was true. I mean obviously. I am afraid of it. But I'm not as keenly afraid of it because I am not as deluded about my separateness from everything else in the universe and that is why I mean.

It's horrible to hear people get prescriptive about. Like man you gotta do ass man but it I find that especially if you find that you are unable to feel it very well might be if you're watching this. If you're listening to this. If you're online all the time and the substitute shadow symbol world of online is good enough to make up for the more emotionally rich experience of interacting with the world. Around you then it very well we might be because part of your brain is just not there. It's not. It's not perceiving enough to overcome that feedback loop of of the sensation and then the symbolic translation of the sensation you need to speed it up reuptake which is literally what psychedelics do is that they enhance reuptake. But the reason that you know. It's you don't want to be prescriptive. More than anything is is that we have experience with this.

The cia brought lsd to america in the 60s and had timothy leary spread it around the world country like johnny appleseed and what did it do you know what what was that what was the the the radicalism that was created out of that expansion of consciousness. It was bad news. I would say on on average overall bad news. I mean the way that people talk about how honestly it's tiresome to hear people talk about ever. Everything is an op online but honest. But if you wanted to say the internet in general is a psyop considering its role in channeling young specifically young alienation from capitalism into cultural spectacle and it's like indulgence in narcissism. It has the same effect that lsd had on the new left but in that case it literally was an op. It literally was the cia bought like a hundred tons of lsd. From sandoz. They bought like 90 of the of the lsd on earth to take to the us.

But the other thing is the other thing that gets you there is just sitting refusing to allow the symbolic order to overall your senses and that requires you to give it nothing to symbolically render give it nothing to turn into symbols. Even your thoughts will run out if they aren't refreshed by exposure to new things and that's what meditation does is that it robs you of the ability to drive your body into this or drive. Your mind into this symbolic revery because you're not getting new stimuli and that's like all psychedelics do is reproduce the sensory experience of deep meditation. It's just that to do deep meditation you have to already be able to like you know reward that experience you have to know you you have to want to do it. Like that's. The big thing is that nothing gets done unless you really want to do. It is if your desire your libidinal energy has been channeled into a genuinely felt connection to every other life in the universe. If it's not genuinely felt you get back to the libidinal politics that we're practicing now everywhere and it completely online and completely within the current political culture. But there's a real.

There's a reason that people talk about waking up and so the idea that it that the that that the satori moment is one of a awakening to a consciousness because you realize that what what made your life a nightmare is that it was a it was unconscious. You were not being conscious of the world around you you were living in a symbolic haze. You were living in a demiurgical shadow realm the problem is that you have to be able to keep accessing that and the and that's why just haphazard exposure to psychedelics that are pursued without rigor and without discipline won't lead to anything because that feeling has to be translated like for me. What made this experience with with lsd different than other ones. I've done because I've done it plenty of times before. I did it at cpac.

The thing that made it different this time is that for whatever reason the thoughts I was having that led up to the the the actual emotion. The actual explosion of feeling and um and then come back came back down from were connected in a way that I could symbolically link that experience to a cause of reason that could convince my brain that it was true because if I wasn't able to convince it symbolically. I was never going to be able to feel anything because I couldn't access feelings and that was when I started to feel you know that's when a lot of the things that felt a lot of things in my life that felt impossible became possible because the the artificial structure side built in my head to to reduce the number of options. I had to what I thought was real. They were exploded like those and I realized oh like these aren't actually problems in any real sense because the thing that I'm worried about happening is not something that is worth caring about because I care about something else because I know what it is to care about something and I just want to say that the politics the synthetic politics like if politics if politics practice from the heart is about love which I've tried which I think is 100 accurate you know the heart. The the sense of connection is what drives you to the conclusion that we're all in this together.

[28:14](https://youtu.be/K-apxCrKLjY?t=28m14s)

Therefore profit shouldn't exist. Capitalism shouldn't exist. There should be no no hierarchy of of exploitation. Because the accumulation of of surplus first a few people is is. It's not just wrong. It's irrational because you're not you're you're not part of a different thing you're part of the same. Thing you idiot you're why are you hoarding this like you're not separate from it and so it has to be. It should be defeated but the synthetic politics. The politics of rationality are stripped of emotion that we practice online and when I say emotion that's another word for spirituality. That spir that secularized politics and in the sense of we're only operating out of base instinct. Here politics is the assumption that we are all separate and we are all out for ourselves and politics is about figuring out the best way to do that and the difference. In that frame is the republicans say we're all competition is the only way to sort deserving from the undeserving the democrat. The liberal says there's no such thing as deserving and undeserving but capitalism is still necessary because we're all separated from one another and in order to accept to extend like the idea of rights to all which includes property.

It has to then we all have to operate from personal base instinct but that base instinct will lead us to cooperate with one another because it's more efficient that way. That argument is sterile and it leads towards where we are which is two two politics two dueling politics of sadism of hate because we see lives that are totally restrained in lives and and futures that will only be more miserable than the present it will only be worse. This is the first time I think in in modern history when the current gen people living have no expectation that the future will even be worth living in how that's unprecedented and what it leads to. If that's assumed because remember you need to have a grounded spiritual politics to overturn this arrangement and if we assume as everyone who is operating within this realm does that no that moment is passed. This is all we have then then we are in fact on a course for doom whether you're conservative or a liberal whether you're a reactionary or a progressive. Whether you think that humankind is inherently evil or that it's good whether you think that the distribution of resources along class lines is is. The is virtuous. It's it's. It's a divinely inspired thing or you think that it is wrong and it's the byproduct of the evil of the human heart no matter how you slice it.

Politics cannot resolve to anything other than degradation from where we are now and therefore all we can really do is assign blame and offer punishment. If politics is collective action and no good action can be taken. Only bad action can be taken and we want the bad action to be taken against the people that we hate. And that is what the party is going to be about that's what that politics is going to be dominated by. It's already we've already seen it coming to district and the reason I think in the long run. Like all this. About oh the pmc is it a real class and well is the lit are liberals actually a cultural elite and what's that what and is it college what has got well. There are plenty of people who go to college who aren't wealthy and what about what all of that is secondary. The only reason any of that matters is to answer the question well what happens what is like why are we arguing these points if not to figure out what is going to happen so we can intervene with it. The point is not to post. It is to change the world as some people have said so what that's the only salient element to this point and to me the salient point about the college no. College divide that's going to come and over to become and define. The parties is that it is going to over. The long run help the republicans and help the most socially reactionary version of punitive neoliberalism because if voting is going to be voting to punish your enemies whose enemies are more people. Both who went to college and who didn't go to college were going to want to punish and I think that in a culture where we have these lurid ostentatious displays of completely removed and vile least insensitive cultural decadent.

 our 500 streaming services and hollywood movies and then a culture of celebrity and and glamour well everyone is miserable. The fact that everyone within that structure is essentially a democrat and will tell you so that is a visible person to hate in this system who are you supposed to hate for the democrats. You're not even supposed to hate anybody if you're a liberal democrat but even on the left who are you supposed to hate billionaires who knows a billionaire how often do you interact with the billionaire. How often do you see a billionaire on tv or in a movie. How billionaires don't tell you who to vote for the media telling you how horrible it is and defending it to you saying oh yeah. All this terrible stuff is actually good lying to your face pissing in your face and telling you it's raining they're all liberals. The trump presidency proved that they're all four years and now oh the election there's no corruption there. It's like yeah you might say that's because they practiced you know all these. These institutional val values guess what these institutional values over time will be coded more and more as liberal right. Now like half of it is but it's going to get pushed even the of the billionaires the most visible ones. The ones people most know about because they spend so much of their time on their platforms on tick tock on twitter on facebook on google. They're all liberals too and the funny thing is is in that case. It's not because they're part of some cultural marxist conspiracy. It's because we're talking about a situation where liberal values come to encompass everything within the structure because that is what separates it from pure totalitarian authoritarianism is the illusion of deliberation through structures like politics like culture so over time as as actual life gets more and more threadbare. Those institutions that are supposed to legitimize it are going to become more and more illegitimate and more and more associated with democrats.

Because the thing that generates them at a cultural super structural level is the experience of college and the attendance of it and so every and so these tech ceos adhere to the notion of of open debate right. The idea that we're a platform. We're a platform we're not here to to publish speech. We're only here to. They do that because they don't want to get sued because if they were a publisher they would be liable for the platform. They can't do that so they have a vested financial interest in adhering to this liberal nostrom but then within it. There are other liberal demands such as profit maximization which tell you that certain political expressions are bad for business and you're gonna wanna remove them and that means that you're just telling more and more people that you exist to support the adhere. The appearance of this fraudulent status quo which the culture exists to perpetuate which it's not because it's in charge. It's because it's in charge of the superstructure. The democratic party is in charge of creating a a pseudo an illusion of movement replacing the existence of inertia with the appearance of forward of deliberation and a process and a practice. It's happening anyway the engine is driving us to where we are the engine of profit. Struggling against the declining rate of profit is driving us towards this full. Hyper immigration and exploitation of everyone starting at the bottom and then going upward just squeezing the life out of people and as it does that it's cultural representation. It's gonna become more and more associated with democrats and the left more broadly because those are the people people are going to see. Those are the people that are going to interact with in their culture on their online in their media.

The bad guys of the left are hidden. They're behind the scenes because their critique of who's responsible is more accurate. But it's still limited by this liberal framework not because it's all within the capitalist structure and so that is why over time I think more and more people including working-class. People including people who are directly impacted by republican policies are going to vote to punish those or own or drag or whatever those who they most are associate with the misery of their lives and that will be these super structural figures and that means that they'll vote republican and they'll vote to help just eventually extinguish culture completely and replace it with the bare coercion of a mechanized post-fascism well. My throat is quite I gotta get another drink. I don't have any more white claws though how in america be different if reconstruction wasn't up oh boy well.

How long do you have I've actually thought about this so I just read a book an interesting book. I love counter factual history as you all know and somebody wrote a book that is philip kundi for zero books and it's called lennon lives and the premise is what if when it hadn't died and it's a 100-year retrospective of what would have happened if the soviet union. Essentially the premise is what if the soviet revolution had had in fact hooked up with the german revolution and created a like a and hooked up the agricultural backwater of russia with the industrial dynamo of germany. What would that have done and it's you know it's interesting. It's pretty idiosyncratic. A lot of it is score settling with intellectuals and political figures. The guy doesn't like but it's definitely interesting as someone who loves counterfactual stuff.

It was fun to read but it made me think that I kind of want to write something called lincoln lives because I do in like the foggiest regions of my brain imagine a world where a second lincoln term is defined by a process whereby lincoln momentum which was towards universal blacks manhood suffrage and towards a confrontation with capital on behalf of labor. Like Obviously these are all you know. We don't know that in the context of like this this hugely fluid moment you know an entire region of the country destroyed and occupied by troops like turned into clay for movement clay for shaping in a situation where lincoln's powers in this moment are are at a point where he does occupy a fulcrum in in american and world history. Like he is. He is uniquely free to move in a way that very few historical actors are because of how fluid the situation he was in control of was he commanded by his mere order a a what million man army that had military domination and the inf and had annihilated the infrastructure of its defeated southern tier and a congress filled to the brim with radical republicans insisting upon a a land massive land redistribu redistribution and a political disenfranchisement of of top rebels now if they pursued that because obviously lincoln said malice towards none. But it's like okay who who's malice are you more concerned about and I really do think that lincoln far more than johnson would have been much more concerned about making sure that there was no malice that befell ex-slaves rather than ex-confederates and if that is the case and as I said explicitly if it is connected to land redistribution to white farmers as well in the south.

That's the huge thing because there was there were attempts in the 1890s and 1880s among populists to try to create trans-racial connections and that that was what brought the real boot of jim crow down. I believe henry steele commander has a book about that the strange case of jim crow where the thesis is that jim crow. The the the The jim crow laws were a direct response to populist attempts to create interracial political coalitions. Yeah. Stevan woodward not commenter so if you wouldn't have had that if you would have been able to connect cut the connection the social connection between small holding white farmers and the plantation elite reoriented. Their politics turn them into republicans. You you decapitate you internally decapitate that node of like the capitalist. Productive economy of the united states now the thing is lincoln would have at every level been incredibly you know it would have been pressured and and she pushed away away from that by northern capital which was at an unprecedented degree of power following the concentration of capital that happened over the course of the civil war and that really is what jump-started america's industrial economy same thing happened by the way in england. The thing obviously the industrial revolution in england was in full swing by the turn of the 19th century but it was the napoleonic wars that led to the hyper like the next stage of of english capitalism to emerge. Similar thing happened in the united states after a civil war but those productive forces could have been politically channeled. The the forces existed between the ex-slaves of the south. The former smallholders of the south and the union army which composed the working class and like yeomanry of the entire northern tier and if their politic and their family members in in the in the northern states.

The thing the main thing he would have contended with and the main thing that might have pulled us towards something worse is that back door that open drafty back door of land just that that that diffuser of political tension of politic of of social discontent. At the end of the day what what the the civil war when it finally did end with the compromise of 1877. It was on the backs of the former slaves. It was we have opened this bottle. We have opened this genie's bottle of emancipation which you know all the wigs and the moderates that always said would be unmanageable because how are you going to get racist white people to live with black people on equal equal terms well. Since we got the reconstruction we got with the reimposition of latifundus plantation economies and the reinstitution of of slavery or or I guess just like the encircling of former slaves and and the and the continued exploitation and are the continued um languishment the continued languishment of the ex-confederate military rank and file small holders. Within that framework. The decision was made well. We'll essentially recreate the old model without the without all of the I guess you'd boil it down to etiquette all the loud voices all the ruckus. All all the dirt and and rudeness of channel slavery replace it with a more refined more abstracted exploitation through sharecropping arrangements and convict leasing well. There look at all the forms here. This is all in order.

I mean he owes this much this much cotton to his former master because he borrowed these many seeds. This is a legal exchange. This person is working to clear a bayou for turpentine mining or something because he committed a crime he was found to be loitering in the town square. This is all this is all above board and that was the liberal revolution but it could have been pushed further that's why you know it. It was the completion of the blujoy revolution but just like in every revolutionary scenario there is fluidity. It could have been the beginning of something very different now how far it would have gone. I don't know.

I don't think you get a situation where like racial harmony is is real in america. By the turn of the 19th century you know but I have I could see a situation where you have a abolition of du jour or I'm sorry. Yes you have an abolition of du jour segregation in america across the entire continent not just in the north. You have an abolition of du jour segregation by like maybe the 20s and you know what kind of politics is created by that coalition by the way what like that republican party. What does that republican party look like what are the pressures on it especially as industrialization increases and as a working-class self-consciousness comes more and more into fruition. How are the conflicts there fought when you have a unified multiracial working class rather than a siloed and racially fragmented and mutually antagonized working class and then yeah like if you have the end of the jour apartheid by the 20s without. Because the thing is is the end of our end of de jure comp our end of desert apartheid in america happened almost simultaneously with the end of american prosperity. That's the thing that gets overlooked. When we talk about the backlash we talk about how white people decided they would rather be racist than have pensions that wasn't the decision the decision was I'd rather be racist and adhere and maintain some sort of hierarchy where I'm on top of somebody else then get nothing because that was what was on offer after after that the rearrangement of the economy that happened after the the oil shock of the 70s and and the the end of the bretton woods system so if you have an end of does your segregation in a moment of like. I don't know a a socialized a boom of american productivity considering that it was a massive resource-rich continent that was maybe over time seeing its industrial capacity tamed towards social ends oh my god. You have you have a dynamo of potential revolutionary which is what marx and engels thought the united states was the dynamo of the next century and they were correct and we were in the tipping point and we tipped the wrong way every time and I would argue that the first big tip and the one that's most mind bending because it because it's the first one it is the most historically contingent one. It is the civil war and reconstruction and the maintenance of the constitutional system all of which spring from at least partially the lincoln assassination. So I was wondering. I might write something about that.

I think it might be interesting yeah. We're getting We're gonna get. Hammered here with some rain coming up. That's why I'm battened. The hatch is down free real estate man. It really was their downfall but I'm imagining like if I was gonna write something and I was gonna. You know try to like game it out. You know a situation where after appomattox the a lincoln-led reconstruction that leads to a you know a shaping up of challenge right away. Like almost immediately the former you know. Leaders of the confederacy realized that oh this is really at stake here like we are going to be disenfranchised. We are going to lose our land. We are going to lose our power.

There would have been another flare-up of violence. The war wouldn't have ended just the way it didn't in our real life. But it ended with this insurgent campaign led by the red red shirts and the cool clan. Eventually leading to a series of almo basically coups and abrogations of democracy across the south which were abetted by the north essentially demobilizing if that fight had happened earlier and been more intense and sharp with the army still out in the field and with the commitment to the cause as it's zenith and the commitment to the cause of emancipation. At its zenith. What do you see hey maybe they call in. Garibaldi remember there was that offer by the congressman to have garibaldi come and lead the union army and he said he wouldn't do it unless they made slavery the ending of slavery. A war end well what if it's 1865 and there has to be another campaign. Maybe garibaldi comes off the bench. Maybe marks and angles come over here. The conestoga wagon with a printing press in the back start organizing among the 

The germans of this of course is fun and fancy but that's the beauty of counterfactual stuff is that it it gets to be fun and I argue that if you pose the questions the right way it is still useful because to talk about what didn't happen in 1865 and what could have happened what was possible. Given the material realities we had at hand. We can talk about what could happen now what if marx moved to texas in the 50s that one could have happened too. The prussians essentially said we don't want. We want to keep an eye on him but what if they'd said good riddance which they did to a lot of those people. The thing that bums me out though is that there was a wave of vigilante violence against anti-slavery german settlers in texas when the civil war broke out There's something an incident called the noensis massacre where a bunch of german immigrants were just strung up by the local confederate authorities.

Those guys loved freedom so much they were fighting for so much. Freedom god the way they would just hang people for opinions the way they did a draft before the union did the way they suspended habeas corpus immediately god. We love them don't we. I worry they would have. They they would have murked him but then maybe hey him and angles go out with a bunch of guys and form some sort of gorilla column engels was a pretty good military tactician and strategic thinker. They called him the general because it was his favorite like topic but and he commanded troops or he no he didn't command troops. He was an adjudant for troops with village my boy august village who was a civil war general. During the 48 revolutions he was actually reprimanded for during at one of the barricades in the rhineland going around and taking all of the german flags because one of the the the main flag of the german 48 revolutions was the tri-color of I imagined liberal german republic taking them down and replacing them with red flags. But he acquitted himself ably he described um. He described the um he described he he described the strategic situation in the civil war at the beginning of the civil war. Uncannily he all two years before they started the march to atlanta he was telling marx yeah.

No they got to go cut it in half this way. Why are they going after richmond richmond is meaningless cut the thing in half and eventually that's they three years to do it and he also described what world war one would look like 30 years earlier with almost uncanny ability so yeah. Maybe they could become like a a unit in there hey throw everybody. In there go never get all get all the have haiti come on like the us recognizes haiti but then like gives them a bunch of money and has them send a detachment. But there was there's a angles quote in this book. This lincoln lives book that I just or this lennon lives book that I just read that is stunning.

[55:42](https://youtu.be/K-apxCrKLjY?t=55m42s)

I hadn't encountered it before let's see if I can find it damn it. This is not going well but yeah if we were going to have a lenin in america a figure of that sort of pivotal equivalence. It would have been him because lenin is the same way. There's no recovery revolution if lenin doesn't show up at the finland station. I think most people are in agreement with that who studied the topic because the bolsheviks were in the process of resolving themselves to supporting the provisional government basically because they were too afraid of the alternative because they didn't have any confidence in their ability to command the situation or govern. If they did lenin shown in the town showing up to town and publishing the eighth april. The season was a lightning bolt. They broke open all of th through and cut through to a degree and over time and it took a while but it got through that just cut over time through the the the the inert the inertia at in the party um. So he's another guy who you know what if he'd had his his brain hemorrhage you know a decade earlier.

You probably would have had some sort of cornulov ask military coup overthrowing the provisional government and then depending on how much resistance to that emerged some sort of pre-fascist anti-semitic po like industrial pogrom. That's what trotsky said and I agree with him on that point which is why it's stupid to get mad at the prolifics or or condemn them for doing the revolution. I mean there's plenty of points where they made the wrong moves after that. But they they were doing the only thing they could have done and their their gamble that they were. Gonna spark a world revolution. It was not a miscalculation that was the moment that was the moment and it was the germans more than anybody who dropped the ball and it was because the they had been too developed. The the the the socialist movement had been too captured by the superstructure in a way that marx didn't anticipate oh. This is the quote I was looking for so so in 1887.

This is what mark's or this is what engels said about what was going to happen if the brinksmanship between the empires of europe wasn't ended. No war is any longer possible for prussia germany except a world war and a world war indeed of an extent and violence. Hitherto undreamt of eight to ten millions of soldiers will massacre one another and in doing so devour the whole of europe until they have stripped it barer than any swarm of locusts has ever done. The devastations of the thirty years war compressed into three or four years and spread over the whole continent famine pestilence general demoralization. Both of the armies and of the mass of the people produced by acute distress hopeless confusion of our artificial machinery and trade industry and credit ending in general bankruptcy collapse of the old states and their traditional state wisdom to such an extent that crowns will roll by dozens on the pavement and there will be nobody to pick them up absolute impossibility of foreseeing how it will end and who will come out of the struggle as victor.

Only one result is absolutely certain general exhaustion and the establishment of the conditions for the ultimate victory of the working class and he was 100 correct because the ultimate conditions for the victory of the working class were the russian revolution and then the german revolution but the the the german working class was led by people who were no longer working class and you might want to say aha so. That's just like the pmc now no because that was an actual working-class movement all right. We are post that we are in the post we are the post we are in the shadow of the defeat. We are in the shadow of the defeat of the 18 of the world war because imagine if a more socialist america encounters a world revolution starting in russia and being kicked off across europe imagine a world where the united states has say like a president eugene debs during world war ii instead of prisoner eugene debs and president woodrow wilson how do they respond to that do.

They send troops to archangel to ally with a bunch of genus adairs and mystic psychos and and martinets probably not. But we missed the moment and now we are in the post-political that super structural capture that started with the leaders of the sdp. Your guys like your eberts your nasties. Now. It's everywhere it's universalized in america anyway. We are all that we are all nasty. We are all ebert no matter what we think no matter how much we lo think that we're rosa luxemburg. I'm sorry we're all nasty but the difference but the thing is is that all of that all of that upward trending um striving that drove the leaders of the german social democrats towards accommodation when they needed to strike against capital because it was the moment it was the resolving moment they were that doesn't exist anymore. There's no hope that anybody's getting any sugar cubes there's only misery and when we break away enough of us break away from this phantom pantomime of politics and re reforge human connections. I think we will be able to sidestep all of that and come orthogonal to the ossified superstructure and shatter it or we won't and we will have a common rune of the contending classes which is what happened in nazi germany. That was the common ruin of the contending classes 1945.

I said orthogonal oh or that no and that's how I pronounce it. I'm not going to say orthago ogle orthagonal off yeah. Like those are two those are two you know in the plinko board of western civilization and huge world civilization as we you know move towards the intensification of history. As as our technology accelerates change. Some big plinko board moments were linked assassination boop and the failure of the of the german revolution really more than anything yeah I am a midwesterner. I'm going to say orthogonal what other way to say orthogonal is there though never mind you're typing you couldn't do it. If you wanted to that's silly that's silly. I call it. The plinketto board not the plinko board because I watched way more best of the worst than I have. Prices right god these guys have given me the business. I know what orthogonal is orthogonal. Is they're coming at a perpendicular angle and also right angle and also the club that nixon founded at whittier college after he got rejected by the franklins. I'm just talking about pronunciation how to pronounce it orthogonal orthogonal oh orthogonal orthogonal. I get it thanks that's how will would say it orthogonal and that's not me baby the end of the day. I am truly a a middle european bog peasant. I am a square edited hick at the end of the day bye guys.
