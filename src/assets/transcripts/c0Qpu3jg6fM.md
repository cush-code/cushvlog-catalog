Foreign tooth comb I was soft inside. There was something going on foreign. You do something to me that I can't explain hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart. We got something going on oh yeah. Kind of Love is Blind. It requires a dedication. All this love we feel no needs conversation. We ride it together -h making love with each other who's in this dream. That is what we are no one in between. How can we girl fail away with me to another place and we rely on each other -h from one cover to another. -h does anyone remember that that cover song was covered by um was it the guy from The Fugees who wasn't Wyclef. He had a song for the bulworth soundtrack. Am I right does that make sense does that sound like anything I'm gonna see if I can find the song I'm referring to I think I might be right Ghetto Superstar that was it who did get a superstar though prize and profs wasn't the Fugees oh. Yes it was I remembered all of that correctly man wow that's what I've got in my head instead of anything remotely useful for any other human being. It's pretty. Funny I sacrificed all of my all of my hit points in every other category and honestly. It was a very inefficient Choice. Probably wouldn't do it again if I had to show the chance but you know what are you gonna. Do. We are what we are and I am Min maxed to the hilt. All I can do is remember crap that happened. They have any actual skills okay.

So today we're gonna say we're gonna finally reveal which China book we're gonna be doing now. I gotta say I feel a little bad about this because I realized after I asked people to like give me their recommendations and I actually already had a China book that I got on my Kindle. A while ago I had been recommended to me I think by Dan Denver and so I was like oh I'll check this out and it was short and that really appealed to me. So it's like it's like 100. It's almost it's like under 200 pages. I think and I honestly think since I don't know that much to start off with about modern China that going General and vague is probably for the best way to start you know if we wanted to talk about something more specific. We could we could pull one of those longer works that people have been recommending to me but anyway this book is called the China boom why China will not rule the world.

So spoiler alert there for all. The people who've been asking will China take over for the United States as the new global hegemon. The book seems to be arguing well not I tend to agree. I tend to think that whatever comes after American hegemony will be post hegemonic and so China will it will not risk. It will not re-center the global supply chain. It will instead be one of those structures that um exists to administer crisis capitalism after the breakdown of the the political technological logistical Supply chains that make modern world capitalism possible so that means China is every. It's every country for themselves. So China is not going to come to the rescue. I think that's what people kind of wonder when they say like will China take over they they imagine will China rescue us like we see the coming conflict with China basically the same way with that. The right and liberals do which is this in an inevitable conflict. The only difference is we think they're the good guys right. It's like no. This is just like what Steve Bannon and and Joe Biden say China is on a collision course with the United States. The question is who should we be rooting for and this book seems to be arguing and we'll see as we read it. They're not going to be in a position to make that kind of play. They're going to be too busy keeping their selves in on top of the increasingly teetering social structures that are going to come under deeper and deeper um.

Crisis crisis is the name of the game I mean capitalism is always a crisis I would argue actually that class Society is always a crisis because of the inherent conflict between classes that drives everything and I do believe that Marx this is a sense. I think this is the central Insight of Marx. It's the atomic splitting of the it's the splitting of the atom that makes everything else make sense because all of a sudden stuff that has been like had been processed by the enlightenment. In one context. Can be looked at from an angle and notice oh all. This stuff that you're claiming is inherent in human history inherent to the human animal All that stuff is generated by the fact that somebody is working for somebody else and that that puts a dagger in the heart of social solidarity and that that Rift has to be managed and that is the crisis that defines all class society and the way that it produces.

Crisis is that it always must seek to expand to accompany for the fact that it's internal structure is being eroded like Conquest is what Saints maintains these power regimes because over time they become stagnant. I'm lead to a a revolt. It is social pressure. This is like the magma coming up through the tectonic plates and it has to be managed and that everything that we think of religious culturally social all of our values. Our. Notions of language and Nation identity itself our premise on structures that grow out of the need to manage these crisis and what keeps crisis. What keeps. Final crisis at Bay is expansion and the history of society history of subtle human agricultural hierarchical societies that emerged we've talked about how this happened with the great girl book.

[09:50](https://youtu.be/c0Qpu3jg6fM?t=09m50s)

 I think that it is very much a thing you had a relatively harmonious con. Social structure where because of the superfluidity of land relative to humans allowed people to really resist any real. Authority nobody could actually make anybody do anything for a sustained period of time. You could conquer somebody and kill them or something. You could kick them off land but you could not um make them like maintain a regime of subservience because they could just go somewhere else and I think that and because they had the ability like these are people who had um. This is people who lived like in close relationship to their environment gained their food not through abstract actions that then are given like a value form but but by by their own hand and they could always feed themselves on the land as well as you know. It's better to be together in groups for some reasons. But it's not essential and that that was an equilibrium like that's going to create Society.

It's going to create culture. But it's not going to produce what we think of as as cult as Society because it does not leave the same structural remnants the ornamental features of society in which some people are sitting around while other people are doing work and that is what means that's what we when looking back on the historical record. That is what we see as civilization and it emerges exactly when settled. Agricultural social structures emerge. We're going to talk about why that specifically happened. I think graybro actually traced it out perfectly correctly. It's just they don't see the implications of what they've sketched out well. There's what they're sketching what they sketch out is the notion that so you have these people living in there's conflict within them. Of course. They're humans but it is not a class conflict because there's not a felt class distinction then more people show up people start moving around they start bumping into each other.

The best land gets taken the best place for humans to thrive are found a place where you can get the most back for the least work which is what people are looking for. We all want to work less for our our survival because why work more we don't have a weird religious structure around work the way that you do have to have in class Society where it is like a ritual inscription. It's just stuff we all do so. Why would you want to do more of it. So the lowland places the places by where where you could do agriculture without planting. You could just throw some seeds down and then the Rising River tides or would come in and irrigate it. For you. You would need to use any you would have to build a seeds and then boom. You have a supplement to it to a to a diet but then enough people show up and oh you gotta work a little harder. You're motivated now because you're a social group to maintain. Its cohesion has to work a little harder and that means more unpleasant labor more stuff that sucks to do well how do you determine who is going to do it.

This is the where we create the rituals of of the ritual religious world wherein our labors have an abstract relationship. They render us subservient to some totalizing other that we are worshipful of a god is co-interness with us now the people who obvious there's God. Everywhere every really every God is inherent in every system. It's just how it's translated from the people within it and for them they had a God but it was not this abstracted principle that people had to bring themselves subservient to and that is why you see that so many of these agricultural regimes are brought into being through Mass ritual Bloodshed. This is especially true in China. The basis of Agricultural Society in China were these early societies that were carrying out massive almost industrial scale um sacrifices of enemy captives in war and that inscribed this vert. This hierarchy you know that blood it.

Sanctified everyone's place in society and that allows class class Society to continue because now that contradiction between one class and the other it has been obfuscated. It has been broken up because now you have God in there vindicating their place in society making them necessarily seek value in the work. They do do and therefore inscribing it with meaning because they have to because they're not being compelled but they still have you know this divines that they want to connect to so. They have to do something the thing they do has to mean something and that is what everybody seeks under class. Society is the best thing is to be able to do work that means something and it does not. It's not at someone else's Direction.

But a class Society needs that and conflict between Class societies is what sharpens it and how did it start before you got there you had according to grab growth. You had proto-egalitarian Societies in the Mesopotamian Valley. You also had 100 Gathering societies that did like feasting cycles and where they would build temporary hierarchies but then would disperse into total egalitarian Lifestyles outside of those time frames when it was basically a played act ritualized sense of identity because the snakes were not there because glass conflict did not define those societies and what they did is. They created this first bureaucratic state where like like the cuneiform was invented to figure out how to distribute communal products. The giant warehouses were the centers of these these cities and within them you see the the cataloging of these mass-produced items of life like olive oil and wheat and to be distributed and you don't see the sort of Priestly palaces and and vast displays of ornamental wealth either and so that becomes a stable equilibrium. But here's the thing everybody who Encounters this world is now encountering a world where they have to Res resolve the conflict between their own individual sense of self and and conception of the world way of being and the one imposed the one that we all have to agree to when you have a society and that the people who are going to get pushed out and again there's still enough room that even though there's now greater concentrations in these more desirable areas the more arid the less the the more difficult to live in areas are still available if you don't like what's going on in these early egalitarian urban areas who gets pushed out Chaz people who want to young men mostly who want to assert their will in the world due to their testosterone. Let's push boil it down to that like the the the the surge within the male of these species towards a Will To Power the grasping of it that is something that is deeper. You could argue than class conflict because now we're talking about the individual's subjective experience of the world and the fact that there's another there's a world outside that we're all creating through mutual collaboration and the thing that makes you want to want to collaborate. What's wrong oh well.

[18:55](https://youtu.be/c0Qpu3jg6fM?t=18m55s)

I don't know I don't know I've got. This thing plugged in Reverb. I don't know I don't know how that oh God damn it. This sucks I don't know how to check that I'll just unplug this thing and plug it back in what about this can you hear. That is it just is it better over the is this better. I'm just doing it through the worse Jesus.

I was talking about thank you very much I have no idea what I was talking about foreign whatever so that you're going to have in a in one of these egalitarian unsettled societies. Those guys they can submit themselves to the ritualized state that these societies had right on a on a seasonal level like you come together for the fair and then you've got cops. You've got games. War you know that kind of stuff and it gets off. It gets that energy out somewhere it. It blows off the steam and then you can go back and live. You know as bands and and not submit to anybody's Authority because there's so much land that nobody has to fight really especially. Since those rituals create this kin relationship you might stumble onto somebody else's area but you're part of the same kin group like they talk about how in early American societies you have these Clan systems that didn't correspond to geography. They were spread throughout entire regions because you would have people all over the place claiming the same symbols and where those symbols gain meaning in these ritualized structures of state. But once you get settled there's no place for it. There's not if there's not war with an external enemy.

What are you supposed to do with that energy and you know you can do Sports. But for some people it's not going to be enough and so what's gonna create be created as a as an antithesis to the thesis. Here emerging of okay we have to have some sort of extractive relationship to our environment and some sort of hierarchical distribution of Labor. Because that is key here you cannot you in order to make in order to compete with other social formations. Doing the same thing. Subtle society means not only are you doing more labor but that labor will be unequally distributed because it's the only way to um. I mean. It's the only way to gain the value add of like it being a social product. So you set you see settling in the hunterlands a different culture a a a warrior culture a culture around going out and fighting other groups of young men and the societies that emerge out of that the kurgan societies that have been theorized and not just steamrolling the early um the early kind of quasi-anarchist city-states and then they take them over and then dominate them from the top and that's where you see in early Mesopotamian Society.

The shift from these big communal warehouses and like minimal pageantry and and ornament to this invasively ornamental military dictatorship which happens when the guy's out fighting each other. Some of the the ones who do the best live the longest they gather around them. The most followers they procreate. I mean you literally create this. This genetic hot this evolutionary hot house. The way the finches speaks start changing within a few Generations in the Galapagos and then that that then as soon as those regimes take power. Now you have the thesis that is now emerged which is these social structures and Notions of work and responsibility and religious life that had been kindled in a kind of pre-class society where like social hierarchy existed. But it did not confer social status and then that is when the people who the the step people the people who go out to stay in conflict with the world and with each other. They're gonna always come back and Jack your which is what undermines the entire stupid thesis of stupid grave grows stupid book. They make this beautiful argument that I think really really helped me get my head around a lot of like how human history is is evolved. It's been a tremendously helpful. I'm really glad I'm glad. I read it but they just they point out that this order existed before the imposition of class Society. Therefore we can't do anything we want and it's like no man as soon as that's that Society those societies became complex enough and over time complexity is going to emerge.

You can't stop that with all of your anarchism because size is going to continue populations are going to grow. Demands on resources are going to grow which means the amount of effort labor that the human body is going to have to do to extract more calories from the world as more people are born into it. That's the challenge of getting a social human animal in a homeostatic relationship with its environment and class Society. Once it emerges drives a stake into its own heart because in order to operate it has to assume the conditions that it was generated under like. If we do this we get this amount of tribute that fuels our system that lubricates the gears that keeps it going and growing. But as time goes on because you're just it sublimating your. Some some destroying your environment to. Eat up the consumption of more and more people and that is putting social pressure. How do we keep in competition with each other because here's the thing we are The Social Animal but we are divided into tribes groups along those symbols. Those symbols that have helped us learn why it is good to work. You know why it is good to to be obligated to your fellow man like the roulette a vocabulary of like deep religious truth and I was grafted on top of a a religious system that instead codifies a class Rule and and and what that means is that as your relationship to the environment destabilizes over time because right you're at your.

You're you're extracting X every year right. But why is going away. It's being destroyed in the process. Yes. There is some regeneration but over time this is just basic malthusianism. But it's true over time. You outstrip your environment and then you can solve that if you don't want to change how your system works you can solve that by getting more deepening deepening exploitation keeping the amount of flavor people have to do forcing them to do more labor and this is how you get slave societies. Oh here are people who we don't have to treat like people and that supercharges your ability to express extract and therefore compete with other social formations but the whole time this machine is running on borrowed time because eventually any system reaches its its extent. It's re. It's a bill because at this point we're talking about discrete social formations like Empires occupying specific Geographic areas and being bound by them and they reach a certain point where they can no longer expand because there are other powers there around them that are closer more concentrated closer to their own supply lines and base of power that they can resist your overthrow or they can resist your reach. You cannot extend it beyond that geographic center be it Rome or Istanbul or Beijing or whatever and when they reach that point. It's only a matter of time droughts are gonna. There's gonna be more droughts there's gonna be more famine. There's going to be plagues now because you've got people living next to animals and generating diseases that are going to run through your population. Now that's has one effect hey you know it's cutting down that population growth.

[29:33](https://youtu.be/c0Qpu3jg6fM?t=29m33s)

But it's also undermining the structural Integrity of the institutions ideological cultural technological that actually make the thing run the actual like skeleton of it. The muscle not not the superstructure and because you live in the superstructure where your reality is our system is just because it is in harmony with God which is the basic underlying premise unstated but expressed different ways culturally secular religious. It's all the same it could be communism. It could be American exceptionalism or political Islam. It's the same idea that our way of being is in correspondence with God's Will and that is expressed through Nature has been since the Reformation and that and it goes for every post-religious secular person and every communist. Every everybody is operating on that assumption okay and so if you are if the system itself is destroying its ability to maintain itself well. Then you violated you've you've committed blasphemy in your heart and it's very hard to do that the whole system exists for you to never have that question brought. That is what ideology does.

But it also is torn Away by circumstance as the destabilization increases that is when class the the reality of class rule becomes more apparent if you start exploiting the slaves too much or even while you're exploiting them you're getting less out of them and therefore the structures that hold them like the knives of their back. The the rows of military that is a state expense is no longer affordable and all of a sudden cracks keeping in the show or conflict between Elites for the scraps leaves everybody to not even being paying attention and then not even noticing what the slaves are doing that's the good. Haiti is a good example for that yes. Of course I'm saying all modern this is what I'm saying all modern famines are man-made going every class. Society famine is man-made in the sense that it is in conditions of these this deep unstable relationship with the environment because you can't move you cannot accommodate changes in weather in a specific place. You can't all just sort of get out of the way of Mother Nature's fickle whims you're planted you're struck you're set up and that means that when the food goes away you're gonna have to mostly stay there. If it's trying to extract more from it and some of you are going to die and who's going to die most those at the bottom because they have the least power foreign but those are some of the things that over time eat away at the legitimacy of your state and then it collapses and now we're in the first time in human history where there is. There is no exterior thing that we're bumping against like up until you could argue 1991. Capitalism is still bumping against something else the same way that you know that the King Dynasty bumped up against Mongolia and even a good bump against England and and and the United States and France. There's nothing to bump against it is a global system. So the the the crisis is we're seeing are ones that cannot be resolved by a collapse that is then to the benefit of all those neighboring states. Right like a collapse leads to local power being maintained because at the local level people are self-sufficient enough to keep their heads and keep their social structure like the collapse of the Roman Empire. For example is really the collapse of a trade Network the local centers of power basically stayed intact.

Some cities got Rampage you know ravaged by the Goths or something but for the most part those those Germanic tribes just became the new tributory. Warlords of a system that was still basically attacked at least in southern Europe um like one of the big cultural conflicts that you see emerge in medieval. Europe is between those areas that maintain relatively robust social structures after the collapse of the Roman Empire like Southern France. And Northern Italy versus the more feral Northern sector including of course England where the collapse of Roman power was essentially overnight and total as opposed to the much more gradual process that was in some places basically undetectable that you saw in southern Europe and I could I honestly think you could you could trace the conflict in France. The conflict between the different parts of of the the French lands that ended up being knit into one thing the the South which became which was the the South which was the headquarters of the albigens the cathars who were one of the first big hierarchical sects of medieval Christianity. The First Crusade ever declared was against the albigensians they were massacred famously when the when the Cardinals sent his troops in the massacre. The final holdouts he said he said kill them all God will know his own which is the first kill em all God God sort of out okay so you had more of a trade Society versus northern France where you had this very quick re-emergence of like Warlord military rulers who just imposed this. This purely extractive relationship with with subsistence and Surplus farmers and then that you know carries on into modern European or modern French history. But anyway this is all to say 

It's this medium-state conflict. These these more and more powerful more and more technologically. Innovative more and more advanced societies banging into each other in a search to stabilize the their crisis written heart of their system by extracting more because it's all they can do and our crisis. It feels different and is different to the extent that we are getting these first real cracks in the foundation emerging now again. They were there the whole time they're always there. In every system. The question is to what degree are the crisis ameliorated by the continued Horizon of more profits. We use technology to increase productivity. We use international law to create the most highly arbitraged and socially efficient manufacturing system where the people who have to where people who make stuff get paid basically nothing so and the people at the other end. Can consume stuff but even with that over time it breaks up and the cracks started really accelerating almost immediately 

It's wild like Marx is often made fun of for saying the heat that there was going to be a like while he was writing in his. He honestly thought in his lifetime but certainly very close to it there was going to be a final world crisis capitalist a rogue vital crisis of infinite capitalism where capitalism goes into final death spiral. It's it's it's. It's it's crisis written heart pumping. Beyond its capacity and then giving out but the thing is first of all I think it is very interesting that Marx like Christ spoken wrote as though he believed that the Millennium would happen in their lifetime and I think that any real Prophet thinks that way because why else would you be so fired with prophecy. You know like there has to be a personal stake. An imaginative stake to keep you invested if you're that kind of a soul if you're that much of a mind on fire genius. It's like Jesus Christ or Karl Marx foreign. But he was right World War one I would say the 30 the second 30 Years War again we'll be talking next year early next year about the first 30 Years War. Very excited about that but we had the second 30 Years War as the Capstone to capitalism and crisis just as the first 30 Years War had been the Capstone to fatally to terminal feudalism. Feudalism was a terminal crisis.

It had been this hybrid dog creature. This inefficient junk rack for hundreds of years after the Black Death basically saved it from having to confront its contradictions because oh yeah this population problem we have where we can no longer get any more. Any more agricultural productivity out of the land than we have we had get no more. Coins we could get no more gold out of the earth to create species to circulate an economy. What are we gonna do oh thank you flagships. Burp.

[39:34](https://youtu.be/c0Qpu3jg6fM?t=39m34s)

Like this is why the conspiratorial view of History can sometimes be misleading when you look at how beneficial to the capitalists and there were capitalists who lived in high Medieval Europe because all these systems are studded with each other. There's never just one thing. It's just what's the dominant parent and feudalism had been broken up and replaced by this tenant farming system in most of Western Europe but serfdom was reimposed in in Eastern Europe why because there was more. The Reformation is a part of this the structures of medieval Society of medieval life. The pace of the medieval life was not consonant with what it was what it felt like to actually live in this more and more commercialized Society more and more commercialized more and more abstracted Society living people living in a system that had been designed for the the medieval pace of Life. The few I should say feudal pace of life because this is no longer feudalism but if feudalism is still the overarching political structure and so there's this massive conflagration the 30 Years War and it's attended crises the Spain. This massive Proxima what emerges out of it is capitalism that it breaks the feudal hold that 17th century is in the feudal. The feudals the the Chrysalis breaks away and Falls away to reveal the new synthesized capitalism synthesize on religion on a basis of protestant religion. I know the Catholicism stuck around but it was on the losing team. It would not shape the future definition of things. Protestantism would shape the future definition why because northern Europe was speeding up faster than southern Europe and why because northern Europe was more environmentally unstable and prone to famine and and starvation more scarce that that definition that that different speed of life is because of scarcity increased scarcity in northern Europe led to more abstracted regimes of exploitation technologically in um the creation of a market space where you could instead of having to ritualize. Socially the violence of exploitation which is inefficient you put it off onto a market so it doesn't have to be socially costed but we can all pretend. It's not being created by the system we live in so that means that they're actually stacking up surpluses in the form of cash and then in the form of abstract instruments of credit. That's a huge thing and it's all part and parcel to the personalized God of protestantism that allows does.

This say so capitalism sets up shop there and it of course takes 100 or so years to achieve hegemony through the instruments first of the Dutch Republic and then the British Empire and it completes that job by the mid 19th century father. That's when you see things like the piping Heavenly Kingdom in China and the Civil War in the United States. That's why you see the world the 48 revolutions. Before that. This is the CR. This is the moment when Marx was there it was the image of the eschaton of global capitalism not yet as one as a global system. But it's a system that could compete with other systems and at a rate vastly more efficient than any of them and it would force all of their competitive. States all of them to adopt their policies that is the moment that Marx was there for and Mark thought at that rate even with the colonial exploitation the competition between the states of Europe as they grew in power and grew in technological sophistication and commiseration. At the heart of their systems is they have to create more and more proletarians to work in more and more exploitive conditions to fuel the system. They will come to conflict it because the boom and bust will eventually become unstabilizing and he got he was correct like he died in what 1881 I think or 1888 I believe and by 1914 like and if he'd kept a little better care of himself he might have made it to that old you know But then he wouldn't have been him you know. If he's out walking around. He's not sitting in the British museum archives but anyway he could have been alive for that that's within a realistic lifespan he would have been an old man but he could have seen it in 1914 was it. It was the start of this 30-year proxim as capitalism as soon as it takes power within 50 years comes to fatal conflict but the reason that was not the end of capitalism is because by this point capitalism had made all these other social formations into mirrors of itself in order to compete with them which means that you have to have capitalism outside of Europe.

Now Europe is where it was born and and Marx couldn't see this because he was a European at the end of the day and he couldn't seem really. He didn't really he how could he grasp beyond that like he could read a lot about the United States but he never lived here so he didn't know what was happening. Here he didn't realize the extent to which the United States was absorbing all the social contradictions of European capitalism and resolving them through the distribution of free real estate and the exploitation of Cl of skin color slave labor racial cast and manifest destiny. These are the these are the missing ingredients that European capitalism could not provide to the center and that means that these Europe can knock themselves out. But when it's all over here is this new headquarters to take over from England and take to us take us to a stage that remarks I don't think ever imagined possible. I mean I think he did in the long run but he had always assumed that it would be interrupted before that could occur by the internal contradictions of capitalism undermining it which it did those not contradictions were not felt the same way in the United States and the United States by that point was able to Marshal a continent's worth of resources and therefore be in a material. Level in it able to take on the role of Europe because of their relatively similar economic power within the global system which is mostly filled with um decaying Imperial systems in in the old Imperial parts of the world.

The parts where there was no small state competition because there was a central Imperial Authority and what made that happen according to Wolfgang or Walter. Scheidle and I agree with him. It was the proximity to step. Nomads. The chats chat the society that even after everything else got settled even after the warrior kings came back and dominated the city so they could sit fat and happy and decadent in their in their sedan shares. They stayed out there they domesticated them and then they just fed them on endless grass fields and just lived as Warriors and that threat kept the Chinese for example always focused on a emergency level crisis of imminent Annihilation which meant that all you could have that meant for one thing. No feudalism feudalism was abolished in China in I believe the 200s A.D like after the consolidation of the first Empire or after I think the fall of like the first dynasty 200 BC. They're like yeah. These these get out of here whereas nobody can dominate anybody else like that in Europe. Nobody can take over everybody's place you know they can come in they can fight you. They can ravage your territory but you're still going to be in charge unless you die in the battlefield and that's a glorious death you're not going to be not going to be exterminated as a as a social social fiction which is what a a barbarian Society operating literally by different rules because of their different relationship to their environment. Their different production method are they're different um mode of production.

They're different they're like their means of production were the. Weapons of war and their horses because they're they're all of their efforts went into being best in fighting so that means they could go to a place where people had built stuff and just take it. I'm talking to the shadow book. Is escape from Rome. A very very good book I highly recommend um but but the stability led to stagnation as someone says in the comments because there was nothing harnessing all of these ingenious innovations that come when more and more minds are working more brains that are together they're closer. They're able to communicate closer because you get like everything printing. Revolution you're increasing mind power but that mind power gets dissipated in a system where a central Authority can prevent certain Innovations from flourishing for the because they rightly see them as threatening in Europe. Everybody was going to grab what they could get and what they grabbed was The Financial Innovations tied to religious Innovations that Sanctified life in a Godless World basically that took God out of the world. As in the market made the market. A decent made the market that is the the world our social World a sacralized space and to bring all um religious conception. Internally. I am the god of course they would never have said that but no that is what they did instead of saying I am embedded in a social organism that is God I am God and then there is the social which is not. It is a it is a nature where we can do whatever we want and we can treat our fellow human as bad as we want to because it is God's will because if it's doing me good and I'm God and I willed it and of course for those people who things aren't going good for tough. You're not in you're not one of us you're a loser you fall out of real existence.

The book again for next week thank you for reminding me is um the China boom why China will not rule the world by ho Fung hung this guy's name. I also did I wanted to do something by an actual Chinese person already. I'm already a dang Gaijin or whatever is there a Chinese word is there Chinese derogatory because Gaijin is Japanese is there Chinese derogatory term for round-eyed foreigners baizu guilo. There's I'm getting bison why I'm getting guilo and byzu I got three gualos. Now I gotta buys you. It's neck and neck. I'm getting you. I'm getting a bison for every guelow means devil man. That's awesome yeah.

It is kind of wild like think about think. This is the thing about something that I find very interesting about about contemporary Asia is that you had these societies like the Japanese and the Chinese who for very good reason believe themselves to be the center of the world. Like it was. It was not obviously everybody thinks that they are the center of the world but they have the best case. They certainly had a better case than anybody in Europe. The ass end of the continent I mean it wasn't as Barren and resourceless as a lot of people like to claim but compared to life in in China. It was nothing one of the big reasons that the Chinese never really did conquest discover. Exploration is because they didn't need anything. They didn't need spices and they had trade networks that allowed them to sell the stuff. They did have for stuff that they wanted and a huge chunk a huge amount of the silver that was pulled out of This the South American mines by the habsburgs went to China for silk. The Middle East also has a very good claim to it also because of its geographical literal centrality to that whole area that whole Nexus there um and so their religion reflected that like their notion their folk. Notions of religion that like turned into you know like that's what's so fascinating about China.

Specifically. It's like you have this Central Imperial Authority but then at the folk level. You have basically a totally a a a profusion of totally un organized local folk beliefs. You know like you've got Confucianism. You've got Buddhism and taoism they're all there. But they're just very loose like rubrics for grouping together what are essentially local spiritual phenomena and I think those things go together like in the West. Those military States coming out of the collapsing Roman Empire. Require a social dimension of of coercion that the Chinese system didn't need to because it was It was a lightly felt hand basically at every point um but all of these religions had in common though is that Chinese people were got the people of God whatever you meant by that just as the the Japanese Shinto traditions and then in Japanese Buddhism too. They were the centers and that meant that the you know the weibo's the gaijins. These are devil people. These are people who are not of God like the same way the Europeans thought of the Infidel other but in their case these highly developed social formations that were just as abstract just as everybody in them was living at basically the same metal. Universe of of Mastery of abstract. Concepts have just these devil people show up and then take them destroy them. It's like it's very easy to see how the the the the the samurai were broken in Japan because how could anybody believe in the old gods a favor when these see the thing is you can't get it because those those sort of Innovations come from basically bottlenecks of capital emerging you're getting like concentrations of money around and focus and human attention around a specific problem and those only occur if the social structure is facilitating that like the state is intervening on behalf of these things and that is like England one of the big things that makes them the has the place where the Industrial Revolution happened because yes they took over from The Duchess like the commercial headquarters of European capitalism in the late 1700 17th century. But they were not able to they were they would made them dominate. Everybody else.

In the next 200 years was the fact that they took those resources and directed them towards these industrial questions that were then eight that the society existed like the liberal the liberal marketized Society. They had allowed for those um those efforts to get immediate reward in the form of patents and money incentivizing the best Minds to get to this specific question because otherwise everyone's going to be going towards their own drummer we're going to get somewhere. But it's not going to be efficient. What capitalism does is. It allows the state to say put money here put money here put money here towards the creation of specific technological breakthroughs in order to compete more effectively and the British Industrial Revolution. The first Industrial Revolution is tied directly to the British war effort during the Napoleonic Wars. It was the it was fighting Napoleon that gave the the British political system sufficient incentives to facilitate deregulate subsidize the construction of Technology first of War but then of course other applications around War but war is the length of health of the state. War is what makes the state and then the state makes War as Charles Tilly says that's that's correct but every time it does so it creates greater major technology which then is directed to the common use under capitalism by being privatized.

Now this is social. This is a social product but it is privatized because of our fantasy ritual world that we live in that is was consecrated really in the Roman. Ethos like capitalism is just the Roman conception of right property the Roman world the Roman I among all the competing social structures that existed at that point. The Romans were the first to codify the the values of assassin. The values of a society in the conditions of Crisis capitalism or I'm sorry crisis class rule in in Europe and it is the European geography that makes it unconquerable after Rome Falls. But Rome's operating system basically is never overthrown. It is incorporated the the texts of the Renaissance. The church maintains the structure that that exists of the Roman Empire the church hierarchy is where the Roman Empire Retreats basically and then Marshall and then like military authorities devolved to warlord Chieftains Lumbers and Franks who then organized into social structures dominated from the from the from the middle that could extend their power as far as possible and so you get the Holy Roman Empire which almost immediately breaks into pieces because the German Park can't hold because it is geographically too Unbound.

It's Unbound the way that France France is bound to. But it's Italy's a peninsula. England is an island. Germany is just this. It's this River. It's these river systems. It's these civilizations dotted along the Rhine or the Danube. It cannot be taken from a middle like that France can't be from Paris or England can be from London.

To this day you go to Germany. There's no big city. There is no you might think Berlin is like London - Berlin has like two million people in it. London has like what 30 million something insane somebody tell me how many people are in London. I think it's got to be like 20 million. At this point there are two million people in Berlin but there's like two million people in Frankfurt. There's a million people in Munich. There's well. There's like five million people in Hamburg which is why Ohio is the Germany of the United States because Ohio does not have one big city like Milwaukee or Chicago because Columbus Cincinnati Cleveland and then even second-run cities like Akron and Toledo which are like Dusseldorf and yeah. It's a bunch of Milwaukee's I guess Cleveland's that is the thing that's annoying those because Wisconsin should be the Germany of the United States. It's got that I would argue the most. It's the most German influenced state. And I think the fact that they had the Socialist mayors that they were able to actually take power municipally as proof of that because that was the courage of German immigrant life. The people who left Germany did so because capitalism had card sharp and Irishman who came to these Shores okay 14 million people in the London metro area still not as many as I thought but nonetheless only 2 billion in Berlin but sadly but Wisconsin just asked the Milwaukee. It's got Madison but like that just the shape of or why hasn't even kind of shaped like Germany sick okay six million Metro in Berlin that's 10 million dollars four million and so that that's what that's the machine that took over the world basically and we're at the end of it.

We the our our simulated Computer World. That is this is supported not by any kind of ritually consecrated human endeavor but by the unthinking totally alienated unconnected to human life decision. Cold decisions of algorithms ah the sound is. Goddamn I really felt like I was on a roll here but all right. I'm gonna just avoid whatever I'm fine but now we're in a situation where there is nobody else to pick up a slack. And I think what happens then is. We look backward and we're like okay. Yes.

We can say that we have a globalized capitalism but as I said before every system has embedded within it. Remnants undigested remnants of what came before so you know like there were capitalists in the Roman Empire even though it wasn't the capitalism the recapitalists in every society. There there was proto-capitalism in the the um the Muslim world in the middle area in the Middle Ages and also once capitalism. Those old systems still remain in some some remnant form you know like There are still Artisans out there and so that means that if if the supply chain breaks the way the Romans did we're left with the same thing. That was the Romans were left with local power persists but at the edges it frays into essentially lawlessness in some respect and so we go back to the the Roman Emperor imperial system with localized trading routes protected by local structures of power that are then going to negotiate. Through these whoever is able to command these out the well that's the thing that's the difference. So after the Roman Empire collapsed right you got the local trade networks. The local power structures existed in the cities in the south and then it collapsed more fully in the north which is where um you know.

The military aristocracy evolves to fight other people for land rather than to cultivate and trade it the way that they were doing in the places that had kept things and they eventually overthood and dominated and created feudalism which is in a respect is a progress from the slave society that preceded it because hey at least it's not slaves. You know they don't own your person. You just are you are required to give them labor as tribute tributary relationship so if we take that analogy to the current moment who is going to be that that Force outside and here's the most pressing question has technology progressed so much since that time that the walls of the trade networks are going to be essentially impregnable and so you will have people fighting for the scraps in the exclusion zones where the the Detroit networks break down and where Capital Retreats does a tactical Retreat to maintain resources elsewhere. Social base for this thing is going to be decaying rapidly. People are going to be getting spit out the bottom like nobody's business but much of its operation will be automated. Drones. Cameras Boston Dynamics robots simple geography proximity the creation of inaccessible at tolls of wealth that then direct the remaining people who are getting just enough to stay on the treadmill yeah.

Somebody's asking if I me and Chris would go to any raves or festivals is coming. Here. You know Chris and and his wife Molly are big time ravers and Festival heads. They are music heads power excellence and I respect them and they're beliefs very much. But I am not much of one of those kinds of standing up that long his ass. My back hurts so I get sweaty but we did go to the club. He went to like the club the club type scenario in Miami and that was very fun so. I'd be willing to go. I'd be willing to to try out a fast. I mean. We did go to Pittsburgh or not Pitchfork pickathon that was great I don't know if I can handle a rave though it seems really loud yeah we went to Club Space. It's called it was weird. It was called Club space but it had sort of like a a autumnal like Forest vibe. I don't know if that was for Halloween or something but felt like we were in like the Ewok villagers and I was like why is it called Club Space. Maybe that's it maybe it's ziwa Village in space yeah.

I would need earplugs. I only got one ear so I have to protect it. I don't know if anybody knows. I'm half deaf. I have to say though hippie have to ask that's one of those situations where it really is. It seems like it's all or nothing because I technically cannot hear it all out of one of my ears which means I would have to have but man. I still can hear a lot of stuff and when I think when I see deaf people. It's like damn. They can't hear anything and I can still hear a lot of stuff 50 percent.

It's it's okay. But I do think eventually those batteries are going to run out you know the the robots are. Gonna get tired of chasing around in a circle and then whatever has whatever whatever that people have done to survive in that exclusion. Zone is going to become a stable viable social formation and it will eventually be able to push open those Gates unplug the the dumbass corpses from the computers from these idiots who like tried to plug themselves at the end of it that'll it'll be armies of human liberation marching into deserted compounds and finding some rich. MacBook and you open the computer and there's just like an 8-bit guy just called foreign. Every human breast that has to be there has to be. There is that those people will be able to synthesize everything that come before them as those people before that did. But I mean come to this point where conceptions of humanity extend to all of humans. I know we like to think that oh everyone's racist now and fascism's back and nationalism is horrible. But the violence of those systems is the Rebellion against the deeper truth that cannot be renounced which is oh. That's a class Society. You can't have that so it has to be suppressed. I mean I don't have to sell you on the future thing. It's going to happen or not you. You just you have to make decisions about what you're going to do with it and maybe they don't maybe they don't figure it out. Maybe they're worse. Maybe they're worse than everybody and then they they dig up the nukes and they destroy Earth completely. Okay still 100 000 years in the future after that 200 000. Got some squid creatures who have come to land and are able to use their encounters with our artifacts to harness technology to the social being to act to negate the the cancerous conflict-based algorithm at the center of our of our social identities. That's been passed out since the Romans all right. I think that was good I've gone pretty long so next week. We're going to read the first half of the China Bloom. It's like 60 Pages. It's nothing that's gonna. It goes through like everything until 20 20 2000 so I'm expecting a very Breezy jog through the political economy of early modern China which is exactly what I want as I said if there's something really interesting specifically I want to get more into find another another book but I think this is a good entry point. Book is the China boom why China will not rule the world by half of Hong. I believe it's his name that's it all right talk to y'all on the flippity flop.
