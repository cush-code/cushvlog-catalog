Silver rob you would oh man did you guys see all those chips on my face that's embarrassing oh well. I was finishing some chips now. I got to get the chips out. I got to have a basic standard of hygiene here or else. I'm gonna start spiraling can't have that you gotta maintain internal discipline. They are the classic ridged sour cream and onion chips. Y'all like that that's one of the most classic combinations you can have yes virgil's back virgil's back on the show. So no more asking me about it ever again. How's that sound good deal. I think food crab chips are good too but they didn't have any my bowdangle does not have crab chips. I don't live in balmer.

 someone asked about the portuguese carnation revolution which is very fascinating story because it's I think to my knowledge anyway. It is the only successful left-wing military coup um certainly in europe. Unless of course you count the bolshevik revolution talking to you robert service so that's an interesting thing because so it was in the 70s. It was the tail end of the era known as the estado novo which is the corporatist authoritarian government that had seized power in portugal before world war ii. It was a rare military dictatorship that was headed not by a member of the military but by a damn nerd by a college professor professor salazar and professor. Salazar ruled over this quas this harmonious sleepy coastal country with a steady firm hand. Later he was joined by francisco franco who sort of ran a similar deal in spain over that exact same time same time period. Now when franco died in spain. What happened was his chosen successor. Juan carlos the the heir to the throne that had been vacated when the monarchy had been overthrown before the popular in the 30s before the civil war but he didn't want to do. He didn't want to keep doing fascism. He said it sucked and he was helped by the fact that etta had blown up the bosque. Separatists had blown up the the general who was supposed to be the guiding hand. After franco died they set off a giant bomb under his car and the car went over the top of a church. They called him spain's first astronaut but anyway the upshot is is that juan carlos didn't want to do any more authoritarianism and so he started to transition to democracy and at one point in the early 80s there was an attempted coup by the military to bring back the dictatorship and they seized parliament and read a pronunciation pronunciamento about how and did it all in the name of the king of course and he went on the radio and denounced them and the whole thing fell apart but anyway in spain or in portugal. Salazar like franco died after a long illness but hilariously with salazar. He went into a coma after a stroke.

They assumed he was dead and just moved on with the continuity of government and then um when you know it. Salazar came back to consciousness and they kind of pretended that he was in charge until he died while not actually letting him control anything but they actually because of that because they had the that little interregnum to make sure the estadon almost attempted to keep going after the death of salazar. But their big problem was they were unlike spain. It meshed in some very long a bloody and expensive colonial wars in the portugal's colonies they had portugal had had a significant overseas empire before before world war. Ii kept it after the war because they were non-belligerent and gave it up piecemeal as they could as they were forced to basically in 1961 they actually They lost their little weird nugget of east of western india when when india just invaded them and essentially dared them to do anything about it and they really couldn't so they just kind of complained about it. But they went away but they were fighting these colonial wars in angola and mozambique in southern africa east and west coast and it was going poorly like all.

Those bush wars went in the 60s and 70s and usually what happened is that the mother country decided. This isn't cost efficient effective anymore and just gave up the french indochina and algeria the brits in kenya and malaysia and that was the model but they were holding on tight because they didn't they had they had not transitioned to democracy. They still were this military dictatorship that therefore didn't have the kind of popular vulnerability to to changes in you know the the mood of the people that one of those other governments does. I mean obviously. That's not the final say in what governments choose to do. But public opinion is a real thing because you can only massage the you you can attenuate democracy to the extent that you can maintain a facade of its of its existence. So if everybody is against the war in your democracy you've got a problem. Then you have to rectify it some way less of a problem in a dictatorship. So they kept fighting into the 70s and eventually a bunch of mid-level officers decided that this was.

They've been reading some marxist theory and they got it in their head that they were gonna. Decapitate the state and they did it. They they coordinated strategic takeovers of all the main power and media headquarters and all that stuff went on the radio and said we're in charge now and that was basically it. It was almost bloodlust and one of the first things they did. Then is cut loose. The colonies almost immediately um but the reason that I have been mentioning it lately and that but anyway no. I wanna so they were like it was a kind of like cuba in that it was a left wing of a military movement this from within the mill. This was a military movement from within the military as opposed to in a in a rebel military. The way castro was but it was so inside the military that's like junior officers. Corps of radicalized leftists came together but they were varied in their ideologies. Some of them were hardcore communists and others. Of them were more social democrats or whatever and so when they took power there was an immediate crisis of like what kind of government were they going to impose and eventually as you kind of assumed was going to happen in the context of where they were and when and like their vulnerability to other countries and and like the world markets and portugal's economy in general being relatively poor They they they hewed away from any kind of state takeover and managed to move towards democracy and you know. There are some leaders. There were some leaders of the movement who years later said they regretted ever even doing it because it was a waste of time and it just gave people fantasies that the regime held legitimacy that it didn't but the reason I've been mentioning. It is because I mean if you imagine a near future where america's critical infrastructure is put under unsustainable.

Strain and democratic norms and niceties are suspended in some way to some degree in some portion of the united states than the only people really realistically in a position to organize any kind of working-class lead military movement like that would be necessary because politics has been replaced by force. You know the the facade of politics has been revealed has been dropped revealing just the armature of force which means you need to have force you need to have actual force. And the only people are going to be in position to do that. On the left would be people in the military because they in terms of having training access to weapons at literal physical proximity to power structures. There's nobody close certainly nobody in the political class and it's not like there's enough of a robust labor movement to to stand up militarily behind. But the problem there of course is that the service academies where all of the big all of the officers come from are. These absolute fat headed mediocrities. These these cows who just got selected by what the system is designed to select the most mediocre yes man who will just do his part to maintain this ridiculous edifice. This world bestriding military colossus that just exists to provide this perverse keynesian pump on the economy without giving anybody anything they could use like housing or healthcare. Ah like that's all it is it's just a giant make work program. It doesn't matter if they can win a war. The wars aren't to be won. Anymore. Wars are just to have where's there to keep on the back burner to slow and slow like you're cooking brisket so in that case you don't need it. What do you need you don't need napoleon. You don't need you don't need. A ulysses s grant.

[12:25](https://youtu.be/fMd4PM_3Whc?t=12m25s)

You don't need some humble son of the soil who fights his way across the country rising with the ranks and showing his his absolute mastery of the moment until his talents are revealed why you're not trying to take richmond you're just trying to get the bills banned. You're just trying to get bechtel and vague to get the money from the saudis keep the whole petro dollar blood wheel turning. It doesn't matter if you're good at it because nobody's paying attention so that means those guys are not going to really be in any position to even on their own behalf. Class solidarity seize power that's where the hope is maybe junior. It's always junior officers like the the the military coups that you saw in like egypt and libya and and portugal the free or were free officers. Movements of young junior officers like colonels and stuff and I always respected gaddafi. He seized power when he was a colonel and he was 29 amazing and then he ruled for over 30 years and he never gave himself a promotion because he remembered where he came from so.

The hope is there's maybe some people who didn't go to west point. Let's hope yeah our military. I mean like the the I think the enlisted people are generally pretty good. They're let to the left of I mean they're way to the left of like cops. For example they're actually relatively diverse as a group of people. You know they gave more money to bernie sanders than any other candidate in donations. In 2020. It's not monolithic. I mean there's obviously psychotic death culture within it because it's a psychotic death cult but there's also a huge civilian more civilian-facing infrastructure of it of people who do not seek out horror but because it really is one of the very few significant sustainable nationalized jobs programs that provide any kind of economic mobility for people below like middle class like in this country. If you're any if you're if you're working poor. There's basically no chance you will have generational transition out of that state.

 even the middle class like that's the hyperdrive and it almost never happens and one of the few things that can provide any of that is the military because they hire everywhere regardless of whether or not the mill closed. So there is. I mean. The bolsheviks were. The spine of the bolshevik revolution was deserted soldiers but you know everyone's so split up that even in a crisis everyone's probably going to do what's easiest which is to follow orders. So the question is who can plausibly be in a position to give those orders and I honestly don't think it's going to be some sort of blood and soil thing.

I think it would be more like a a military command economy like egypt or pakistan like you go to the px to get your groceries. Every week you know like there's mandatory service and and like you gotta do corvae labor. You know like build ditches or something for covent bodies but then they also like run the economy and like like actually own capital which is true of the militaries in egypt and pakistan. They're actually huge investors in like industrial capacity and real estate and whole industries. I think there's like a flower monopoly. I think by the egyptian military or the pakistani so that that and then that would be distributed sort of through the veins of its actual military members and then down through their families and stuff and then like create an economy based around that like like like like camp followers during a war. Obviously.

I mean I've been very critical of china. I don't think it's. I think it's a puzzle one dictatorship just like the united states is hashtag real talk but I'm not a psychotic shot and a hater. I realize that in the long run china and the united states will have to merge at the political and economic level like like one currency type. Like that's going to happen it's just going to question of what the terms are going to be so it's. I have no problem so yeah. I got to go with china over over india on that one. Although they're probably fighting over like somebody who had like a coffee mug ring stain on a map and now they both think one thing is theirs that happens all the time the chinese they actually had a war. In the 60s. They went to war china and india for brief period I don't think it's going to escalate.

It's not really in anyone's interest critical support for the nba mlb players. The the owners are disgusting cast of vampires. These dis human pigs who just are so so besotted with their own sense of entitlement that they've decided that they'd rather not play baseball than play it on terms that aren't their total mastery and domination of of the talents of people who are far better than them in every respect. People who actually contribute to this to the game people want to see as opposed to sitting tick-like on top of it sucking. Out of the game nationalizing sports is that's a no-brainer and it's not like it'd be difficult. Oh you got it. You would have to you would probably have to do like a salary cap but remember. This is not so that the other half goes to That's that's not a salary cap because it's not going into the pockets of the owners you can think of it. As a tax. You can think of it as a wealth tax which you should be willing to pay right in a just society so you'd have to have a salary cap but then you just have everybody you just have like a board of directors who hires a hires management and then they do do what every other team does which is basically what the packers do only it would be totally municipally run okay.

[19:30](https://youtu.be/fMd4PM_3Whc?t=19m30s)

Somebody wants me to do the rest of europe with the america because I said the midwest is the balkans app. We've already established that appalachia is the caucuses I think that all right all right this is interesting H . I think the west coast is scandinavia northeast is france. The south is italy and then of course like everything west of the midwest is This eurasian step texas can be germany how about that texas is is germany because it's the size of all these other regions and it has as many parts of it within itself because like there's pride like like east texas is like bavaria and then like west texas is like prussia. So yeah germany is Germany is texas the north. The whole northeast is. France and maybe a little spain. Italy is the south. The step is the is the west and then scandinavia is the west coast. I think that's it that makes sense. The northeast is france and then new england is england obviously. So I'm talking like pennsylvania to like through new york that's france and then new england is england that makes perfect sense eight. Ancient rivals. New york yankees red sox that's nothing on on on the hundred years war.

Battle agent court I'll take that any day over over game seven of the 2003 alds alcs god damn. It florida is turkey and greece like depending on like it's the peloponnese yeah think of the mediterranean as the caribbean or caribbean is the mediterranean. So the south is italy and then florida is past the aegean to to greece and and and anatolia. The mid-atlantic that is the low countries that's benelux delmarva made with hope delmarva is benelux. How's that yes new orleans is venice correct very good. See this all works. Hawaii is like malta or something and alaska is iceland what is the vatican graceland baby. That's the american vatican new england is old england and the british isles. So it's also ireland the whole thing because it's not that big they flatter themselves ohio no ohio serbia.

The thing is is that england and ireland as much as people they may hate each other or whatever it's basically the same countries. I'm sorry it's the same pasty skin. It's the same hunched over beaten down feeling. Both countries have the same exhausted sense of being passed by the same innervating weather the same sort of dreariness of the soul and like kind of I mean ireland. They're much more cheerful. The people are nicer but the vibe is very similar It's just like there's some parts of of new england that are nicer than so that's why as much as you want boston to be ireland I'm sorry boston's too miserable to be ireland. Boston's got to be england that's how badly you irish. Is is one of those bummer ass english cities where everybody just kills each other during soccer matches and if none of this makes sense remember.

It's all absurd and ridiculous and means nothing but as I've also said it's not hurt nobody so let's have a little fun oh. I'm just staring at this. I'm getting transfixed. I'm sure this is always very riveting when I do this but sorry. I'm just wow good stuff. Oh god somebody asked what kind of board games virgil made us has ever made us play. I think I talked about this on the show but I'm not sure when we went to net roots nation in philadelphia. Last year. There was a at this in the swag merch area which was way inferior to the one at cpac. They had this video. These like activist board games. Board games were supposed to teach you how to be a better activist. One of those called like antifa space cats or something like that it was weird. I don't really remember how it went but it was you were fighting fascists in space and you were a cat so that was the that's the one name he also in iowa. Last year made us. Play or earlier this year made us play the game of thrones trivial pursuit. I think it was so ah. I'm hoping to stream some games soon hoping that can happen soon. I would play white frailty. The board game that sounds fun somebody asked let me try. I gotta make a sad admission here.

Somebody asked how many criterion collection dvds. I own for one thing. I'm not really that kind of guy. I appreciate fine films sometimes but I mostly watch. I mostly watch garbage but even if I didn't. I don't own any dvds anymore. It's just. I moved too much. It's too seductive to just have everything in the cloud. Even though I know I don't really own. Anything anything can be taken from me at any moment and that's scary. But it's a price you pay.

[29:26](https://youtu.be/fMd4PM_3Whc?t=29m26s)

I'm probably gonna just cut off all media and just evaluate what's going on in the world through augury watching where the chickens feed and when the crows fly from their nests and that kind of thing secret honor is the greatest movie about nixon ever made with the best dixon in it. Phillips phillip baker hall one of the greats. But he doesn't even really do an impression and they don't give him any makeup or anything. He just plays the volcanic wounded animal. It's really good gremlins. Two should be criteria release absolutely masterpiece yeah. I am getting today has been very bad for allergies. I it's been. It's. It's it's been getting worse. This week ragweed damn you yeah everyone who hasn't seen gremlins too check it out. It's groovy. I didn't see never really here that movie is amazing because it kind of came out while pizzagate was still something. That was idiots like me thought was mostly a joke but it seems chillingly plausible. Now. I'll say that hearing chimes like I don't wish. It was an ice cream guy oh that's a great question. I had never thought of that because I've given up hope that it'll ever happen who would be the ideal director for an american tabloid film very good question. Let's think about this that movie has been dangled in front of me forever. I remember like in the 90s. It was tom hanks was going to produce a mini series for hbo. It never happened even after la confidential. It's a bummer because that's my favorite one of his books. It's the first one I've read. I'm a big fan of all of his stuff but nothing's ever topped the experience of reading american tabloid. For the first time. It was one of the most important books. I've ever read in terms of shaping my aesthetic oh my my historical interests my politics.

 my you know my approach to narrative a lot of things. It was like what I thought you could do in a in a novel and so I would love to see a movie version of it even if it would be bastardized because allie confidential is a really good movie but it still isn't a patch on the book um and I but the best part is. I think. I can understand why they did what they had to do with l.a. Confidential because the plot of l.a. Confidential is absurdly complicated. I mean it's that's part of the point but it's also just the idea of putting even a fraction of it on screen not realistic with american tabloid. I think you could really do it. You can really tell that story in a way that wouldn't compromise the story arcs because the big problem with the big problem with l.a. Confidential is the way it just ends in a big stupid shootout that just cuts the gordian knot of all the plot strings. And I don't think you'd have to do that with american tabloid and so I've often thought about casting it like who should be in it. But I hadn't really thought of who would direct it. I think let's think of the obvious choices first the first name that comes to mind. The most obvious name is david fincher but I don't think that would be ideal. He gets elroy's obsessiveness in his like chili like reptilian gays.

I don't know maybe it would be maybe maybe. I'm thinking too hard. Maybe. It's just fincher. Maybe fincher is the one because the thing is. I guess. It's because I don't really like fincher that much he's not.

[34:17](https://youtu.be/fMd4PM_3Whc?t=34m17s)

I don't like it as much as a lot of people do. But I have to say that for this material he's kind of ideal but let's keep thinking the cohen brothers. No no no no no not the koch brothers. Elroy doesn't really have a sense of humor as the thing and I don't think they could ever really pull that off. That's one of elroy's strengths is that he never winks he has full full. Like fixated north star intensity on telling the stories he has no time for frivolity. Some of his short stories are funny on purpose but the novels are not funny and that's not that's good if they wouldn't be as good if they were and I can't see the code brothers not doing it like. No country for all men is a pretty funny movie. We it's got. Two double beds did you not hear me. We don't give out that information about our residents and of course one of the funniest bits in cone brothers history in the famous coin toss scene with the gas station guy when he when he chokes on the peanut goes who else paul thomas anderson. Someone said he doesn't really do plot and an american tabloid movie would have to be very plot heavy. It would have to get in its character stuff at the edges and that's not really what paired what pta does so. I don't think. I don't think that would be a good good one zack snyder that's kind of funny. I don't know 

Soderbergh is an interesting choice. Okay. Soderbergh is interesting because he can do like genre. Like easily you know. I mean he's he's. He did one of the all-time great elmore leonard adaptations and out of sight. I think he could he could vibe with elroy. He's also got the chili thing So he's definitely on the list michael mann h . That's an interesting one. He's definitely would yeah. I don't know. I think he might be like he might be hostile to the plot stuff. But it's just too plotty because he's his movies really don't move in that kind of linear way. I mean the heat is almost three hours long and there's barely any plot in it craig zoller. Oh man ooh now that's an interesting one craig zoller. I don't know if he could pull up well. Now he didn't tomahawk. See he could definitely pull off yeah all right. He's definitely on the list too. Dan. Gilroy is a good idea too town girl is good andrew dominic not bad. This is some good ideas here not tarantino andrew dominic is a good one too not eastwood 

I just finished lodge 49 I really liked it and I thought the last the end was great but god damn. It. I really wanted another season now that I'm done I'm really kind of annoyed because as much as they don't need another season. Because the show is able to you know leave you with a sense of satisfaction no matter what because it's you know. It's. It's. It's it understands itself as a cyclical story even though it might get another addition to it but still man I i really like those characters and I would like to hang out with them. Some more for another season or so but people people are too dumb. There wasn't enough prestige in it for people to watch it. There wasn't enough dumbass indulgent. Like ooh. This is all very serious and rigorous and this is real. This is cinema while you're looking at your phone. The whole time. Every one of these shows is designed to be watchable. You're watched looking at your phone. God damn it how about some coffee flavored coffee okay so there's cheeto in the white house. I'm stuffed up. This is not good oh boy.

I'm sorry what is the most effective allergy medicine. It's not the one. I took today that's for sure. I thought it would have worked. I gotta take another one these damn bowdangle. Allergy medicines are nothing but sawdust yeah. How you guys always make fun of jesus. How do you know he's just not allergic h . It's not necessarily tooting on that yayo you might just have some dang red weed allergies as I do I am not buying the ps5. No what would. I do with it. I don't. I don't game. I chant gabe shan't be happening. I have. I we have a we have a gaming pc. For me to work on if we ever figure out how to stream from our office. I'll play crusader kings or something there or roll a ball around in the katamari demasi game and stream some of that. But I champion gaming on a console. I shan't be gaming upon a council. You can't make me do it.

Oh man. I usually the thing is. I usually don't take medicine I usually because it usually just hits in the morning and then I'm fine and so I just got to ride it out. But today it's not going away is having kids immoral no of course. Not. It's it shows that you actually believe that you can that there's a future it makes you want to fight for it. There's nothing wrong with egoism is just an observation of the self as it exists but you aren't yourself as you exist. You're oh you're out. You are all yourselves together at the same time and how do you manage that that's the only question that matters how do you manage all those other isolated singular egos. How do you manage them because that's all that there is 

[43:08](https://youtu.be/fMd4PM_3Whc?t=43m08s)

Virgil wants to do a good beltway garage suit but I gotta know. I gotta say. I don't know what I'm gonna talk about because I have completely checked out on the presidential race. I mean. I do not care. I mean obviously. It's not hard for that to be the case because everything that's happening seems very irrelevant. But I have genuinely fully grill pilled all my way through by any of my concern and personal. I don't really know what's going on.

It looks like mine's gonna win but I mean. I don't give a so I don't know what I'm gonna say honestly. Maybe I'll just talk about grilling booker in kentucky is interesting it would be nice to see him get the nomination because it's obviously very unlikely that mcconnell will lose. But if things fall correctly this could be an unprecedented landslide election. I mean you're seeing certain signs of enthusiasm on the anti-trump side and a huge shift among democratic voters. The potential to see a return among black voters to 2016 voting or 2012 voting participation amounts which if that all happened you could see a real genuine landslide. It wouldn't necessarily extend that far down the ballot because obviously a lot of it will be about trump specifically rather than the republican party but mitch. Mcconnell is a very hated individual. He could very well get some of that backsplash and you want if that possibility happens. It.

Honestly won't really matter who he's running against so you in terms of you know because they're gonna win either way get somebody there who might be slightly better than the other one and booker looks a lot better than amy mcgrath oh yuck liberated up alberta baby wigs. It build the pipe build the damn pipe where are we going to build the pipe when are we going to get serious in ottawa and start building. The damn pipe I am patio man jesuit patio mall and this is my patio land and I am the god who surveils it all is under my domain from the ikea. Folding chair to the weber 22 22-inch kettle to buy chase wool is michael. Jackson truly canceled he's dead that's exactly that's as cancelled as you get. There is no cancellation that transcends death. I'm afraid. Yes. This is my patio autonomous zone.

Somebody asked he keeps asking about oliver stone's nixon which is an okay movie. It's pretty good but it's not his best. It's got a lot of great performances though although one of them is not really anthony hopkins. I don't think he's very good. I'm not gonna lie and not just because he didn't have a good handle on an american accent which he absolutely does not he sounds. Welsh always same way connery always sounds scottish but a lot of the other performances are great. They really nailed the casting james woods as haldeman. I mean perfect jt walsh as eric um who should correct the chris daughter movie me baby me no. I I will be directing the the stephen paddock movie. Daughter harmony corinne could do a good job soderbergh actually. I think if you read dorner's insane um manifesto where he shouts out like hillary clinton. Joe scarborough gianna michaels that talks about like todd phillips thank you for the hangover films and it's sad that I'm not gonna get to see the hangover three. I think it's gonna be wonderful when you complete the trilogy sir before he goes out to kill a bunch of cops and go down in a blaze of glory when they set fire to the building. He's in that's like that's. It's like a normie just purely snapping and the informant does a good job of that safeties would be good for a daughter movie. Oh yeah safety used to be great for dorner movie. Michael b jordan is gor as as daughter okay even though. I look like ll cool just I'd actually like to see the hughes. Brothers come out of retirement to do a dorner movie. What was the last movie they made. Dead. Presidents is so good also medicine society so yeah. The hughes brothers give them some money and have them do the daughter movie. I don't think john carpenter wants to come back which is cool.

[50:28](https://youtu.be/fMd4PM_3Whc?t=50m28s)

Okay. Somebody asked about dems I bet because I started talking about causality and you know how all action is predetermined and totally protested and unchanging. But you still have free will because you are not aware of the degree to which that is true and so you'll say oh. That's on that show. So. I started to watch it and I gotta say man. I cannot take alex garland. I cannot handle this super ponderous just overly pretentious crisp frosty thing that he does it just rubs me the wrong way. I don't get more pulled in by it. I get more alienated by it and then I find myself looking at my phone and then I'm like. I told myself. I wasn't going to do this anymore so that means I should stop watching it who play the tsarnaevs well. Felix will play a amalgam of both. I don't have the rhoda that's that that's one of the only things that isn't sneezing is one of the only things that isn't a symptom of the corona. I was not a huge annihilation fan either or ex. Machida time to air it.

All out british sci-fi guys and me don't really go too well together. I guess you'd say him and ridley scott can go jump up my butt. 28 days later is okay but he didn't direct it. It would have been worse if he directed it. I could say that honestly I know people love dreadnought with dread is a cult classic and I certainly have to see the appeal. I watched it like two weeks after. I saw the raid and I just like this is this made me wish. I was watching the rain guy fighting his way through one building. It's just. I know. It's not fair to compare them. But I couldn't get it out of my head and so. I can't really judge it outside of that context. Also I want a little bit. I'm sorry.

I want a little bit of build world building can I get a little bit of world building. The whole concept is that it's the near f it's some cyber future where all the the entire world has been sandblasted and the only places left are these little antarctic mega. Cities and then crime is so rampant. Overpopulation is so out of control that they've gotten rid of having even a complete a an actual legal system. One man judge jury and executioner and in the movie that don't really come into it at all because they get locked into the thing the whole time. Like the design of like those modular. Housing complexes was cool but you know give me a little bit of the actual. What's it like in there. What's the deal. It's. It's.

It's supposed to be a far future dystopia. I'd like a little bit more of that. Now the stallone version up because they did the bad thing where you go to see a movie about a guy who's got who's got a job and then half of the movie is them not doing that job because they are been framed for something. I hate that you you want to see the guy be the thing you don't want to see him not be the thing. It's judge red not prisoner dread but anyway at least you got more of a sense of like what what the society was like. I mean it was dumb like the council of judges. Very stupid but I want a little bit of that. I want a little pequito moss of that portfolio. So that's why I can't even really get behind dread even though many people love it spilling all the tea right now spilling the tea all over the place. Like a cherub. I seen csa the confederate states of america movie. It's not great It's very low budget is one of the big problems with it. But it's got some interesting ideas and it's it's relatively well researched all I and also. I don't think it's really plausible that the confederate states would have taken over and imposed slavery in the entire united states It would have been more like in the hairy turtledove books where they become regional superpower rivals and end up fighting in both world wars against each other.

All right guys one more question. I think that I'm going to split thank you guys for talking was a good time somebody asks how to stop behavior loops It's hard it's impossible to tell someone because they have to find out for themselves. What works but the principle of all of them is slow down. I know it's way easier to say than to do but when you learn why for the inside it'll be easier to remember. I don't have an eddie pot. I should get one though they look like fun. All right guys. Somebody asked me if somebody gave me the advice to get a gun. H yeah that's hilarious bye guys.
