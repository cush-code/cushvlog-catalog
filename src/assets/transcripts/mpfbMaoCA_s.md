All right now rest for the wicked money don't grow on trees. I got bills to pay. I got miles to feed. There ain't nothing in this world for free. I can't slow down. I can't hold back. There. You know I wish I could There ain't no rest for the wicked until I close my eyes look good at the media making my mind do. This don't do that got to hear the sign. The sign says we've got the membership God to be inside. Oh. You can't hear me can you hear me can you hear me. She won't say they couldn't hear me okay good and I'm not roboting right now right. The robot's on sound is gone because I think I fixed that somehow I clicked on a thing and it fixed it. I haven't had that problem for a couple of episodes. I'm very happy about that good good good hello everyone I know it's been a while I've been out of town sort of took a break honestly. I was feeling a little gassed so it's nice to do a recharge. Talk a little bit about the rest of the three body problem.

Although honestly I don't know the book did not really impress me that much I gotta say a lot of it goes down which is just the pros I get it. It's not an English language book and it's been translated and it's a different context. But it's honestly. Some parts are slug to get through and the ideas are interesting. I'll probably read all the books because they keep saying that they get crazier as they go on. So. I'm going to read the rest of them but the first one it really did just seem like more set up than anything so just to recap When we last talked about it.

They set up the situation where China since the cultural revolution was looking for sending out signals to aliens and they actually got a response and then this lady who basically had been traumatized by the cultural revolution and said you humans we're gonna tell these aliens to come and kill all of us and now there's now the current day. There's a secret society of people who've been in contact with this alien civilization who planned to come to Earth. It's going to take them 400 years to get here and they're going to wipe us out and take over because they live I planet that is captured by a solar situation where instead of being in a stable relationship to one Celestial body. Like Earth they are trapped between three stuns three stars and then there and as such are captured by the three body problem which is that when you get two celestial bodies in a relationship with one another they have a very predictable paths But if you add a third one it becomes impossible to predict there's no Rhythm to it. It's just it's essential Randomness and so that means that this these poor aliens in this poor. Society have gone through hundreds and hundreds of civilizations get getting to a points of of development and then just being destroyed because eventually the sun just shows up and Cooks everything or pulls the pulls. The planet apart and somehow though and this is really the thing that strains credulity the credulity. The most they are at the time that they're in contact with Earth. They're an advanced civilization that has somehow been able to build on all of those previous civilizations and is in the lookout for a new home since they are waiting eventually for that situation to degrade and then get absorbed by one of these flailing Suns and is it.

Pennywaffe and Weiss are doing it oh hell yes those guys well. At least this will be a contained narrative right like they don't have to worry about having to go beyond what the author is written so and we know that that was the real problem because as much as those last seasons are dog. When they were here adhering to the the books I can't say that I didn't enjoy them and it the the whole book basically just sets up this situation and then it ends so. I've got to read the next one now which I am I just started it. When I finish it. I'll talk about it maybe but for now I'm not that interested and it is yeah. It's a little. It's a little hard to get through the pros. I gotta say so far though like in terms of interesting ideas the the stuff in the three body problem. A big point that seems to be made is that you cannot assume that there will be any continuity between Human Experience and the experience of a different conscious life form that would emerge out of different scenarios. And I gotta say the the premise of oh aliens would just treat us like bugs. It's kind of undermined by the fact that they're in direct contact with humans because you say oh to to us. They would appear like bugs but we don't talk to bugs. We don't write letters to bugs saying you're bugs like the fact that we can't communicate with. Animals is one of the things that makes us able to differentiate ourselves and imagine ourselves in a superior position. The whole point here is that they're in constant human conflict or contact. So I don't know doesn't seem like you could really sustain that but I don't know we'll see. It's very.

I gotta say it's interesting that the time scales they went with went with in this because by the end of the first book humankind is now aware that okay there's this Alien Invasion Fleet and it's coming and it's going to be here in 450 years that is kind of an interesting question of like how do you deal with that. But I don't know as an American. It seems weird because like how many Americans think there's going to be anybody around for the aliens to kill in 450 years like like. We don't even have enough investment in the Earth as a continuing concern regardless of where we are on the political Spectrum. We all have our different eschatological fantasies. Our different ideas of why it's all going to fall apart wokeness run amok for example being one of the genius theories. But there is a certain certainly a conviction that transcends partisanship that says we are we're not going to make it to 400 years. There's one cool part spoiler alert for anyone who hasn't read it that's sort of a ghost ship type deal where they use microfibers to just chop a boat in half and kill everybody on it. That's pretty cool and I can imagine that being cool in a in a in an adaptation of a live action version. So I will keep reading it and I'll keep people abreast. But I haven't really found much to sink my teeth into in that first one I have to say but mostly just want to say hello hi. I hope people are re watching I hope that people are listening to Hell on Earth. It's finally out I think it's going pretty well.

I actually listened to it I never was able to bring myself to listen to the hell of presidents because I just I sound so stupid to myself. I listen to myself and I'm like shut the up make a point. I get. It's different. If you haven't heard it. You know but like for me. I can't handle my my extemporaneous speech. But in this one of it we since we wrote it. I've actually been able to to bring myself to listen to it. And I gotta say I think we did okay. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out so far. I mean it doesn't help that I have a very unpleasant voice. You know just this incredible nasal Hawk. It's about. It's helped that Chris is there with his mellifluous sonorous voice me ah oh thank you. It is wild that I became a professional broadcaster with my voice wouldn't have made it on Radio Days.

That's for sure there's not enough margraves sorry. We'll try to find some more Mar Graves for you in the future episodes. It's just a marquee. It's just a German. It's the German spelling and pronunciation of the Marquee which is also a in French and English nobility March. That's marcher you're on the border. He is like hey we gotta we gotta secure this area for the Welsh or the poles and you secure it for us and you get the feudal rights over the area. Yes the Marquis the Marcus of Queensborough people are asking about video games and I gotta say I just have a hard time. I have a hard time with it. You can't do it rank the states of the Holy Roman Empire okay that's interesting well. Bohemia has probably got to be number one just because it's a kingdom. It's the only Kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire so that makes it I mean that's just pimpish right there. I mean Bavaria is cool of course. You got the beer drinking and whatnot. But they didn't even get an electoral title until after the 30 years they didn't give you even get a a electoral vote until after the war lame pathetic if you can't vote for the emperor what are you even doing well. The Bohemians went back to being Catholic because they got too cocky. It's really they have no one else to blame but themselves. They started the entire thing by throwing those dudes out the window and it got them having even their little precious Ultra Quest Church taken from them getting cocky with it.

George Santos would not be a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. He would be a guy who borrows a bunch of money to start an army and then just like leaves with the strong box and then lets them all Riot and mutiny which happened a lot. He could definitely be a bishop that was a great job for a complete scam artist so somebody says and I've thought about this actually. Why is there so little media set in the early modern era and I do think it's because it is this weird dog's breakfast and liminal space between modern concepts of society and organization and and Military conflict and the medieval feudal era like you've got like battles in during the the 30 Years War. For example guys showed up with suits of armor and like maces and stuff and also there's a bunch of guys with guns. That's it's it's it hits the eye wrong. It's it's for an audience that is not able. It doesn't know about you know this period. It just feels like a bunch of anachronism smashing into one another people much prefer hi. If they're gonna do that era. They want to do high Middle Ages not Knights all that yeah. Something this is perfect something you either want Braveheart or the Patriot. You don't want both and that's error really is both. It's got both that it's got all that stuff at once ah yeah like stuff that happens during early modern is almost all like about 

It's Shakespeare or like Elizabethan Court drama. That's about it and there you know that could realistically be any time because it's still a bunch of people in absurd outfits sitting around oh somebody's asking about Catherine Medici. We kind of sped over it because the French Wars are religion as we said on the show could be its own series and it's very very Game of Thrones. It's got all your. Gambo twists and turns that you'd want oh tons of red wedding style situations but as a result you know you kind of have to glance over it suffice to say that she was the Regent for her sons and they were all kids or dopes and and she was basically running the show until towards the end when her son Henry III actually did assert himself and then got assassinated for his trouble so maybe you should have listened to Mom the idea of a guys in Knights a suit of armor charging up to an infantry formation shooting a pistol and riding away that was one of the Innovations of the Dutch. It was it was a technique where you would have a line of Horsemen just go up right up to the the opposing infantry fire their pistol and run what run then ride back in like a like a like a hook formation. The Caracol.

That's it yeah we are going to have guests. We're going to have a supplementary appendix series of interviews when we're done to kind of fill in some of the blanks like we're going to have Patrick Wyman is going to be on to talk Finance to talk the the the economic Revolution and we'll have a few more we haven't lined everybody up else yet. But it'll be good because and we're going to have Eleanor janega on to talk about like daily life which we don't really get to on the show. You know like how it was to actually live during this period um and then we got a few more so. I'm happy about that because even as I'm enjoying listening to it. I note where we miss stuff I know where like we've but you know if we're gonna have a thing that holds together as a narrative. It's going to have to. This is going to be mostly a project of kicking things out and maintaining sort of a streamlined shape. But these the interviews will give us a chance to for things that people have more questions about address them and then we hope to do a bonus episode at the end of the whole thing that will be a question and answer. We'll solicit questions for people who have specific clarifications. I don't know if hell of presidents will ever be put on patreon. I do know that if you go to a certain website where you can watch videos and you put it in.

There you might find it. It is wild how few movies there are about this period. Someone's asking there's this movie The Last Valley with Michael Caine that is pretty bad. If anyone's ever seen it. It's got a few moments. It's generally though kind of embarrassing especially Michael Kane's German accent which is one of like two times in his entire career. He tried to do anything other than sound Cockney but there's stuff. During the period but not that event really you know it's very interesting that way. This this this this convulsion you know that took over half the continent never really became a in America certainly but like even I mean I'm wondering are there German films I gotta assume that Germans made some movies about it but I've never seen one yes PornHub. That's the website I'm referring to yeah Germans get slept on I mean it really is The Crucible for much of modernity there and 30 years wars and its result and its consequences are really a big part of the reason that Germany ends up not being the place where modernity is fully baked.

There is a Martin Luther movie I've never seen it though starring Joseph fines as Martin. Luther it's just called Luther I haven't I haven't heard anything good about it. But it does exist wait a minute. There's a TV oh. Okay I was confused. Yes. The Idris Elba show that's not actually about Luther hilarious.

[21:27](https://youtu.be/mpfbMaoCA_s?t=21m27s)

The only movie I know of that's really about that really does a good job of dealing with the mercenary. Warfare not of this period but the generalized like mercenary. Warfare of of of the era and going earlier is Paul verhoven's flesh and blood if anyone has seen that that's about Rutger Howard plays a mercenary captain in the Italian Wars who's like moving around his his loyalties and one of the things that made the Italian War so horribly. Wasteful is that there were plenty of opportunities for one side or another to gain something like a victory that were thwarted by the fact that it was not in the interest of any of these mercenary captains who were known as condateri which is Italian for contractors to end the war and it was also not in their interest to risk the armies that they had put together in open battle so they would just sort of dick around and to spoil the countryside for long periods of time and that is one of the real downfalls of the city. The Italian city-state model which otherwise F did a lot to build Economic Institutions that were incredibly precocious for the period but they also ended up having to rely on foreign military contractors and mercenaries because they're you know base. Population was all busy making money so then the big boys came down and just fought over it for 100 years and all that energy moves up.

The Rhine star forts are cool. It's true if you've ever been to a place. That's got them they're pretty. Neat you got that angled Bastion. That's right.

There is this Spanish movie called captain alistari. That's there's also is there a battle. It's about recoil right which is a ROK Roy rather sorry. The Battle of Rick Roy was between the French and Spanish and is sort of considered the The Last Stand of the tercio. The Spanish tercio formation before it had to be phased out ooh. What country would I want to live in during the 30 Years War well. The easy answer is the United provinces because the 30 years war is happening at the exact same time as the Dutch Golden Age. They're technically fighting a war for their survival with Spain but the lines of that battle are well away from Amsterdam. For example they spend the entire War making money the the Tulip Mania that is famously considered you know. The first modern speculative bubble occurs during the 30 Years War. That's how tulips instead of have to worry about an army coming in and to spoiling the countryside and making them all starve for the winter because that's technically a place that's involved in the war. But it has very little danger of involving any of the actual fighting. Yes.

The Calvinism is a bummer but even there you have you know other stuff happening because one of the things that Calvinism does is that it creates this space between church and state by necessity because you know they're they're. The the the congregations are jealously guarding their control over church discipline which means the state ends up becoming alienated to an agree. That's why you get even at the time you got all these psycho Calvinists. The Netherlands also becomes known for this hot as a place where religious non-conformity is allowed in fact that's one of the big reasons that the pilgrims many of whom went to the Netherlands to escape oppression by at the Anglican Church end up coming to the new world not because they were being oppressed in the Netherlands but rather that it was too permissive in the Netherlands and yeah. They got Spinoza there imagine chiefing loud with Spinoza do I wish if I could dress up as a fancy little Doppel cylinder with a cool archivist and a big feathered hat.

I think that's obvious yes. In fact I wore the feathered hat and the neck ruffle to the live show. We did in New York where we recorded a supplementary bonus prequel episode that we will be releasing where would I least like to live oh well obviously Germany But I don't but not all of Germany got hit as bad. I'd say Bavaria would be where I would like to avoid the area between Bavaria and Bohemia that like kind of South Central Area no thank you that was just getting rid back and forth over and over again. Elsace also just constant armies tromping back and forth also the um the Virginia colony would be no fun. New England was actually thriving during this period and it was one of the few places where Europeans were doing better than average and we're having like eating more than they they would have been otherwise. But Virginia at that point was was together until the second half of the century.

Oh man there's so many people who we don't get to to mention in this series that I think should be shouted out I I'm always listening and being like damn it we should have talked about that person. Let me think of some though I always assume the croaton thing was just that they they left they're like. This and they went off with some Indians. You look at the Dutch and they definitely being the first has definitely paid off for them. Like they got to hand off their hegemony to the English. They took a bit of a haircut in the 19th century. Specifically like they there was a decline in living standards but not anything like super dramatic and then in the 20th century they got all those Colonial superpowers. Yes they got occupied by the Germans but you know World War II. Everybody had to take it on the chain in Europe at that point but ever since they have been they've been Cruising and it seems like they're not racked as much with the misery of having lost an Empire. The way the English are probably because it happened so much longer ago but it does seem like the British who did get off relatively. Cleanly are in the process of destroying themselves out of this perverse sadomasochistic rage at having lost their Primacy in world affairs yeah. Like they they have another they had Indonesia. They did all kinds of Colonial crimes over there and now and also thanks to their engineering genius. Even though they're below sea level. They don't really have to worry about climate change because if anybody's going to figure out a way to not get swallowed by the ocean it's going to be the Dutch yeah. They've got right wing anti-immigrant sentiment sure of course. Everyone does now that's that's that's unavoidable but they're also not like self-consciously disassembling their state. The way that the English are yeah the Dutch fire. The Dutch farmers are rebelling to save their right to do farming or whatever the hell I don't know the Dutch did kick our ass in the in the World Cup.

[33:22](https://youtu.be/mpfbMaoCA_s?t=33m22s)

It's true trying to think of somebody I missed how'd they get so tall is a very good question. They are the tallest people on earth. I believe the average height. The average height of this might be wrong look it up because I know a lot of in my head that isn't true. There's a lot of stuff. I know that is incorrect. I think the average Dutch I'm going to look it up before I even say it so I don't want to sound like an idiot average. Dutch height well thank you for giving to me in centimeters. I don't know what the that means okay yes six one six one. The average height of a Dutch man is six foot one that is insane and I've been there and I've seen it. It's wild as a as a tall person I get used to being the tallest person in a room and when I'm and I see people who aren't even though I don't want to. I get this like reflexive kind of like ah and I kind of like stand up straighter. It's it's I'm nothing I'm proud of. But it's definitely a real thing and I would just be like you know in a bar or something and just look at these. These treat just giant blonde guys I guess yeah I guess all the short Dutch people who got drowned by the by the by the levees and the dikes and stuff yeah.

I guess they've been eating calcium or I guess. They've been eating protein longer than anybody. Oh this is a very interesting question what's the stupidest accent. I obviously it doesn't mean when I think of that it doesn't mean like actually stupid like indicative of stupidity. I'm just saying for my. I'm thinking of it as subjectively when I hear someone talking that way. The more I assume they're stupid and the more dissonance. It is when they say something that isn't stupid and somebody yelled Long Island and that might be number one. It's certainly High the Long Island accent is just it's very hard to imagine anyone sounding like that and who's not a. I actually think like that weird Mid-Atlantic like Baltimore Pittsburgh Philadelphia thing with the with the small mouth you know. I think that's cute I don't think that's dumb Boston is not a stupid accent. It is a but again that's just media stereotypes like people say the South and some Southern Accents. Obviously you know they talk slow.

But I don't know there's something about Long Island. It's like it's like a conscious willed in ignorance of course not true. But it's my It's my own. Prejudice I mean the accent of my people. I think is pretty stupid sounding like The northern northern Midwest accent I mean Fargo for example like those people don't sound that smart yeah. That's that's a good point that the the Wisconsin Minnesota accent is. The opposite of the Boston accent in that you assume the person is at least superficially nice and I would say that like Midwest nice is real. But it's of course not authentic. Because nothing is it you know everyone's everyone's performance of self. Is is some degree self-conscious and and being triangulated between the people that you know and your expectations. But I do feel like Midwestern niceness is a weapon that is pointed inward at this. If the person who is being nice as opposed for example to Southern niceness which is a weapon pointed outward at the person who is being wielded at I mean the California accent is pretty.

Dumb I mean California speak with the the up talk and everything is associated in many with with all of the cliches of vapidity and empty-headedness of a Chicago accent oh my God. We love that one freaking Chicago I'm gonna have some Polish sausage watch. The Bears game Chicago really is New York if they'd gotten Pollocks instead of Jews. Yeah alaskans do sound like they're from the Upper Midwest. It's just something about the latitude I don't know oh. No somebody asked what the best accent you can do. I am the worst judge because I think I do a few accidents very well and many people tell me insist to me that I do them very terribly so I I give up. I I have no I have no faith in my own work anymore. The Pacific Northwest is the place where there really isn't an accent because it's the last place people white people anyway showed up. That's the last place that you have like a real concentration of people. So it is everyone's from everywhere else and so it flattens out. And it's it's concomitant with mass media.

Oh man so the old-timey Mid-Atlantic accent my one of my favorite accents of all time. It was not a native accent. It was not an accent that existed anywhere. It was an accent that was taught to actors and broadcasters. It was considered a classy way to speak if you were going to be on the radio for example and so that accent from early movies and and radio stuff. That is the thing that they made up because they're like people are going to be hearing this and we don't want to sound like yokels so they they thought this thing up that's kind of English but isn't and became a accent that people got in the media but that no one in their day-to-day lives actually spoke. It's not really British though is the thing that's why it is the Transatlantic accent because it's not quite British because it does not resemble specifically any actual existing British accents. Maybe Katherine Hepburn she might have been the only native speaker of of transatlantic English. There's probably a few pockets of Connecticut where people people were able to put that together now see yeah pasta good evening Mr Mrs America and all our ships at Sea well gonna press. This is interesting. Someone is saying that Australian news people have a fake accent and I can believe that because if there's any group of people that are probably collectively embarrassed of the way they talk it's got to be Australians right because if you want to talk an accent that kind of makes you sound dumb right here we are good evening welcome news crocodile got Liz.

He's running Rampage and all over the place Aaron. There the way they say no is so funny Nair foreign. There was a comedian. I think his name was Sean Cullen that I used to watch when I was absorbing Comedy Central bits instead of a personality as a teenager who had a good joke where he pointed out that there's no Australian Bond villain because you couldn't take him seriously. James Bond gonna kill you right now. It's gonna happen you're gonna die No One Believes that I do hope we get to tour Australia at some point and just do their dumb voices at them until they have a riot oh.

[43:51](https://youtu.be/mpfbMaoCA_s?t=43m51s)

Crayon. I say crayon many people who I grew up around say crane that's like one thing or crayon. Rather. A lot of people say crayon. I say crayon I always said crayon. It's always a crayon but I'm weird. I say February. I say the r in February the second r Wait a minute the first star no I see. This is very interesting. Someone says do you say pop. No. I say I said soda and this is a weird quirk in Wisconsin. I don't know if anybody else could back me up here if they're from there but the counties next to Lake Michigan up and down because I'm not from Milwaukee. I'm from like an hour north of Milwaukee. But I'm on the water. The counties next to Lake Michigan I don't know about Door County but like up until like the the middle of the of the state say soda but as soon as you get Inland like the rest of the Midwest and everyone everything like to the Pacific Ocean they say pop very weird. I used to think it was a Catholic Lutheran thing. But now I have no idea.

He do that did Sean Cullen do the bit about REM singing the bond song yes and also Dylan yeah. It was a great bit. I do have to say I'm biased because I grew up saying soda but pop sounds dumb to me you sound like a child okay. I don't think I say bagel weird though that's right. I say it normal right. I don't even know how the what the Wisconsin Bagel is because that's I just I just said Bagel normal right Bagel that seems see that comes that's not intuitive at all to me. I feel like I should I grew up there. But I don't say bagel. I say bagel or bagel bagel. Oh God damn it now. I'm in my head. How do I say it bagel. I'm gonna get some bagels. Now. I don't know how I say it bag yeah. I'm saying it weird. Now I don't even know how to how those how how to say it anymore about I'm saying bagel Bagel right bagel. There. It is that's how I say it and that's normal right bagel okay good. I knew it. I knew I said it normal you guys got my head. I say it normal. It's a bagel off never calling it a bagel.

That's not that's not how I roll we did call water fountains bubblers. Apparently. Wisconsin and Western Massachusetts are the only places that do that and it's because of a company that had a certain branded water founder that was found in the region. Also the only places in the U.S that have Cranberry Bogs oh Rhode Island. Also oh yeah well that makes sense Australia's call calling them bubblers too and we're going to drink a bubble gonna go get a try and get the bubbler yeah right gonna go down to the gonna get. They haven't drank David that's content right there just saying bubbler over and over again. In an Australian accent oh. It was always a cockpot. A crock pot. I don't know what the out of here. It's a goddamn crock pot the weirdest one though and I honestly don't know if this was just my hometown.

But we called sloppy joes were called. Hot Tamales yeah. We're talking white people. Right now this is we're real white people hours right now thicker. It's the clicker. The remote is the clicker. Also they were called tennis shoes not sneakers yeah. The hot dish thing is more Minnesota. I never heard anybody talking about hot dish. I certainly heard about people cooking in a crock pot. Though what did we call immigrants buddy. You don't want to know the only minorities in my hometown. Growing up were among refugees from the Vietnam War and it's amazing they had every single stereotype associated with black people or Latin American immigrants elsewhere one of the things that really taught me early on that it was mostly because it's like this is a coincidence. All these people from all these different parts of the world all have the exact same cultural Character defects cracks. It's a crack not a creek most chapels mostly Midwest except for will who's the fancy. Upper West Side New York boy but everybody else is from some Midwestern State. How do I pronounce beer. That's not a weird one. It's beer how else you say beer melk who says milk I guess I've heard. Some people say milk.

But I don't say milk. I say milk and yes crayfish not crawfish foreign that thing with the unnecessary R is very interesting Washington where specifically is that because I don't even know if it really corresponds to a specific geographic area as it's like more idiosyncratic. I don't do that I'm normal I don't add an R okay so it is just more weirdos to like individually do it rather than a reproduced Regional accent. Texas apparently interesting they say washed in Texas and Iowa too see. This is all over the place I know that Pittsburgh pittsburghers say my car needs washed which honestly just sounds like you've had a head injury like you should go to the doctor if you say something like that they should give you. An MRI Pittsburgh is one of the funnest accents definitely go downtown. Gotta say the Pittsburgh Steelers play downtown the fact that they say jag off delightful the app the Paris of Appalachia. See I can't do it fine whatever off I do feel like jagoff should be more universally applied that should get out of the Pittsburgh ghetto and become nationalized is jabroni really a Pittsburgh thing interesting.

[53:34](https://youtu.be/mpfbMaoCA_s?t=53m34s)

I didn't know that somebody asked an interesting question what if the British what if the US had never revolted against England and the fact is it's just that's going to happen at some point and the thing that's going to make it happen. Inevitably. It's not slavery. Like the 16 19 people say it's not taxes and and T duties like the the history book say the like the elementary school like the high school history is. It's the proclamation of 1763. That guarantees some sort of conflict between the colonists in England because it put the colonial interests in expansion and direct conflict with England's presiding National interest in restraining migration and restraining westward expansion of of colonists that was certainly the thing that pissed off George Washington. The most whose entire career was based on land speculation and required that that's Frontier to continue going out if he was going to keep making that money but there but for the English like it was a cost benefit analysis that told them it. It is too expensive for us to Garrison. This Frontier when especially since we're not going to be getting the majority of the the output. Here like this isn't going to be coming to to England so they had they had a very vested interest in restraining Westward Expansion and Westward Expansion would not be restrained and I do think that that is one of the signal problems of the 1619 project is in order to make their case. They have this incredibly spacious argument that it was English pressure and threats to end slavery that led to the American Revolution and that is you're literally reversing time there to try to take later a later emancipatory push which only makes sense in the context of Napoleonic Wars anyway and applying it to an Era when it has nothing to do when it is not anybody anything. Anybody's on the talking anybody has on the table like ending slavery for the English was part of their geostrategic great game with France.

This is something that CLR James talks a lot about in the black Jacobins and they were able to replace enslaved labor in their colonies with indentured labor from India at that point which they would not have been able to do during the American revolutionary era. But they did have a vested interest in restraining Colonial immigration Westward and it would not be restraint none of the forces. None of the burgeoning concentrations of capital in America would have seen that happen right exactly the U.S pivoted to India after they lost the colonies like that entire thing is predicated the entire turn against slavery is predicated on them losing the colonies in the first place. I have not read the Dominion of the draca books. But I did like one time find out about them and I like through clicking on Wikipedia and I did like read the lore and I was intrigued by the idea very nerdy old history stuff where South Africa becomes like turbo Nazi Germany because it gets all of the defeated royalists from World War from the American Revolution and on the defeated Confederates after the Civil War and just becomes like this. Self-conscious white murder state that becomes super highly technologically advanced and then beats both the Nazis and the Allies in World War II. But of course what that is silly because those white states that we actually got were pretty lame and got their asses kicked. Relatively. Easily is there a single good movie about John Brown not to my knowledge. I mean there aren't that many either the road to Santa Fe with Van Heflin and Ronald Reagan as I believe he plays Custer in that movie the Ethan Hawke one was bad. I will say it I know some people liked it. I found it pretty shitty myself yeah exactly if there's a good John Brown movie. It's just Avatar.

Isn't it weird that we all learned about Peter stuyvesant's in elementary school or maybe Junior High I thought about this because we mentioned him a little bit on the on the on the hell on Earth. Why why so do we not all learn this because to me this was. This was a guy who was always in every every single American history textbook he had a peg leg. He was the Dutch Colonial governor of New Amsterdam who turned over the the colony to the English. It surrendered to them basically you guys didn't hear Peter Stuyvesant I wonder. If this is a generational stuff thing and Peter Stuyvesant is a guy who's just like in the curriculum up through like the middle of the 20th century and so anybody who went to a public school specific certainly up until like 1990 got Peter Stuyvesant or 95 or something and that now in the 21st century they've like streamlined the the curriculum and they got rid of him and I understand why because it's weird that we it's very weird that he is a guy that they gotta tell you about or apparently they didn't. They did not tell you guys about Peter Stuyvesant. This is blowing my mind I just I have just a distinct memory of in my like sixth grade history textbook this painting of Peter Stuyvesant in a room like look looking angry while the Duke of York's flotillas is in the window behind him. Nobody learned about Peter Stuyvesant wow he was a cranky old. He also right before the British came and took New Amsterdam from him.

He went down to Delaware and squashed and took the the Swedish colony. I am the swedes had a colony Delaware and they filled it with fins because the fins Finland was like a Outpost of the the nascent Swedish Empire there in the Baltic and the there are these like Forest dwelling fins and they were basically like pagans like they lived by with themselves and so the swedes decide hey. These guys are perfect. We'll send them to the new world to like clear the land. They're. They're Woods people so they sense. They send these fins to to New Sweden and it's almost as soon as they make contact with the local Native Americans they just joined them. They're just like oh you guys like trees too cool and then they just hang out but yeah you can thank You can thank the swedes for why Delaware exists. You can thank the swedes for Joe Biden and High credit card. Interest rates unregulated insurance industry tax haven oh and Elon Musk buying Twitter. All of that you could blame on the swedes.

Chancery Court yes if Delaware didn't exist it would have to be created. It would probably be Rhode Island because it's like it's not. The only tiny state that could leverage you know its regulatory capacity as a value add in the market foreign of America. Now that's accurate Delaware really has been floating on that first state thing for a long time kind of embarrassing you signed the Constitution first congratulations. It's funny to the the two tiny states are both notable in constitutional history. Delaware First State signed it first Rhode Island refused to sign it and they kind of had to be forced to sign. It and other states started yelling at in their print media yelling at Rhode Island for not signing the damn thing. In fact they started calling it Rogues Island because they wouldn't sign the Constitution and part of that is because Rhode Island was the most Simon pure Federalist stronghold the one most hostile to to any sort of democratic governance really and that lasted for a long time. In fact it got so bad that there was eventually an armed rebellion in Rhode Island by a guy named John door known as the door war or doors Rebellion I'm sorry Thomas door 

Like these guys they were they were trying to expand the franchise and the existing government wouldn't do it. So they rolled a Cannon up to the State House. Yes the door Ward d-o-r-r not ER the Jimmy door War. They need to be embarrassed though about those New York System hot dogs I gotta say I was very excited about the New York System hot dog when I heard about it just from the name. Then I had one and I was like this is This is only okay yeah.

East Coast has small states because of when they were founded. They were founded by small groups of colonists who could settle x amount of territory on behalf of why company with X Charter and then as capacity is built. The amount of land that gets divvied up and the amount of settlers who are coming in to take that land is balloons. Feels like Rhode Island should have more Seafood based foods like that are notable and unique. I can't what do. They have they should have like more like they should have their own type of chowder. Does Rhode Island have a chowder fried clams you fry a clam wow amazing I mean Maryland's got the blue crabs so they have that most Seafood no special Seafoods. What the should have said Rhode Island clam chowder most useless State. That's a tough one I when I think of like just garbage States. Indiana always comes to the top of my mind Indiana called The Crossroads of America because it's a place you go through to get somewhere more interesting Delaware. I mean the thing is Delaware is generally useful. You know two of the most evil people on earth. Arizona's got the Grand Canyon come on have you seen the Grand Canyon.

It really is pretty. Amazing somebody asked the worst Regional Cuisine though and I'm thinking about that I mean the Midwest is going to be up there just because of how heavy it all. It is without like the I mean like Southern and Midwestern food will kill you you know. It's all like a lot of meat and starch but southern food. I don't know there's there's more spice. There's more flavor you know I got all the different Regional barbecues and stuff soul food whereas the Midwest it's like. It's just like German. It's transported German food and just casseroles and yeah. The Pacific Northwest doesn't have an accent doesn't have a Cuisine for the same reason.

Ooh Oklahoma ooh Oklahoma is one of like four states I've not been to and that should say something I've I've been I've been as Johnny Cash said everywhere I've at least like spent time in I think like 40 46 47 States. The only states that I've not like even put a foot in are Oklahoma Nebraska. I think South Carolina and Vermont. Those are the four on the continent. Those freak States they don't count I guess yeah. Salmon the Pacific Northwest would be salmon for now see how much longer that lasts I know I feel like I want to go to Vermont. We were in New Hampshire for the primary and I kind of wanted to go to Vermont just while I was there. But I didn't have a chance. I mean now that I've seen Tulsa King. Though I feel like I want to pilgrimage to see the place where Dwight the general man Freddy and his troops went to war with black McAdam Vermont is an interesting State just demographically um like. It's. It's poorer than New Hampshire and more left-wing even though poorer whites tend to be reactionary in their politics. It's not true in Vermont maybe just because there's just white people. There. I don't know but it's a fascinating area.

What do you think about modern disability politics. Back wow I'll end on that one foreign I won't say too much. I don't want to. I don't wanna. I mean anybody who listens to this understands I'm not going to get canceled. I just don't want to insult people but I do think that a lot of disability politics is people. Desperately Seeking a subaltern status and I say that as somebody who is I'm sorry way more disabled than many of the people who I see make it the fulcrum of their political identity and you know like they they pitch it as like well. I have to be the defender you know because of how of the of the of the trauma that my life has been trying to be different disabled in this country. It's like ah not really not really and you can't argue that you're part of a community because due to the incredible variety of what it counts to be disabled I mean by God. By certain definitions you could say everybody is. Don't feel like I'm part of some community and yeah. It's like it does feel like. It's an online phenomenon more than any expression of the real experience of people like yeah. Obviously you know capitalism is at war with anybody who is not able to fit as a cog within it. That's true yes read caliban the Witch and all that but as with most things the way to fight that is to fight capitalism and trying to play gotcha with people for being discriminating to discriminating against your disability of whichever one you have is. It's a recipe for the opposite of that. It's really just a way for you to be the center of attention and for you to have a cudgel against other people. I just remember finding out that like well a a somebody who is like a big time disability rights. Person had type 1 diabetes and I just thought that was funny.

I didn't know there's no emotes foreign only thinks of their disability when forced to by these people trying to turn it into identity in a way that I mean identity politics. Themselves of all stripes are dead end including white ones which like people say I hate identity politics and then are Republicans. It's like the Republican party is just a giant ID Paul Factory. You morons. It's the question of what the identity is you get an option you get a pick But I have never felt that it is a fruitful way to think of myself and to relate to the world around me.

I remember I was in. Was a freshman in college and I had a cane. At that point. I had gotten out of my wheelchair that summer and I had like progressed from braces and crutches to one brace and one crutch to no braces and a cane and I got rid of the cane by the end of my first semester. But then that first semester I went. I had a cane and I was in a class which was down a hill and I had to walk up and down to the hill. I never complained to anybody about. It didn't occur to me. And I went to a class and at the end of it the professor stopped me as I was leaving and said I want to apologize and I was like oh for what and he says well earlier. In the in his lecture. He'd he'd made a reference to someone stumbling around and he thought that he after he said it. He realized oh you know this guy with the cane he might he might be triggered by that and I it had not even I mean it had not even crossed my mind as he had said it like it had not registered to me did not related to me.

There's not been an instinctive reaction to me and I feel like that is where we are now everyone is and they're not doing it on purpose. There's nothing else to do so focused on ourselves as as the only point of meaning in the world that we're compelled to relate everything to ourselves and that means makes all communication and interaction a minefield so yeah you got me you got me to go off there at the end thank you very much but then again. Maybe I'm just an Uncle Tom of disabled people maybe maybe I'm I'm the Candace Owen of disabled people all right. So. I'll try to get back in the Rhythm and do this next week. Maybe I'll have finished the Dark Forest by then maybe not but we'll talk about something. I'll figure something out bye-bye.
