Um oh there we are oh my god. I'm on. I love it when it works oh. I do not want to turn on notifications good lord that sounds terrible why is it now saying. I'm not on there anymore. I was on there no not on there what the what why what oh there. I am there I am folks I'm indoors because the great storm has come the storm is coming. Q is right oh my god. The storm is here it's storming out. This is the storm that they spoke of and now we're having it storming it up old stormy daniels ah yeah. I'm honestly shocked I kind of thought that new york's days of accumulating snow before march were over got to walk through it. As it started really gave me um old old homesick vibes of wisconsin freezing my ass off walking home from school nice. We will be talking later in the episode stream whatever the hell you want to call this moment in time about the first three chapters of 

This here book the republic for which it stands by richard white but I wanted to give people a chance to show up you know if they've read the book. I don't want to start off because yeah you get more people as time goes on in these things generally so like in about a half an hour. So we'll start talking about the book right now. I wanted to comment on something that I've noticed which is every time barf sacko crumbo comes out with one of his absolutely banal popular culture takes where he's he talks about parasite. Oh. That's a great movie or when he just talked about how well he was writing his awful memoir.

He found solace in better call saul and the boys I mean obviously part of me is very smug about being like aha. Here literally is our prestige tv president talking about how much he loves. These shows think about trump relative comparatively does trump ever talk about an hour-long streaming dramas. No he talks about watching fox news or newsmax or whatever or cnn. He talks about cable news which is basically a reality tv channel like if you take the concept of reality tv seriously as this the elu.

The the destruction of the barrier between you know living in america and watching america cable news which is very little news in it. Obviously it's mostly to be talking. Heads. Emoting about politics is essentially a reality show and all those people yelling like hannity that's just an incredibly long confessional sequence. You know. I can't believe nancy pelosi ate the peanut butter with her finger and put it back in the on the shelf that kind of thing. So again. We see the prestige tv president and the reality tv president and our prestige tv president. He was loves watching the boys and he loves. He loved watching the wire when it was on and one thing. I see a lot is people saying how's obama watching these shows considering all of the anti-corporate anti-capitalist themes in them. How is he watching them. He must not be absorbing them. He's either lying about watching them or he um.

He is not he's not. He's somehow missing the subtext that I am able to absorb and I am here to ask posit. This what about this what about this possibility what if barf sacko crumbo gets exactly everything out of these shows that you do and these movies he sees parasite. He watches the boys he's not coming out with some mutated version in his head. He's getting the same message as you are. It just doesn't matter because this is just entertainment at the end of the day and his position is fixed enough in the world and his value system is fixed enough. Around maintaining you know his his role as a power broker within it that nothing he's going to see is going to change his mind and I think see otherwise smart people. Kind of like instinctively reject the notion that he could be absorbing this art at the level that they are because there is buried in all of our assumptions about artistic consumption that are now completely intertwined with our politics. The way we talk about television and movies specifically is essentially is completely inextricable from politics.

You say it's almost impossible to have a conversation about any any of these products that is not inherently politicized before you even start talking and of course. It's always politicized but I mean explicit politics as opposed to like broader you know ideological underpinnings of work and the pr. The reason you do that. I mean obviously it's because in my cynical view because there isn't a lot of art in this stuff and you've got to fill. Column inches with something you've got to fill the void with something you can't you can't confront with sober sense. The the hollowness of all of this but also is a similar delusion that comes from the resist. The rejection of that reality which is watching the right shows watching the right movies will somehow make you a better person in a fundamental way not just in your outlook. But in your actions it will change you for the better in your day-to-day experience of life and while that is true of great works of art and the individual's response to a great work of art or even an individual's response to a specific piece of You know more attenuated art that has like a specific resonance to them that's the case but it cannot be scaled and that is the fantasy at the heart of all of this political fixation with our with our media is that we assume that there's some extrapolatable and and and compounding social vector towards good or evil that emanates out of a popular film or television series and I am here today to say that there is not there's nothing it doesn't do anything. Our moral choices are are determined by by interests that are far far deeper than any glib. Spoon feeding us if it wasn't spoon feeding us it wouldn't be on television so. I'm sorry. I think I mean I don't I mean.

I think obama is a smart guy. I don't think he would have got where he was if he wasn't unless you believe he was a cia clone from a vat and maybe he clearly was able to apply strategic and tactical insights in the political process that allowed him to defeat to essentially jump the line ahead of a bunch of other people and that required more than just oratorical skill but like he's not a great mind. Obviously. He's very He is. He is happy in his change.

He's happy in the fetters that he has given himself because they excuse him to do whatever he wants. They give him the excuse to pursue power nakedly because well somebody's going to pursue power nakedly and I'm afraid we have to be nibury in our in our understanding that the evils of the world cannot ever be vanquished and that attempting to do so is a greater evil than even those existing evils and so therefore we are left with the question of how to live and therefore if I want to dedicate myself to rising to the top of this this pyramid of violence of monstrosity and oppression by by putting a a smiley fa a diverse face on a neoliberal retrenchment that's going to immiserate everybody and that is going to just continue this driving ratcheting capillary action of human misery. Someone's got to do it it might as well be me. It might as well be the sensitive guy who reads the right books and watches to write shows and watches. The right movies and comes to the right conclusions about them. The ones the same ones that we in the cheap seats come to but they don't he is able to rationalize them. The way we all are every day with. Everything we know to be true but can't deal with because accepting one truth means dis. Inconveniencing ourselves in some significant way and we have to get to a point where that where where that truth has an emotional weight that is anywhere equal anywhere close to the emotional weight of our more embedded personalized preferences.

What we think we want the only way to get there is through I hate to be a broken record but through spirituality through through through the ritualized enchantment of ideas and enchantment of values that can give them a a motivational force that could break away from the this um gravitational pull of self-interest barack. Obama was able to take his self-interest and turn it into a religion that's why he was able to do what he did. But most of us aren't that aren't that skilled or aren't that sociopathic and we have to muddle through being pulled between what we know to be true every moment and what is convenient for us in our personal understandings of our our self-interest and and and it's fighting those things. That's our daily battle and and art is an expression of that conflict but it is not ever going to resolve it for us and it's hard to understand or it's hard to grasp that because it really does render a lot of the time and energy we put into consuming and talking about media and makes it a kind of a a empty and and pathetic waste of time and and since we have no idea of what to fill that void with. We'd rather avoid that that a reality altogether like.

I said that the the prestige tv anti-heroes are sociopaths honestly. I don't think they are because then there wouldn't be a show like the shows. Those shows are about a deeply deeply talented in one way or another and also deeply deeply um selfish person battling with whatever fragmentary echoed half remembered conscience. They might have the thing that makes them unable to just be happy in their consumption but their audience. Their imagined audience that guy. I was talking about the one that they're all subconsciously writing for that upper middle class thriving fixed eyes fixed on self advancement professional who is the ur consumer of this stuff. That's a sociopath that's a person who has fully resolved these conflicts. That's why you wouldn't want to watch a show about them. That's why you wouldn't want to watch a show about obama. A prestige tv show or obama is the protagonist would be absolutely sterile and boring. None of there'd be none of the psychological torment. There wouldn't be any of the any of the strum and drawing and the and the the dark humor that you get with other with shows about people trying to like gesture towards a sense of morality that transcended their personal interest. Barack. Obama makes no and spends no effort doing that spending that spends not a second wondering about that stuff so how would the show be interesting and that is what then that's be and and that's because television like all mass market.

Art is about not only about but is partially about and this is one of the things that attenuates its artistic merit like it's. It's generalized artistic value as an art form is that it's pandering. It's pandering to that audience. It's giving them what they think they want to see because if they didn't want to see it they wouldn't watch it and if they don't watch it. You're not going to get another episode and you're not going to get another renewal and you're not going to get to make another movie and that is a compromise that is deeper even than thought with. With these guys. These show runners who created these programs and so they're flattering them. They're taking that blank-eyed professional psychopath and they're giving them. They're they're flattering them and extending to them the fiction that they have a conscience to struggle with which they don't why wouldn't obama like the boys. I don't understand why it's insane that obama would like the boys like he he like. I have said he doesn't think that he is he has power. He doesn't think that that the president is fundamentally a a job that is about doing things from one's own volition it's about serving a mechanism that is inviolable so he what what why would he why would he be horrified by the boys why would that make him disconfided. I don't hate the boys the boys is fine.

It's not anything to write home about and if it's what prestige tv is now then the what a pretentious gar. I hate using the word pretentious anybody who call who calls art pretentious is just telling on themselves most of the time. But for season four fargo is noah noah hawley the guy who created it showing the fundamental problem with him as a television creator which is that he thinks he's too good for tv remember. This is a guy who has directed a film written directed to film which by the way I watched and sucks wrote a book that I'm not reading television is in his own mind beneath him and that shows throughout all of his work but in season four fargo. It's just it's overpowering yeah prestige. Tv is is is the obama of art.

It's this thing that is all we have like all we have all all liberalism can stand on now now that it can no longer offer anything to anybody materially. Now that now that the the the material pitch of the democratic party that made it the natural ruling party of the united states. For 40 years is gone and all they have left is the ability to push forward on the strength of celebrity on the strength of personality and you might say but what about biden they wanted obama again. They never wanted anything other than obama. The democratic electorate they would have voted him a third term overwhelmingly if it hadn't been for the constitution if he'd been able to come back for like like putin. In this time they would have voted for him overwhelmingly. If michelle obama had run she would have gotten the nomination biden was the closest thing anyone had now buddhist thought. I'm gonna be gay obama but he doesn't actually have the charisma that obama had and his and the fact that he is so clearly trying to ape.

Obama's voice mannerisms means that his ability to to break out of that box is already. It's completely abrogated just by virtue of his his transparent phoniness. So there was no obama to pick what there was was obama's vp. So he would talk about rap rock and people be like oh yeah rap rock what about I wonder what rap rock's doing and you saw they have a poll now. What was what's your pick for 2024 michelle obama number one and then harris number two which is like six degrees of separation the vice president's vice president and that's why the democrats are because they built everything around in 2008.

Like obama gave them this. This thought this hope oh we we can. We can govern during conditions of neoliberal austerity ending over wrenching continuously compounding neoliberal austerity without a material pitch to the voters with this narrative and they I mean and the proof of it was in the pudding in the form of obama winning big and then winning a big re-election which democrats haven't done for a while. I mean even even clinton never won a majority of the vote.

He was under under under 50 percent well under 50 percent. He was at like even in his re-election where he crushed dole. I think he got like 46 percent of the votes. Someone can correct me on that but it was not 50 because both times he was running in three-way races with perot who took you know a decent chunk for the the the best that a third-party candidate has done since like tr was perot in 96 and 92. Maybe wallace 68. I'm not sure. I got to look at it but anyway one either way they really don't have a record of big big. Crushing victories and he got it and then he got reelected even though you know it looked closer than it should have been and even though but while this was happening of course the litany has been said a million times they lost the thousands state legislator seats. They lost like a third of governorships. They lost the house and then the senate and then they tried to run austerity with.

Hillary got killed got to run with biden and a little shine of nostalgia and trump's unique unique uncouthness unique uncouthness to the nation's well-off meant that he could win um like. I remember before the election. I said that the reason I think after the after the first debate. I said I think being's gonna win and the reason he's gonna win is because people are gonna have a choice between four more years of ever cranking political rhetoric or kind of taking the heat off of the kettle for a little bit and I said people are gonna pick that because they're still there's still relative security in this country there's still even with precarity. There is enough security among voting people that that'll carry through and if you look at the electorate you look at the the votes you look how the vote broke down. The most comfortable people shifted to biden from trump because they have a house. They've got maybe a boat maybe maybe a ski do maybe two cars in the garage they can go.

They have some 401k money. They don't want to be in the streets shooting it out with antifa where did trump gain. He gained amongst people who have the least to lose the people who saw the ratcheting up political rhetoric and in the move towards conflict and said sure bring conflict why not. But they have no they're screwed. The democrats are because it was always a fraud. The whole thing was a fraud. It all depended on the specific charisma of barf sacko crumbo which is now thanks to the constitution no longer accessible and there's nobody in the wings. There's nobody who comes close. There's a bunch of off-brand obamas like cory booker who's like a chuck e cheese animatronic on the fritz trying to do obama and then he got fake ass buddhish and then who else there's nobody there's nobody. It's a bunch of fossils who who clogged up the top of the party because they do not want to hand the reins over to anybody who is not fully enthralled by the machine. The way they are and they don't trust anybody else to run the thing and they're all insane megalomaniacs who don't think they can die like every other old. American who's all decided that they're immoral and this is just like prestige tv coming into the and oh. But then lastly so. This is a totally fraudulent and and doomed project but democrats are going to double and triple down because they don't have anything else and so they convince themselves. This is the only way things can be and that actually if you criticize it you're a piece of.

[22:20](https://youtu.be/KbCfQmrk51c?t=22m20s)

Prestige. Tv is essentially the same thing. It filled the void of attention that people had once their attention. Spans have been destroyed by the internet and their ability to put. Any thought or concentration into a difficult work of art was scrubbed away by the daily abuse of like being a a a screen centric human and also working working working more and more and more and having less and less time to devote to anything other than the most brain smoothening of recreational activities and in that but but you know hey if you went to college you know you're supposed to want something more than that you know and there is that yearning we actually have that cannot often be articulated but still drives us in some way and diet pills It's actually the premier form of artistic expression of our time oh good and then they wrote it and they're sticking with it and they'll tell you that you're what like an elitist or some or or somehow racist or problematic for saying that instead of confronting it because they have nothing else there's nothing else because nobody has the energy of your attention to to pursue anything more challenging and even if they wanted to who could talk to them about it and that's nine that's half of it right.

There. At least half maybe more honestly at this point well. More than half is talking about it talking about our artistic consumption and if you don't have other people who have had the same experiences who can you bounce things off of what can you get responses to your hot takes from both in real life and online and so barb sack is our prestige. Tv tel president and prestige tv is our. The barf sack of art is the is that strike in india actually still happening because I thought it was one of because the thing about india is once every once in a while like 250 people will go on strike. But it's like a two-day demonstration that's in conjunction with like a communist state government and like it's not really a strike. I mean how many people who get freaked out who get very excited about indian strikes are aware of that. I wonder. If there's just a lot of semantic confusion. There people get excited because they hear general strike and whenever anything happens politically in india.

The sheer number of people makes your hair stand on because it's hard to conceive of that you know coming from america which you know is hilariously small population wise comparatively but you know it's not. I mean it's i. I'm glad to see modi get any kind of pushback but I know that there are continuing protests by farmers in india biden is the mad tv president that's actually pretty good. We were we've joked on the show before by the way about how one of the good things about biden being president is that they'll bring back mad tv because no one's going to be the the the perpetual outbidding on wokeness and like um a sensitivity to to to prejudice in in media that is define. The trump era is gonna let up because trump's not president anymore and everybody gonna feel a little more relaxed and that we're gonna bring back mad. Tv biden is is is I mean those stories like those corn pop stories and and dog face pony soldier. I mean the whole thing he could be a mad tv character.

Like the man he would be he would have been the president in a mad tv sketch just coming out and talking about you know taking a 57 chevy to the malt shop and then like he crashes through a wall or something come on man isn't that a great catchphrase for a mad tv character all right so let's talk a little bit now about the republic for richard sands which in its first three chapters sketches out the early stages of reconstruction in the south and what richard calls the greater reconstruction that encompassed also the the development of america's western expanse and the first thing we get in the first chapter about president about. About presidential reconstruction is a good hard look at our worst president. Andrew johnson a man who is almost singularly catastrophic in american history.

Because there are very few people you can look at and say almost anyone who could conceivably have been where they were would have been better and then you look at how how how much happenstance and and and total you know random chance went into him getting it. It's it is enough to make you feel like there are other worlds than these and that and that we're in the dark one and that things like that not just that but things like that are the hallmarks of a world where you know even far farther back than that. Some domino fell in the wrong place and and they've been falling wrong ever since and man that feels like one real bad. Domino is andrew johnson being president and reading about the specific his specific mission which he made his presidency about which was to readmit the south as quickly as possible with the maintenance of existing economic structures and political structures and then seeing how much effect that had in terms of undermining the very early stages of reconstruction and the thing is is that you know once. The once congress came back from their hilariously long um recess congress. Back then was basically a part-time job and the congress convened like new congresses convened far.

[29:47](https://youtu.be/KbCfQmrk51c?t=29m47s)

Later like than they do now it was kind of a nightmare honestly and it's one of the reasons they changed it. But even after they got back so you had a period of pure presidential reconstruction until like december of 1865 and then even after congress comes back and then even after congress is comes back even more radically republican after 66 midterms Johnson is able to Do an insane amount of damage and at the most critical time because even once grant gets in we haven't got there yet in the book or or haven't spent much time anyway with the grand administration. But once grant gets in and and is able to carry out you know the more radical reconstruction inc. In collaborate more in collaboration with congress than fighting them They are trying to reconstruct now on a situation that has much less of the fluidity much less of the contingency much less of the potential that existed in april of 1865 because andrew johnson spent four years cheating all over it and it's it really makes me more resolved than ever to really try to pursue this as a project.

This idea of like if lincoln lives because it would not i. I would not want to make lincoln like this world historic savior figure more than anything. I want to make johnson the world historically catastrophic figure that he is because honestly like lincoln is assassinated and hannibal. Hamlin was still his vp. Or or a azeroth had gone through with his mission to kill. Johnson and benjamin wade the radical republican. President pro tem of the senate becomes president. You could still have had a much better outcome of reconstruction. Although I think lincoln is sort of uniquely suited in that moment to you know at that most protein moment to be exercising power but things could have gone better with almost anyone else. There and yeah like it's less about lincoln living than about johnson not getting to be there and to just god oh god breaking up the. The the land grants that sherman had given to friedman and the coastal carolinas. I mean like that could have been the bedrock of a of a the model of a redistributive reconstruction that could have been seized upon by guys like stevens and sumner and wade and lincoln eventually not at first of course like but maybe over time pulled in that direction. By the flow of events um we didn't get that obviously we got instead this and so obviously andrew johnson history's greatest monster and incredibly trumpian like just perfect.

The the way that he would personalize everything hyper paranoid the the fact that he went on a president or to be the vice president and the only difference is he got out of him because he was flying in the face of northern opinion. This is the other part of it is that he was his mission had no constituency in the north and and honestly even in the south. The constituency was pretty busted up because there were a lot of southern ex-confederates who wouldn't even look the gift horse. Johnson was giving them they were looking at in the mouth. They wouldn't even accept his mechanisms because they involved too much too much besmirching of their honor um yeah. He did like they're being very unfair to me but the specific phenomena of johnson. Johnson's presidency which he spent trying to create the constituency for a white supremacist third party that he would be able to head and then run for re-election with is almost precisely what happened the last time a non the the challenger to the democratic party in the 

In the in the second party system. Tried to um create a broad tent to defeat that party which was the whig nomination of john tyler to be william henry harrison's running mate in 1840. One of the most catas the catastrophe that set the stage for all the catastrophes to come on other because honestly that's another point where you can get wacky with the counter. Factuals so and henry clay who is like the the the the the intellectual founder of the whig party the guy and also the political um the biggest political influence on lincoln lincoln loved henry clay. Lincoln thought henry clay was the ideal american politician and he was a wig before he was a republican and his politics were always the weak notion of a um. You know a a yeoman republic that is nurtured and allowed to develop with coordination from central government as opposed to the jacksonian democratic vision of just let everybody get corn liquored up and steal indian land and then that's it there's nothing for the government to do so. Clay essentially founded the weak party and ran a number of times against jackson lost and then in 1840. The whigs had a real good chance because the economy had collapsed during van buren's presidency because the the the the model the the banking model that had replaced the destroyed bank of the united states helped create the panic of 37 which really did discredit the democratic project and discredit the that their whole idea which at that point was the governing ideal of people north and south of voters. North and south leave me alone to have my slaves or to to buy my to develop my land and to to um heat myself with indian scalps. That was that was that was by far the most popular political persuasion at the time and it saw itself come to discredit by the collapse of the economy and by van buren's refusal to do anything about it because they're democrats and they don't do anything about the the economy. That's not the government's job and the whigs really wanted to make sure they didn't.

It up so they didn't nominate clay because he was a loser. They nominated a war guy william henry harrison. Hey war man yay he fought in our colonial wars you idiots like that right. He's one of you and they offered the vice presidency to clay and clay turned it down because he was pissed that they had not gotten him the nomination again even though because it was his party and so then the wigs did a catastrophically stupid thing like. I said that stupid thing that set the stage for all the stupid things to come later and that was they nominated john tyler of south carolina is the vice president because they were one they were trying to appeal as not as the party that was not the majority party of americans. They wanted to appeal to never jackson basically or never van buren but really never jackson because jackson was the trump he was the personality van buren was just riding the wake. Even though he was the mastermind clay was both obviously but um for the wigs but anyway he was a never jackson democrat. He had split with jackson not over internal improvements or in favor of the tariff but the opposite over the nullification crisis over the question of whether or not the south south. Carolina could refuse to carry out. The the refuse to comply with the tariff laws that had been passed by congress and jackson came down hard and said I will hang john c calhoun who was his own vice president from a goddamn lamp post. If these don't stop this and tyler and other southern democrats were horrified by that the guys who ended up becoming the intellectual you know found the intellectual backbone of the secessionist movement. John c calhoun amongst them but also tyler. They said we're horrified by this display of the absolutist power and and we don't like jackson because of his His grasping for power not not because of ideology necessarily but just he is too power seeking and the wigs who call themselves the wigs.

They pick that name because the whigs were the party in parliament in england which was you know the the most close political culture to america's. The ones that americans were most familiar with the whigs were. The party of parliament against the prerogative of the king were the tories because they called him king andrew and they fancied themselves as the defenders of the constitution against the the usurpations of jacksonian democracy and they wanted to get as big a tent for that message as possible and so they said hey john tyler you're horrified by jackson how about you too and they say sure they put him on the ticket and then william henry harrison. Drinks the doo-doo water and dies and instead of henry clay taking power with weak. Majorities in both houses of congress and being able to carry out in the wake of the crisis of 37 carry out. The american system like actually try to enact a system of internal improvements that could have knit america together and mitigate it against the rise of sectionalism and perhaps slow down the the breakneck move towards expansion across the continent. Instead you got john tyler a guy who had no sympathy for the whig ideology at any point and spent his entire term vetoing legislation from the party that nominated him and cozying up to southern slaveholders and democrats to create a third party run as the head of a explicitly pro-slavery party and it didn't it and nominated clay and then clay god damn it.

[41:01](https://youtu.be/KbCfQmrk51c?t=41m01s)

In 44. He came close as close as he ever came in fact if new york had flipped he would have won and there's actually kind of a There's an there is a jill stein of the 20 of the 1844 campaign because there was a small abolitionist party called the liberty party which was headed by an abolitionist named james bernie that polled somewhere around. I think three percent in new york which was more than the difference between polk and clay in that state and most abolitionists in the north voted for the wigs. So it's likely that they would have if bernie hadn't been. There. They would have voted for paul or voted for clay and so you could blame the bernie bros the bernie bros for the mexican war because it's less much less likely that clay would have pursued a war with mexico than polk and of course. If you don't have the mexican war you do not have the civil war so once again the even if you're not if you want to talk about the the the dominoes fallen the wrong way even before lincoln being succeeded by johnson.

You have harrison being succeeded by tyler so the rest of the chapters that we read are about the expansion of railroad infrastructure into the west and the way that white describes and white is an expert on that specifically the westward. The frontier is really his baileywick. He's written a book that after this I might read because I'm enjoying this so far called railroaded which is specifically about the way that railroad infrastructure was built after the civil war um. If you know anything about the way that the government works now the way that they built the railroad is incredibly incredibly familiar a corrupt handshake between consolidated capital.

The capital that had emerged from the civil war and the government give giving out land grants to railroads as an I as and pitch to the audience to the american people as a self-funding mechanism that will allow for the creation of of american transportation infrastructure at no cost to taxpayers and instead of course. What we got was a the beginning of a one of a ratchet ratcheting move towards full capture of all government prerogatives by that concentrated capital because the war cr was the original dynamo of american capital accumulation and then after the war what we replaced it with which was not of course obviously. Not nearly the The intensity of the of the war but filling the same role was railroad infrastructure and then subsequent as part of but some subsidiary to that building of like american military american military campaigns into to subdue indian territory and I will say that I'm enjoying the book so far. I think that for a you know a political and ideological history it is very perceptive.

I very much appreciate white's emphasis on protestantism and and liberalism as drivers at the level of politics. Obviously this is all on top of a material base that he doesn't really talk about but that's par for the course. In this kind of history is yeah. It is It's going to be a political and cultural history and the oxford series that this is part of which I've read several other. Very good books from like battle cry of freedom. Is is is probably the best one volume book on the civil war and that's the oxford from the oxford series. What half god wrought which covers the pre-civil war era. Like post federal era. That's also very good but they are fixed fixed mostly on culture and politics which is always interesting in its own right as long as you remember what this is all. What the real drivers are at the level of politics and culture which you know is where the real viscosity is in any and in any political situation and and and where any kind of effort to direct the flow. The material flow is going to find itself concentrated and directed because the superstructure does determine and change the base but as I've said as a subsidiary action as generated from originally and how that happens is much more contingent.

That's where contingency lies is in that super structural relationship and one of the big contingencies is himbo and replaced by one of the worst men honestly just one of the worst human beings to ever occupy the presidency and that's okay saying a great deal because there are some monsters in there. But even like andrew johnson doesn't even have any like some of the personal virtues of the more charismatic or personable psychopaths who've been president and I and people have told me. You know lincoln and anders and johnson at the end of the day would have been that much different they were both racist. I mean yes they were both racist but but andrew johnson was lincoln was ambiently racist in the way that all 19th century white males were. Johnson was pathologically and personally and like nixonianly racist and that he he was in a unique position as president in reconstruction to have that personal animus shape shape the clay that everyone who came after one would have to build upon oh god can't get over it. Oh. It's so bad and the thing that's important about that the reason that that matters and that's the reason that we need to have some sort of nuance when we think about these things especially historically is that racism can be part of your decision matrix but it might be subsidiary or it might be less influential than other aspects.

It might get outvoted in your brain by other things and whether it is or not. Is determined by the virulence of your racism like that matters at every level. Like there are racists who voted for barack obama you know but the more racist you are personally the more aware you are of racism. The less likely you would have been probably to vote for obama so degree matters. I mean voting for obama not voting for obama It's not the sole signal of ones like political virtue. But it does signal a willingness to cross a barrier of saying yes black president.

I will be okay with that that requires that your racism not be the thing that is deciding things for you at the level of politics and and that is the thing that people are very uncomfortable with the idea that because it just suggests the idea that you might have to deal with people politically who are racist you might not be able to clean everybody's brain through culture and make them all nice post anti-racist subjects before they can come together and do politics you might have to do politics with people who have racism in there as one of the things that they're reasoning with. But the challenge then is to overcome it and one of the big reasons that neoliberal politics and all of its flavors including this radical radical anti-racist like afro-pessimism that essentially says that nothing but neoliberal accommodation is possible because of how racist white people are the thing that undergirds that is you'll never be able to overcome racism and as long as you're framing politics as the neoliberal zero-sum game that we are living in the idea that it can only ever get worse and that it's up to you to hustle and learn to code and and stay on your grind. One way or another in order to survive you'll never be able to overcome it.

Twitch banned the word simp that's funny but anyway. I'm very looking. I'm looking forward to the way that white weaves in protestantism and like mass mass religious conceptions into the charac into the stuff because one of the things that any more successful reconstruction would have had to push against would have been that very protestant liberal association between autonomy in the market and freedom of contract and the like.

The the conditions for virtuous living. There was a predominant sense that that by that point post second great awakening when we'd like as a nation come to terms spiritually with being these atomized market. Workers who might not even be able to have our own land might have to sell our own labor to survive or sell our wares which you know can be a similar prostrate position. We came to the conclusion that that those interactions are what reveal our worth as people reveal our our status as saved or damned and with that the case um the government intervention in the economy that would have been required to do reconstruction in any way more viably would have been very difficult. It would have been hard but the thing is it wasn't the only people people thing people thought there was there were other contending and conflicting values that were culturally expressed and held in different ways and that could have been brought to bear to to insist upon The breaking of this notion of contract is freedom because of course as white shows very clearly the post-war fixation on not allowing black dependence by not giving without without without giving to ex-slaves.

First of all the idea that former slaves had not by virtue of their enslavement earned anything you could give them is absurd. I mean they they literally are the reason that those plantations existed and the reason that that land was cultivated and the reason that there was any economic activity in those areas at all. So giving giving them land is in fact payment. It is a deferred payment but beyond that absurdity is the compounding absurdity that giving country had been built and that's where racism comes in. But once again racism is part of a mosaic of of conceptions and influences and interests that could have been arranged differently with different a different accumulation of events and of course as like points out the funniest thing about andrew. Johnson is that he was like many unionists in the south before the civil war. He hated the planter aristocracy because he was not one of them. He had a nixonian chip on his shoulder because he had been a low-born tailor and he became wealthy and became a political figure. But he was never one of the one of those you know one of those planter aristocrats who were very self-consciously trying to create a european style a feudal social order on american soil like they wanted to be. They thought of themselves as the cavaliers from the english civil war. They all thought they were little prince ruperts of the rhine running around in their little hats with plumes and a guy. A drunk tailor like andrew johnson could never be one of them and so one of the reasons he stayed loyal to the union was. He didn't want to fight to create a nation where they ran things and his idea for reconstruction was to was to put power into the hands of the the simple white people of the south because like a lot of white unionists he thought that the real victims of slavery were poor whites of course. That's half true poor whites are the victims of slavery but of course not the real or only victims of slavery and that's that the refusal to see the bigger picture is is is what racism does. That's its social function is to obscure the reality and to allow for the division of workers the vision of the dispossessed against each other and the reconstruction that johnson pushed for that. He thought would empower the simple white people of the south what did it do it put every kudzu covered fancy lad.

Humid all right so if anyone has any specific questions about what we've read I'll pop in there. But I'm going to be wrapping up soon so for. I don't think there's going to be a stream next wednesday. I think I'm taking some time off next week I've got other things to attend to. But when I get back let's do the let me look here yeah. Let's do the rest of part one finish part one so chapters four through eight. That's a nice stopping point. The name of the book for those who are coming late is republic for which it stands by richard white well. The most cringe counter factual is the one of the nazis that won the war because one they couldn't have and two. They did a good book about the cold war in africa. There actually are two books by this guy piero glacias and it's about cold war diplomacy in africa and a lot of it and a lot of stuff about the cuban intervention in the angolan. Civil war one's called conflicting missions. Havana washington and africa eight 1959 to 1976 and then there's another one. The sequel visions of freedom is 76 to 91. The only one who ever got it right was the nazis winning the war. Right thing was philip k dick which when he said as soon as they got nukes they would have destroyed the world which yes why won't dump all right.

This is the last question here why won't trump go to jail in the state of new york because he was president. Presidents can't go to jail when nixon said if the president does it. It's not illegal. He was right in the sense that a president will never be criminally punished for anything. They do in office or once they're president before because no political system will allow that precedent at least ours won't ours will not because if you start arresting them then everyone's going to end up in jail and that's why I think it was. I think felix told me that his dad had an idea that the president should issue. The presidency should be one long term like 12 years or something and then you're executed because if trump goes to jail some. Attorney general is going to try to put obama in jail or biden in jail and then you're off to the races and they don't want to start that precedent and I mean and that's just like the political grandstanding.

They sure as hell don't want the actual criminal behavior that they carry out to ever be accounted for because then how are they going to decide to do this the decisions. These people make the monstrous criminal decisions. They make are only they can only make them in a context of total impunity if there was any re potential possible. Consequence for their actions beyond like oh I might lose an election which you're gonna lose off. You're gonna leave office eventually as in I might see my fortune taken from me see my freedom taken from me. The way you know the rest of us have to decide to do things like we have to decide what to do in a day-to-day basis with the thing in our head of like oh. If we do the wrong thing we could get in trouble in a real like sense in a real personal sense as in like forgetting like stat and I know these guys super care about status and winning elections. There is a freedom that they need in order to operate in knowing that your personal security and the security of your fortune and your family and their it's never going anywhere. It can never be challenged. You're never going to see the inside of a jail cell you're not going to get executed.

You're not going to what maybe some hippie hits you with a pie when you're at the aspen's ideas festival. That's it you can't make these decisions without that as your bedline assumption and they're not going to do anything to violate that conflicting missions and visions of hope are the two or visions of freedom. Conflicting missions and visions of freedom are the two books about cold war foreign policy. All right guys. I'm gonna go so I'll do some more streams this week but next week it'll probably be dark just a heads up and then when we come back and I'll give a heads up ahead of this but like let's shoot for the wednesday. After next the rest of half part one bye.
