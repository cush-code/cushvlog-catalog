Hi guys you know what I've decided that opinions are really pointless to have I mean what does it matter you know if you believed what they happened versus another. If you have some version of reality you know like what difference does it make what difference does it make it was a great American once said it's all just you know personality traits like who you think killed. Kennedy doesn't say anything about who killed Kennedy. It says everything about you.

It says everything about the person you are the type of books you've read or haven't read your attitude towards power blah blah blah. That's all all these opinions were spouting do. They just give purpose and shape to your personality. So we're all trapped like rats during this thing either with a gun to her head to work or cooped up at the order of just mad incompetent God's just the worst people. The most people any society has ever produced in charge and complete and unn challenged control and that's just the fact of it and that's not something that people can really handle. I can't handle it and so we cultivate personalities and oppose in opposition to our the dread fate that we fear coming around the bend. Politics is a big part of that and that's a big reason that young people don't vote and poorer people don't vote. This is voting and politics.

This is higher up on that Maslow's hierarchy. It's the that you can worry about. Once your Masek needs have been taken care of which really suggests that it's not a vital field for you know human destiny but rather a an entertainment I mean and I'm not just talking about not just talking with voting I'm talking about politics as a thing to care about as a thing to have opinions about. So I mean that means including everybody who has never voted and that would never vote but who has spent hours and hours and hours and hours determining exactly what flavor of like non revisionist Marxist Leninist. They are it's like dying. I don't know I mean I don't want to call myself a ho gist. But at the same time I really appreciate OSHA's understanding of the need for autarky like.

Everyone's got them but I just want a grill ah man yeah. It would be funny if the hunks left the Oscars because nothing else gets released of 2000 2020 because there's a rule that there has to be a limited amount of theatrical release for any movie to count like so that's why Netflix bought these theaters. These things like one screen theaters that are basically gone and they're keeping them alive to show like for a weekend they're offering so they technically count as award fare well unless they change those bylaws. There's gonna be like six movies to choose from to win Best Picture and I certainly got my fingers crossed for trolls world tour. I saw the birds in Texas I saw the birds in Texas I certainly did yeah. The vibe wasn't great seeing all those psychotic animals freak out and try to attack human beings. They say it's electromagnetics that's why that happens they say that the electromagnets that they use for navigation is bait so they get interfered with by electromagnets.

Maybe it's 5g what if there's no what if the danger of 5 G's that it kills all the birds and then because it kills all the birds. It destroys the cycle for like pollination and stuff. And so we have a huge drop in the production. So there you go. 5g. Don't we love. It folks you can see the people who really react poorly to questions about 5g well. I just want to say like oh. You're a addicted to the Internet man through I mean at the end of the day we all are but like they are in the thrall of their disease. They're there in the full thrall of their sickness because they're like no keep get me. A bigger get me. A bigger spike to put my vein give me more of it and my right folks. That's why they call dumb phones in my opinion. That's why I call them dumb phones. We love the 5g tell me folks we have enough 5g.

It's the most cheese they'd ever have 3G pathetic pathetic get it out of here orgy. Ah this might not even have a phone but IG oh we love. It don't we and the whirlwind is in the thorn tree. The Virgin's are trimming their wicks. The Virgin's are all trimming their wicks on 4chan am I right folks. The Virgin's are all stripping their wicks on the chapel Trap House subreddit drop the mic you just got roasted in a way that you guys will never all right so people are saying. I did it Adam Alex Jones impression yesterday. I'm kind of worried. I don't remember doing it about Alex Jones. Impersonations was I just like on one to such a degree that I just sounded like him or did. I actually try to do the voice but him be lighter still let him be filthy. Still oh. I did do an out shows the pressure no good.

I'll have to go watch it back. Okay folks here we go we're talking about five T it's gonna be the end of straight Birds folks every bird will be gay. The birds are gonna start and sucking each other. All the eggs will go on hatched okay folks. Every bird will be gay summer born summer diet because I remember last night I also talked about how like it's possible that the CIA perfected public mind control and also individual mind control in the 60s and we're all living in like a synthetic reality that they've created because I feel like that could technically you know qualify as something similar to what Alex doe could say because I gotta say that does sound kind of tasty as a reality. I honestly check out the subreddit basically exclusively just to check out the the episode descriptions and it is because I want to know how we did and I want to know how people thought about it. I like I actually care about what people thought of the show and I want to make it better. I don't want to necessarily pandered anybody. But I want to know like what are consistent issues and the thing is is that it is a bad group of that make up the rest of that subredd. It are all lynch inducing so that's why I check it out but like I can't read any of the other stuff.

It's like god damn I get it there's like a fairy. It's just like a warehouse at this point for every like left-winger on reddit and I understand why that's why there's a need for community there. But man it's just I wish they were less so maybe less like I guess. They were less insecure and their identity I guess I would say but like they're young people so that's impossible. So I guess that's part of it. But no that's why I don't want to interact with it and I don't go on there. Sometimes I'm tempted to respond to really annoying stuff. But I realized that there that way lies madness. I don't hate the fans honestly. Most of the people who post on our subreddit don't like the show and they they're proud of it and they like brag about. I don't like the show and like they won't even. Like the reason I go to that stupid website is to check out the the thread for the episode and half the time it's not pinned because they like have no interest in the actual show which is like damn. I know we were early adopters so that's why we're kind of an umbrella thing Mohammed thing who hate us mods hate us and the show. So it's a it's a disaster.

If I could have my way. I would do it. Dave Anthony style. Stalin asked iron-fisted control. Know you say anything I don't like your and immediately. I think that would honestly have make it more interesting space than this just parade of try-hards. A lot of people are fighting an ideological battle against our show in the subreddit like we're trying to push some version of politics onto us or like make us disobey and I'm not interested in any of that so I just ignore it and I just try to find out what people think of the show people who I kind of respect their opinions. What are my thoughts on Hunter Thompson I was a huge hunter Thompson head as a kid I loved Hunter Thompson okay.

This is a good question the best type of Protestant. There are a few decent Protestant varietals. I would say that no one is relatively culturally stultifying that you can't really argue with the social output that was accommodated by Scandinavian Lutheranism so Scandinavia skandos get a pass even though it's a little austere for me but of course the Society of Friends. Absolutely the Quakers are a fantastic tradition and I would say that any of the like religious you know cloistered communities that still exist like Mennonites and Amish I respect the hell out of them too but everything else can go to hell and as I have said before American Protestantism isn't even the same thing and remember the Quakers started in England. So they don't technically count American Protestantism. It's just not not Christianity. It's its own pagan sacrificial Rite that's a good one who doesn't love the calf hours folks don't we love the cabbage. We love the cabins the most beautiful American States hard to be California annoyingly enough I have to say I'm sorry.

It's hard for me to keep a split lip on a lit spliff. I'm distracted by this whole rigmarole yeah oh God Captain America Catholicism is just kept. It's just it's. It's just prostitute. It's been consumed. It's been just taken over the route. I mean there's there's a remnant there and Catholicism because it's not. It didn't like Holi we towards itself on the new land. The way that Protestantism did so there's still some like socially useful tradition since Catholicism which is why I would say I pick it over Protestantism and even in America. It's not quite as bad or at least doesn't have that I mean at least for one thing. They read you know like that's one thing that I guess I'm a bit of a snob about because I do look down on American Protestantism. It's just like proud anti intellectual tradition just like absolutely like hayseeds or like proud of it. And it's just infuriating and you can see that in the fact that there are no Protestants on the Supreme Court. It's all Catholics and Jews because the only reactionary Americans like like social and economic reactionary Americans who have read done any of the reading from the Bible and then like going through to college and like attending institutions of like Jesuit learning actually have any kind of ability to speak in the terms of like the Supreme Court. You know so like you get a Catholic like intelligentsia. Leading this this potato sack of Protestant rubes. So that's why I got to respect the Catholics.

You know even though them being the brains makes them even more dangerous. There's just I can at least respect that they do the reading so there you go. I don't think I've read a book in five years. I can't read anymore the internet has destroyed my brain swear to mercy. No. I mean I'm reading. Now you know. It's just. I don't feel like I read as much as I used to. It's disappointing. The internet really does like just start clogging up your. Brain. Sun is out storms earlier but sadly there was a tornado warning in New York City yeah. Like it's not already feeling apocalyptic you got. The goddamn birds falling out of the sky. We've got rivers and seas boiling 30 years of blood. Earthquakes tornadoes the dead rising from the grave human sacrifice dogs and cats living together mass hysteria yeah. I know my worldview is pieced together mostly from sugar packets.

I think Biden waving will be very funny and I honestly think it might be the funniest outcome and that's why I'm worried. It's gonna happen because I really don't know if I think that's the right thing to happen but what my opinion in doesn't matter remember. We talked about this but our opinions of mouth too are meaningless. Our actions are determined right. Now you know and we'll either act on our beliefs or we won't. And if we don't then they weren't real just on the real if we don't act on them. Now then we didn't really have them there weren't really beliefs.

There were affectation and we'll find out boy but yeah because Biden is so visibly decaying in a way. The Trump amazingly isn't like Trump seems pretty on the ball. I mean he had a big decline like his first year in office and then he kind of plateaued and so now he is obviously still prone to ranting and interrupting himself and trailing off and doing wild insane tangents. He still has a basic function he can still like say words in a row Brighton cannot do it. He's as tias of idling my Model T he is I know they say it's the stutter but it means that he can't like that thing of him on Anderson Cooper where he could not get out of sentence. He was trying to talk about the wartime like production or or something and all I could do is go and you know there was a fact. There was a time it was Roosevelt you know during you know during the war. During World War Two there was a thing and it was oh god. This is not this is way it cannot communicate swing. It cannot communicate that's wild and like that's unprecedented you know like Reagan. Tennis was a manage decline that happened after he kept office but for the most part this is ah. This is like late term Reagan like like the last year after he'd already been president for seven years. That's what he's starting at on Inauguration Day who had lured the comic potential is amazing. It's like when Lloyd it's like with Lloyd. Bridges was the president in hotshots part two. He was tug Benson. He was like the goofy Admiral and he became president and he was like falling off or like at Leslie Nielsen was the president in a scary movie for whatever cuz Trump we already kind of know we're getting. This is a whole new level like a guy who has to talk every day has to communicate to the people. Every day has to be seen places every day just slowly melting in front of our eyes unprecedented and as like a stand-in for America's like is a very very heavy-handed metaphor for the American Republic that we're in and the Empire that it's the center. It's like god who is writing the season. It's way too hacky but this is on the nose.

This is there's no subtlety here because like to have that guy be the figurehead during a massive catastrophe collapse economic social health oh really the petro dollar collapse guys that's why we don't have a plate. That's why America like that's why MNT is true in America is because of oil because oil is priced in dollars and that's what allows us to push off inflation and that's it. That's why we have our absurdly huge oversized share of the GDP of the world. That's why we have more consumption per capita than anybody in the world. That's why all of our horrible messy hypermarket eyes. Institutions are built in was so much built in graft because of the need for profit that there's no functionality underneath them to get any efficiency whatsoever but anyway yeah so so like the ride might be over in terms of America even being able to sustain its position as like consumer of last resort as you know a world monetary power because like what is a world where fossil fuels are still needed everywhere but there is no way to get use the cash incentive to get people to move them there. I don't know how that kind of a radical disjunction gets solved besides the mass nationalization of these goddamn oil companies which is what we should do. But sadly there is no one within sniffing distance of power who would ever come anywhere close to having the vision to do that and to have the popular support to back up that kind of move.

Just doesn't exist so we're left with this attempt to prop this thing up but anyway to put a visibly senile man in charge of that and then watch him just fail everyday to live up to who he was the day before that's an artistic level yeah. That's where we've transcended metaphor like art doesn't exist anymore at that point. I think like Artie yeah art. Winx yeah. There's somewhere art arts gone but I like our shows gone. All art is gone because art is reality because we've crafted it yeah hmm damn. They should think who knows who the hell knows but man the one thing I'm hoping to get out of it is. The debates guys is the debates. It's really those two old ships in the night. These these decrepit hulks bobbing next to each other in the harbor just to sundowning and Meg lemonade maniacs clanging against there. They're like the words totally or all trumped absolutely roasting Ivan for being senile Biden getting feisty and like challenging him to physical violence.

Let's do it and of course it sounds debate which I love that would be even be better. I think and more emblematic because as Felix has said we've we are living in the reign of the sons you know the horrible inevitable result of a meritocratic social order where the merit somehow is becomes inherited. Genetically. All you're doing is inculcating the worst habits of the dullest. People on earth put these numbskulls in charge with a mandate to never change anything in a substantial way. It's like hey you have to deal with this unprecedented social and economic crisis but you can't do it in such a way that the thing you do makes a permanent change to any status quo or condition. That's an impossible ask that cannot happen so something's gonna have to break here. There's either gonna have to be some sort of like internal coup or the the political faction of capital actually like takes over either through military means or something or the state essentially collapses and we have like privatized chieftains.

That's it. Those are the options yeah that's all I can see waking up is possible and that would be part of that second option. Oh I'm gonna be on every drug I have for that to be. I'm going to be candy flipping at least for that debate. That's gonna be one of the high points of my life and then I hope I don't have to be here for it. I hope I get to be with my friends oh oh oh just let the oh I understand. It's gonna be rolling. Situation is gonna be remit and relax or am it over the next two years. Little Jesus but just let us be out in October.

So they can have the debates and they can go and hang out with my fellow guys and stream watching. The debates well blitzed out of my goddamn mind just give me that and then the oceans can claim us. We could be the last Atlantean generation. That's fine. We weren't doing that great we were down in the count if you really think about it. Even before this with global warming we were down in the count. We were like in there.

It's like that honestly. It's like 1 & 2. It's a bad count so it's like if you gotta get hit by a pitch. That's fine that's a better result than keeping swinging well anyway. There's me getting all glue lean again. I'm sorry guys I just. It's like I feel like I'm conducting electricity like builds up over the course of the day. Like one of those one of those like electric generators and then I fill up with like electrostatic power and. Then Zork I have to shoot it out and that's what these are. Those are me just morphing about and I'm sorry if you have to hear them but you know at this point. I think you know you're getting into so. I think you know you can be understood that this is like hashtag real talk. This is like me getting down and gritty. This is under the hood. This might be the end of the house of saud which obviously that would be. I mean too much to hope for. It. Probably does you gotta figure that they're gonna have to wrap up the Yemen work pretty. Soon like they're just that's not a luxury they can afford any more. Around in the oven with the the Houthis who they just cannot beat all they do is get. Sudanese.

Child soldiers worked that's all they're doing my welcome to my mind garage welcome to my mind garage by the way I don't know what come towns take out. Protestantism is but I do think it's funny that on that show guess what there is not one of a books. So I don't know what episode do. They talk about Protestantism because I'm a few behind I've been listening religiously. But I've been backed up since the quarantine. So I want to hear what their specific take is because it is like that pet hobby of mine is like thinking about the cultural like the shape of American Protestantism and how it you kind of like you know how you get a blood clot in like your lung and it creates a situation where you get a scab in the shape of your lung like the brac. Ally like you know all the tendrils and stuff that like your the airwaves are that get filled with blood and then hardens and it coughs up and it's the shape of the inside of the law. Right.

You're like that's what Protestantism is in America. Like it is the super structural thing that accumulates all the all the garbage all the worst cultural runoff of a settler colonial slave Empire. So it's fascinating the subject to study and I do have an idea to do a new braided past about American Protestantism. I want to do a little more reading before I started though because it is a lot of my stuff is very off-the-cuff and I don't want to go way too out on the limb. I want to have a little bit more odd or scholarly graph backing before I go off. But I do want to go off that spams fascinating religious tradition well there's lb on seed which is a good book about the specific religious and cultural traditions of the people who came to America from England and the Great Britain. Another book about like intergenerational traditions of violence is all God's children. All they get some more. It's getting chilly out. Here is rain today.

Supreme Court God people really do care about the Supreme Court. I think it's just because it's something stark and understandable. And it's like points on a scoreboard and so people can get it get their head around it in a way that like policy stuff is more abstract. I don't want to get one of those I forgot to say never live. Saw these questions I wanted to put another thing I missed it. I got there I got there and Chewbacca I can't find ya the Supreme Court. It's like come on you know that nothing that's gonna save or doom. Humanity is gonna be decided in a court of law certainly not by nine not dumb. In the Supreme Court. If you go through those channels it just won't happen. It's just gonna be bye-bye bye-bye whole. Thing's gonna shatter just doesn't. It's like any any regime that doesn't have enough give in it. I mean that's what defines a regimes long term longevity. We are incredibly brittle. We've created a situation where we've hollowed out all of our institutions from within in a way that I don't think they were meant to withstand this kind of longitudinal shock.

What do I think of acceleration ISM. I'll tell you what I think of acceleration ISM. We all better hope that the acceleration estar right because this is if this is an accelerated. Then. I don't think I want to see accelerating I think if you're accelerated to that speed. It's where like your skin starts pulling off your face and you just get peeled like a banana. So don't thank you I would rather not sign up for that sir good day. I said good day so yeah we better. Hope it's correct. No we're not. It's not a gamble. It's not that we aren't every choice of the matter we're accelerated. We have to acknowledge the reality we don't get to make reality fit our theory of it. We don't credit that it's like well in my theory that we're not accelerating and I don't think we should accelerate. So no it's not accelerate okay. It doesn't matter what you think it's happening. We're accelerated the theory about like the point where crisis conditions come to the and and people are forced to make a choice and certain delusions are exposed. That's now that's now oh boy oh boy yeah. So yeah.

I have no idea everything is everything is up. I don't think we've only beginning to see the beginning. It's gonna get. I think it might go way beyond. What a lot of us think is possible. Maybe we thought of it theoretically but we sort of dismissed it. It's just not being commensurate with the reality as we understood it and the thing is it wouldn't be. It would be a tectonic shift. It would be the kind of change that really doesn't happen the kind of over the night instant overnight instance. Phase shift like that doesn't really happen in history and we're living through one oh boy yeah. Shit's up.

That's the Warren Zevon song that he wrote after he got diagnosed with terminal lung cancer with a check please yeah. Everything's very exciting they say we live in interesting times and I think we can all say even though right now that's pretty boring for a lot of us. It's still interesting. I certainly would not want to get owned by Corona right now and die that would be really annoying. That's see what happens not seeing what happens after having like this this idea like not specifically this but like something in the shape or posing just out of view in my mind like a like a rake like Banco at the wedding or Banco de at the feast at the just the shadow haunting me and now it's here and then I'm not. Gonna just get old right away and I want to be the guy at the beginning in the zombie movie. He just gets bit what are you like hey what's going on out here. I want to at least get home to turn the TV on and see like the eyepatch guy going we need to nuke the cities I want to at least get to that. Let's we'll see something what it is. I don't know I'd do that no sir search me son I got a song I know a song. I don't think it matters who's gonna be President.

Next I don't know if these institutions have the elasticity. There's some typical forces at work are you ready for the great atomic power. We follow the grated powered power. We're making cookies. I'm so excited we might be teetering on the brink of it abyss that none of us have ever even come close to imagining but damn it. We've cookies I have not been drinking today. Sir I am a teetotaler. This is a spindrift sparkling water. Sir. I'm just high on life yeah that that Avenue by the last episode of that Avenue five show I was just like Oh. What I have not dropped acid yet. I'm gonna do it.

Soon though I want to get nice and liddy waiting for a nice day. Today it was just too stormy. I mean I'm like that's the thing like if I cut my hair. Am I ever gonna have anything as interesting as what has happening right. Now. Because as this thing is like my front for true birds here is sort of like dying. It's giving me. These really honestly poignant little architectural wonders feel like a damn whoo the thing is the one thing that would make me shave the whole thing I'm God because if this went away and I ended up with the sides and because as much as I love Lex G and I love the idea of sides there are sides gods who I respect. It is a look that gets me nauseous even thinking about being on my head where it's just the couch you know like the Mao or whatever or more than George Costanza. That's not that's not happening if it ever gets that bad. It's all gone because that's or I'll like just rub. Some stem cells on it like that's hopefully by then there'll be some sort of Oryx and Crake style genetic stem cell based lubricant cream that like fuses with your DNA and gives you back luscious locks. I would love to get Lex G on the pod. I would love to get Lex on the pod I would I would do. I would do what's wanna feeding him and me I would want to rap. But I don't think he would do. It sadly also I don't know if it would. I don't know if the audience would like it.

That's for sure man's eye. He's got hotcakes. He does not sugar p-goon yes exactly oh wow ISM hell yeah peasants. Let's go let's go get some of those Hakka peasants lying around you know where we got any of those. Any of those like generationally landless transients. Peasant farmers that lived in over cramped conditions as tenants in southern land holdings where they were sort of second-class citizens had powered Chinese revolutions for generations. Before that we got any of those late or not. I don't know oh boy oh. Boy. People are Bella. They're hooting and hollering now in addition to clapping see this thing. It's too bit up. I was saying about how to have to keep clapping so they really care like show that their penance. Wow clapping enough you gotta work it out. They're gonna be doing the wolf howls and like Cucaracha dances. That's gonna go off there's gonna be fireworks. Eventually this thing goes long enough. They're gonna be like shooting a cave in the air like it's Saddam's wedding. That'd be so funny. Everybody's got like a something they've got it like a like. A Sicario gilded a que that they got I like Etsy and they mail it home. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if the Taiping rebellion had been successful that's a real. I think an under I think an under pondered counterfactual of history as if the Taiping rebellion had been successful in China because it really came very very close. The Ching were on a real knife's edge there for a while and it was the Western intervention that really pushed him over. They could have very well fallen. The other way and a lot of the Western powers were initially sympathetic to the Taiping because they profess to be Christians. It's just that the guy was such a weirdo that eventually they were like oh ok you're on.

Some other never mind yes yes you deserve to have another seamless delivery. You earned it. You've earned not having to be ruined for people with masks trying to save lives or deliver food or do anything useful. I'm okay that I know now we're all absolute parasites well. It's pretty clear the parasitic nature of this whole economic arrangement like the people with the least social standing. The least control over their jobs and the lowest pay are the people who actually need to be working like how has that not how is that revelation not just destroy the foundations of everything we think about politics or economics or justice. I'd love to go to Colorado where would I perform in your house in a hazmat suits. And that's why I fear that like they're gonna open up again and they're going to slowly but surely normalize these deaths and normalize this threat that having these jobs is like well. That's part of the job it becomes like hey you signed up for it and even if then maybe they'll be a little better paid like to incentivize but considering how many people are out of work if they're not gonna have to give much they're. Gonna have huge incentive to get people to do it to risk their life and then it's gonna get normalized none of the people and then we'll slowly just sort of accept a certain number of casualties and a certain degree of care or certain triaging of care that allows us to function while still having these numbers overwhelm what should be the limits of the healthcare system. Yes. I don't really see an alternative for that point of view. If we're not giving up the markets we're not giving up capitalist. We're not giving up the profits. Then we are giving we have to we have to change our definition of acceptable human losses. Then we just have to factor a new thing in another thing is it's not the first time like look.

What happened with cars showed up. Cars showed up in cars started killing people immediately. People who got splattered all over the road people have no idea what they were doing. They were murdering children. They were destroying whole neighborhoods and what do we do we invented the crime of jaywalking actually. No you're wrong for stepping into the street that you can always have stepped in from time immemorial since the beginning of time. No this newfangled device should come and be able to mow you over and it's your fault and we normalized with the deaths. Around traffic traffic fatality still tens of thousands of people here. It's a monstrously dangerous thing to do to just let that happen and we accept that because of what what how crucial automobiles we can to the economy and like the way that they interacted with our settler you know geography of a free real estate. But so they'll just factor this in the way that was and it's just going to be a process. There'll be a couple of these like go out come back in but eventually we're gonna be out less time as we just except like create more bumpers for accepting deaths just like I don't really because like there isn't hurting anything. Like if these new studies have show that like upwards of like that their estimates of how many cases are there are down by like factors of 10. The in places that have officially maybe 15,000 cases made in factual ality have something like two or three hundred thousand cases like and that's what there was a Stanford survey that suggested that I don't know they said that that was like falsified or something. But there is another report from the UCLA or USC that says the same thing about Southern California which is that there's vastly more people who have this then we thought which means that the fatality rate is much lower now because it's so much more communicable that's still killing a ton of people and it's not acceptable but you could argue hey there's some herd immunity possible there and the thing is you can go forward with that that is your argument and even if it isn't true I don't know if it's true you know oh well. It didn't work but then you just keep going because we have to keep the Hiroki and will feed us all into the grinder. The thing is like these are these numbers of deaths are not absolutely. These are these aren't black death numbers. These aren't you know even these aren't a bowler numbers in terms of fatality rate or anything. This is a number of people who we've lost before el Spanish flu killed more people even if it kills many people's the Spanish flu.

It wouldn't be a big deal if we just normalized it and honestly you know if you create some slack the economy and now if you buy out some industries we can consolidate further which is going to be a nice bonus. Of this. It's a none of these small businesses are gonna be able to come back up afterwards. People who had money beforehand they're gonna have hoarded it and they're gonna be able to buy up everybody's stuff for pennies on the dollar. So it's gonna be like. Demolition man all restaurants will be Taco Bell. Though the Amazon presents Taco Bell Prime I don't know what these people are though it's really weird their dog what if 9/11 ever happened Wow that's a real one isn't it because that is such a contingent act a lot of times that could have been stopped. I don't know I've long. I've always been a skeptic of the truth ISM but you know since I've seen I've kind of widen my credulity. My turn I still have a fundamental problem with a whole idea of an inside job 9/11 and that is a government apparatus that had that degree of control over an operation that size.

I don't think would have to do it to get a war in the Middle East. But maybe they did all that. Maybe the RAND Corporation did a bunch of regressions and they realize no. The only is the only guaranteed way to get this to happen is. With this nothing else. Will work was like anything more than a anything less than like a 25 percent failure.

Rate who knows I don't know what the main thing is if it happened one way or the other doesn't matter. Same people are in charge say that the way to dislodge them is the same it's just really their capacity to control things that's different and honestly. I don't know how you can embrace the real like hard truth or theory. I mean stuff about like them knowing beforehand. That's a whole different question. And I think that's really significant like there's all this weird stuff about insider trading happening right before 9/11 like stock the shorting of airline stocks a guy's got arrested for like doing insider trading off 9/11 information so the idea that this um it was known about at some level and was allowed to happen.

I could buy that but like controlled demolition and all that it just seems like you're working backward. But I'd say either way well. They're still in charge same people if they have the same motives and the way to beat them is sadly the same organizing and goddamn. It that's the hard part because all the other theorizing is a lot more fun talking about like who killed who blew up. The towers is way more fun trying to push the goddamn wheel of pain up. The hill again oh boy see the finally thing about tower. Seven I never got was why would you need to blow it up and the only answer anyone's ever given me is like it had the files or something. It's like they knew what they were like. They had the whole like months leading up to it to plan everything which means they could have planned to remove the stuff from the place before they did it unless they forgot and they had like fire missile at it to just knock it down. I don't understand yeah and I obviously another thing about the Pentagon. This is like that seems like such a bad target you know. Since its I mean you go to the trouble of knocking now the Twin Towers for their propaganda value why just crashing into the thickest building on earth. That's gonna barely show any scars. It's like wow because the part that got blown up is like the accounting department. That's like isn't there another way to get they presumably they know where this stuff is and they can get it and like get it out of there if they could plan that I don't know that's all like I said I am agnostic on all this stuff having an opinion is nice. But at the end of the day it doesn't prove anything and there's no way to know so who gives a.

I'm just gonna be grilling back here and my little grill spot catch me grilling boys and girls. I'm all about that grill life you feel me. I know you could all right guys. I'm going.
