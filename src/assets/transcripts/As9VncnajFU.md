Gazing with tranquility powell was when they heard a goody man came singing songs of love and then the girly man came singing songs songs of love histories of ages. Past unenlightened shadows passed down through all eternity. The crying of humanity and here come the goody many singing songs of love holy songs of love. Ah hurdy. Gertie man donovan one of the best credits role songs ever at the end of zodiac. I saw zodiac. I saw zodiac at a advanced screening like because I got a little pamphlet. Like a little card. Hey go and see this for free great crack packed theater when the crep and when jimmy simpson when the the mcpoyle he goes that's him and it cuts the black and he goes before he could be interviewed. Arthur lee allen died of a heart attack. I heard the entire crowd do this collective exhale. This disappointed sigh it happened in unison and I gotta say one of the most like you know you talk about how the whole point of the The theatrical experience is to have those you know communal moments and usually they're of catharsis but just like to have this theater-wide collective thwarting of catharsis. At the very end it was powerful and then the haunted by this guy who's who can just play you a song of love and then you'll never have it consummated. It's great which is why zodiac is not really about how you can't know about what happened and like it's impo the possibility of certainty. It's not about that at all that movie is adapted from a book by a guy robert gray smith who had a pet theory. He's not one of those guys who looked at you know this un solved historical mystery and decided to like bask in the uncertainty and like turn that into a creative pursuit. No he said hey yeah this hunter. Thoroughly allen guy he did it and the book and the movie even though I think fincher is much more big ambivalent about. It probably doesn't even necessarily believe that just by virtue of telling grace smith's story you smuggle in this like actual narrative and that's the reason that everybody sighs at the end when we saw it is because they're like.

We couldn't have our knowledge consummated and that's really what it's more about. It's about how even if you know what happened you can never be satisfied. It's not that you can't know. It's that knowing does not provide the satisfaction. The culmination that knowing is supposed to because if we're not seeking knowledge of what's really going on then what else are we doing right. But what does that knowledge gain us nothing it can't gain us anything because we can know anything and it won't change our behavior. That's why you want to talk about great songs that speak to the specific like contours of modern alienation from the self. Leonard cohen's everybody knows everybody knows that the dice are loaded. Everybody knows the war is over everybody knows. The good guys lost like people want to oh if only everybody knew who killed kennedy. It's like what two-thirds of the population think that in some way or another the government was responsible for the assassination of president kennedy. What are they doing about it why would that number going to a hundred change anything that is the fundamental problem with conspiracy theory as a heuristic for understanding history or the current moment. Not that those things didn't happen of course they happen you cannot have a global capitalist hegemony without a full coercive apparatus. We have some fantasy even like with a relatively radical critique of american imperialism that there's the places where we coerced capitalism into being and the places where we where we basically bribed it into being but no every level of social order from the president of the united states. If his name is john kennedy to exploited workers and certainly minority workers. In america. There are people who have to be brought along coercively outside of the law because remember we're not. We're talking about how there's x amount of coercion that needs to maintain a cl. A class rule right over time that number has to get bigger because there's more people who are being exploited. Their or their exploitation is organizing them around the feeling of being exploited. It requires more output. There has to be a contin escalation of coercion.

Now part of that is buying off some people so they're not fighting so that they don't have to be coerced and that makes it easier to concentrate on those who cannot be reconciled in any way to the system as it exists and so that doesn't just mean imperialism in the third world. It means assassinating the president if he gets out of line. It doesn't understand what's going on doesn't hasn't really doesn't understand the count. The real context of america's victory in world war ii or the real not the context the real consequences like when the united states decided to to go to war with the soviets and with the former colonial countries on behalf of the political order that the that imperial europe and japan had left on the world. They decided we are going to put this thing back together frankenstein style and that means we're gonna have to repress the out of a lot of people and that includes people at the heart of empire and so it's no coincidence that as the cia is being formed you have the creation of or you have the red scare this cultural war on communism that has political effects in the form of purging the most progressive elements of the american democratic party coalition which could have steered the u.s. Towards some sort of negotiated co-management of the post-war world with russia and I know that seems insane and it's like yes the moment. Fdr's brain caved in that possibility went away as soon as truman. The thought it was good that lincoln was assassinated and when she went to the white house to visit her son she wouldn't sleep in the lincoln bedroom so like you've got. This cultural package in this guy coupled with the fact that he owed his position to the democratic party not to the coalition of left-wing and progressive forces that involve that that was centered in the democratic party but which had come together in a popular front to win world war ii. In alliance with the soviet union. The question was will that alliance continue into the task of rebuilding the world or will it turn into war and we made the choice to do that the story we get told is that stalin was this he basically closed iron. Curtain. Down said no you and we had to in order to defend freedom match that but that's not what happened. This is what's happening by the way wow the cia is being built while truman is authorizing the building of the cia oh yeah. No and true the thing is. Truman was like progressive for the time he had genuine progressive values. He wanted to continue the new deal but he hated communism more and he didn't hate communism merely because he was an aparachik of the democratic party. He also hated it for visceral personal reasons because it suggested miscegenation now again that's you say oh you're talking. About this is idealism. No why is truman there to be president in the first place because the left couldn't keep wallace on the ballot at the 44 convention.

This is where you see that by the time you get to the creation of something like the cia the die has been cast and so while you can describe what the cia does up to and including assassinating the president doing mk. Ultra mind control selling building up every network of large-scale drug mart drug sales in the world standing up the cartel system that the that the global supply chain then piggybacked on top of they did all that. But they did it in a context where the the the social muscle necessary to like really resist the imposition of capitalism on its own terms which the new deal state had pushed against and was being eroded away from the position of like being able to sustain that what that meant is that while the cia had to do what they did to maintain the the position they were on they were not doing it in a context where they're just that any of their discrete actions were determinative. They were I was happening after the decision had been made after the crucial real battle between the the working the global working class. The grow the global proletariat humanity at large and the the algorithm that is like parasitically sitting atop like the the human institutions of capitalism of the capitalist like developed world and so while you can map the terrain fixating on proving specific events within the context of the deep state and with the context of our understanding of like the role intelligence plays as a crucial buttress to the structure the greater structure of capitalism like it's a necessary component. It cannot be done away with the cia still exists and does stuff. Although I would argue that now intelligence is more of like a make work program because one of the things that the cia did was make itself obsolete like it didn't have to intervene at the most at those crucial points anymore because they didn't have to worry about those moments arising because instead of trying to do keynesian like inefficient um like mid-century modernist. Like brainwash individual people the market can just unleash the product of of you know of of raw research carried out under like the the funding of the government privatize. This technology of the internet that is gonna structure human life in a way that is going to tear us out of any kind of social context where our actions can have political consequences. That's why we have to we can as an entertainment only for entertainment purposes. Only we can observe the arc of the intelligence state but if our politics become applying a a a heuristic of conspiracy to every event as it unfolds that will only lead you into inevitable neutralization by the fact that that process the process of just taking individual events as they happen and then trying to make a narrative out of them given the bric-a-brac of culture that you absorb that is how reactionary popular culture is made that is how reactionary mass politics such as it exists can be made is through those narratives. What what the what socialism what marxism is supposed to do is allow you to look at events as they happen neutralize that need to go down a movie and get to the question of how do.

I improve my conditions how do. I improve the conditions of my children how do. I make the world. I live in conform with any kind of value for what human life means but my god no. I can't do that. I have to solve the riddle of who did 911 or. I have to expose The the pandemic like okay good go for it. You're gonna end up never finding out why and what I mean that by that is you will convince yourself. You've already convinced yourself. What you will not have is what you're dreaming about the fantasy that is pulling you forward which is that the revelation changes something a fundamental fact. About your life in the world catalyzes a reaction because like even if you are just like a person who likes to talk about conspiracy theories and has no contribution to the research and somebody else pulls out. A smoking gun you're going to feel like you were part of it and that it was. It's your victory. That is gonna. That's what's gonna. That's the reason you're involved in this and the other people involved. In this they're trying to get off you're all trying to get off. Now you can think in your head. I'm trying to get off because I want to overthrow the structures of capitalism that that stop us from being able to organize and it's like okay yeah. I understand you want to do that but nine out of the ten of the people who are doing it with you don't care about that. Narrative that's the mass political narrative that fascism offers as an alternative to the pursuit of like socialism.

As a utopian nirvana. It is no nirvana's a utopian like horizon. I should say no utopian horizons are impossible. We are it is man against man. There can be no deep cooperation between people. We are strangers to each other which means we will all eventually destroy one another until there's only one left and so then we must seek out our enemies and destroy them and how do we find our enemies.

[17:29](https://youtu.be/As9VncnajFU?t=17m29s)

We see who does the bad things in the world and we try to punish them. That's where cue comes. From. That is why the center of gravity of like conspiracy theories about the kennedys and stuff has drifted rightward. You can argue oh. It's because the left hasn't taken it seriously enough. No the libidinal gravitational pull has dragged it there. That's why alex jones became a reactionary because he's selling a politics not of the hard boring of actually changing things but of a fantasy. A fantasy of of consummation through violence you're never gonna get. There is the thing you're just gonna keep running until you smash into. The this is the death drive enthroned that represented as fascism that can only be distinguished from the rest from capitalism in any other condition is it what's the difference between capital. It is. It is the conditions the material conditions under which capitalism is operating. That is what the only difference is now the reason but the thing is is that time is the other factor it's not just material conditions. It was material conditions that we would be back in like classical fascism that we imagine. It's like a mass seizure of power by a mass political party represented in our case by the republican party and I can see why we want that to be because yes if it's just a question of like capitalism in deep crisis where even at the core of it there's massive felt alienation from the system and and by like unchanneled hostile energy like that is true but we are a hundred years past that point technologically. That's what we forget when we think and only one of the two time or place factors that go into considering like a a context that we're considering historically or even contemporarily and what that is that that hundred years is wrought is a de-politicized de-socialized people who cannot act politically the way people could act politically in the 20s they are and when I say they couldn't it's not. It doesn't mean that they can't physically do it and it doesn't mean that they are too weak or pussified to do it. It means that the things that would should exist to reinforce their actions like to echo locate against don't exist because people are like in any situation. This sucks. I want it to change then what do you do in some context with some degree of technological you know baffling between people. You get one amount of political like meaningful political organization but in another like well. The one we're in all of our political energies get dis diffused into entertainment aesthetics which in politics is fascism like we like imagine americans as like and this is why it is a fascist thing. This is why like this is this the psychology is fascist which is just accelerated capitalism so imagine you're an aztec right and you're like or like everyone understands that you have to that there has to be violence in the enjoyment of pleasure in a ranked society right.

Like the aztec. Tribes that like became the confe that that came together like on those on those islands in in lake. I can't pronounce it. They were like these warrior bands who like had these hierarchies of power within them and they were able to come together and organize collectively by agreeing to turn their violence into games into sport. But the problem is someone still has to die if there's real consequences if there's real consequences if it's not fully If it's not removed fully from the glass system. The exploitation mechanism that is grinding away at every moment at the like very enamel of civilization at its bones so like our our to be a american who considers themselves and lives a life where they are getting. They are addicted basically to capitalism put it that way the way that the aztecs were addicted to their class rule in the sense that they could not imagine any other situation where they would be in the same position specifically like their pl. Their enjoyment of life would be dramatically reduced and the main reason for that is not even like oh. They're afraid of not being able to eat a million burgers and they're afraid of not being able to have a giant mcmansion and all that's and that's part of it. But that's not all of it. Part of it is a genuine belief that well because we treated the rest of the world. This way there's no reason that if the tables were turned that they wouldn't return the favor. This is why jefferson referred to the slave owning class of the south as holding a wolf by the ears because when you do stuff to people you know at a certain level. It's wrong and it has to be laundered. Somehow you have to make them deserve it. But that only displaces the guilt. It does not eliminate it and one way that it manifests itself is in a neurotic terror of the other and the thing is the only thing that defeats that this is why this is the problem and why one of the reasons we can't act politically the way we used to is that the only way to get over that is to have faith oh oh no faith yeah. That sucks and we got rid of that and again it doesn't go anywhere you know. This is a closed system we're talking about this is this is there is no place for anything to run it all stays in the system.

 it just got displaced to the south. So the only thing we believe in now is the self and that means that the the thing that got the the you know millions of um storm of like brown shirts to go out there and like street fight communists and then you know very quickly enthusiastically wage a war on the rest of europe. They did that because they still believed in something beyond themselves now they didn't call it god anymore that had been destroyed by the 19th century as nietzsche said but there was still like some notion of a unity to stand in for god in a community in the in the in the sense of other people and of course. The great clash of the 20th century was when we say that do we mean the nation or do we mean a class do we need. These nationalist concepts or do we mean a class relationship that correspond that means that our violence has to be directed upward. This is what I'm saying now the reason fascism took over. Was was taken up was able to take power fascist. Fascism was able to take power because it was people who wanted a violent reckoning but didn't give a at the end of the day about about her utopian horizon. At the end of the day they just wanted power. They convinced themselves that that's all that mattered and that's because at the end of the day they bought the final lie of capitalism that the self is the only thing and that is what's eating us is that we are all one way or another captured by a theology of self-worship and the problem with talking about. This is that people immediately turn it into a moral question oh you're all narcissists. Now there is nothing else to be. It is like yeah. It's amazing like the same people who want to like defend like slave owners or like vikings by saying like they had a coherent moral code and it was like of the moment and you're pres you're using presentism to try to to critique. Them. Will then look at their fellow people who are narcissistic in by the way the exact same way. They are no different at all except for branding and then blame them for it. It's like I'm sorry. They are not none of us have ever lived in a different world. I've never breathed the air you know like what the hell is water. You know that joke the. The two fish are swimming and. One of those fishes says turns and says to them god damn the water's real warm today and he says what water or I'm sorry what's water.

But what this precludes is the mass politics of fascism filling the gap technology what does that look like and to me. It looks like branded techno dictatorships and because there have to be two brands because remember there's another half. There's another group of these people who at the end of the day are just as death-worshipping. They also believe the self is the only thing but they also adhere to a remnant of the puritan ethos that says that if I do something that there is a god who will recognize me some collective entity history. Usually they think of it as but like not in a dialectical sense like just in a narrative sense history will remember them well because they did good things that's liberals but of course the end of the day. Liberals are more addicted to the capitalism than they then are able again or willing to act politically to actually challenge capitalism but they have to sublimate that guilt somewhere too and they do it by blaming republicans oh and blaming fascists like they're making us do this but they submit willingly and the way that but the but the way that they'll be able to submit willingly is to federalism and I really do think the great divorce is much more likely than any claim of the center because the center is collapsing. We've seen the government response to real deep crises right now in the last two years and you cannot. I know people want to say. The cruelty is the point and like oh these people are doing this because they're it's a psyop or. It's a great plan demik. If you're a republican or like a based socialist or it's like oh. It's white supremacy. And it's genocide and it's you know ethnic cleansing if you're a leftist. But at the end of the day it's neither of those things. The state doesn't have the capacity to do it anymore to do the things it used to be able to do because it has had its guts eaten away by marketization by financialization. By by the death of the public sphere. It doesn't go anywhere it is just privatized of course. There's gonna be violence there's violence. Every day. There's violence now 50 people in a why why are seasons two on the mexican border. Just the other day. The violence is everywhere it will continue but it will continue to grind up the people it's grinding up. Now it is not going to change its target that's what everyone the change of target is the breach with the old world that all gives us permission to act and freeze us of obligation. And that's what we're all hoping for when we can finally act out the movie but for be precisely because of that reason. It can't come to pass because it's what we need to add and we're imagining that it can't happen because what we're imagining that we need is actually what our libido needs. It's not what the moment requires. It's not what's actually happening. It is a libido delusion that we all collectively engage in because that's the only way we can engage in politics is through the narrative spectacle. I hate to reuse that word so much. But it's it's very meaningful and the reason we're able to do. That is because how much of the actual sinews of the state.

Even though those are buckling are automated by capitalism by the flow of money through the system by the wind through the the pinwheel. The reason we're in a huge crisis now though is that the thing that fuels this is this This politically determined input in the form of u.s. Dollars that are circulated and and how and where those m that money goes is a political decision. It has not been fully automated. Yet. It's behind the times it's version 1.0. It's literally presided over by nonagenarians and there is and the thing is the system is going to work no matter what it's going to adapt to whatever crisis politics spits out and it's going to win because there's no there's nothing else. Contesting anymore. We're all just individuals trying to survive and what we're going to get instead. Is continuing immiseration at the bottom renters a bit but yeah essentially starting with anyone who does not own a home and then basically how much how good their job is how much access they have to generational family wealth and the fam in the form of like maybe their parents own a house their proximity to home ownership. They will be their their misery will be determined by their proximity to ownership hope like land ownership and and that will be capital ownership basically and that will be determined both just by like the grind of history like oh unemployment rate just bumped you're all fired and now you have to live with way less money in the same conditions and you have to juggle that and that you know eventually you're going to fall off of the beam. Everyone is because you can't stay on it forever. It's it's it's ground going away beneath your feet. It's just a question of how long it takes so that's just the grinding thing in the background happening indiscriminately based on pure money but then you have the individual encounter with fate that is determined by their proximity to land and ownership. Encounters with the police encounters with violent criminals. Encounters with even hate criminals. Their encounters with disease like coronavirus their encounters with discrimination and and mostly lack of care and interest by intervening institutions because they don't have the money to make anybody care who isn't being paid minimum wage to do so all right. So this is once again a very long way to introduce a chapter from the making global global capitalism by leo panic and sam gindin we get there. Eventually we always get there so I did the same thing on friday. So I ended up having to only do one chapter and I want to. I don't want to get in the habit of that because the book is very neatly organized into two chapter parts and I want to keep that going so. I decided today. I'm gonna go through chapter eight wrap that up and then do The next section chapters nine and ten week from today next tuesday oh but just to finish that thought what this me but then and then of course like encounters with law enforcement like what's legal what's illegal to like you know because people are going to be on the wrong side of a lot of discriminatory lines in like popular culture and in legislation.

But they will be able to protect themselves with money. It's going to go from something that is an existential threat to something that is an inconvenience and bad and traumatic psychologically. But it's not a direct existential threat and then for some people. They're going to encounter it stochastically and boom they're actually going to be. The thing everybody else is scared of and they're going to be more of them over time. Like that's. What's going to happen like we're describing the imposition of you know like a techno fascist regime but who those people are and talking about is in terms of like numbers percentage of the population and specifically like the They're part of a process that is like social wide is is is not different. It's it and this is why it's not necessarily even going to be that way more you know social enemies are going to be extinguished in red states than in than in less fascist blue states. It's going to be that some people are going to be chased around by the state ritually to make everybody feel better in both places and in both places that is going to be part of a larger tessellation of like everyday miseration that will be socially invisible because it's not what anybody is going to be paying attention to they're going to be because we live as cyborgs and we're cybernetically connected they're going to experience this state like they're actually going to experience the state because remember we're talking about the people who are not falling into the cracks because if they were they wouldn't be on the board anymore they wouldn't be part of the public. The assumed public they by definition are all on the board still and what they share is a desire to not think about what's really happening. Especially the closer to precarity. They are because that means thinking about their own vulnerability that is destabilizing they would much rather think about literally anything else and so that means let's think about what the state is doing what we can theoretically be in charge of even though it's a fraction of the violence being doled out by this machine as it tries to strip the last shreds of profit out of this goddamn globe and the thing is that's not that doesn't say people think this is dumarism but the th but the fact is is that yes political action as we conceive of it in this forum is impossible but that's not the definition of political action that is a fantasy deluded. Concept symbol of that term that we use to allow us to carry on with the fairy tale that we're doing politics anymore when we concern ourselves with who's getting elected to these offices that have been drained of any actual authority and that is why the only meaningful political question is do. You have the horses for that which again and because it is meaningful it cannot be spoken up. But anyway. The flip side of this is that while you're imagining that nothing can you know while you're trying frantically because you still believe in it you're trying frantically that to to operate these these you you're you you got to the cockpit of the plane and you're trying to move okay. Here it is here's the metaphor people can understand and hell the right wing thinks talks this way too that like the political project is anyone you can imagine it and when I say political I mean our imagined idea of what a political project is that would involve us mostly voting sometimes demonstrating spending money and joining orgs. And it's like again that's politics. But it's not by definition all of politics. It's the only part of politics they can't be legally spoken of and therefore it's the only one that's visible in the discourse. So you participate in this thing and that means that you are fixed on what's the state's doing and so the state is using its limited remaining. Um discretion picking and chooses who is going to be made a public victim of state violence and again not evenly applied organized around those who resist who get turned into criminals who get if they were part of the the citizenry by acting the way they do well. They're not really doing legal politics. They aren't people anymore. They've been disintegrated into homo saucer. They're in the big pot of homo saucer with everybody else everybody else who either couldn't keep up or tried to fight it. And I think because of that you're never going to get your horizon. It's going to be a devolution to the states and then within those states the continuation of politics with one side winning more and more and just doing more of what they always did before which is going to hurt more people over as time because more people as percentage of people in the system are going to be like unambiguously hurt by the current conditions not just not like the people in the center. Not like the middle class who are determined determining all this psychically not just in their feelings in their fifis which is what they're doing and why their politics can consist of voting and legal stuff because politics at the end of the day is aesthetic to them because they're not really suffering. Now yes they're suffering generally but they aren't suffering in a way that alienates them from the system. I'm talking about myself.

[40:49](https://youtu.be/As9VncnajFU?t=40m49s)

But I'm talking about millions of other people too at any time cataclysm can break this whole thing open. This the black swan event can crack it open and of course if there's anybody left to to look through the wreckage. You'll be able to of course show prove oh that thing that wasn't some random event. That was the the clear and un unchangeable direct consequence of these earlier actions and you'll be right. But it won't matter because we can't see it as it's happening. It's. It's all subterranean. It's all are. It's you're stepping onto like ice and the ice is cracking but not you know like at the top where you can see it. It's cracking it like the base and the cracks are like running and deepening but you're not seeing them and then this whole thing is just gonna burst out. It's not gonna. The thing about those is that by definition they cannot be predicted so like the same convincing people that a specific type of catastrophe is about to happen is just like trying to convince a bunch of people that a specific conspiracy theory about a significant crime like. I'm gonna prove that all the school shooters actually are mk ultra gladio people. Okay good you did it congratulations now what well now. I believe this cool. What are you gonna do with that knowledge. I'm gonna convince other people too well. If you convince them what are they gonna do with it. The same thing you did which is meaningfully nothing. The thing to take from this though is that you still have to live a life. You can't know any of this. You can have suspicions and you can have personal beliefs that guide your decision making which is what you should be doing all the time. But they cannot be ever a horizon to chase because you can't get there like that.

Why is the not why is the conspiracy fantasy a courtroom. Why is it always a courtroom. The conspiracy theory fantasy almost always ends in a courtroom revelation historically and why it is because the fundamental underlying notion of of the conspiracy narrative and the fact that it's rooted in libido politics and not in class politics again. There's you can the whole point of class. Politics is that it fuses the libido to class interest but that is something that only happens through the process of class consciousness formation which we have lost so fewer people have that what we have instead is just this floating politics that wants somewhere to go that wants a container and and conspiracy theories is the container that like it gives to downwardly mobile middle-class people people who have some proximity to home ownership and are feeling downwardly mobile plus of course a big chunk of the middle of persecuted minority groups who are much more generally alienated from capitalism than than white guys for example like guys and girls in the middle. Class of some relationship to capital in the form of homeownership. The fantasy there is that you get a you prove it in a court of law a neutral institution with power to adjudicate right and wrong and punishment. That's the important part you can prove something and then the court will make a judgment and it will be rendered and the and the the guilty will be punished and that under assumes a fundamental in legitimacy outside of class rule that adheres to institutions like the court and constitution. And that is. I'm sorry. That is that belief is incompatible incompatible with socialism because as soon as you believe that these institutions have valid have validity you have to have a personal understanding of why and that means you have to build a history of america where things like the constitution and the court system are did. Good work for people and help people out and it's like they did but only in a greater context of being the scaffold of like political of cultural social coercion that allows capitalism to be birthed. It's built in like this.

It is there's contradictions that are inherent here and and social the conspiracy theory. She seeks to flatten those and it says you get the court everybody understands and and or they ever understand and then they persecute it and and that's where q anon comes from. There will be a day when all will be revealed and the thing is it's just a socialist. It is just a secularization of the of the christian fantasy of apocalypse which by the way is the theological spiritual like supernatural version of the yearning for a communist utopia before you can get the dream of a communist utopia. You have to have the religious dream of the kingdom of heaven and that is why for q anon they have totally fused the coup the day that trump takes power with the second coming. They are identical in their mind because it is the great revelation everyone will know the truth and the truth shut them free. But we all know that's not true and the thing is you don't have to reject religion to believe this you just have to start from scratch.

These institutions when you look at them exist to perpetuate class rule and what that means it's not about assigning blame to specific institutions for our fate. It's saying given that would any situation exist and be ever be able to be brought into existence. When the system as such manned by people who believe in the system is presented with evidence that would require its own abolition would it go forward. No it would protect itself. They would never allow that court case to come forward and now you can say well we have. We don't want a court. We want a revolution. We want to make everybody so everyone understand and then rebel at once and that's another you know headlong run into a brick wall because again everybody knows okay. Kennedy was killed by the government how many of them are now going to believe politics that include a narrative where you know. Kennedy was killed because he wanted to stop the gays from taking over the government which is a basic threat of a lot of q and stuff where are their politics going to go when it's time to fight in the trenches.

You know what I mean if they're going to be organized around the the rooted land-based remaining capital that is at war with finance capital and is trying to amenitize itself the same way that the united states tried to imminentize itself in iraq as like a last-gasp effort to resist being dissolved into the world market as a because the thing is the united states is plot placed in the united As the center of global capitalism was always short. It could never last forever because eventually the system equalizes itself. There can be no america like eventually there can be no america in the global capitalist system. It will dissolve that poll because it it tends towards this equalization but it requires first you know It required the nation state as a birthing mechanism and it has gotten to a point where it's at least its usefulness but because we do have like institutions governed by people who have understanding of themselves as americans that's separate from the project of global capitalism. But they responded to that not by revolting against capitalism because they that is impossible to them to conceive of trying to invade iraq and take all of that soft power that we'd accumulated over the cold war and make it hard with a actual physically in manifested empire. The kind that had gone out of style after world war ii but that now in a in a mayday type situation.

We're gonna start grabbing for and we failed and that's why it's turned inward and now we're destroying ourselves in seek of in seek of finding who's responsible for this. This declension and punishing those accordingly so how did we get here how did we get here. The answer is the 1970s and 80s I'm sorry. We're now in the 80s. The 1980s and 90s which according to the authors of this book is where capitalism and a global assist of capitalism became not a horizon to be pushed towards but actually achieved imminence. This thing that we're all seeking one way or the other with either annihilation or with communion. You know barbarian barbarism or socialism classic thing. We're on the barbarism path and that's what's driving us all crazy because we don't want it. But we don't know what else to do okay. So we talked last week about what this meant in america. The buck breaking of the labor movement basically in the long and short and the creation of this credit. Economy where people are still going to be consuming and they're still going to be spending but they're not going to be spending wages that they earned as that were per share of profits of the industry. They worked in that was stuck they were never going to get raises of wages again they were going to get credit that would allow them to keep spending on the more and more advanced and cool technology that was capable of being pumped out out of the out of the tech. Boom or the the the tech revolution of the 70s which of course was something that was publicly funded and then privatized so that it didn't become this agora of human liberation that the california ideologist idiots thought oh. What's this material conditions intervene oh.

[51:39](https://youtu.be/As9VncnajFU?t=51m39s)

No they sell it all to the private market. Meaning it. All just becomes crap for us to buy and they further enslave us oh darn again. Why do you need you don't need the cia anymore. At this point you have a digital mk ultra that is just going to rewire every human brain according to the capitalist. Imperative mission accomplished sit back and relax but again that doesn't mean that the role of of enforcement goes away. It just migrates to the private sector and that that started in the 80s under bill casey after after the buck break. One of the things that got buck broke in the 70s was the cia and the national intelligence service in in general and bill casey solved that by creating a parallel privatized privately funded intelligence system that was outside of any america any democratic oversight. There had been theoretical oversight that was exercised in the 70s and now that was eliminated and that's that's the that's what iran contra was about in part was building.

This network with money that got turned into or that with coke money that came from turning contra supplied yayo into crack in america's inner cities at the same time that the black working class was being dispossessed the people who were at the lowest at the totem pole because they had the lowest access to pacified and coerced drugs and then the drug war on top of it. It's a perfect system but again these are all things that are caused by other things within it. It's this kind of beautiful unity and we only can like gawk at it and then try to live and apply our understanding of what we're looking at to the condition of building something different and totally separate from without its institutions and outside of its parameters. Because within it we are trapped okay so so. According to the panda granted and panic 80 to oughts is the 20-year period where capitalism totally fixes itself in the global system and and all of the nodes of resistance. Like the you know the developmentalist third world non-aligned countries or the the command economy soviet union. Those were all gone and the chinese had decided to hitch along for the ride. So the the the financial institutions that are built now internationally are the ones that took this from something that was a system among systems to the only system.

 and how this happened in europe was a further process of buck breaking different left-wing parties and letting them know the deal and having them get the ned baby speech and finding out you cannot do certain things unless you want to change your relationship to the state in a way that you just can't fathom because you don't believe in enough you believe in yourself and again you didn't choose it. You were born that way it was dissolved out of you. It was leached out of your bones. What were you supposed to do so you get francois meteron who and while everybody else is electing reactionaries we get thatcher we get reagan in france of course. Those zig when everyone else is zagging just to show that they are different and that they're not part of the herd. They elect francois meter on this fire breathing socialist platform and with an absolute commitment to doing the opposite of neoliberalism advancing state control of the economy the way that the bennites were proposing to do in in the labor party. They got crushed where the what might the swedish social democrats were proposing with the meidner plan which chile was trying to do and you know in chile because it's in the periphery you. That's where the cia shows up to give guns to a bunch of psychopaths and have them murder everyone but in in europe in comfortable old europe where everybody's sitting on their asses and having their 15th red wine break of the day. Capitalism is doing pretty good for them. They just want to live better conditions under it so when the state says to them like meter on like they said to meet her on okay. You can go forward with this and we will destroy the economy because the thing that had been created by the end of brenton woods was the ultimate discipline like the ultimate whip hand had been created when they unpegged currency and they got rid of fixed exchange rates because when you let exchange rates float. It means that a particular country can be targeted for destruction to have all of its vacuum and the this happened in a number of countries that the the us empire wanted to discipline who in the third world particularly like zimbabwe and stuff venezuela.

 it's a capital. It's a capital flight. It's called and it basically means a run on your currency. Your currency becomes so scarce in the country that you can't make payments because your cur the capital has fled and turned into money elsewhere. All of those all those franks are going to get. It turned into deutsche marks and and sterling in dollars and you're not going to have any money left. We are cutting you off basically because your ability to build anything to use an economy depends on this global cat trade system so that means you have to work with our our fun bucks. You have to use the itchy scratchy dollars that we gave you so unless you're willing to do a revolutionary government that institutes like wartime scarcity and probably go to war with your neighbors like shooting war with your neighbors. If you're willing to do that then you can try to have your your socialist france in this moment but if you don't want that if you'd rather stay president of france and for all the socialist and mps to stay in their position with their three mistresses and their four pierre tears and their their four-hour snail-based lunches of course mederon and the rest of these guys take the deal he went to he went around to the ear to the other european governments first and he said hey we can create our own coordinated exchange rate group outside of the system and like you know pool our resources basically like and create a bigger pool of economic activity that could like you know generate its own flows and it kind of it could have worked because you know. Western europe is incredibly rich and very um. It's it's very rich and very advanced. It's it's like the most one of the most advanced parts of the world in terms of capital accumulation that means you could actually maybe build something more efficient thanks that you could do cyber sin on steroids maybe but everyone told them to social democrats.

I think it's very poignant so so miranda of course classic french. He was a lifelong socialist. That's what he believed in but you know. He was also the most french man of all time he had like a bunch. He had a secret family and a bunch of mistresses. His secret family came to his funeral that apparently was not awkward at all everyone's like oh yeah. There's this other family so I guess it wasn't even a secret. It was just other family and then so he was. He was a man of appetites. He was a man of pleasures of the flesh and so of course he doesn't want to go to town and he doesn't want to fight a guerrilla. A check of our guerrilla war leave that to the puritans you know I think it's very fitting though that when he was dying you know he had his part in building this machine and of course what he got out of. It was a fantasy of european integration so they basically told him look. We're all doing a structural adjustment. You're going to have to kill the dream of socialism. But we all now because of these floating exchange rates the europeans we got to come together. We have to create our own currency and the us basically gave permission right then and there in the early 80s late 70s to allow the europeans to go start of this process of getting their own currency in the atlantic system not outside of it. That's the important part and of course mederon's able to convince themselves. This is gonna be the few. This is gonna be. The vessel of human liberation is the european union and it's not gonna be my generation but future generations who will lead us to the promised land.

So I can just be a dirty old frenchman. The rest of my life and help help dismantle socialism as even as it was any nascent structures of it within the french state so when he was dying and he's looking back at his career he decided to have as his last meal. Basically a sumptuous array of pleasures with the centerpiece being ortolan bunting order on bunning is one of those things that was like a cool reddit fact that people learned about in like the mid-aughts and then it like made its way 10 years later to mass culture and now you know like. It's there's a succession reference like. I think there's another show that has got ordell on It's it's now just like you know hey. It's sort of like project paper clip that's another thing like people just started talking about hey. You know we've got a bunch of nazis from germany after the war what and then you know now there's like four shows where are where they're playing. I've seen two streaming series in the last couple years to have to to needle drop tom. Lehrer's song werner von braun you know but yes.

[61:59](https://youtu.be/As9VncnajFU?t=61m59s)

It's a songbird an endangered. I believe songbird that is a fried whole in cognac drowned first. I believe and then you are supposed to eat the whole thing whole in one bite with your head under a napkin. In fact. I think the reason a lot of people learned about. This is because of a famous a relatively popular article that was written about it by a journalist who was at the at the dinner and you eat it under a napkin because you're hiding your shame from god because you are killing and eating this like perfectly pure little beautiful thing and you're chomping through the gristle and the bone the tiny little bones they're snap. They're stabbing you in the mouth and it sort of is a ritual that's supposed to you know ground you in your pleasure and like situate pleasure within a greater concept a greater context of sin and that like you your pleasure is at the at the at the pain of others and like we all deal with that the thing about the rich is is that the rich turn it into a sadistic. Fantasy of domination. They turn the the the misery that they carry out on others into a pleasure to themselves. This is the ritualized element that like the nerdier members of our ruling class do again not because it's in. It's the re it's power. But because they got to do something they're not going to actually be pressing any buttons that mean anything so why not go to the epstein island and go to bohemian grove and molest. Some kids together and believe fantasize that you're actually in control of anything because you imagine you're like summoning you know the spirit of pure domination from the earth and you're embodying god in that way.

 have fun the wheel is turning no matter what it's all on autopilot. You're just you're rich. So we don't you're not a threat to the system. You. Spending. The money is one of the out the the consequences of the system. Like these people getting rich is not why capitalism is doing what it does. It is a algorithm. It has an unfeeling imperative to create profit. It doesn't care where it goes. We decide where it goes and that means that we're going to let our rich people sit around and imagine they're in charge of something and that means people dumbasses going into politics. Smarter ones going into secret societies to do fuckfests because you've gotten past the fantasy of thinking that you're actually in charge of your carrying out political decisions and then you get to the point where okay the actual violence that I carry out on real human beings is is the real power and I can ritualistically magnify it to be my power over others that is really just the machine's power that I'm piggybacking on top of so. It's all a system of people fantasizing about agency. So like we at the bottom. I mean I'm not at the bottom but I mean like outside of the power structure you know look up at them and we imagine what they're doing and we tell these stories about what they're doing to explain why they dominate our lives and they're also telling these stories to each other to explain yes. That's good. We should be doing that but the thing that we have in common is that our actions are extraneous to the outcomes it's called.

Ortolan bunting is the name of that meal it's technically illegal but there are places if you're rich and famous enough. But I do think the idea of meteron like at the end commit doing that what's really fascinating is did that mean did he do that as like a ritual of acknowledgement of the pain he has caused and as part of some greater expiation you know but like to covered in this like facade of pleasure but like indicating a deeper yearning for penitence or was it a fully self-conscious essentially demonic ritual. The thing is you'll never know can't bring him back not. I i don't I did not speak french. So even if we got him on a ouija board. I wouldn't be able to tell you and and the thing is is that the conspiracy question that all ends up leading in his head. It all ends up at the end of the day leading in the head of people who at the end who are also along for the ride not the same degree but in the final crux of it are which means their most extravagant acts of personal will are going to be their least consequential ones. The stuff that's the most against the grain and like personally violent and flamboyant is the stuff that can't be processed through the system itself. The the pleasure they can't get elsewhere but also the pleasure that is dependent upon the underlying system of oppression that they're part of all right so meteoron and the french they get buck broken.

They do the great reverse they do the great turnaround. In 81. They say all right we're doing structural adjustment. They got us because if we don't they'll just they will create hyperinflation because when the money goes away the only thing you can do is print more of it but the actual capital has gone. All you have all you have left is this fiction of money and it represents capital as soon as it doesn't represent capital. It becomes completely fictitious which is why the numbers stop meaning anything and that's why it was always very silly to imagine hyperinflation in the united states because hyperinflation is a disciplinary tool from the center of capitalism. Now what's changing now though is we're in the final stage shift to where america's central role is being removed and it's fighting back. Iraq was part of it trump's tantrum the war in ukraine. These are sanctions against iran and venezuela. These are all part of the process of the attempt to create a stranglehold building a wall and building the cyber wall and building alliances with all the tin pot coke dealing maniacs who run central america and of course trying to undermine the pink tide in latin america.

Now the thing is though nobody who's resisting them is resisting them along class lines. They're all resisting them along the lines of the interests of their national bourgeois russia that's national bourgeois china. At this point. I'm sorry. It is national. The thing is china you can't really say bourgeois. It's something new and that's what makes china so interesting and why I am at the end of the day ambivalent about it too soon to tell is true and lai said and also it doesn't matter. That's the beauty part. I can leave it at that because what am I gonna do if china's good. I'm going to go to china I guarantee you they don't want me there. I'm going to stay here and just cheer them on for the sidelines with a pennant. How's that going to do.

I can leave it at that that's the beauty of this whole approach is that it allows you emotional freedom from certain subjects that could suck the orgone out of you so surprise and then of course in england. Not only does do the does the right take power but the labor party would you know this one of the oldest and most influential and labor social democratic parties in in europe has its socialist principles ripped out of it by new labor. So I mean and of course the sdp had already been neutralized. So this is the end of the left and of course the the communist party. In italy is going to come apart in tandem with the soviet union so you're losing any real nodes of political resistance and of course this integration that's now going to happen what's the shock of shock. It begins with the end of capital controls completely because capital controls are legal regimes that states can use because remember.

[70:23](https://youtu.be/As9VncnajFU?t=70m23s)

The state is in charge. Technically of this of this whole operation. The state is there at the guidepost or at the trading post like putting up and down the arm you can say yeah. No you can't take capital out of the country that means we can do other things and avoid hyperinflation and avoid having our economies destroyed by a capital strike and that is some that is one of the things that made capital initially resist post-war state the postwar breton wood system because they thought oh no this is going to be if this is the new deal overseas. Then it's capital controls are in all these countries which means our money will not be safe and they were resistant to it but guys like harry dexter white literal communists who were making these systems thought to themselves like mederon did. This institution is going to bring us about world cup communism. He could look at the bretton woods system and say we're going to constrain capital and move the direction of investment in a social direct in a social of vector. We're going to turn the flow of money flow capital development towards social ants and that was a big no-no and of course. They didn't even get the initial. They they only really allowed themselves the law. The the reserve themselves the right to impose them in the future. That's all they really got because it was watered down so much because you know the flow was against the left. Even though these guys didn't even know it yet. They're they're high level. They didn't know it was it was over before that it was already like the tide was turning these systems were going to be turned against the entire you know working class everywhere but at the time they thought it was real But this now the newmar the new world. They can no longer afford those baubles no more capital controls goodbye and this is going to be how these states are all brought into line like There's a big um. There's huge currency explosions in argentina and then of course mexico and there's the the asian tiger economies in the 90s. I think we'll probably talk about that in the next chapter. Start popping and that's all because of currency flow because of the the floating currency exchange system. That's how george soros made all this money by the way I wonder why he's such a social liberal. He's literally the embodiment of the global capital flow as like a disciplinary structure outside of the control of any one government including ours which is why our middle which is why our political class is going insane and we're eating our own brains because we cannot recognize our position and negotiate from it. The way that nixon tried to the way that bernie has talked about doing because we're afraid of what the fall would look like because we were afraid they would treat us like we did to treat them because at the end of the day we are all middle class subjects in our political efficacy because our institutions are fully working class or middle class but again not middle class in the sense of even really a relationship to capital so much as a an identity that is wrapped with notions of race gender nationality culture that warp us away from expressing a solidarity in our politics. We can only hurt each other because helping has been has been literally eliminated from the programming so this means that that london which has been this clearinghouse for us dollars and a way around bretton woods from the beginning and a big back door of us capital into and out of europe but had remained their original structures because you know london was the first what's the place where like classical liberal liberalism was born where the idea of like independent currency independent an independent market already existed so there were very few formal regimes of regulation that the city of london had to push against when becoming this you know global headquarters of capital but it had you know but its institution still needed to be updated and part of that was getting rid of any restraints on derivatives because that's where all the action's going to be now. The the a thing that exists now multiplied through time to try to stave off the crisis of profitability that's at the center of the system and isn't going anywhere and is only exacerbating But it also got for the first time in scc. It's not called that but it has the same function and it's because neoliberalism is not the state.

Like deregulating things. It is the state changing how it regulates things that's it. It is going from regimes of um of enforcement against actions because the the new deal thing that pervaded the 70s was basically. No you can't do that you can't do that you can't do that hindrances on the actions of capital what comes in its wake is things that expedia capital in the form of insurance against risk. Because the thing about a financialized economy is that it is much more volatile. The you got a classic productive economy. Sectors can sort of assumed to be in the long run profitable but if you shorten it up if you make it if you shorten that time frame it becomes much more internally volatile and that means a lot the risk of like catastrophic collapse like that the kind that break down an economy and and throw a wrench into this whole system accumulate and so you've got to minimize those chances now you used to minimize them by preventing institutions from doing things that would lead to that kind of a speculative bubble. Starting with the late 70s early 80s. It becomes we will now ensure that if it does happen it will not lead to a collapse because we'll just pump liquidity into the system. We will just because all it is is um when when you have overproduction it is. It's just there's no money being made to be spent. You just dump money into the system and you solve the problem until it the real business cycle kicks in like that's. The that's the thing at the basis of the of the of the of the austrian fantasy of the of the of this is that oh you can always just pump money into the bottom and again that is in one condition that's not any more stable than the keynesian. Fortis to compromise that that came before it where you had a regulatory state and public spending that wasn't stable either because the material conditions deteriorated well our. Material conditions have deteriorated and this is also when goldman sachs becomes like a global brand. Goldman sachs is not one of the old boys on wall street and there's and they end up overtaking all of them in doing business in europe and selling all these new um instruments and that's because the old dog can't really learn new tricks you know. Scientific and financial progress is measured in funerals. You know it's the cuny and incommensurability question. You have this new world and you have these old bankers who just don't know how to accommodate it. Because all of their structures are based on these obsolete paradigms. The new guys hungry less at the end of the day lazy because they're at a in a lower spot in the totem pole on the ch in the chain of the food chain have a motivation to adapt and they do and then boom they're over. There and goldman.

Sachs becomes the vampire squid that like eats the entire economy and that basically administered they become the jp morgan basically of the the 2008 crash because tonight it's amazing it's 100 years 1907. You have this crash that is rescued by a liquidity dump that is coordinated privately by jp. Morgan Then you they build the federal reserve and like they create this. This this new system to regulate the thing you have the but you have the great depression and you have the ups and downs in the market and then by 2008 100 years later. The government is carrying out at the end of the day what is just the same thing as what happened with morgan the the The ins. The the orders of a player on the board looking to stabilize situations for the state stabilize the situation for their own gain which is why what we get instead of a re-regulatory state instead of public investment. Again is just liquidity at the bottom that is doing class war on behalf of the rich. But it is it is just more currency which can be done from the center of the system but again our centrality is waning. This is a an emergency mission we're banging on the button to try to keep this thing propped up because we've given up on the hope of of gracefully changing our lives. It's gonna have to crack up the forces that would have moved us towards accommodation with the forces. As they exist were all destroyed. They got assassinated. They got purged. They got out maneuvered by a more concentrated more technologically advanced more coherent concentration of human energy around the the magnet filings around the iron bar of capitalism. So goldman sachs is out here dealing out these these instruments in europe and meanwhile all the european banks start embracing american practices. America's best practices look at these guys these guys are killing it they have lower unemployment than us they got everybody wants us treasuries. These guys are are where it's at we want to be like them and one of the things they embrace is the notion the the theological concept of shareholder value that there is only a short-term fiduciary responsibility which of course.

This is the ethos you need when you have shortened the time frame robbing from the future to keep things. Going you have to hit the the empirical way. It's not something that you're like oh observing and then saying that's the right thing to do. It works in practice. No it's deeper than that. It's theological. That's what they believe in and that's why now we can. They can. They can carry out trades that are eating out eating from within the heart of the thing that they're trying to preserve because they can't preserve that without undermining their deeper loyalty to the shareholder in the moment which is a fantasy. It's a it's a theological delusion that they're that they're wrapped up in one of many that flow through all of us at every level of the chain um and so in this context these new newly americanized firms in europe and goldman sachs are flowing the fdi back and forth we're getting a huge huge surge in foreign direct investment both ways it's european money coming out of or europe or it's dollars being bought by europe in the form of treasury bonds because the new volcker rates are so much higher that the return is better and then coming back in the form of europeans buying american exports and and and american real estate stuff like that like bringing the dollars back the title flow ebb and flow title gravity. So europe europe has higher unemployment than the united states during this period consistently through the 80s and a big reason for that is that in the so I said that when you had the big drop in profit everybody did basically the same thing in the businesses. The things that they've been told to do if the economy if like the profits drop then you invest more in the business you invest in becoming more efficient. Like that's. The first thing you're supposed to do. It's a native instinct and they teach it to you and all the good business schools problem is the united states that um the efforts to to make it more efficient ran into the organized workers who said yeah. No we don't want to be more efficient. What the are you talking about we want Efficiency means a more alienated work day for me. No thank you. I need more money. If I'm going to do that you want me. You want me to work for less money and alienate myself. More no thank you They were eventually broken but like it it made it so that that initial attempt to prop back up but failed in europe where the working class was much more organized in the united states.

Those efforts to become more efficient were even more easily and quickly thwarted so unemployment stayed up because you know those firms. It's it is true like they lost their efficiency. Now again efficiency is not a good abstracted out of its relationship to capitalism. You know it's like they don't have to become more efficient to get to fix profit we could get rid of profit. This is only on their underlying capitalist terms that this is a choice that has to be made but the choice that they end up making is all right fine. You you don't have you don't get a job. Then we don't have these profits we're not paying you. So you can sit on your ass. But again it's a it's a mark of working power now in japan. One of the reasons they did not have an inflationary crisis in the 70s is that when the japanese firms decided to start making more efficient their processes to rescue profits they were going up against basically nothing because the japanese working class had been completely lobotomized by the fascist imperial japanese state just like the german working class has been decapitated in west germany which is of course like has. The least has has the most american-like political economy that is built up after world war ii. So there's no working class that could really resist it and so you know they were bought off with with high interest rates. In the in the 70s. I mean they were bought off with a high savings rates and the ability to like save money in the 50s and 60s and then they were just you know hyper-exploited. But the european governments all realize there's nothing. They can do internally to fix any of these crises because it would mean saying what they meant it would mean saying like hey. We actually have to you have to work for less if you want to work. They want to say that so they had to walk talk around it and so politics became this argument about like if we could get a euro together if we could get a euro yeah. The japanese thing didn't eventually burst in the 80s because all they had they were like us like at the end of the day. All you have is is more money in the system and eventually it pops the thing that's preventing it from popping now. It's just there's nowhere for it to go. But that's gonna change with time. But you know. It's a question. Is there a pop or does the bubble. I would say that we're in a situation where the bubble doesn't pop it. It it is drained but it is drained in a way that is very violent and not smooth and in fact horrifying. But it's not does not destroy the central machine that is necessary remember to keep all this going because they still need the u.s state with its money and its nukes to not fall apart. They really need america to still be america as we understand it where the treats flow more than anything like you can't have a country with 330. 3 000 nuclear weapons and you know a currency with its level of market penetration and like the consumer heartland of the world you can't just have them fall into oblivion because then everything will fall apart. Now. Eventually they could fall into oblivion but it would have to be long after their power had been depleted through that exsanguination. I'm talking about and that's why I think it's more likely that the thing is going to be just. Dracula drained to death because the other is a a outcome that you know. Other stakeholders in global capitalism have a interest that aligns with capitalism to prevent but eventually eventually you cannot sustain profit and human intervention in the system. Not just the democracy human intervention of any kind and when I say that I mean people acting within the system and believing themselves to be in part in control of it and then we're going to be if there's people left. They're going to be like the people in crimes of the future. If anyone has seen that movie just a bunch of aesthetes whose are you know living in the ruins but are technologically kept in sort of a bubble with the last remaining profit being accumulated because it has to go somewhere.

 just you know doing rituals of sublimation of their sense of responsibility for their condition and why things are the way they are so anyway in japan. They were swaddled like a baby all through the 70s. Just you can have capital controls. You can have tariffs but we're not we're going to let in all the japanese. Stuff you want because you are too crucial to geo strategic politics. In asia. You are our bulwark because remember china fell in 52 or 48. I'm sorry china fell. Japan is the only country with like the left that has is anything like a developed power to like project and and circulate american power throughout the region. So they had to keep it propped up. So they allow their industry to just almost overnight go from like you know textiles they go they do a speed run through the whole 19th century. They go within a few decades they go from textiles to um to light machinery and electronics to like they go through the same process that you know killed. However many million people in russia it all goes out peacefully because it's being all the misery is elsewhere. It's it's in the places where value is being pulled from the earth. At no recompense you know through coercion and it's getting. They give it they swap it. I mean like you can look at south korea and japan basically were given the the profits of african economic activity during that whole time and this means they have a weak labor movement because its structures have been destroyed by the war and then you know they didn't get high wages there But they were able to save more money and and imagine like a horizon of security and home ownership which kept them relatively docile you know along with whatever cultural processes there might stamp down class conflict so yeah. There's lower inflation higher on a high but higher levels of exploitation and and that so you have there's lower inflation during this period 70s. But it's because you get on one hand high exploitation and then the other a low cost of capital in the form of cheap. Credit low interest rates which go all the way through the 80s until they're no longer sustainable in a in a global system of of circulating capital and circulating currency and popped and that's where you get the the 90s as the japanese lost decade. I mean these were people who were americans were freaking out about japan taking over the world. Hw went over there and barfed on their prime minister. Michael. Crichton wrote a book that became a movie about japanese intrigues and industry and oh man you should see it rising sun.

 sean connery will wesley snipes. It's a hoot name. It's a hoot nav the movie gung-ho if everybody has any scene. Everyone has any seen that one with with michael keat with michael keaton. That's a good movie ron howard. I believe it's one of his better films honestly. I think it's kind of underrated um of course.

It's you know it's capitalist propaganda but it's hollywood. But it's a fun movie but anyway all of a sudden overnight yeah never worry about the japanese and you know the reason they couldn't hack it take the ball from us and like go to the super. Saiyan level is because they didn't have the population they didn't have the level of capital development to do it They couldn't hold it up and the reason we're not having a pop now is because china can't do it. That's that's what's going to keep. Things from popping off is that china can't do it yet there's and then honestly though the thing is. I don't think china can ever do it because when I say it I mean harness themselves to capitalism in a way that promises like a continued standard of living rising for their citizens that can't happen in the in the ecological and echo geological context that we live in and the thing is they know that and so that means that perhaps they're going to bend this curve towards an actual global system. A global circulation with no center and that would be them basically like cutting off their lower limbs and saying like oh the least advanced of us are just going to eat eat it and they'll say look that's terrible but what's the alternative here. What's the alternative here annihilating all life on earth and because they you know there's still a soul in the party. They won't do that that's the hope anyway again don't know not my problem really and again if I knew for sure. What would it make me do. It would make me try to convince you of it and again if you if you agreed with me. What are you going to do again what rather wince repeat our discreet. Opinions on any individual subject can't matter there's only the collection of our opinions adhered to our experiences and emotions that can generate action can generate a will to anything a will to act that is not determined by what those specific things are so.

It's just it we all have to recon configure what we mean by politics but before that bubble burst in the late 80s. You had this huge profit bubble explode in japan. That money had to go somewhere and so it came into american investment. That's why people freaked out partially not only were their cars much more competitive than ours. The way people were buying japanese cars like crazy but they're also buying up real estate in the united states again the ebb and flow thing you know we bought their cars. They come and buy our real estate. The same thing happens with arab countries and in america in the 1970s it's in network. They were buying up treasury bills during this high interest era. But that cheap yen had a political problem in the united states because it was leading to or it was understood to be led to in popular culture because here is this foreign country doing something we can't. Reckon with what we're doing to ourselves but we can reckon what a foreign country is doing to us. So in this foreign country is that setting their yen too low so they can have more competitive vehicle prices with us because their cost of labor is lower and they can leverage that into accepting less for the car because they've undervalued their currency because they're privatizing that they're privatizing rather than adding to the public purse that productivity raise that's not fair and that they would say make them revalue it and because it's It's it's a foreign policy. It's another country and because the us both parties have no interest in like disabusing them the of the idea that yeah. It's japan's fault because they didn't want to say yeah. This is actually policies we're carrying out they said yeah they got to stop it. So. There's this plaza agreement that there's an agreement to bring down the cost of the yen bring down the cost of the dollar or bring up the price of the end to bring down the price of the dollar which had just gotten way too strong in that period too many dollars in the us had to it had to they had to go elsewhere. They needed more exports and so that was the hope anyway and this this thing this. This agreement integrates japan more fully into the finance system and it crucially makes it totally subject to american markets.

It's very important and what they do is. They end up investing a lot of this money in the auto sector in the u.s like I said they didn't just close a bunch of factories in the rust belt in in the 80s. They also opened a bunch of factories in the southwest and the southeast in the non-union parts of the country that started putting out like hired fewer people because it was more highly automated and paid them less than union workers. So it's like. It's all part of the depressionary spiral on labor. But it's still you know. It's investment that builds jobs just at a lower level um. But this is all premised on cheap money. The cheap money gets the point of instability. They raise the rates and the whole thing pops and the japanese economy collapses and I honestly wonder if that's not what they're hoping to do right now. I kind of think that they're looking at what happened with japan and how yeah you know their economy basically collapsed there but not as part of a global. Great depression. That's important like they're still like the lights are on elsewhere and you know it it. Them up but they're still around. They're. They're still you know in the g7. They're still part of the team. They're on the fashion. They're on the they're part of the capital cycle. Here they're moving the capital through the way it has to be maybe.

We could do that here and of course that you know overlooks the fact that that the sinews of state are so rickety here and the social network that allows people to accept something like a massive collapse of living standards with something approaching equanimity is is liquidated so it'll be very interesting to see if they're if they're if they're pulling out a japanese late 80s type deal or late early 90s. I can't remember so for the rest of the world while this is happening and the financialization splits through everything these guys who are trying to catch up to the first world with their input substitution and sometimes with the aid of the us who understood that these like if not for the communists the threat of the communists these states have to be structured. They have to be durable that means there has to be some sort of domestic economy. So there is like a grudging support for isi isd and for you know the larger of the post-colonial countries and the developing states in latin america to build their own economies. But when the volcker shock kicks in and people call it the volcker shock now kind of you know to talk about the interest rates as a whole. But the volcker shock to me refers specifically to how it was felt in latin america because there really was a shock in a way. It wasn't anywhere else because they had borrowed a bunch of money to do their to defund their you know economies and to to keep the development system. Going and trying to you know develop those internal markets that are so crucial and they needed to do it on borrow money because you know they were running uphill with a backpack and when that interest rate hits their borrowing ledger. They all of a sudden basically go and solve it because they cannot pay the new interest rates. It's basically what happened to the adjustable rate homeowners in 19 in 2008 and of course the imf is there to do there what they did in um to do. There what they did in england structural adjustment on the condition of the bro. The breaking of the public sector and the end of trying to build sorry buddy you're not building an industry anymore except Some of you can be a place for foreign capital to park itself and provide a low-wage proletarian labor. For you're not gonna have any domestic industry with like a domestic distribution of profits.

No no those profits come with us you we leave you the the cost of maintenance and we leave you the pittance of salary. We give to these people whose exploitation is the whole point of the operation and that means you can't develop you're done everyone's done everyone's treading water and been seeing the thing slowly fall apart ever since which is of course why there's this big. At least part of the reason why there's a large immigration problem now because the at the end of the chain once we now have immunitized realized global capitalism. Global capitalism means like industrial or some countries close to capital with domestic consumer industries at all of every level and a consumer economy and a consumer economy to an extent has to have a political component. It has to have a public sphere of discretion for an order in order for the whole cycle of of consumption to to generate like you have to be seeking something you have to be seeking something through the affirmation of choice that is elsewhere denied you and that that dream relies on rituals of choice and that means you have to have a ritual political choice but that that ritual has real effects on like how exactly efficiently capitalism can operate but in these in these places that got capitalism last where there was no development because all of the profits were first exported directly for cap for the west in the form of imperial spoils or after the end of imperialism extracted by the multinational corporations that came as I said and did what they later were able to do in latin america. After this the volcker shot and that created this new bipolar world where you've got people at one end concentrating consuming the production of people at the other end because you know the actual production is at the level of resource extraction and manufacturing and shipping. That's still old-fashioned dickensian victorian capitalism. The kind that should lead to the building of durable working-class political and frankly military institutions that are able to fight to compete with capitalism for power. But we have those now scattered and broken throughout a geographically diverse periphery and then little blobs of internally geographically diverse poverty within. It's a hell of a system.

[104:19](https://youtu.be/As9VncnajFU?t=104m19s)

I gotta give him credit for it and by him. I don't mean any of us we're too stupid but the real god of capital. I gotta give it to him old old satan. I really do think it's it is. It is a real god that displaced and dethrones the old god for everyone. That's what I mean though. It's not not for just believers for everyone because even though you know you had horrifying regimes of class rule. Before that you had notions of a holy and a sacred that had transcendent qualities that transcended any individual and that could at any time touch any individual and I'm not just talking about christianity any all of the great and small religious traditions but those feelings persist because they're human feelings but our name for them.

Our names for them has now been They've been drained and sacralized and turned into these empty categories that are only cynical shells for class rule and for accelerating alienation and surrendering of human value to an algorithm. A a incantation a spell but you know the apocalypse comes for all of us but not all at once that's the fantasy like in the early 1600s. Everyone in europe christian and protestant was 100 convinced that the world was about to end and the thing is for them. The ones who died in the in the in the in the crisis of the 17th century from like 16 18 to 16 like the 30 years war era and a little bit before it came if you died during a village destruction by some swedish. Cavalrymen or or of a resurgent plague epidemic that rampaged through the continent or of a famine which were the frequent result of punctuated crop failures caused by the little ice age by the climate shift that dropped global temperatures by two degrees centigrade. One way or another you that death was part of a great tribulation and therefore your death had the had that architecture to it you found out like god's judgment. You found it one way or the other um but then there's what about everybody left what about everybody who lived. It felt apocalyptic but you know their whole lives had sucked. It was apocalyptic in once once they survived it in retrospect. It becomes just some more stuff that happened and the apocalypse stays on the horizon because it always has to because they cannot reconcile their lives to their to their values because we live under class rule which was never overthrown by this conv. This convulsion and so we have to build new structures around these terms with and and give our feelings a relationships to these these terms and it meant that what we were worshiping the whole time like once it comes into being is not. It's not any embodiment of human value. It is an embodiment of the value of the extraction of profit which is domination which is separateness and difference. It's it's literally the it's anti-matter and you know it's part and parcel of life. It's built into our alienation from ourselves that is an inherent to human life. You don't get rid of alienation completely. It's impossible.

We're not animals. We can't. We are different animals. I should say our our capacity for reflection means that we cannot be unalienated the way that we imagine fantasize. We could be and the way that we imagine animals are and that is always going to be there um. But the question is what name do we give it and we've made. We've given that that gap that that little that separation instead of trying to to remove it with our concepts. We are deciding to worship it. We're worshiping the void the separateness and all of our actions in the market reinforce that that's what those words mean because we have this roman conception of identity centered on possession ownership. That's why the empire never ended. Philip was correct and I think that grab grow to go back to the dawn of everything they make a convincing case for what was life what what life was like when you know that alienation was just something that was dealt with as part of a more grounded and holistic politics and and religion. This is the crucial part that that dealt with all that stuff that didn't allow the accumulation of alienation but again after time over time. Enough. Trauma is going to bend things in one direction or another and then if that trauma encounters the material to reify itself like horses and bronze. That is gonna do so and it's gonna dominate every other form of life because they don't have the imperative to own and then the romans are the ones who define that most purely and built. The most enduring institutions and structures of that reinforce these ideas over time so that when they collapse even though their power could no longer be extended out physically psychologically.

It was still the prevailing idea of the entire people and everything they built after that including their idea of christianity was built on top of it without knowing it without knowing that christ was trying to prevent that very thing from coming into being christ was tr was was saw in a tried to stop that thing from emerging now built by it molded by it that system of values that is deeper than any name we give to it because it it organizes our lives and our relationships with each other in ways that we can't choose. Then. Christianity becomes a parody of itself and christ becomes satan and of course. The protestants immediately decided like almost like martin. Luther starts off being kind of conciliatory toward the pope but like as soon as the pope tells him to off. After worms he was like actually the pope is the antichrist and it's like yeah of course of course. The pope's the antichrist because he represents to you everything about christianity that corresponds to the deeper rot of the ownership theology that our christianity is built on top of but he can't see it the experiences of life to allow him to see it and articulate. It don't exist so he has to project it onto the the catholics because if the catholics had just listened to him and read the book and come to the same conclusion as him well then god damn it everything would have been fine. We would have had our heaven on earth but of course we can't have that because these people who are most powerful in society they understand christ as the guy who gave them all the stuff they have and so they have to project to the other and then try to destroy one another and then when everybody's out of that they build a new god that allows them to sublimate that conflict like the protestants sort of have to just as things get worse. The protestants have to decide that the catholics are antichrist right that the pope's the antichrist because they have to they deal with all the horror that's happening and they have to stop it and this is how you stop it kill the antichrist but that means like actually going to war and that's disruptive. What's much better is if that the antichrist becomes invisible and all of the evil that we are doing becomes unspeakable and so we imagine that that satan is. This is is this thing tempting us. When in reality satan is our is our is the shape of our actions and it's only our sublimated guilty consciousnesses that require this this foil to contemplate and that's why religious monotheistic religion has to at the end of the day become fascistic. It has to try to seize the state to compel because more deeply than it believes in humans. It believes in ownership because it is this unreconstructed totalizing ideology that has to be stood against at its root and the root is nothing to do with the trinity. It has nothing to do with any theological question or moral question.

Beyond is there a transcendent right to property and I say no. I don't think there's any argument you can make for it that is not presupposed class society and I say we have lived out of class society before we can live in it again. But that's because we have the capacity to seize our institutions and direct them that way. We could only do it once we had the concentrated capital capable of it. That's why the medieval peasants could not build socialism. In the crisis of the 17th century. All they could do is do in die in starvations and famines and and raids by soldiers get killed in feudal revolts that they can't coordinate well enough to defeat. Like mercenary armies sent by rich princess. They either died or they you know blamed it on witches. That's the the rich craze of the 18 1630s is the world coming to the at the seams and someone having to be blamed for it. There's also obviously a bunch of anti-jewish pilgrims but the height of which mania was at the height of the old lady. On the edge of town you can beat the hell out of her. You can stake and you can set her on fire. You can do whatever you want to to vent the misery of your life that doesn't involve confrontation with power but you couldn't have because there's no structures to accommodate it. The working class is always supposed to do it. The working class wc failed in the 20th century. We are now in a situation where you cannot really talk about people as being members of a class. So we're just we're the global citizen. I guess. This is some heart and egry. But I do think it's true and we're still going to organize a long class. Though is the thing because the only people who are going to be alienated enough from the system to actually risk confrontation. With. It are those who are the farthest from capital and therefore the most the closest to real alienation and that doesn't just mean you know the global poor and unemployed reserve army but also the the most hyper-exploited among laborers which still need to be there. We have not fully automated this economy by a long shot. There's still plenty of people even at the center of the system that have to do shitty long grueling work for low money and so and the tools exist for them to organize. It's not going to look like the old organization though because those categories have been empty demeaning we're building new ones every day and I don't know what they are.

I hate having to always end it that way. But it's just a mandala man. It's the western fantasy that you can straighten the mandala and just walk up it like a staircase. You gotta keep going around in circles sorry you gotta. I know it's a cop out but you get to the top of the west chasing the red. The chasing the man in black and maybe you've got the el the horn of eld in your hand this time and maybe that'll mean something. But it's nothing that you can intuit all right so next tuesday. We'll talk about chapters 9 and 10 which is about going to be about the super hyper financialization leading up to the big collapse and then I think they're going to talk about what's next. I'm very interested to see how they talk about that because the thesis of their book is that the state is inextricably linked to capital. The u.s state has been the most important single institution in bringing about global capitalism but now we're in a situation where like the demands to to equalize the flow that are that a system in crisis requires are running up against the fact that the u.s government you know has a the u.s state is now have a directly contradictory interest to that because if they're not at the center of this thing we're not getting the treats anymore end of story and the treats are the only reason any of this works. I know that's snide to say oh treats you're talking about things like dialysis and you know school lunches. It's like yeah. I know. I know. But it's a consumer economy. It means everything from things. People really need these things that people don't really need at all but psychologically. They need them. It's it's the addiction economy and people are going to get weaned off at one reas speed or another and the faster. They're weaned off the more violent. The response is going to be the slower the weaned off and like you know and that's what the u.s wants to do but they're pulling against. Now they're pulling against the reins and so what kind of equilibrium do we settle into. That's the question. I would like to ask it and um apparently sam guindon. The co-author has been made aware of the stream and he might come on at the end when we're done with the book and talk about that I'd be interested to hear his thoughts so all right. This is another long one sorry about that next tuesday we'll talk chapters 9 and 10 the making of global capitalism bye-bye.
