Hey guys you guys watching. It's here. It's here. It's happening. It's really happening. This is real life. This isn't a dream you know that's right guys. What is it oh yeah. That's right. It's time we're grilling tonight. So the deal is. I'm gonna just do a little test. I just put some burgers till I get the off of the grill so got a steak. Here I've got eight a yummy looking guy. I know meat is murder and we need to eat less beef but damn it well. It's they're gonna have a little bit more oh. So you know trigger warning for participating in the bovine Holocaust I agree but I'm weak I'm a weak man anyway.

So we're gonna get. These coals good in this chimney which by the way somebody recommended on here that I get a chimney. So I don't have to mess with lighter fluid very thank very very thankful. This thing is honestly idiot proof which is great because I'm an idiot so you just dump the clothes. In here you life some newspaper underneath it and it just gets them all cooked up and then you dump them out and they're ready so what I'm gonna do is. I'm gonna be I'm going to be. What do you call it going to be preparing a steak after the fashion of my good friend and America's favorite Italian American comedian Mike Racine. One of the best chefs I know him and will are really kind of the two best cooks. I know and he gave me this this way to cook a nice piece of beef where you of reverse sear so. I'm gonna do indirect heat for about 10 minutes get it nice and kind of gray and then boom put it right on the fire for however it longs to get nice and scorched what doing the Viva see here out here. In this place.

We're doing the reverse see here get up out of my face thank you yeah. We're doing good. We're doing good guys trying to have a way to put this thing around so I don't have to hold it. It's kind of annoying actually you know what I got a I got a thing I'm gonna get little help hold on get it back. Sorry feels a little Blair which right there I'm sure that was kind of traumatic so sorry. About that guys. I got a little dude here that I use yeah so.

What do you guys what's up what do you guys want to talk about you. Gotta say guys I'm not. Gonna really take any questions about the protest movement and everything because I just recorded a one-on-one me and Chris for Chapel this week where I kind of tried to make sense of everything I've been putting together in my head and on here for the last week or so into something kind of synthetic and a unified field. So I really kind of spent on the topic and in fact now I feel really kind of relieved because I feel like I finally expressed what I've been trying to get at and I hope I hope people like it. I'm sure it'll be divisive. I hope it is. I hope some people get passed because if they didn't then I didn't really express myself all enough. But I feel good about it so anything else you guys want to talk about oh man.

Oh laughs alms assassination. I mean isn't has it. There been like a kind of a revert. A slow-motion drip by drip limited hang out about South African intelligence ship over the last decades like they let slip the stuff about killing Ruth first and then they let slip the stuff about beating Biko to death and let slip the stuff about the germ warfare and the nuclear weapons plans but it all kind of just went over by the by the way the same way that CIA over time limited hang out. There stuff you know and considering what they were up to. In the 80s I mean that entire regime was going through a complete nervous breakdown because they were so under so much pressure and and they were so terrified of losing that they went absolutely ham. They. They had bad torture camps in the middle of the the veldt where they had they were barbecuing people. They assassinated people all over the world poison people that there's there's accusations in a cold case Hammarskjold documentary about the assassination of members role in the Congo parenthetically that there's like a South African front intelligence company like a front medical company created by the South African Secret Service to spread AIDS in South. Average. None of that stuff would surprise me. The assassinator poem would have been totally in their wheelhouse of what they were up to bad guy. Cuz Paul really what Paul really was the the the point man for global apartheid divestment. He's one of the guys who organized what otherwise would have been a much more difficult task of getting everybody on board you know because otherwise South Africa you could have leveraged different sides against each other. You know triangulated like China against Russia or something.

Oh I ain't had chargrilled oysters and I am feeling I'm just thinking about. Though Oh Mon Ami you get those in there like you get them trouble would stop oh you pulled a boner. In there you crotch a bra delicious stuff ma'am. Ooh. I want to get some char grilled oysters out there. I think that might be a that might be one if I can get a hold of salt if I can get a hold of some fresh oysters. I think there's a purveyor around here might get some oysters get up. Hef do you like backpack full of them break them up in myself put. Some butter you get that garlic Bordeaux you put on there and then you just bought it on that file. You get that cool fire going here you just cared oh you put that board you cook that boar out down there ship because oysters you get really are never as good as the ones in restaurants because they get you know they get fried a place because that's where it's the mark-up is highest so it has to have a certain quality level that you don't necessarily have to have if you're getting a wholesale. So wholesale oysters are not gonna be as tasty raw. I mean there were always three is one of the best most perfect foods in the world but only if it's fresh only if it's the right kind rolling right ton of you seasoned otherwise. They're still great fry them up oh my god. Oh my god. Fry was too old a po-boy with therefore I what's the end oh oh oh oh slap your mama. But the chargrilled oysters are also phenomenal.

I had them in New Orleans. They were great. We kill em little. Em'ly you pull over gone. There. You you know all I could do even with a Oh child. I still put them horseradish. On. There you know I'm gonna spring that horseradish in there. Even with that boy I put that horseradish. I like that ten ooh that tangy horseradish it really opens it up.

I gotta say Cajun. Food is probably the best American food way I mean what's its competition I mean Southern. Cuisine is great very heavy though the barbecue is its own weird nerd fiefdom that honestly is kind of alienating because of how sectarian it is. It's like all right get over it though brisket pulled pork shoulder sort it out. I don't care. It's all fine just what's in front of me I'll eat it settle down like what else like New England like lobsters really good but you know they do better seafood in the goal. Even though the oysters aren't is good which is why they are usually better at New Orleans if you get a mic rider or char-broil because the Gulf oysters are not as good as the ones that the North Atlantic or or especially especially the West Coast Washington you might be losing weight. I don't know I think I've kind of looked like I've looked eating less during quarantine. So I think let's do it sorry sorry about that all right. Where's my all right. Here we go alright alright so now put these guys on a nice pile in the middle yeah alright alright button it over here and then we cover it. So now we can set and forget that one for a bit until it's time for the reverse. Here it's not hot enough. Some people are saying all right. I'll get some more. He told me 10 that's how when I put out put it on. He told me 10. But I got some more. I'll leave it on longer - I'll leave it on longer - I need you guys to help me so thank you for that advice.

Like I said this is. This is literally my first time doing anything more complicated than a than a hammer so thank you guys I hope you enjoyed the view of my butt while I was doing that medium-rare is usually what I get. It's really high-quality meat. I might go. I might go let me go rare. I don't know usually medium rare though seems like that's the ideal way the Colden path. It's all about finding the middle path and everything that is that is the righteous path. But it's the the fourfold path and that's medium-rare baby. Mwah I had a Easter's in Portland. They were great. I think my best port oyster experience. So it's probably Seattle does Washington. Those Puget Sound's boy boys or I think maybe the best boys. I already salted it. I rubbed up the steak. The steaks all rubbed up thank you for that thank you somebody asked me about.

[16:12](https://youtu.be/BXscppi_H5c?t=16m12s)

Buddhism was that I didn't I saw so I thought someone asked me about Buddhism if they want to repeat the question I'd answer that Oh No messages are being deleted. Is there a mob war because the mob going are the mods going to war oh that reminds me um. I'm gonna leave this in longer than I would have if I had more hotter coals to begin with but could you guys sorry. You said a 15-minute timer yeah give me a 15-minute timer. So I'll know to check actually. No. I'd like to check in like five. I don't have a watch. This is Mike and my computer's over there so if you give me a five minutes my alarm right now thank you. I think there is an internal chronometer. I don't know where it is yeah.

Buddhism is great. It did change my life too. It's good stuff. It's the closest anybody's got. It's the closest to the route that anyone's ever got all the way because you know no one is ever has all information in any kind. It's impossible so. It's only it's only a shadow of who could be. But it's the deepest to the root closest to the root really that guy knocked it out of the park. Old sin hearts of Gautama real yeah real Ted Williams type producer theologically just one of the one of the absolute conversation for greatest of all time. I've not been to a temple because I haven't been really able to rededicate myself until like I have this moment while walking in quarantine. So I haven't been anywhere like I haven't even been able to integrate the idea of being outside into my idea of my my day-to-day life. I mean it's my routine has been so prescribed. Now. It doesn't even occur to me to do the kind of things that would have just like everything feels gone. Everything everything feels very far because did the idea of going anywhere navigating physical space like oh where do I gonna do take a Kluber what am I gonna to what what am I gonna do take take take the train.

Like these are all recipes for Corona Corona Vail maybe to a population Corona feel you I mean never mind pop well welcome to Corona Ville population. You somebody is going ham in the chat apparently getting put into time out. They have time out how old are you. People are you all babies are you are you. The age of those kids that that Felix used to kill in fortnight. I will be really pissed if you guys are those little babies. If you little bottoms need to be spanked that is very disappointing to me. I thought I was engaging in some sort of you know quasi Socratic dialogue with an audience of adult peers not not knaves and infants ah I've been pranked pranked by the internet again.

I mean obviously when we talk about the way that modern post modernity infantilizes first world's subjects such as us. It's fair to say that yes you are all babies emotionally intellectually as am. I we are all we all have third grade emotional and intellectual reading levels because that's how they like to keep us as little perpetual budding pubescence who need to satisfy every new eruption within them with a purchase the ideal consumer. This is like the HMDA that the consumption machinery of a young person is like. It's like adrenaline that you get like a hummingbird burst because your personality is so unformed. You're so anxious that you're so vulnerable socially that purchasing becomes the anchor for identity and you grow out of that or you did you used to grow out of that. But as the stimulation increases your ability to prolong that that awful agony continue increases and this the capitalistic reward system incorporates that into its profit projections and all of a sudden you have elongated adolescents for everyone under the age of 50 because we've never ended that state of post-pubescent anxiety because that makes us better consumers. I'll tell you guys. Everybody asked me to recommend books. I am a fraud I don't read the books. I'm all grabbing words things like an infant I'm grabbing towards these ideas and then people say oh that's an that and I'm like I bet. It is that makes sense. I feel more like. This stuff is drawn from the ether than from any kind of accumulated rational understanding of the world that I've absorbed it's very hard to explain though all right five minutes let me check a check I got oh boy oh dear.

[22:10](https://youtu.be/BXscppi_H5c?t=22m10s)

It's not really it doesn't look like. It's getting much cooking. It still has to cook catch more with these holes. So I'm not really gonna start looking at it until the coals get more. We might not even it might might. I might run out of phone battery. Before this thing is done. I have to accept that but I want to make a good dammit if it doesn't work. I'll just stick to Nathan's Famous hot dogs and oysters which I think I'll be able to do relatively easily just get a big flame. You gotta make sure that it's kissing flame and then just watch.

Those babies just soak up that Bordeaux on I mean not the young Sergio Leone. I guess thank you I don't really know what he looks like he's certainly a talented director. He had so many wonderful films what is best Balkan nation Serbia number one number one sitter via no I mean I'm from Wisconsin right. So I have a I have a bulk in I have a I honestly do it for as far as an American can because I'm from the American Balkans I have a Balkan sense of of state identity. So I have to go with the bulk of state that Wisconsin is and we talked about this the other day and we came up with some stuff and I think thinking on it. I think the true answer is Serbia. It all starts with Serbia is Ohio that cannot be defeated. I think Croatia is Michigan then and I'm pretty sure that Wisconsin is Slovenia. So Slovenia is the best baltic country because I am from the Slovenia of the United States. The problem is what mmm. The problem I have is. Minnesota has a really good claim for being the most lavinia of the balkans - that's my problem. Matt Illinois Illinois is not Slovenia. Minnesota could be Slovenia. I mean obviously I like the idea of Slovenia being Wisconsin because then you got the scissor connection which is cute. But I think Minnesota might have a better claim on being Slovenia than Wisconsin does and then I don't know what Wisconsin is.

It's not Montenegro for sure. It's not Bosnia. I think Indiana is Bosnia but it's not like Macedonia maybe it's not even in the Balkans. Maybe. It's like maybe Wisconsin. This maybe Wisconsin's Bulgaria or something. Maybe it's Bulgaria Oh Romania. That's it Wisconsin's Romania nope nope you know what switch it and it's perfect Wisconsin Slovenia. Minnesota is Romania drop. Mike that's done we did it guys. That's I will not hear a discussion. This is 100% correct. I know it's not bulken but we're talking to the region because there aren't there isn't it. There aren't enough perfect analogs because the upper tier is different than the rest of the Midwest and it has to be reflected in that it's got to still be Slovak as a thing. That's why I can't be Greece oh. Romania isn't Slovak god dammit. This is Tarek. This is really difficult well. That's the thing is that Wisconsin is literally checkol shod. The Czech Republic I mean if you want to talk about direct come you know that bohemian those Bohemians moved to Wisconsin so it is literally in terms of the population that he came from Bohemia which is now the Czech Republic or Czech yeah. So if you want to go with that and like allow yourself to stay Slovak and move out of the Balkans proper. Then Wisconsin can be Czech Republic and then that leaves Slovenia to be Minnesota. It's all very complicated and made up is the thing and stupid and a waste of time but at least it's not hurting anybody. Yeah I realized Romania wasn't Slovak. I bungled that they got literally Romania a Romance language. I bungle it.

[26:50](https://youtu.be/BXscppi_H5c?t=26m50s)

I'm a bundler. I have sinned I've seen before the masses. I'm sorry looks like good going hard tonight. Last night. I was out and just bumped into a giant. I just stood out on folk on Flatbush. She waited boom. It's wild all right. We got a 10-minute warning you know what this is going well. It's He warned me about this. It's like. It's not a very it's not appetizing. It's like kind of grayish brown like but that's that's the layer you want it to be when you throw it on for the sear. So I think we're on track here if I get it on the other side. The way I got it on that side and I can get it hot enough in the middle. I think it'll be good. I don't know what the internal temperature is. I know I don't have a meat thermometer stop yelling at me.

I don't have a thermometer my friend I'm doing beef because beef is like the lowest risk that I'm gonna die. Beef is generally the least likely to give me a bug or something. That's why I'm picking a nice USDA prime piece of beef so that I can air because I don't want to get too vibed out on this. The whole point of this is to be chilling right to be like applying oneself to an object but not to the point of internal stress and if I can right now like if I was without you guys if you weren't on here I would have one but this is too many things for me to enjoy at any level any of them. If I hadn't if I had a thermometer to this mix it just throws off the equilibrium so I can't do it. I understand your concern and I'm trying to maintain that Zen posture that balance of all of all forces and I that means you have to know what to drop. You have to know what you can lose and in this case because I'm gambling that a nice piece of this is really good - this is like mail-order is is is not gonna have a parasite in it. I'm willing to roll the dice in order to have a good time and to maintain the chill and Grille attitude because a large part of it is that old cliche accepting the thing you know the ability to change the things I can change accept the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference I mean that is a cliche but like David Foster Wallace was 100% was correct when he said all those cliches that they use in like drug rehab and they are true and they do have profound meaning.

The problem is is that if you only learn them from the outside they're totally tinny and hollow and cliche you have to learn them from the inside. You have to actually go through your life experience to the point where you get enough understanding of something that it ends up being translated down to a little pocket version of that idea and all of a sudden that cliche has meaning and helps you move forward in your life. Positively. I'm not saying any of it is good. I know that 12-step is a scam and that Alcoholics Anonymous is. It's just a Christian cult. I'm just saying that those cliché phrases have meaning if you build it up within yourself. Got the copter snorting the copters keep stirring the sauce keep stirring the sauce into climb a mountain why did you do that Karen Karen. Why did you do that we needed that money they never would have found it. We're really giving me really really good.

Once y'all compass I always have to stand for Goodfellas. There's too much about it that I don't deeply expect to not give it the number one spot okay. Someone's saying a isn't a Christian cult. I'm just saying what I've heard. I have no idea. I'm saying I have no investing in these things being affected just that the be there is an observation. We made that really profound life-changing truths Barban all when expressed that's all I'm saying the real ship moves you off of your can and sets you on a new course you it when it comes out of you. It comes out in in flat cliches because if everyone else understood it the way you did.

[32:23](https://youtu.be/BXscppi_H5c?t=32m23s)

They would all be like that everyone has different levels of understanding in different vocabularies and they clang off of one another and so you just say the thing that's most easily transmittable which because the other person has not experienced what you did to get to where you are. It sounds like a cliche. It sounds meaningless because they have to do the work to get around into. It and make those words mean something that's what I'm saying I don't think it's gonna be bad. I don't think it's gonna be great or anything. But I think it might be okay so you know this was I mean my best ones are not gonna be on here. You know like when I'm really like it look the whole one of the chief grill. Hill philosophies is don't do two things at once only do one thing at a time so I'm already violating key. Grill pills Scripture by doing this but I felt like we all deserved it after all this talk and all these journeys together on all these youtubes and all these comment sections just a nice communal thing so for one time really. I feel like this will be fun but my best grilling is gonna be when I have the undivided. It's just me and the grill me and the grill and the fire and the quietude or the conviviality of a friendly friendly eventual combats that day ever comes.

I think it's coming soon. I think I think the I think the containment seal on the quarantine has snapped. I think people are gonna be back out pretty quickly. In fact you could almost argue that okay you guys want to get really galaxy brained. Insane I want to put a catastrophe on this right. Now okay. This is insane. This is like total speculation. I actually kind of feel sad saying and that's saying it doesn't feel like it kind of is irresponsible to put this in the world sort of Roku's oscilloscope style Basilisk.

However you say it but it also I can't get it out of my head now that I'm thinking about it so we've talked about how the sewer economy is broken right because of coated and there's no other way to recapitalize the American economy the other than the consumer sector because I thought we have left we've stripped out all the other in stress structure and sold it off and and and out sourced it. So you can pour all the money into this hole but there's no bottom to it. So it's never gonna start piling up and be useful and so something has to be done to change this dynamic because you can open doors. We've talked about this you can open it back up that's only gonna confess some people to go back outside mainly people who are ideologically resistant to the idea that there is even a virus ie conservatives people who lose their own ecosystem of knowledge their own epistemic tree. That say no this isn't even real I want to put my hair down.

I want to eat the cheesy dip and fit person. Funky beats so they break containment first because that's barely anything is ready. There's still a big mass and people not even liberals but like regular normal people who were sort of a political polecat was messing with my train of thought was I saying that completely the helicopter just destroyed my side of the train of thought. You guys got to tell me where I was but oh okay yeah. Now. I'm at thank you so. So you can't get people who believe in the virus to go back shopping because they think they might get sick because they believe in science. They follow the regular mainstream epistemic trees. They're like yeah I'm not gonna go on hurt myself so even if you open up they're still not. Gonna go out. You need to break the seal you need to break the enchantment of the scientific consensus around kovat.

You can't do it piecemeal because you don't have time so what if you create through a domestic patio type situation a provocation designed to stoke a series of escalating Civic disturbances that essentially give a lot of these urban liberals a moral justification for stepping outside and back into the consumer economy so that now when they open up everybody's out there and you can restart the engine. I'm not saying that it's true I literally just made it up but tell me if it doesn't kind of make sense. But that's one of those like matrix questions where even if it's true you still have to act the same way because you can't know you know how can you know. How can you know. It's no way to be truly unless somebody drops a big bag of documents and even then it would probably get absorbed into the question of oh is that a false flag is that fake is that a deep faith is that a Russian op is that is that is that is that a government spook op trying to tell us. It's the government's booked out. How do you get around that you know so you got.

[38:26](https://youtu.be/BXscppi_H5c?t=38m26s)

It just move forward no matter what I'm not saying it'll work either. By the way you might the damage might be too deep. But that's I think a possible outcome. This is everybody's. Finally they open up again they're like hey. I was willing to risk it to go outside to walk around and get a protest for hours. How much more now that I've already broken the seal of containment. I've already violated that sense that good no because the thing is all of that was sustained by this terrier around Koga the idea that everyone will die of it. This will kill everyone even if you look at kovat.

It will kill you you think it's 1%. It could actually be 15%. It could be a hundred and fifteen percent. It had to be that the stakes had to be that high to keep you indoors to keep you a good person for risking it so going outside means well I value. These issues I value police brutality I value. The police state I value fighting back against these tyrannies and racism. I believe in those values more than I'm afraid of this spreading this virus so that means that you have to tamp down in your head. How much you fear the virus so from now on you're not as scared of the virus which means you're more likely to way going out to a bar. Wouldn't it be nice to go to a bar. Oh my god oh my god sit down restaurant maybe okay go to a karaoke night because that and now the theaters been shrunk to size nothing's changed in the science you didn't find out oh. It actually doesn't kill you. No. It still kills people still killing people. It's going fewer people because of shelter-in-place and now. It's going up again because of a relaxation of shelter-in-place. But this is literally the process I was talking about where we get used to hundreds of thousands of people. Dying. This is how we end up gaining complicity in it. This is how at the end of this we look back and say holy. 700,000 people died and we were all kind of okay with it because we all felt like at some point.

We weighed the risks and said it was worth it whether it was because we wanted to go to Fuddruckers. We wanted to end racism. One is a more lofty and mayor and Meritus goal but they are still both shrinking your sphere of your fear of the disease and also the degree to which you think of it as deadly the degree to which you're going to notice the number of people who die from it because you're gonna start to because she went outside you made that choice. So when the bodies start piling up. You've been you've been now before you weren't when we were all locked in waiting for the government. We weren't. We were we were good people. We were good people who were following orders well for the best of everybody because that's what science told us and we know science doesn't care about political beliefs but now that we're out and we've decided to. It was worth the risk and he said if people die. We're gonna measure it against that and we're gonna be like. We made that choice because we thought it was worth it. But now we are. We are inculcated not work.

We all have blood on our hands. Now. It's like. It's like murder in the Orient Express. We all did the murder oh damn spot and there's nothing no way out of that mass now and now they normalized the death of maybe. A million people who knows on me because now we're all feeling complicit in it in some way all right. I'm checking the stakes all right. I'm trying outside the sphere. Now. I'm gonna try to see it try to see it.

I know it's not not long. It's a little bit. I'm at my ass. This flat I'm a white boy. I'm a thin ass flat. I'm a flat ass pfl. Eighty flat ass white boy a white guy all right. I have a surrender at any plan for this thing to be great than to be right off the bat perfect hit. But I think I will be able to make it tasty. It'll probably be a solid B but managing expectations between the screen and the grilling for maximum personal enjoyment. So I set my sights low now if it's better than that I'm delighted and if it isn't I'm not disappointed as much. I can just enjoy the ride to worry about it. Spilling advice from yours truly - thou art as I said I'm sure that it is fully cooked in even if it's a little not. Steak is one of them these dangerous meats to cook to eat rare. I do have a loan slow project. I actually would I saw somebody pointed out how to do the snake method to smoke with the 22 kettle 22 inch kettle and I have a big hunk of pork shoulder that is in my freezer. And I was thinking that I could put that baby in the smoker well. You know I know you got to put the tray of water in there. Next to it. You just put it in there for like 12 hours or something. I could definitely see myself doing that that sounds a lot of fun yeah because I looked at I look. It's amazing how all this stuff is. I was. I was a little intimidated by the charcoal because you know. I'm not naturally gifted in these kind of things and was worried. It'll be a little hard to manage and you know maintain temperatures and things like that.

[44:48](https://youtu.be/BXscppi_H5c?t=44m48s)

But there's a lot of. It's a lot of idiot proofing in these things so make it easier to do. I mean they're saying asymptomatic people think about that they're saying asymptomatic people aren't aren't contagious now remember how that was orthodoxy that was one of the big things that people yelled at each other to convince themselves that it was good to stay in that it's you could have it. You could have it. It'd still be giving it to people. You stupid. That was the justification for for condemning others and for for feeling better about your your shitty decision to say inside which sucks but now I mean if it from the beginning you could honestly say I don't feel sick. I'm probably not gonna get anybody else sick and people couldn't say that's not true. It would have been much much harder to can force this entire. This entire thing. This is what you can't do conspiracy theory stuff because it's way too easy to create these things out of whole cloth. So I just made up that thing about restarting the economy right well. I could connect it even further back. They also did the Cova thing as a as a false flag. That's like I guess not as not as made up but like as an engineered a virus. But then also in addition to that false flagged up in the point of like hyping the crisis and juking the the science at the top levels to create a consensus. Around this is being super terrifying because there was a super big crackdown coming in capitalism. Like the the American economy was at the end of its elasticity. It was gonna snap and things where everything was wildly overpriced and maybe this I thought was this you could just you could short the just drop the whole thing to the goddamn guard floor and then build it back up with you know that faucet of public money the global cash pile and then you have repurchased at essentially pennies on the dollar and the thing is that's very compelling and persuasive narrative. Lee and and if you really think it's too elegant what you end up doing is you start looking for ways to justify that and then you get that so you get that that that bias towards confirmation that people have confirmation bias and before you know it. You've you've transcended reality. But the thing is there's also a world where that was a hundred percent true. Everything I just said is how it happened. We don't know if it's this world though and we can't assume it is because it's proof unprovable. All we know is what we see in front of us at the stake is not a shoe. I don't have a very honestly pros and rillettes.

I think you guys might eat throw on this while I eat steak. It's look I just flipped it. It looked good. I think another three or four minutes on the side. I think it's gonna be good and even if it isn't there'll be a nice crispy exterior that'll be worth the tongue. Among them I got that I mean going to need a cutlery so I'll be right back. I'm gonna roll the dice a bit off the cutoff piece alright guys. I know this is a very men going their own way. Dang just a piece of steak on a plate but like I said trying to manage the number of balls. I'm gonna competently be able to toss and a side was gonna be way beyond. My paygrade. So we'll take a look at this guy. That's my boy t-bone Saddle Creek I believe Saddle River or something like that sound off in the comments. If you think it looks good. We got some meat here and me on dudes isn't really good. I have yeah look at it. Oh I got a nice goal. I'm with you guys here how good am I gonna do this when I'm be able to focus look at this guy. That is the medium rare look at that guy. Mm mm ah oh boy. That's delicious and the beauty of these Weber's is now. I just let the burp coals burn down a little bit. Then I put the top on you took those events and it seals it in its self extinguishing just great so elegant so interesting and I was able to put it together in like minutes hmm no ketchup on steak. Her name's is good horseradish really probably my favorite. I wish I had horseradish in this damn house. They don't have any at my grocery store. I don't know why but um no no ketchup. Ketchup is um. Ketchup is too much of its own star. You know honestly. I think that's it people think ketchup is too fat is not fancy enough but it really is. This is ketchup. It's too much of a scene stealer because it is so richly delicious. It's such a perfect Toonami and it's still like resident. It draws attention away from what should otherwise be the focus on the star of the show. That's why you put on something like a burger which is not nearly as you know toothsome by itself. Mm. Man I killed this I can't believe I killed this I thought this was gonna be a disaster.

I never did the reverse here before. Like I said it might be a little at some points. But I'm rolling the dice because you only live once and you only grow once oh my god. Is you only grow wait a minute that's not even a that isn't even anything never once never mind. I'm distracted how long have I got license to grow baby license to grow no more minute man. This is so good. I realized that as I sit here you know in my decadent backyard with my my boudoir compliments. Backyard grilling and fine steaks my full David Brooks Ian embodiment as an American white male American consumer of middle age. But I should say one thing about class. Then I said on the last stream but I want to elaborate on. Somebody said that when I I talked about how I think chapo and other people I cost to podcast where we charge directly to the consumer I would are technically not not workers under capitalism. Not not petty. Bourgeois are you really even and certainly not capitalist. They are artisans a preeminent capitalist form that's still embedded unevenly and eventually will be done away with. I mean look look at you guys see how Spotify is trying to buy up all the big podcasts they bought Joe Rogan. They bought last podcasts on the left. They're gonna try to do what George Hearst did to the gold claims of Deadwood and roll it up under one big thing and then the artisans will be gone just like what happened in the woollen trades and and in the in the 1840s in Europe well. We're still there for now. We're still embedded in it for now at this point and the thing is somebody said that that's trying to like absolve us of our class position because it doesn't address how much money we make.

The thing is income is independent of class that has a correlation but that correlation does not begin at the level of class. It is it's like it's super structural. It's the income is super structurally related to class class. Position is one's personal relationship to the means of production. The labor sells its time and labor. His labor time capital is buys it small. Blue Schwaab is like a small hole you know cell self exploit s' as well as exploits. The labor of others all that stuff they all make more and less money. But that's independent but it correlates highly with being a capitalist because that's the thing you get you can extract the profits out of the system. You extract the surplus. If you're on the top of the exchange of course you're gonna. You're gonna have more and more importantly. That's so like if I'm if I'm an artisan I am NOT part of capital. I'm not a capitalist as long as all the money. I'm getting for my artisan work. I spend on myself. Then I just put through my hands I don't buy anything. I don't hold anything. I don't buy land. I don't become a rent here. I don't buy stock. I don't invest myself in the economy. I don't do that I am I am NOT even if I'm making millions of dollars. I am not part of capitalism. I am an embedded relic. I am an artisan. But that's not what happens the more money. You have eventually you buy things with it. That's what it does so you buy land you buy lauranmatt more land than you need you get passive rents from that land. You buy stock now you're an owner in a company that purchases the labor power of others. Now you're embedded in capitalism. So you are to some extent invested in capitalism's for maintenance. But that's independent of your role as an artisan. It all flows out of them income of being an artisan. If you're a poor artisan you will never be a capitalist.

I think this has been a great stream guys good talk good bats. I think we've got somewhere with some of this stuff and the stake in this world I realized by the way today we recorded an episode where we talked about the protests and everything well. It's the first time we've actually directly like talked about the streams and I wonder how many people listen to the show don't even know about these I hope. There's an influx of viewers because I really feel like I'm getting at something here and I like the feedback penny buzu. A person does not have a fully extractive relationship to the market. Like a capitalist does. He is exploited by capital but he also exploits capital which puts him in a balanced position between the two major classes which is why the way that the petty-bourgeois goes depends on who has the balance of horses on their side. They tip towards the winning hand. That's what happened that's what's traditionally happened. That's certainly what happened in the Democratic primary like the idea that we personally drove away the Warren voters by being mean to them this wildly idiotic and undiluted I'm afraid. They were as soon as Biden's hand was strengthened by the the DNC Obama intervention and the entire suburban white Democratic electorate. The the six-figure plus management types make up the backbone of the party decided on mass on Biden. It was all over but the fighting about the shouting the Warren East is were tipping to the strong hand. No longer being nice to them or Mena then would have changed that all right guys I'm gonna finish up the steak I think and log off soon. I think it's been like an hour right.

I'm feeling really good doc. I'm feeling like I'm entering new levels about I'm unlocking new levels here the introduction of the actual grill. The imitation like this is even in miniature when talking about the imminent is a ssin of the grilling concept from a what do you call it a metaphor to a direct physical intervention in my life that's right the material manifestation in front of me something that I interact with with my senses. Not just virtually my senses that I feel touch build up feel invested in to the degree that I built it up right and now this space feels different. Like this place with the grill is a different place than it was without a grill I want to do different things with it. It changes my life. It expands my social circle. I'm gonna have more people over here with this drill. Once people start doing that which it's not going to be long. Then I would have without because why do I want to sit back here just like a bunch mutts when we have the drift. So I know it's a very facile exact example. But I really do think that that a lot of this stuff is fractal and it like you know a small example does shine a greater light and and if you look close enough you can see the connections so I'm gonna finish up this blue delicious t-bone right now and then I'm gonna go in oh no I'm gonna do yeah finished Moby Dick. I think the book that whale is nuts a hab though he's I like to cut of his jib as they say goodbye.
