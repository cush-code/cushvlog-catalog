Okay if you have been lifted there in the game. Then we had a shutdown. Anyone with any sense had already left time you were standing in the corner looking like the jacobins outside the streets are filling out. The windows general breeze was blowing me didn't see the farm inside so they caught another bed and drew up the jack of hearts ah am I on come on all right great. I'm on fantastic. This is rare usually. It's lately. It's been kind of annoying hey everybody yeah so. I was at a antique store the other day and I found this little lacquer box that I didn't really recognize got a decent deal before it went. Online found out more and apparently there's some sort of puzzle that you solve with it. And if you make it into a certain shape well you you see sites that you would not otherwise see. I guess so today. I thought on stream you and I were gonna solve it together.

Let's go no of course that's joke for anyone who enjoyed hellraiser and that's also of course a puckish reference to the gentleman who tried to solve the tried to take the lsats on twitch live. I don't care anything about who he is or anything about it. I don't know or care just the act of doing that to me as someone who streams on twitch semi-professionally mind-blowing absolutely mind-blowing the confidence. I mean it's the perfect double-edged sword because at the one end this is a confidence that really you know could build an empire. But at the same time a idiocy that undergirds the confidence that guarantees that any effort other than you know getting people to watch you dick around in the computer is going to come for nothing but wow I can't imagine doing something like that just the thought of live having thousands of people. See you just like no not know what you're talking about fail miserably god. It's terrifying. I mean I will not lie when I say that that is the thing that sort of drives me like the the the closest thing. I have to a a neurotic association. I guess with with the streaming is just you know not falling off the beam in terms of intelligibility in such a way that I lose people because you know if if it's not making sense to anybody else.

Then maybe it's not. I mean maybe it doesn't make sense you know in a greater sense. I can't have that so the idea of somebody's just going yeah. I'll I'll take this thing. I'll take this law test. It's logic. I'm good at logic amazing amazing damn near It's it's damn beyond everything that tom and it really it tells me a lot about the type of people that advance in the internet. Takes fear the internet personality spheres. You essentially have to have a part of your brain missing that recognizing you that recognizes your own intellectual limitations and it poses a challenge anybody who wants to think on the internet or even express themselves. On the internet is how are you going to keep yourself grounded by the way guys and gals.

 it came for the republic which it stands the first book in my planned reading festival to prepare for doing something with the concept of an unassassinated lincoln. I'm gonna start reading this and I thought it would be fun just like as a project for myself and for anybody wants to follow along to do a little mini book club where I'll just kind of talk about what what. I read that week so next wednesday and I'll put this on twitter and stuff. I'll probably read the first three three chapters of this and talk about them not very long probably. I'm not gonna do like the whole show but you know I'll just probably do like a 10 minute thing. At some point. I did. I bought the book. I bought it what if yoda is six foot tall and smoky weed oh right. The book is the republic for which it stands by richard white. I first heard about richard white honestly. At least this book. I mean he's written some other good ones. I first read. This book first heard of this book when he was interviewed on patrick wyman's podcast tides of history which is very good and I trust patrick a lot. He sounded really good in the interview. So we're gonna start there. It's a very solid book literally. I could probably kill someone with it. Oh is chris in the chat cool. I love when chris is in the chat especially since he can. He can address some of your audio concerns if you have them at least the ones about translating like files and and yes he is a trained guy.

[06:12](https://youtu.be/NvfokmzLM60?t=06m12s)

He wrote another book called railroaded about the transcontinental railroad ridge and the and the whole like creation of railroads which of course you know is the perfect subject if you're trying to understand the capital formation in the in the years after the civil war because as I've said the civil war was the catalyst for of capital creation. A capital concentration rather in america that created sort of the dynamo that led us to an industrial capitalism on a grand scale on a competitive worldwide scale and in the aftermath of the war the thing that took the place of waging war was building building a rail infrastructure and the way we did. It was we just gave a ton of land to a bunch of private companies and had them speculate their assets off across the continent while just grinding men into hamburger while building it. So if you're talking about any kind of you know what what what would what if it's history of america where we don't get civil. We don't get our failed reconstruction and our you know robber baron capture by of our government against governing institutions. One big things that would be different would be the way that we built the rail drugs. I mean honestly up to it including the question of how how you know how intense our exploitation of of native lands would be anyway getting ahead of myself.

 didn't talk didn't lincoln talk about wage slaves and stuff well yeah. He did. I mean that was a common abolitionist argument and it was one of the things that appealed to working-class and small-holding northerners was the idea that if you allowed them to that there is a an essential um. You know coercion at the heart of wage labor and slavery and that you know if. If the south winds they will impose a greater degree of coercion. Now the south would rejoin by saying well actually. Wage slavery is inferior to slavery. There is a a southerner named fitzhugh who wrote a number of books where he made the argument that if you you're gonna always have two classes of people the smarter and the less smart. The smarter ones tell the dumber ones what to do and therefore they will be in a subordinate position. Now what should that be the slave model has a reciprocal relationship built into it. It says I you you owe me your labor but I also I also provide you with basic um basic survival. Fodder like. I feed you. I give you a place to sleep. I give you a stable way to reproduce yourself even if everything else is up for grabs and up at my discretion whereas wage slavery you're saying yeah. You guys are going to work for me.

If you don't you'll starve and if you do. I will give you this money for you to go find your own food and shelter well. It up they're gonna start starving so what their lives will be over time worse. Their poverty will be greater than misery will be greater than the slaves will be and other southerners hated when fitzhugh talked about this and his books were not that popular among advocates of slavery who were trying to you know keep the north acquiescing to the existence of slavery because if if too many northerners heard that's what the south thought they would make the conclusion oh well then. Eventually they're going to turn us into slaves and they were right to think that fitzhugh was the guy who was taking all of the conceptions that undergird slave society to their logical conclusions. Not separating not stopping at the arbitrary border of something like race which the smarter even then knew wasn't a real thing or not as real as like the the the people who were trying to convince themselves that like you were talking about different species even though different species can't reproduce at least not reproduce fertile offspring so right. There you have lost any even a scientific basis as they understood science at the time but that didn't stop from trying because they wanted to create an arbitrary border of exploitation well.

No no not white people. If it's you saw farther and said no white people too why not are they dumb. They can't. They're not in charge. They've never been in charge. They've always taken orders.

[11:15](https://youtu.be/NvfokmzLM60?t=11m15s)

Why is that going to change why have them running under foot and creating problems and making everything miserable for themselves and everyone else when they could be be put into a submission. A mutually advantageous submission where they recognize their inferiority and of course the thing about fitzhugh's logic which is the logic the undergirding logic the social logic of every mechanism of class exploitation. We've had since the dawn of civilization and the one undergirding capitalism and the one that will over time take over and become. The sole. Relationship of production is that notion of there are those who take and there are those who give in some combination do through some combination of a willingness to give which is their participation in a social order that they have invested psychologically in the maintenance of some culture. Or this is this is when we describe this we're describing superstructure culture as such and then there's bear um physical force which undergirds the whatever the person in there has in their head as they're giving to the person who takes now what and that is the dialect that dialectic relationship is the driver of class struggle between those two types of person broadly construed now as the society gets more complicated 

The relationship gets blurry and you have things like slaves and serfs and indentured servants and levies and and freeholders and and wage workers and managers and ceos and and civil servants and professionals where all these things get enmeshed in one another and they get muddy but over time over time as capital accumulates at one end of this poll and capital and resources run out the divide re-emerges and asserts itself like I've talked a few times before about how the guys who own france 7-11 franchises have essentially been proletarianized by 7-eleven because they're able to because they run the whole they're vulnerable because they they need 711 to provide them with you know a franchise license and all the materials that they sell and they can change that relationship basically at will and and so a lot of these guys are making essentially minimum wage and working 80 hours a week. While they're essentially owning this thing. That's because and that process happens throughout. Every strata and some people are able to negotiate a trans phase transition like some small some like medium-sized manufacturer or small business person who is about to get crushed is able to like buy stock somewhere or get a job within the structure. One way or another they're being alienated from their capital. Everyone is going to be alienated from their capital or have capital accumulate to them in classes in those classes now according to the ideology of the state and all that the or the and the ideology that undergirds these systems like the one that fits you with expression that comes down to intelligence that that comes down to some pers or or like breeding whatever the hell you want to call it superiority of culture.

All it boils down to a better brain. You have a better brain so it's okay. It's. It's only natural that you should get this now of course that's absurd for a zillion reasons but one of the most prominent prominent ones is that even if you take the assumption for granted the superiority that they are off talking about is a very narrow set of um skills that all revolve around the process of extracting surplus and hoarding it which as a system breaks down as resources run out or as you know externalities within the biological system build up The system is incapable of correcting because it is um selected in the form of reproducing the privilege of people who are already on top and who therefore give these special brains to their kids just by the virtue of giving them a social context to be acculturated into them. Both social and intellectual and it's going to eventually crash into the goddamn.

I mean it's 9 11 every day anyway but eventually it won't even be sustainable on its own terms and that's when you get the common ruin of the contending classes and both of them smash into each other. The alternative to that is a structure where the boundaries this arbitrary boundary of extractor and and and extract e is abolished and everybody is working and everybody else is enjoying. Surplus. Everybody is creating surplus. Everybody is enjoying it to the degree that they can because it is a there is a social recognition of the existence of a social organism that is the basis of marxists for each according to his ability to each according to his needs which so many libertarians are horrified by because they imagine well what if you did that now it would be like they claim the tyranny of the lazy and the stupid they'd just sit back because why wouldn't they they're free riders but all that logic. The free rider logic of libertarianism rests on the idea that there is a fundamental alienated humanity making up this system from each according to his abilities to each according to disease describes in the broadest sense. The social reality the flow of capital the or whatever the flow of surplus rather. The flow of surplus throughout the the social system is from ability to need and everybody needs so everybody's needs are met. Everybody has ability of some kind or another and it is the socialization of the process and the use of the technology that has accumulated through the process of capital accumulation of capitalism that is then applied to the world around us to allow for that that organic flow of surplus within a social system to be generated. So that is why there could never be any in my mind quarter to be given to any desserts based moral order which all capitalists apologia must be at the end even even in your even liberals. Even honestly a certain bright strands of market socialists. It's it's an idea that there must be a does. There must be a system of reward for ability. An ability broadly construed as brain power but in a socialist system the reward is living in a socialist society and that is why you know like like.

I said oh free riders what about lazy people who don't want to contribute. Why would they why would you want to. I mean the number of slave owners who complained about how how including george washington the founder of this fun country who is on who written letters who wrote letters complaining you know. The thing about these blacks is that they really won't work unless you're forcing them to what the is wrong with them like with this incredulity and horror like we're giving you food and shelter and it's like well yeah. But if you were getting food and shelter too right and you were working in some way towards our common survival too. We were all together then they probably wouldn't resist working but they also wouldn't be having to do what you're making them do and of course. This is all you know this. This is this is the reason talking about this stuff is the reason that marx didn't like trying to sketch out visions of what socialism would look like because it necessitates it requires like like actual you know the end state that people are not even. I don't mean the end state but I mean the the post-transition state that people imagine in their heads. It is and and therefore the the broader goals and the broader projects that we have to express and live and try to move towards now in the here and around and here now in this moment necessitate an essentially a collective phase shift in human consciousness and and that's not like that's not hippie. Sit around in the castle in reams or something and say hey what's what like imagine this system collapses and what comes next or what or no not even collapses like feudalism. You know what this thing's bad. Why don't we get a new one. They wouldn't do it and they never were able to do it because you need to have a liberal subject for that kind of social relationship to even exist to generate that kind of discourse but imagining it could just assuming it could.

They wouldn't have been able to get anywhere near where we are because it would have required them to imagine people acting towards each other. In a fundamentally alien way. It would require them imagining people acting towards each other as strangers which they could not do now of course. There are strangers in the medieval world you know the saracen and then the heathens or whatever but within christendom and first certainly within like the the community. The idea that that you could walk out your door and everybody you. Saw in a day were people who you did not know and I don't mean no just in sense of recognize. I mean the sense of having actual social embedded relationship with they couldn't have imagined that they couldn't imagine living like that and it's like well we live that way because we because the very order we live in has generated a a shifted conception of the self in relationship to others than the in the medieval subject had and post-transition socialism would require a similarly um shifted perception of others a re-socialized conception of the self where you have regained the social embeddedness of pre-capitalist society but within a cosmopolitan framework where it doesn't have to be somebody who you've dug turnips next to your whole life or somebody who goes to the same cathedral that spent 300 years being built or that fights in the same crusade. Everybody maybe not as deeply as you know as deeply but as as influential towards one's like ideas of loneliness and fulfillment and existential um satisfaction similar. But that phase shift only comes with with a change with a revolution of what type. I have no idea. I wish. I could tell you and I believe someone says. I feel like this is the thing that anarchists miss and abs that's absolutely it. The anarchist assumes an inviable liberal subjectivity that will persist into their anarchist. Their anarchist society that they are imagining moving towards that will only reproduce liberalism can only produce capitalism because in the absence of social bonds we are all out for ourselves. We are all homo economicus. We are all going to seek to benefit from the surplus of labor that we did not participate in because we do not feel the injustice of that because it's not happening to us and now someone might say well. There are anarchists who do take this into consideration and it's like maybe but my observation of anarchism and practice and as a tradition suggests the otherwise. I saw mank.

[24:30](https://youtu.be/NvfokmzLM60?t=24m30s)

I watched bank most of all. I just don't know why it was i. I mean I know why it was made. It was the screenplay that david fincher's dad wrote 40 years ago and he's been trying to make ever since and which 100 only exists because netflix is at the point where they're going to give money to any big name director who has anything that they want to make that's why they gave scorsese 500 million dollars to do the three hour three and a half hour old age home digital de-aging movie which I think is brilliant as a brechtian like masterpiece of alienation. But for very for that very reason it never would have been financed by a regular studio. At that rate it might have but it would have been one of those deals where like scorsese goes in basically lying to them and then they just give them more money over time until their pot committed which is essentially. I think what happened with the zeiter snyder cut which w warner brothers thought oh great we'll just. We'll get a few more eyeballs off out of these pigs by just taking our old crap and putting a new label on it. But it turns out it needed work and once snyder got in. There he started asking for stuff before they knew it. They'd thrown another like hundred million dollars onto the fire and now that thing has cost like 500 million dollars.

That's because but um he basically tricked them and scorsese would have had to trick people into letting him make the irishman at a regular studio and I don't think any studio is signing off on this self-conscious like black and white fake 40s movie about this making of citizen kane and he's only making it because his dad wrote the screenplay my pacino hoff impression your. Local not very good I am very excited for the snyder cut. I will watch it for sure and yeah. I'm fine with them doing that but sometimes you wonder if they should have stayed in the holster. I just there's something deeply indulgent about it like david fincher's dad and thanks for reminding us by the way that at this point all these people even the good directors. Even the good directors are just rich kids. Everybody is just somebody's kid who decided to take a flyer on a career in the arts. Everybody in in hollywood at this point is like re-antoinette flouncing about in her fake peasant village at versailles so thank you for reminding me of that and and even if it's like oh he wasn't rich. It's like okay. His dad had a screenplay for four years. He was clearly in the business and that's more than most people can say um and also just like. I remember people saying it's about. It's about mankowitz's fight for recognition. First of all no it isn't he has one scene where he argues with orson welles about whether he should get credit. At the end of it.

She says fine I'll give you credit. He gets the oscar what's the grievance what is the grievance that drove this apparently. It's a pauline kale essay. It just all feels very crankish. Although I will say the stuff about you know epic in the 34 sinclair campaign was interesting. But I think there's a bunch of more interesting ways. It could have been presented and I do think it was funny that bill nye played up in sinclair that's actually pretty. That's pretty big. That's pretty good. So you know. It's all right. I'd say. I'm gonna. I haven't done it on letterbox yet. I'll probably give it three and a half three and a half is my courtesy number where it's like. I recognize the craft. I'm not gonna pooh-pooh it. I see some things I enjoyed. I like I very much enjoyed charles dance as william randolph hearst. He sort of had the hollow like slack look that he had. It was pretty eerie and and oldman was really good. So there's like. I liked all the upton's and claire parks but so three and a half h . I have to rewatch video jerome someone's asking about video drum. I haven't seen it in a long time. I do remember enjoying it. I like cronenberg of course and james woods is actually one of my favorite actors and it certainly seems prophetic.

We're we're living in some new flesh that's for sure we are living the hell out of some new flesh oh. If you like it flush. You can keep it oh let me be clear love that that obama's doing his media tour now it's fantastic. He's he's. I love it most of all because he is confirming everything we've been saying about it and specifically the about how he does not view himself as a figure who wielded power. He never imagined himself to have been in the same room as power. His job was to experience power on behalf of a grateful nation that he could then explain power to he could go to the mountaintop and like look at the bush like a kind of a moses type figure where where the burning bush is just the grinding gears of capitalism. Crumbo you know I've been thinking about his about my one of my I mean barsako crumble is my favorite name for him but one another name. I really like is the old bungler and the thing about the old bungler is that I don't know if it's accurate because I really don't know if you can say that he bungled anything because if you really got him strapped to a chair and like hit him with sodium pentathol how much would he really want to have gone differently at the expense of doing different things.

Like that's the thing it can't just be all it would have been nice if mitch. Mcconnell had been more respectful or whatever now what would you have been willing to do in exchange for what different outcome what can you look back on and say oh that was a mistake. I honestly don't think he would have any because I think that he is so deeply narcissistic and so fully convicted so he fused to his conception of himself not just as like an empathic person but also as an intellect as someone who has looked into the fiery furnaces of capitalism and has been seared by them to the level of like deep knowledge of the universal truths and as such. I think his commitment to himself is passive and to all decisions made within the halls of power as predetermined and out of his hands. I think he very well might look back and go yeah. I didn't bungle anything and if he doesn't think he bungled anything. I don't know if you could be said that he bungled anything because if he wasn't working on behalf of some broadly construed american public he wasn't trying to do anything for anybody but himself. He wasn't trying to do anything except get himself a netflix deal and get himself a tedious.

 person with a home cappuccino machine is going to read and give to each other for christmas. He might think he bungled he might have bundled but if that's not what he was working for if that's not he what his goal was. Then he succeeded on his own terms so kudos sir now you might say the one thing he might have bungled. I see someone pointed it out in the chat and yes that's a good one is keeping biden out of the box on behalf of hillary in 2016. Although once again I think if he sat down he would say some to himself like well hillary. At that point she had a robust enough team and blah blah. He had she had people in the dlc dnc who were gonna support her and if biden had stepped in it would have split the establishment and bernie would have gotten the nomination and lost trump. Even worse or not lost to trump which to them. Also a disastrous outcome so he's probably got something in his own pocket in his in his head to tell him that that was not a bungle. That's one of the beauties of being that kind of guy is that that olympia remove and that and that and that isolation of intellect into this crackpot realist framework where I have completely accepted this structure even though I'm one of the most powerful people within any global order you know to to provide direction for the for for the direction. For for this thing oh he might you know what no never mind there's one thing nope.

[34:35](https://youtu.be/NvfokmzLM60?t=34m35s)

I was thinking did he would he have said he wished he wouldn't have said anything about about skip gates cop being stupid. He probably would have said yeah that was stupid but then again he's probably very proud of the beer summit. He did write about it in the book. I mean he really didn't have to mention the beer summit more than like a page. I don't know but or honestly like a line if and he talked about it significantly. So maybe he'd be like It gave us an opportunity to bring some serious questions to the public. I think he would definitely probably he would definitely say he shouldn't have said anything about like kanye when he called him a jackass. He'd probably look oh that was beneath me or that he shouldn't have worn a tan suit that one time yeah yeah it feels like there's like an intellectual battle even about like not whether or not barack obama sucks but how he is the nature of his suckiness the nature of his badness and I think he has to be viewed not as misguided not as even treacherous really so much as blank so much as a empty vessel one of those hegelian figures who emerges to embody the time to embody the emptiness of the time to embody the emptiness of life in 20 late 20th century 21st century america a life where all values are reduced to market values where the self is imposed composed entirely of just a sluice of base desires.

J self generated by a machinery of of misery and oppression trying to soothe its own wounds and that the only measure of a person can be their success within that system at expressing themselves. If we are all alone we are all to die and be forgotten. Then. The only thing we could do is try to be remembered and so the most ambitious of us the smartest of us will endeavor to be remembered to be able to build monuments to themselves to acquire fame and more importantly money to consecrate their image and blazing it across space and time and into that breach people are going to step who have that combination of ability and will essentially the ability to at a basic level. Delude. Themselves into assimilating the ethics of this degraded inhuman moment on to their very species being and so they are able to move motivate themselves the way that I have said like revolutionaries have to motivate themselves from within like that. John brown drive that connection tissue between himself and every other person that meant that he felt the pain of others to such an extent that he was driven and focused towards the goal of ending that oppression because he felt it. The figures who rise in the current moment. Like obama are ones who have been able to psychologically separate themselves so completely from every other person in the world that they can self-motivate in one direction as opposed to the rest of us porsche who can only ever somewhat separate that connection and that means that our pursuits of success within the system are undermined at every point we are either too distracted by carnality or our connection to other people. Leave.

Us paralyzed how could how can I get a job at this company knowing what they do how can I do x y and z job knowing what it does how can I do x y or z menial job knowing how how much it leaves me miserable instead the fully possessed. I guess. The fully possessed figure like an obama and trump are able to unify themselves and put all of their energy into a spiritual pursuit of narcissism which eludes most people but the more successful of us at least the ones who have to work in some way for their own success and can't just sit on piles of money. Those who have to do something and obama. I would say certainly more than trump. Although honestly trump too because if trump would just want to be rich he could have just sat on money forever. It was he wanted to be famous and being a mid-tier developer in new york. In the 70s is not a great way to get famous. You have to work at it and he did obama farther from power and power from the public eye had to work even harder well. Obama's smarter than trump is but they're both driven by the same dynamo of of of religious narcissism of of of self-worship which is what we're all supposed to be being driven towards and the thing about that is that you know we are a monotheistic world. There could be only one and that's why monopolization and accumulation are the drive of capitalism and will eventually consume all humanity unless that that spell is broken unless that's so that engine driving us in that direction is broken so obama set to the point of becoming a world historical figure for a young age and he was very very good at it. He's he is very smart but that's because he's worshiping his own self fully.

He is. He is a mystic basically as is trump and that is why they embody the the emergent um. That's why they embody now the the um social dialectic between democrats and republicans. The two americas who are now at at war with one another that were bored out of the the collapse of 2008 and the subsequent bipartisan non-recovery that said okay the economy just liquefied and set everything building back together. We're just going to leave it as this big pool of money that we're just gonna dump into it and let the richest here get more of it and and pour money down their bucket and then allow them to use their market share and their relative um bargaining position. Vis-a-vis a further miserated working class to fully properize people into tecto surfs which is the whole app economy which is basically the entirety of job growth since 2008. That was a bipartisan a job and they carried that out to the team and out of that out of this hyper-charged individualized spectaclized society to embody one way of getting ahead within that system. One way of successfully worshiping god one way of becoming the god that you know you need to be is. Obama's and obama's is follow the rules that's basically the argument here are the rules as set up and now those rules are liberal right because of the need to have a a system of um. What amounts to etiquette to allow the market to function like the market needs etiquette because everybody's a stranger and and and everybody has to have is approaching each other from a position of alienation and so the same way you have to shake hands tip your cap to stranger you have to embody certain values.

Those values are inculcated in college and you learn them and then you apply them to the world and obama showed you. If that is what you're captured by. If that vision of self-worship is what you're powered by that shows you the way trump is break. The rules trump is if you want to become god if you want to become the most famous person on earth. Therefore a god for all of time after that you just be a until there's nothing anyone else can look at but you. And there's nothing anyone else can hear but your voice. Now the thing about that is that that's a tough one if you don't already have a lot of money or social position or attention to begin with and that is why that one is not as appealing to people who are less demographically positioned that way and it is appealing to that caught here of like baby boomer. White people who are sitting on all the remaining wealth really we have domestically in this country and see that and it's certainly especially after seeing eight years of this one version that they can't do they're too old man they're too set in their ways. They can't curtsy like that they can't extend their pinky fingers. They can't remember not to say that about those people trump says that and then that has got to be the two visions of of godhood that we all battle around and the that working-class movement towards trump or at least a trump influence republican party because there's no way whoever they nominate now.

I have no idea what's coming after trump. It's hard to imagine him not wanting to run for re-election. Not spend the next four years just doing what he's been doing because he likes the running around the country part and he can still do that for the next four years and then just run again. I think he honestly at this point might do it because it'll be all this parts. He does enjoy which is campaigning with nothing else and then because he has a dog brain and doesn't remember anything and has no object permanence. He'll forgot how much he hated actually being president and he'll drive himself back but one way or another even if he drops dead of coba tomorrow which would be hilarious of course. The party is now the alternative to this follow the rules obama party and a lot of those working class people of color. They're not going to find themselves any more able to imagine themselves succeeding by following the rules as any of the beautiful voters who support trump but of course in reality.

Nobody gets to be god. Nobody gets to do it. Nobody gets to be fully actualized. Narcissistic beings instead what they get is the chance to see that desire just dissolve before their eyes and be replaced with nothing with no social balm. No suit no no sucker to come in the form of love of others just further miseration and and precarity more than anything the sense of always not going up but falling down and because the conditions of that precarity are not negotiable they're not nobody is nobody in power is signing off on any redistribution of power or money away from the current polls that it's being pulled towards sorry. All you can do is find that other tribe with that other god and kill it because it's the reason that the crops won't grow we do not need amprim and priv is not the answer and print turns back into capitalism and because I mean if you're because if you don't have that social conception I was talking about thing where your sense of self identity is composed psychologically of a genuine felt relationship to other people beyond yourself and specifically beyond even the people you know personally and people that you even our side of it like a cultural context with without that tribal breakdown.

Primitive breakdown will result again in a conflict over resources and conflict. Over resources is the driver of social alienation and you can't say well. We'll all get to that point and then just break back up. You'll lose it. Over time. It has to be sustained technologically that social connection has to be maintained technologically drainage drain dry so sorry.

I drink your white cloth. Our phase shifts ultimately spiritual indeed a spiritual revolution but as I've said before that's not crazy that's not made up. It's happened before the europe going from europe going from pagan to christian that's a spiritual revolution. The medieval socially embedded corporate sense of self being turned into liberal um individualism that is a spiritual revolution. It's the it's. It's it's the necessary byproduct of a change in material relationships. You have a situation where material relationships are moving in one direction and as those ferment within them and the conflict within them moves them in another if you get if you get to that socialism. Barbarism inflection point say within our system that is you know moving towards crisis.

Final crisis one time maybe not now maybe not 100 years but it is if it breaks towards um if it breaks towards socialism that will mean a change of material relationship that will over time change people's sense of self because of it because of the change to their social relations to one another. I mean sorry their material relations to one another and once enough people have had their and enough like gen enough. Kids have been born into new social relationships that generate new spiritual concepts if enough people have those experiences if enough people have those mysteriousnesses due to their material conditions having changed and the change keeps moving in the same direction just like what happened with the emergence of the liberal identity. Eventually you get a situation an inflection point of consciousness where people are experiencing the life experiencing life in a different spiritual context but it comes after changing material conditions because if we're going to make socialism it'll be because a bunch of people who are alienated who do not live that life who do not have a spiritualized sense who are living every day as like a raw nub working together enough to push things in a direction.

But they're still going to be separated but it will be through the act of working together and seeing results from the work that that those spiritual changes happen on an individual basis. Some people have like large scale like conversion experiences. Other people have just to change a gradual change in their their their emotional palate as it relates to other people and then the relationship between people motivated by that changing spiritual sense and their application of themselves to the wheel of material history. Those things reinforce each other until you get another punctuated a punctuation. An inflection of spiritual change somebody says medicare for all comes to the america how. I have no idea. I have precisely zero idea the political force that moves us even in that direction is one that is if it exists.

Now. It is in a absolutely protein state and it is as absurd for me to imagine how we get to medicare for all as it was for marx to sketch out what socialism would look like after the revolutions of 1848. Not even to say that it's that necessarily far away in time but that it is that far away in event in incident in increasingly unpredictable random emergence of response to changing conditions. I mean hell we might never get medicare for all. We might go straight to just national health health care like doctors are employees of the state which honestly is the superior system in the more socialist system. But I understand why it's not what people push for and it shouldn't be at the political level right now. But we very well might get there considering how how things how how the confrontation with capital what shape it takes and I don't know what shape. It's going to take. I have suspicions. I have guesses. I think it's probably not going to come from the democrats. It's probably going to come from a dif. A third party that emerges and sort of breaks up the duopoly and replaces one of the two parties as happened in the 1850s but beyond that.

I don't know biden's covenant plan is awesome. It's wonderful. It's definitely going to work is the thing. I love most about it. No money for anybody keep. Everything open make wear masks which people are already doing by the way basically what I mean. He's not even saying they want to do a mandate. He's just saying I'm going to ask everybody to do it which they've already done everyone. Every day tells you to wear the goddamn mask and most people do wear the mask even the republicans because it's like required indoors and people just sort of like okay fine. I'll do it even republicans mostly do it like only the most hardcore ones see it as a culture where she will let the demand refuse to wear a mask so unless you're talking about requiring it which would get create almost overnight a bunch of posse comitatus revolutions of like hicks in sheriff department saying that they're not going to enforce it and then what are you going to do you're going to go to war. No you're just going to back down so nothing accomplished and then the other 100 million shots in the 400 days well. There's 325 million people so good job one two yes I yeah right. I'm sorry I'll believe it when I see it for a million ways even if everybody in america was dying to get the thing and had no qualms about it whatsoever the idea that we have the capacity to administer something like that on that scale.

In that time. Frame to me it was absurd but the only way you can understand the democrats position. Right now is how can we get back to normal before we have to give people more money because they do know that it's some and republicans honestly know too. At some point. They are going to have to give people more money not necessarily like the 1200 again but there's going to have to be a stabilizing injection of capital at the demand side or our consumer-based economy will collapse and they know that but they're also with this all these vaccines coming online. Now they're also hoping the same way at the beginning of the thing everybody was essentially saying no we're not going to shut down because maybe it solves itself maybe it falls away. Maybe the transmission doesn't jump and maybe they track and trace a guy and it gets contained. Maybe they drop the moab on cedar creek and it doesn't spread and we don't have to worry about it. The same way they were doing that for a while that's one of the big reasons that everything went to hell so quick right. Now. They're like how far like just get some vaccines and people maybe we can just get this thing kick-started without having to give people more money and so right now I think biden and the whole. Those parties are in that wait-and-see thing that suspended animation of like negotiating not negotiating giving the illusion of forward momentum just to buy time for a miracle in the form of a flawlessly carried out and executed vaccination campaign that reaches hurt immunity within 40 days or whatever the my guess is that they will They will they will give in before that but I i honestly have no faith that they won't push it way too far trying to wait it out. I didn't see a tweet today that said and I thought it was actually pretty brilliant I gotta give credit actually.

I should give credit because it's a really good idea is that the only way to deal with the fact that we have these two incommensura world views with the democrats and republicans and the way that there's so little trust. Between these two factions. The only way you can guarantee a very quick. Ascension to a vaccine protocol is if you took the two vaccines because there's two there's a modern one and a pfizer one and had branded culturally one of them as the democrat vaccine and then branded another one culturally as the republican vaccine and had the two media apparatuses talk about them. Not just in terms of saying ours is good but more importantly saying that the other one was terrible and the other one was going to make you either like what the democrats could say oh. It's going to make you racist or and democrats could say oh. It's going to make you trans and that you then that and more importantly that getting the the one that the other ones don't like it owns them and makes them unhappy and and it would be self-generating like anything from outside. It wouldn't work it has to contain both but it's it's too way too smart zero chance.

We do it. We are far too dumb all right. I'm going to get off in a second. But I want to I want to credit this guy because I really thought that was a smart a smart idea. It would require more more cooperation than and and coherence than our government is capable of of undertaking because the lumpen idiocy that has overcome our billionaire class has predictably also totally taken over our political class so that not only I can capital not not only is government not able to like coordinate capital because capital has so much influence. Now that it's just overalls the state's managerial and coordinating capacities. The people who could fight that within government are similarly captured by self-interest. I mean my god nancy. Pelosi just admitted yes the other day that they checks to people before the election because they didn't want trump to win. That is what they call a perverse incentive John. Askanas thank you shout out to john esconnis that was very very smart. I'm going to read it. I'm just going to read this thread because it's really good. The solution to vaccination under hyper partisanship is so obvious and cynical that it will never be done. We have two very similar vaccines pfizer modern. If you want to reach her immunity fast. You make one the lib vaccine and one the vaga vaccine give the new give the get the new biden administration to endorse the modern vaccine as the best one for science and experts have gates and soros team up to send out. The distribution have gal gadot lead a celebrity music video hovering all of the soy people every one of the avengers getting the modern vaccine.

You spread rumors that trump is holding millions of pfizer stock and mush rushed it through fda approval. You get newsom to ban pfizer in california. Have like um yeah have a bunch of like viral tweets about like pfizer was a nazi company or something and then you have trump go on hannity and take and they and they take the advisors back. They take it together and then you have the booths at the rallies and everyone would just do it and and I just want to read these last ones because this was a very astute point. This sounds crazy but consider that this is exactly what happened with the coronavirus pandemic itself from february on with both sides arms racing to maximally oppose whatever the other side happened to support that's how you go from some tentative scientific support for hydrochloroquine and a bit of trump boosterism to msnbc and the new york times writing hit pieces on it and talk show host joking about it. While fox news practically begins selling it on their website and the admin making it a miracle cure that's the big part of it in the way that it reinforces each other.

I remember the hydrochloroquine story. It was like I mean liberals were always saying well. We have to say this because people are dying nobody's like one idiot drank. Like a goldfish cleaner or something. There was no need for everybody to go all in on horrible hydrochloric we wants. They were driven that way by their need to define themselves in opposition to trump and they were filtered down all the way to everybody including on the left which is supposed to be critical of this sort of mind and on the and then. At the same time hydrochloroquine became the miracle cure on the right and not taking it was and yeah like that's that's that's the thing you put in your body. Why wouldn't that work with a vaccine all right. So I'm going to leave you guys and gals with a quote. A tweet that um. I retweeted today that really reminded me that the ideal and I don't know. I'm not really joking is that if bernie had won the nomination somehow through the grace of god that my ideal vice president for him honestly might have been marianne.

[65:56](https://youtu.be/NvfokmzLM60?t=65m56s)

Williamson and I feel like I feel that now more than I did even at the time and I was very interested in marianne at the time just because I feel like she is one of the very few figures in public life who articulates in any way even if it's from the point of view of like west coast new age. The the reality of of our spiritual lack and she had a tweet today that I thought really really reminded me that we're on the same wavelength. Caterpillars disintegrate into a soup of imaginal cells out of which emerges a butterfly that's where the world is now. One way of being is disintegrating. People are imagining new ways of doing and thinking about things relating to self and others. It won't stay soup for long and of course that's not necessarily a good thing graham. She said you know the old world is dying. The new world is yet to be born. This is the time of monsters but it's also the time of miracles. It is a it is a liquefied It's liquefied earth like you know during an earthquake. It moves so fast that the ground itself turns into it has a viscosity of liquid. We're there and what comes out of that is up to us as terrifying as that is to think about and as hopeless as it might make you think when you consider how far all of us are from god in a real sense from love. We're also all we have and the only thing that could do it and we're here and that's something bye.
