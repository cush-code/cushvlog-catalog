Um wow in the afterlife you could be headed for a serious strife. Now you make this scene all day but tomorrow there'll be hell to pay in the afterlife. You could be headed for the serious strike. Now you make this scene all day but tomorrow there'll be hell to pay people listen attentively. I mean about future. I used to think the idea was obsolete until I heard the almond happiness bee. This is a place where eternally fire is applied to their body. Teeth are extruded and pulled up grounded baked into cakes with a pass around in the afterlife and the very other serious drive. Now you make this scene all day but tomorrow there'll be hell to pay beauty talent fame money refinement tap skill and or other things you try to hide will be revealed on the other side and the d and the a and the m and the n and the n the t and the I o n lose your face use. Your name then get fitted for a suit of flame. The d and the a and the m and the n and the a and the t and the I o and use your face lose your name then get three for a pseudo flame does anyone remember that song is anyone a geriatric millennial and we can name that song or is that before your time I'm gonna see if I get anything from you people squirrel nut zippers that's correct hell people think of squirrel nut zippers as part of the swing revival but they really were kind of doing a different thing than uh like your cherry pop and daddy's or your big bad voodoo daddies um. I will confess that I in fact had that album. I had the the the cherry pop and daddy's album that had zoot suit riot in it which terrible the classic example of why I didn't buy records when I was a kid because it always seemed like a bad deal you're taking a bet that what any of the other songs on the album are going to be as good as the song you heard and yeah nothing on that. Albums anywhere near as good or as catchy as uh zoot suit riot was but I also own the squirrel not zippers album which is really good hell. I believe it's called is it hell or there's a lot of solid songs on there. I will I will defend them and that's one of them okay. So today we're going gonna. We're gonna talk about uh the cold book which I gotta say not exactly what I wanted it to be. I really did want something that was gonna be more grounded uh the way that uh fauna is.

I wanted like basically fonner's approach in terms of you know doing the whole systemic and grassroots simultaneous. You know the the narrative uh like the densest narrative rope uh. And I'm sure there is one like that. But I've not as well read on that historical era to know what it is and it was not cold. I must say it's a little too uh removed from the action as it were uh. So. I don't think we're gonna read the rest of it um. I want to and besides. I'm feeling like I want to move forward anyway. I mean. I've been looking backward out of despair and I've realized like well. What is this this is like. This is an expression of despair and and I realize that a lot of what I talk about is trying to articulate despair and what it means to be politically self uh aware in a time of despair and people can of course say oh there are plenty of times in history when people have felt political despair. This is classic naval gazing uh presidentist narcissism typical of a millennial to assume oh yes. This time. It's different as though there haven't always been a period where everything felt hopeless and I will say of course that's true.

But I would also posit that the totalization of capitalism the totalization of our world system. The totalization of our information matrix. The totalization of our access to information means that we have reached a theoretical barrier of human potential that is un uh rivaled at history because every almost every point of total despair you can point to in world history has had the possibility of transcendence within it because as much as the world seemed hopeless there was space to imagine uh some sort of transcendence. Some sort of upward movement ascension rather than endless declension unto in sickness unto death they had heaven. In other words we have no. We don't have heaven like nietzsche was right. We killed god in the pursuit of turning ourselves into god and now we are worshiping ourselves. But that is at the expense of a spiritual understanding of the universe. Any kind of connection to anything outside of ourselves any ability to imagine death as anything other than the annihilation of the universe. The end of the world armageddon but the annihilatory kind and without like the winking out of nirvana but rather just the screaming horror. All we can imagine is death as being on flight 93. And the thing is we're always on flight 93. Life is right 93. The question is are you going to scream and bash your head against the wall or are you going to defeat the the uh fiction. The fantasy the false delusional belief that is generating the fear which is that there's anything to be afraid of which is that death is some sort of insurmountable annihilation. That's not the case believing it is. It's the fundamental notion that drives our our individualism and it is a fantasy. It's a fantasy that we need at a base level. We need to have some separation from the world. We need some fear of death in order to be able to negotiate it and then be in life because life moves forward life wants to flourish that means we have to want to save ourselves but that sense of danger should be proportionate to the immediacy of it. The suddenness of it natural death should not be afraid but your map should not scare us because it would be understood by us at a metaphysical level. The way we understand ourselves as separate now in a way that is beyond the need to articulate or reinforce consciously that there is no separation that we are all part of a cyclical world where we are feeding a system that we are part of and that exists eternally and if you operate and the thing is though that can only be sustained in a social context. There is no social context. There is no time spent with others. Instead. There is time spent with ourselves which means time spent thinking about ourselves and a time spent building this ego that cannot conceive of death. I think this is all  that ernst becker talked about denial of death. I'm assuming. I never read it. I have never read any of these books. People keep saying hey you sound like him and it's like yeah probably. I'm getting it. I'm getting it without having to do the reading. It's great. I feel like.

I'm  playing contra just but I'm but what that means the implication of this that matters is that it means we are the first generation who is seeing before around them a terminal uh decline wherein they can't imagine a better future for themselves. They can't imagine a better future crucially for their children. They cannot imagine the perpetuation of a legacy and a legacy is what stands in instead of our um. That's what soothes us instead of social existence. That's what makes us pursue capitalism so that we can leave a legacy and that is a way to extend our ego beyond our death and allow us to focus on a task and that's the thing we are. What despair causes you is to not be able to focus on a task because what's the reason to what's the upside. What is. The what is the uh rational reason that I should pursue this why should I build up institutions why should I cooperate beyond myself if there is no hope for me to leave a legacy and that is the vicious cycle that perpetuates us towards armageddon and at the very top you have these people who have started to believe a new religious delusion on top of the delusion of self which is eternal self through the uh at use of technology. The singularity the feels the musks the the cyborgs at the top that is all that can persist the rest of us stuck below where we know we'll be out low the threshold of getting into the bunker where they're going to put jack us into the computer and we can play mario kart with galileo for eternity. If you don't have that to look forward to if you know that of that as a real possibility something to soothe you you can't be soothed. You're in terror and what do you do you drive. You just try to kill yourself. You destroy yourself not consciously but through the annihilation of that thought the annihilation of the the the scary thing which is what generates all of our addictions neuroses horror that attempt to turn off this. Blinking light in our brains. The check engine light that's always on and we think and so we either confront it and are driven mad by our inability to resolve it the fact that we can't imagine changing this.

We can't do politics meaningfully uh and then just the hedonistic pursuit of uh distraction. There are two ends of the same coin though they are the same thing they're just the janus faces hedonism and the sadism. That associ that goes with it is uh the pursuit of pleasure but so is a hysteric like social justice pursuit that is also and like the neo-puritan purification of the ego or purification of the self purification of sin because of the imagined uh the the imagined super ego because that's what happens you either pursue that you either indulge the id in these moments or the or the super ego and and uh reactionary indulgent hedonistic politics is the politics of of that of the id of just pure satisfaction. But some people aren't built to get pleasure out of that because they're too aware of all the horror they are too. They've convinced themselves too much that they're good people because that is how they keep their ego up by saying they're good. It's the same thing as the puritans they emerge into a world where god is starting to die like the real living god for the puritans is is becoming a memory. All they have is this calvinist  rationalist god in their mind. This reasoned out algorithm that says well if god exists. Therefore they're uh how powerful therefore they have complete control. Therefore I am predestined to either be saved or uh damned well then you either party like it's 1999 or you act like you're saved and that's what we're all doing that is the  for the liberals for the liberal and left they are performing for that uh that imagined other the brig lacanian other just staring furnace portal eyes at us at all times and making us pursue a politics that plant cleanses ourselves. It is the end pursuit. It's the same social strata. The people who came to this country not because they needed to not because they were fleeing debt or they were impoverished but the uh relatively prosperous puritan plan. Puritan uh settlers were the emergent middle class having its first nervous breakdown about being in the middle class. Because once that collective conscious concept of god dies you have to create a uh a totally internal one and for the puritans it could be a real god. It could be a god that was transcendent and that could send you to heaven but now after the enlightenment thanks a lot voltaire after the scientific revolutions of the 19th century. Thanks a lot darwin we if we're really over cultured people can't believe any of that. It's like the rocco's bacillus. Like ideas that once you come in contact with have tainted you as soon as the possibility that the world can exist without god that there is a wind-up universe that extends itself through the mechanical processes of evolution and stellar formation and all this stuff as long as that possibility exists and you know it exists. You can't believe anymore you can't believe in anything anymore. Now that doesn't mean you might not be religious and you're going to double and triple down on your religiosity.

But you're going to be doing it to ignore that voice to ignore the red light blinking. And I would say that that is what makes this the first generation to truly be living with political despair political and metaphysical despair. We will be destroyed we will be annihilated. There will be nothing left of our existence in the near term planetary extinction because once again if you know that there's a possibility that the thawing of the permafrost will unleash a chain of events that will cause earth's atmosphere to hyper uh uh carbo carbonify and turn earth into venus. If you know that possibility exists scientifically and it does and most people who are aware of things who pay attention to the news because they think it makes them a good person. They know that too and then once again as long as you know. It's a possibility. You are now thrown into doubt forever as soon as you know that that that annihilation is possible. There. It is and we know that the car course is putting us in that direction as soon as you know that you can't imagine that you're going to have a legacy no legacy no kids. They certainly won't have kids. It'll all be gone.


You can't solo console yourself that way so you can live for today and that's what we're all doing we're all living for today. But we're in a condition of material decline which means we can't enjoy ourselves. We can't enjoy ourselves because even as we indulge we indulge less and less and the indulgence is less satisfying over time. We're stuffed. We're muncher. We're eating our goddamn. Corn. We're stuffing ourselves to just not feel the decay and so this is a new situation because in previous times the times that marx imagined would exist when the final conflict of capitalism came uh when you have a system where there's no where it's just. It's created so much human misery and alienation and there's nowhere for it to go you've extended like we're now in a global system. There's nowhere to vent the steam. The frontiers really are over and all the new ones are fake like the media like it's all just a way to scam us into see staying in the system while they. This is just like when in the 20s they gave stocks to people. It's a way to keep people gambling keep people at the table. When you got to that point. The thing would blow up because people would have as they said in the manifesto nothing to lose but their chains. But we are now in a a era where uh imperialism allowed for this huge explosion in consumer uh um purchasing power among the working class at the center of capitalism that it essentially bought them off and now. We are so disconnected from ourselves socially not just in building like a spirituality but just having an understanding of how to resist politically. If we wanted to we don't even know how it works. We are so little memory how many of us grew up with union households and how many people would work in the union how union jobs now you don't have the uh the social knowledge or the spiritual knowledge.

I gotta close the blinds. Apparently you got a rare torso look. There you got some torso so we're consuming and it paralyzes us because even though we're not happy and we know we're not happy. We have something to lose we have something to risk and we can't believe that our risk will be rewarded. We are fatally paralyzed because since we can't believe that any sacrificial move will be worth it. It will always in game theories terms be in our most rational interest not to pursue it not to risk it. Like this is science. This is a I could write this  equation I swear to god. We are all powered by belief belief in something and the matrix of those beliefs orient us towards courses of action and they are interlocked and interwoven strands of belief belief in things things that aren't real in any sense because that doesn't exist but things that are affirmed over and over again by our perception of uh existing by our time on earth by our being in our bodies. No it's not idealist because I'm saying that's why people do what they do. But they don't know what these things are. This isn't something they're choosing. This is inflicted upon them by their life by the experiences on earth they have which are determined by their material placement. Their where they are what they emerge with what they perceive what their lives are determines what they believe. That is why this is not idealism.

We are motivated by belief but we don't choose those beliefs. Those beliefs are chosen for us. We are wound up and set off which means we are materially fixed so we all believe in stuff and that stuff is a bunch of different things. One of them the front one that we need one of the first ones is the idea that we're being that is separate from everything around it and that's a necessary precondition for consciousness. In fact it is consciousness and then our degree of consciousness is our degree to which we pull away from the moment. We're in we pull and live in the echoing moment behind what we're experiencing and then think about it because it is in that gap that we create a map of the future that we live in and that that projection is reality. It is a self-generated movie a backdrop a hologram and what makes that up is what we've experienced garbage in garbage out. The thing that determines our action is the specific arrangement of those uh experiences those time and place that these things happen to us and over time that creates an emergent property of self-conscious consciousness that then bootstraps you into being a uh. A actual free-will-having conscious creature it bootstraps it into existence because eventually you have so much time to build such a real world around you a real future that you can inhabit by making decisions.

The more you believe in that the more your actions are determined by it and not by what is just happening around you. What's happening in your head right after what is happening to you occurs and that is where actual free will autonomous consciousness emerge in that gap. So we have to rebuild belief beyond the south because as I said that self was once one thing that we believed in among a bunch of other ones. The the our love expressed to the people around us our understanding of the world through the stories that they tell and the and the ritual rituals. We perform around these stories that are framed around human uh flourishing in the early age in the early early stages of the building of like human civilization society when you're talking about bands in harmony with nature. The stories they're telling are stories that are advantageous to the collective pursuit of a group but over time as humans react to material conditions changing as it becomes harder to sustain life in a certain geographic area and you have to move and change your relationship to the world around you that you accumulate these bifurcations.

These exploitative classes the one side of the divide of people who can spend the time in their head long enough to wield a tail and tell a story to those uh who are going to hear it and that distinction creates your distinct the categories of labor the separation into uh more efficient allocations of resources that build up civilization on the back of exploitation because we say we're different than others and then we're we we think we are different from others but that we is. It's part you. But it's part everybody else. But when you need to survive and you need to store surplus. Then all of a sudden. Some people need to be less you than before some people need to suffer in a way that you wouldn't want someone that you really felt was part of you to suffer. But they have to suffer for everyone's survival but over time those calcify and you get cultures built around entirely the people on the top of that entirely among them the the people on the bottom only experiencing it through vicarity.

Not through their participation in it and that separation over time gets deeper and deeper and then technology is created to allow it to sustain itself because without technology. None of this happens without technology. The hyper exploitation of capitalism isn't possible because how do you get that many people to do that because there's more of them than there are of you if all you have is a  stick. If all you ever are rudimentary regimes of like slave labor or feudal oversight you need a lot of participation from people in that system. You need them to believe in something about the world around them unless they're being compelled uh by technology unless they're being compelled from outside and the intensification of technology is what allows capitalism to emerge which which necessitates a hyper exploitation that would not be possible in a more uh in a more intimate social setting like look what happened in the year. The history of feudalism is a history of periodic and violent and volcanic and very threatening peasant uprisings like clockwork things get too bad people get fed up and they stop believing not in maybe the king not in god certainly but in like the local elite as they understand them and so you had to back off but if you have technology you don't have to back off. You can bomb their huts like the the the great peasants war of the the 1520s. Uh that was put down by uh  guys with sticks just like that just like the guys with sticks uh who made up the peasant army of course it wasn't totally even those guys had uh the the the soldiers of the aristocracy. Of course. These are regal knights descendants of the. This is basic almost a level playing field now post-capitalism when you saw when you saw advanced industrial capitalism cutting through uh the pre-capitalist world. Like a  buzz saw you saw the exploitation that never could have existed in any other system. It just exploded across africa and latin america and asia and that's because of technology. It creates a distance in time between but between you and the exploitation that you are benefiting from and we live in a situation where I say what you mean.


I mean the people listening to this. The people who I my audience are the people who have had the similar enough experience of living in america to use the same to have the same language as me so that when I talk to them they get what I'm saying that's who I'm talking about. I say we because there's no point for me to talk to anybody else about this stuff because this is subjective experience. This is the stuff that matters because it's what we have to focus on. Instead of these abstract political categories like what I find so frustrating about and ultimately fruitless about political discussion at this point is that it's all framed at a level of abstraction that goes so far away from experience that you're not really talking to people. They're not you're just running through algorithms.

You're running through argument algorithms so that you can avoid dealing with the reality around you the despair that you feel once again understandable so you need to get more specific to get anywhere. So you have to choose language and you have to choose an idiom and that's what I've done and so when I say we that's who I mean we are now in a situation where we have if we inherited us a world where we were at the top of this food. Chain of exploitation and the political spectrum throughout a system and capitalism is now a world system that has encompassed all the other world systems that it hooked into to come to into life. I think the wallastine thesis is essentially correct. You have these local dynamos going of economy and then you have the emergent machinery of a capitalism and over time it just screwed its way into all of them and what political what political ideology is within that framework on the on the regular scale on the scale of like.

I still endorse the system as it exists like the traditional left right political scale short of its extremes the one where you could realistically engage in politics at an electoral level and invest yourself which means even if you think you're at the extremes. I'm sorry if you care about who's president you have invested yourself in this thing and so even if you don't believe in it your actions validate and reinforce. A system that has this orientation exploitation is unavoidable. Exploitation and misery within the system is necessary. It is fueled by it. It is this grease that runs it even though it doesn't have to even though we're now at a point where we have enough technology to distribute much more equally and less neurotically and and remove a lot of just these. These persistent uh social canker sores that are created by our need to dominate like the anxiety created at the top of this relationship. Not to mention the horrifying misery at the bottom of it you don't need either of it. But because we're stuck in the short term we don't believe other people are real. We have to pursue our most selfish interest all along the line and then it's our politics just become a question of well. How do we orient ourselves towards that and that really is determined not by how good you are as a person but aesthetic preferences that are generated by your lived distance from exploitation.

Liberals and conservatives do form a real uh authentic political spectrum left right but it is understood as I think not about ideology. It should be understood as a relationship. A time-spaced relationship to exploitation. The right wing is oriented around living near the point of exploitation which is why the right wing in america. Anyway is the final expression of the planter ideology of the antebellum slave owning class sitting on your veranda watching. Others labor for you all that idle time but right next to the point of misery sitting there and watching it happen and having to consider yourself the protagonist of history. A good guy in some way you build up politics around that liberalism is the power in america is the descent of the politics of those puritans who settled the north the land that was and they and they didn't. They. There was no slavery there not necessarily because of how good they were.

But because the  clay and gravel there's no rich real loam in new england. The best you can see in that part of the country is is this is a hard scrabble subsistence farmer that's why they all became  merchants and their their exploitation is removed. They're sitting in a counting house. There's they're passing around bills of sale. The exploitation is happening next to them well. Those people are being paid for their time or they indentured themselves to get across the water. I'm doing this part of the rules-based order. I'm doing this because I'm observing manners that I mistake because they're all we have with morality and then liberalism is built around. That and liberalism is the driver towards uh like universal recognition of humanity which is good and necessary. And it's part of the dynamic the progressive dynamic of capitalism in that it accumulates things. It accumulates capital that is necessary to uh uh to accommodate human life and sustain a civilization and flourishing and increase the number of people. There are the number of consciousnesses.

The amount that we can collaborate the milk that we can make the technology that we could hypothetically use to distribute pain throughout the system in a way that allows us all time to flourish in our own way oh my god real human liberty. Part of that is driven by a recognition of others as ourselves but and there is no place for that for the working class because it's all being done at the level of culture. It's all an emanation. It's all being interpreted by those people sitting around in rooms in the east coast and so they express a universalism that we need. But it's short of class. But it doesn't mean we don't need it. But all it can ever do is pursue absolution because it cannot deny the need for exploitation because it takes it for granted the same way the southern planter does and so what are we seeing in this crisis moment when oh the world's getting worse and worse how is america going to thrive i.e. How am I going to be able to feel good here and for the for the descendants of the planters. The answer is well. We just hyper exploit people.


What are you talking about. We have fun we we embracing our carnival as evil but that we have decided is good like oh. We're all christians now in our cosmology. Uh jesus is satan but it's christianity. There's it's like the same thing levade did only less self-consciously like level is just the anton lavey's satanism is just pointing to christianity and saying this is the logical uh progression of this not that it is the inversion or denial negation of it. It is the next iteration of the same thing because you guys worship satan too so great we'll be satan worshipers together.

We'll dance in the  your feelings and that of course is right that is that is trump right that is trump expert. That is that is the id desire expressed by trump. But what the liberals have to respond to that is not liberatory. Politics is no no don't you understand. The pleasure in life is feeling like a good person and that means we have to sacrifice for other people. That means we have to decarbonize and we have to de-grow and we need to cleanse ourself of the sin of being born in this position of decadence to be living atop this mountain of misery. We're going to cleanse ourselves but that just means that other I have to feel worse about being who I am and I need to punish other people who are heretics who don't feel bad enough about who they are. Meanwhile. The machinery of exploitation continues but at arm's length we don't put up a wall we do the same thing but we wouldn't put up a gaudy wall. Maybe we use uh drones and  uh proxy armies to maintain dictatorships in other countries that can catch them before they get to us. We use apps we don't need servants because we have apps we get an abstracted form of exploitation where where we get less pleasure. We don't we we have to save we have to drive tiny cars or no cars at all and drive bikes. We have to we have to uh eat less meat.

We have to go on vacation less and the thing about that is since neither of those answers deals with uh both. Since both those act answers accept doom as the premise they both say we're going down. There's no hope well if you're engaging in politics which one of those you picks is not determined by how good you are it's determined once again by drumroll where and when you've lived did you grow up enmeshed in. Uh this right wing planter idea ideological uh sub uh counter uh cultural uh superstructure that emer that exists in all of these nodes of like of extraction industry and look the franchisees the beautiful boaters and when you grew there did you fit in or did you not fit in once again not determined by you determined by the ridges of your brain and the accident of your skin color and things like that and and that is what determines it. So then you come out and you have a political ideology and you pick one of these two sides. But you're not the talking about politics. You're not talking about politics as a thing of believing in a future you're talking about a regime of punishment of others who is going to pay who's going to pay for the fact that if I'm having fun. I'm worried. I'm going to have less fun in the future.

I'm having fun but my kid's not having as much fun my kids on  fentanyl this sucks. I can't have fun. They get mad about it and they need to punish someone same way. The people who see everything getting worse around them and feeling guilty and guilty more guilty about it need to punish somebody and that is why we have these dueling sadisms that make up politics at the level of uh. The electoral at that's like the conscious level and this is why I get back to. If we're in. This age of despair and despair is born of lack of belief in anything. But the south then we have to go one more step. We can't go all the way back. Although the reactionary idea is that we're going to get some of these beliefs back can't get any of them back. They're gone once they're gone for god forgive as I said as soon as darwin is a possibility in your mind. As soon as it makes sense to you. You can't believe anymore not the way you did and that happens to everything we can't believe in anything else anymore.

So what do we got to do. We got to take this next step forward which is to abolish that last pesky thing that we believe in we have to step on the gas individually become individual uh uh existential accelerationists. Let's use that term existential accelerationists and we need to by one way or another believe in the possibility of something other than ourselves enough to reduce that belief in self because the beauty of it is. It's got to go somewhere when you squeeze on it. It's got to go somewhere because belief is what powers your  blood in your veins you don't get to choose it. It's why you breathe when you're asleep. It's not going anywhere unless you want to die and if you don't want to die then you believe in something well that basic belief has to go somewhere and if less of it goes into you then it has to go into something else and so go and get it and you'll have to look you'll have to look and where will you look.

Where is the only place you're liable to find. Anything can't find anything on the internet. Can't do it impossible. It's a fantasy as soon as you're here you're not there as soon as you're here as soon as you're here pointing at the internet. You're not here in your body. You're in your head. It's gone. It's over everything there is engaged at the level of this fantasy. This hologram that cannot be changed. It's here and so you gotta do it. You got and if you're and if you're earnestly pursuing that which you'll have to because it'll be a matter of survival. You'll hit he'll hit something and it'll be good and it'll be good. It'll be the right thing because it'll feel like the right thing and that only comes from but if you try to do that without doing anything to the ego. The ego is going to determine what you bump into and guess what it's going to be. What serves the ego and you're back to square. One you have to actually have a felt displacement of belief outward and that means you have to do something and you can only do that if you're not here if you're not distracted and that the real necessity will make you look inward and then when you look inward and whatever you do you. Meditate you can take some mushrooms and listen to pink floyd. You have conversations with people around you you sit in your body and you see feel it. Something will happen not to everybody not at the same rate and not the same thing. It won't be understood by everybody as the same thing. But it is necessary. It's necessary precondition so that's what I want to be called after all of this what is the next stage of the grill pill.


It is existential accelerationism because we're not getting back all the politics of the premise of like either fetishizing like liberals fetishizing the new deal state communists fetishizing the soviet union nazis fetishizing uh like the teutonic knights rampaging through prussia. All of those politics are doomed because they're trying to go back to beliefs that cannot be sustained. There's always there's only one there's only one belief that has to be annihilated. There's only instead of trying to in rebuild beliefs that can't be reconstructed all right. I was supposed to talk about that weimar book uh and honestly I feel like I kind of said everything. I wanted to about it mainly that there were two forgetting everything that I read there are two social democratic parties that determine the fate of world communism. The social democratic party of germany the first large-scale mass labor party in europe and the world really because america they had the democratic party but the democratic party was never a working workers party the fact that it came first actually doomed it that way because it was premature you could only have mass and you and that's because of geography and materials not ideology not the american way or not the constitution and not our love of liberty.

It happened because in the context of free real estate and endless possibility of of yeoman land ownership. The elites could afford to have mass suffrage and afford to have mass politics. They didn't even do it right away. They did slowly but they could do it earlier because they weren't constrained geographically the way that europe was and so they got the democratic party before anybody but the democratic party had no class character. It was the party of yeoman. It was a party of small peasants with their own or peasants who are emancipated and have no landlord sacks of potato. The sack of  protestants uh seeking only themselves and worshiping only themselves so uh so anyway we got the democratic party but it was too early uh germany meanwhile constrained as it is geographically coming into existence as a nation late unable to compete in the imperial contest with the likes of france and spain and uh the dutch or britain because of their late entry are forced to internally uh develop and are allowed and and what what uh facilitates that is its federal character and then within that that furnace you create the first real industrial proletariat as marx predicted uh there in britain too. But uh britain had european. Britain had the social steam valve of uh colonialism and the empire germany didn't have that so you say people say it could have been germany or uh germany and uh and you and england are like creating the first real working class in the world but its militancy its engagement with politics is being uh constrained in england all through this period by the events of colonialism and imperialism. Germany doesn't have that it has to ferment from within and that means uh that it emerges the first coherent working-class politics and the first major the first mass labor party. The social democratic party which is the party that inspired the bolsheviks in russia to name their party that and I would say that the problem the question of why we didn't get the communism.

The communism is that why we not get to the communists when we needed it and that really was when we could have got it maybe a different world. I think not maybe definitely a different world that happened a bunch of different worlds that happened. But we didn't get that way we didn't get lucky. We got the bad turn of the screw. We got the the wrong set of coin flips um but we didn't get that one we got the one where it failed and I think one of the reasons. The one of the big reasons it failed is that those two parties even though they shared.

I would say the correct reading and understanding of marx as in they were generated by the real conditions of an emerging working class. In that time and place the late 1800s. They were filled with the best the brightest the the most uh uh uh insightful the most humane. But they were but they did it in two different countries that essentially existed in different times. But they came about in about the same period of time. The problem was is that germany was the prototype capitalist state. The state that marx thought could be overthrown in the near term through political action of the working class as a self-conscious. Uh unit russia is essentially  futile it is a funeral society with a thin screen of a bourgeois. Uh culture on top of it and that distance the distance in developmental time determined the shape of the two parties and the conditions that they would be able to operate. In and that meant that by the time the crisis comes the real crisis the the  get off the pop moment of 1914 to 1920. The crisis capitalism hitting the thing that mark saw he was early in 1848 when he thought it was just around the corner. He said okay maybe it's maybe. It's a little bit further away but he was a lot closer than he thought because people say oh. When was that gonna happen marx. It happened. 1914 was when it happened but we lost that's the thing we've been living in the backwash of that defeat ever since so when that happens germany is the prototypical country that is in this condition.

Russia is a  feudal backwater so what happens is is that those social democrats in russia. The bolsheviks around the the most brilliant man of his era lennon and in his position lenin um they emerge as this coherent militantly organized revolutionary minded uh organization that has been illegal for the majority of its existence. Most of the people involved in it spending a significant time in prison or unhiding or in exile base operating as as criminals as underground uh figures and they're finding a uh. They're fighting a political situation where the imperial authority has been uh completely um desacralized. Nobody believes in the empire anymore uh and their opponent was a bunch of peasants who were politically inert and and certainly not uh influential in the cities uh and then this thin layer of inbred. Uh thin blooded romanovs and then a very tiny layer of middle class and on their side a massive hyper-exploited working class that was packed into incredibly dense settlements right next to these huge massively concentrated factories. Russia had at the turn of the 19th century by far the most concentrated industrial capital in the sense that the the factories were bigger and employed. More people and the neighborhoods were more thickly peopled and more universally. Working class and a a dissolving red army made up of uh lumpin peasants and workers who've been given guns and then just walked away from the front. They were the only potential progressive force that could have taken power in that situation. Lenin was 100 correct about that cadets the srs. The  house of straw you could not build anything on that working on the middle class.

It was non-existent. It would have crashed and absent the soviet absence of militia mix. The military would have taken over it would have been as trotsky said it would have been a militant uh military-led reactionary movement that would have hoisted the swastika 20 years before uh world war. Ii helped ten years before the  uh or four three two years before the nazis were even founded so they had to act but it's russia. It's a backwater even if they take power. They're going to be it immediate war with the the western powers are going to be isolated. They're going to have to uh fight. A rear guard back foot action against capital. All over the globe try to help working-class movements where they were but only basic like through an advisory position the possib and they would have to industrialize a country that is a  backwater if they are thrust into the world of party. Uh conflict or of a multi-state competit competitive conflict which is what capitalism was birthed out of innovation of capitalism was birthed out of the state conflict within europe. The united states became a hamiltonian uh developmental state. Even though nobody at the ground level wanted that not even the  uh slave owners they had an entire political uh articulation opposed to it and the masses of people were absolutely opposed to it. But they had to compete and that need to compete is what organized us into the state. We became the need to compete would organize them into caring about themselves as a state. Not as as some sort of revolutionary vanguard. They wouldn't be able to act that way anymore so what would be the point of fighting well. Why do you why can you fight well because this is going to be the spark that lights the fuse dummy.


We're in the end times. This is the big contest. The germans will take it from here that was the theory of permanent revolution. The trotsky conceived up that was the thing that was in lenin's mind when he sat those. We're going it's because they believed they believed in the world revolution and so around the same time the same thing happens in uh. Germany has happened in february in a year earlier in uh russia and that is the  rubber band snaps keel. The war is over. The germans have been defeated stunning everyone because they believe the propaganda and honestly the position on the field had been pretty stable uh and and the deterioration of the of the germans position was very sudden and late so shocked the entire country. The british the the uh but at least the war is over. The butchery is over well the the german high fleet up there in uh the baltic commanded by a bunch of old psychos like people who thought they were teutonic knights like blood drinking maniacs of the feudal remnant but like the junker par excellence. Uh they decided that they got to go out uh with honor so they're gonna  pick up stones and go out to meet the british navy and go down into the ocean instead of turning over the glorious ships of the line to the the british. The troops say and the sailors. The common sailors say  long enough and there is a mutiny a general mutiny and keel that touches off a conflagration of revolt throughout the country. But the problem is the party that should have been leading that the party that had been filled by the most capable people with the best analysis of the situation who had acted the smartest in pursuing it were in the social democratic party because being part of germany meant being part of this machine of accommodation because capitalism was uh developing and it was developing a middle class.

It was developing a political articulation of anxiety relative to exploitation and that means that you saw this reforming instinct and so fine you get the you get the uh you get the extension of the franchise you get called toleration. You get the first social welfare system bismarck. The great the great mind of his time. The great liberal mind of his time so oh capitalism is is causing some squeaky wheels. Here we're going to grease them or the thing's going to blow up and he did. He greased them up greased them up good and so and they legalized the sdp. The the uh the bolsheviks were only very rarely legal in in soviet union as I said their leadership kept going to jail the sdp got to run in elections and they got to. Uh send people to parliament and they got to send a bunch of people to parliament. They get to create an entire political class of office holders. They get to get rid of political class of newspaper editors and and trade union executives who fill the ranks of this new middle class and who are also the brains of the party. Yes. It's it's still being fed at the root by the organization of the working class. But it's all being contained by this party apparatus that is growing more and more middle class more and more bourgeois accommodating itself in its daily life to the conditions of the petty bourgeois not the work and so when the moment comes this party that is that was born and contained the best analysis of of german capitalism is not ready for it because it's  bourgeoisie and so when the first rebels begun the social democrats act swiftly to prevent a revolution that needed to happen because the bolsheviks were right that there needed to be a world revolution they were correct. Now that was a belief that was necessitated by their position at the end of the donkey but it didn't mean they weren't right.

The germans were wrong because they hadn't spent the last 10 years in siberia or in exile or or getting beat up by the checker. It's been the last 10 years getting fat in offices having tea cakes with the  local chief of police and so when the moment comes they can't see it and they fight against it and then who is germa who is the german revolution's lenin frederick ebert as in the person who was smartest the person who was most in a position of power and had the best way of the land but his motivation was wrong. He wanted to preserve this state that needed to go and so they created the fry core which becomes the spine of the nazi party to put down uh the revolt now of course. It didn't help that the revolt was led by people like luxembourg and leafneck who were frankly not that competent certainly compared to the  bolsheviks and more importantly did not preside over a well-oiled machine of revolutionary um. A well-oiled machine of revolutionary um discipline like the bolsheviks did because how do you enforce that discipline and with the bolsheviks you  up here what's gonna happen you're gonna have to get yelled at rosa. Luxembourg's gonna say that you got to buy the google for the next meeting who gives a.

It's just there's less of a disciplining effect and so the movement itself is on discipline and you don't really see the the thing that makes you know that there was a potential for a successful revolution in germany is that between the initial rising and keel and the final putting down of like the rohr valley uprising with where the red army was formed uh in 1920-21 you saw enough sustained effectively organized uh political and military coordination and action by the left broadly construed that it could have taken power. It had been coordinated properly but part of the reason it wasn't is that in that initial uh burst there were a bunch of people who either went along with the sdp or stood back and watch what happened because they weren't sure they believed in the party. They thought maybe they're right and then it was only later after the establishment of the post war government and certainly uh of the post-war government and the creation of like an all-powerful president and all this and the refusal to carry out any meaningful uh social uh socialization of the uh economy. They started rebelling but it was too late at that point and it was unorganized and that is because of time and place time and space determining the fact. This thing all explodes at once but it is unevenly divided and it's unequally developed and so it spreads across the world and it cuts to hits different places at different points and then the need to compete drives it forward. Like the russians didn't want to  do capitalism.

Nobody did they had to do it serge. Gavida had to pull them by their nipples to do it because they were in a competitive state framework. It would give them the tools to compete with the other powers and uh and so this thing kicks off simultaneously. But it develops in different ways because of the social conditions. There's no middle class in russia by then it's it's a peasant. It's a bunch of army barracks on top of a peasant uh uh thraldom and that means that the parties develop differently. They develop and but the thing is capitalism is going all the same time it's on its own clock. It's developing separately at different things because at different rates because of the conditions in germany versus in russia. But the glo the thing itself has a clock a clock. When once it strikes the thing will go into fatal crisis and that is what we got in 1914 and what we got through. It is the suppression of communism in europe and and then the assertion of a global capitalist empire that slowly wall and steamingly steamrolls capitalism over the rest of the world at the expense of the people who live there and the ability to create massive amounts of surplus that can be ex enjoyed relatively guilt-free at the center of capitalism to distribute the spoils of empire and so once again you got a time space  up but it was not and here's the thing that looks that looks mechanical how could it have gone any differently because these things are made up of individual decisions that can change and and they're made up of a bunch of events that are essentially random assassinations.

Um outcomes of battles uh changes of position changes of weather is a big one and in that world we're always uh in we're always living between these possibilities. These things are always open because somewhere there is a thing a coin flipping. There's a coin flipping with it all around us at all times. So we can. We're all we're moving through these coin flips. So we we cannot subjectively experience it as determined. We have to subjectively experience it as open because it is we only know what happened. We can't know what's going to happen. That is how we rescue us ourselves partially from despair. We approach politics through that lens while also cultivating love for those around us and for other things and for and for and for the universe. It's as cheesy as that sounds off-loading our ego and the emotional connection of our ego to other things and other people and people and animals and everything and then also embracing the eternally flipping coins that make up our world and that we're moving through I mean. I can look at american history and I see a bunch of spots where real happiness stands shaped us in significant ways. I've talked a bunch about civil war and reconstruction. You don't have to have that many flipped coins go differently for uh benjamin butler to become vice president for example or for lincoln to just not be assassinated. It was not a it was not like that was a  uh and guaranteed thing.


A million things could have happened that could have by happenstance changed the outcome of that assassination attempt. I mean my god they were trying to kill four guys. All the other uh attempts failed or three other guys. All the other attempts failed. Uh the guy who was supposed to kill. Seward went into his bedroom and tried to stab him in the neck but he had a uh he had like a splint from breaking his jaw in a carriage accident and he didn't get him uh. George. Azeroth was supposed to kill johnson and I mean there's another one. Azeroth goes up and kills johnson like he was supposed to then uh schuler colfax who was a radical republican and speaker of the house becomes president. He wasn't a neck brace that's incorrect that I i I say that because I thought it was a neck brace and I actually was looking at a recently looking at a uh an account of the assassination and it said that it's actually in that race but or I mean a uh a splint but let me know if anyone wants to fact checkmate on that one.

They can but these are all coin flips and then what we get is. The worst possible outcome andrew johnson the one man in the country who could have been no worse position there that wasn't destined. I mean there's a very good chance that if henry clay becomes president in 1840 yes that you don't get a civil war. But you also don't get westward expansion the way that it happened because henry clay was had a possibility there to govern the uh with to govern the entire united states along the rubric of his american system of internal improvements and terror formation and the building of an industrial economy on the model of europe but that would have required the slowing of westward expansion and the eventual end of slavery. Now. Obviously that system was resisted by the south uh very strongly and they said hell no what are you doing. We want to expand we need to expand uh and they were always able to uh succeed at that with the people electorally because the economy kept. Collapsing and getting giving land out for cheap became the only real way to raise revenue for the for the government and provide any relief for people because there is no capacity no desire for a capacity in the state to actually do anything that's the minimalist notion of because all the power is in the in private hands the power to over to exploit being number one.

The only difference between libertarians and slave owners is that they think that they need the piece of paper because they've been acculturated. The time and space has removed them enough from actual slavery that they have to have that piece of paper between them. But it's the same thing and that was their electoral appeal to the broad. Broad population is hey we actually give you land well that was partially because uh the whigs were never really able to hold power. Consistently. They had one chance and it was in the 1830s.

1840 after jacksonian van buren democracy and its its approach to uh currency and banking had seen a massive collapse of the economy in 1837 that with no real response from the government the whigs took power at the presidency and the house and the senate for the first time. In the only time they'd have that in the lead up to the war what during the second party system but henry clay wasn't there to do that because they had nominated an old guy william henry harrison and then when they after they offered the vice presidency to clay and he turned it down because he was pissed that he didn't get the nomination they give it to john tyler who is a southerner who is a a expansionist pro-slavery cycle. The exact opposite of their politics in every respect the opposite the negation of their political project but he didn't like andrew jackson because he wasn't uh tractable enough on the tariff.

Literally an issue that they actually the wings agreed with jackson on he becomes president. They put him on the tape on the ticket to say hey look. We're the whigs anybody who didn't like jackson vote for us because hey that'll get you votes and who cares who's vice president well. This pile of  he put uh a stick in the spokes of the wig agenda for the entire four years. Then the democrats get in you get uh in quick succession the recognition of texas and then the mexican war the final uh the reach too far too fast that led to the inevitable sectional split well what if wigs the wigs get in there and are actually able to deliver economic relief minus uh westward expansion. They slow the pace of westward expansion and develop internally and effectively to grow the economy that way and therefore get the support of some of those would-be yeoman is it possible yes and if it's possible then it could have happened in this world that we otherwise inhabited. It feels so determined right because there's nothing inevitable about john tyler becoming president.

Now you might say ah yes but at a much lower level. Everything is determined yeah but only in retrospect. So we have to always inhabit the ignorance of the moment and that's what we can drive forward with but only if we're motivated by the engine of love. It's about it's about creating a heuristic creating a tunnel creating a path creating a target create creating a hologram of the world to live in and orient yourself in but then also it's about creating a power source to drive you forward and that can only be that's a break. It's a dumb spiritual process of breaking down and it's individualized and all we can do is act with the hope that we can change and those around us can change just like rocky said in rocky iv all right. I hope some of that made sense next week.


Let's say the first. I don't know how long the chapters are because. I haven't looked at it yet. But let's say the first 50 or so pages of the future of the future book of kim stanley. Robinson's uh what's it called something of the bureau of the future. The future book kim stanley robinson's future book what's it called the bureau of the future ministry of the future. I knew it was one of those british terms how about the department of the future huh is that are you an american come on usa usa usa hear. Them yes the ministry of the future. Oh yes.
