I hear mariachis stack on my radio and if they glow in the dark hold me tighter. I think. I'm sinking down and I'm all fine on heroin outskirts of town. All right. This is good. I got a new spot. This is my spot now. I think this is much better than the bed. I'm back hi guys. It's new year's eve new year's rock and eve depending on how it goes tonight not sure if I'm gonna have a stream tomorrow just letting everyone know.

 gonna see some people socially distanced but everyone's of course going to be every have every incentive to just pour paint thinner on their brain because 2020 was an epic waffle of a year am I right folks. I should get this out of the shop don't do product placement unless. I'm getting that paper which I'm not how is everybody doing how's everybody feeling about a new year how is everybody feeling about charging the essentially arbitrary calendar change with meaning as a psychic bone for the sense of lack of control and helplessness that we all have how are we feeling about that. I'm feeling good about it. Let's not pretend 2021 is going to be better because why not if it's worse. What's the big deal oh you were wrong. Notice people are terrified of being wrong and it's because everyone's opinions are all out there now so if you were wrong. People can point it out and it undermines your credibility or your virtue and it makes it it makes it people. They tack away from their joy and it's sad who cares if you're wrong who cares if 2021 is worse than 2020 which it very well might be at least hope. It could be better for one goddamn night if you have a chance. I'm not on the toilet how dare you.

I would not stream on the toilet. I respect. I respect the viewers too much to do that also that's for only fans that's special premium only fans content for when I start showing my hairy to the internet. But that's not yet we'll see we'll see if it comes to that for now. I'm good. I do like the revolutions podcast. I'm glad. It's finally coming back poor mike duncan man. I mean. I know that he he fell off the internet for a while there and he was. He missed his deadlines. I had no idea what the cause was. It turns out he had. Kidney stones my god miserable and the height of covid brutal poor guy. But apparently he's better now and in january. We're gonna get more revolutions which give me my slop. I'm a slop piggy too just like everybody.

I want my content and I'm very excited maybe. I can have my I'd like to talk to him again. We had a really good episode a couple years ago. I'd like to talk to him again. So I thought as the framing device for today's show. I would take some take advice from someone on The subreddit that is devoted to these streams which yes. I have admitted in the past. I look at how could I not it'd be really weird if I didn't where they said inspired by the flag discourse if I could rate the state quarters. I thought that was a great idea because I remember when the state quarters came out. I wasn't. I was a big fan. I I avidly waited for the next ones and made me think yeah damn. We should go through these because I remember just being very mad at most of them for just being terribly designed so. I thought I'd go back and take a look so. I'm gonna go through this year by year which ones we have we've got 1999.

The first quarter is of course for the first state delaware which that's all they really have going for them is that they were the first state to ratify the constitution and now they're essentially a offshore tax haven for corporations and insurance companies way to go. There's no reason that you should exist. They should be annexed by pennsylvania or somebody and have their state government abolished have their. The delaware method and joe biden are now going to be are going to be practicing their particular brand of transactional politics and boy. It's gonna be a nightmare and it's just caesar rodney on a horse because what the else are you. Gonna talk about with delaware there's nothing to talk about unless you just wanted a picture of like a p.o. Box that for some you know holding company that is technically headquartered in delaware but has no offices that would be the ideal delaware quarter.

Instead they have caesar rodney who was the founding father who most famous is most famous for riding day and night from the continental continental army encampment to the philadelphia continental congress to give a report on the disposition of washington's army which helped bolster the spines of the delegates who were wavering about whether or not to vote to declare independence from great britain. So it's like a key moment and it's very dramatic. He shows up. He says the army is good. We can win this thing and people said yes so cesar rodney who had a face. He had face cancer face cancer that's brutal hardcore imagine having face cancer in the 1700s well. He got a state quarter out of it so guy and a horse. What can you say not that good. That's a c that's that's minimal effort but delaware what else do you want them to give you pennsylvania. They just show the stupid state because they're so proud that it's shaped like a keystone oh my god. They're so proud. We're the keystone state our state happens to vaguely resemble a keystone of a building congratulations and then they've got a liberty lady holding a stick once again and they have an actual keystone just to remind you of why they call it that and also to remind you that the state doesn't even really look that much like a keystone and that the whole dumb thing is pretty forced so once again c terrible yeah everyone's talking about mf doom. I he's the guy who rapped about food any more mask never listen to. It don't know young. Mc is my favorite rapper people. New jersey is just a it's just washington crossing the delaware which hey you can't fault him for. It's new jersey. What are you gonna do have like a body buried in a in the pine barrens or something It's a it's a classic moment from american history.

It's it's busy but because it's a scene of action it doesn't feel cluttered. It's pretty good not bad georgia just the state shape and a peach. I mean it kind of looks like an ass. So that's funny but other than that pretty uninspiring connecticut gets credit because it's got that the tree that's it's got the tree. The charter oak and it's got all the big branches and so it's at least got like a It's a little symmetrical. I like it. It's the best of those. I would say of the 1999 ones. The best is definitely connecticut with the tree. In 2000. Massachusetts was just the stupid state first of all honestly if you have the state shape you're losing who cares state shapes aren't interesting for the most part and we know you should know what the states are shaped like anyway and it's got a minute man oh. They're so proud of their dumb minute man. Once it's got a gun on it which is kind of cool. Maryland has just their state dome and it says old line state oh my god wow boring south carolina once again shape of the stupid state and a palmetto and a dumb bird. I don't like the collage ones at all. New hampshire's is actually hilarious because it has the old man on the mountain which shortly after the coin was released. Fell away and doesn't exist anymore so that has its own special charm and then virginia a bunch of colonial ships coming into jamestown. I like boats boats are always good on a coin. None of these are terribly good honestly. I guess I go with virginia just because of the sails but other than that yeah. The mountain the the old man on the mountain is like was a was a face shaped outcropping on a mountain that fell off fell off a few years ago. So I give virginia that one in two thousand two thousand two thousand one new york.

It's just the state shape but instead it's just like massachusetts state shape and then instead of a minuteman. It's the statue of liberty boring lame north. Carolina has the kitty hawk airplane which always annoys me because both ohio and north carolina claim to be the state that was first in flight because the wright brothers are from ohio and they designed the airplane in ohio in their bicycle shop. But then they took it to the dunes of north carolina to fly in my mind. There should be some sort of adjudication on who gets to be the first in flight state and honestly. I think ohio has a better argument. The wright brothers were sons of ohio. They were sons of the industrious midwest. They literally just went to north carolina because there was a big flat area. They could fly a plane on so north. Carolina big demerits for stealing valor from ohio. There rhode island. They got a sailboat and a bridge reminding you that it's the state of boat shoe wearing rich. And then kentucky is just a horse and a horse barn wow. These are all these suck. These are terrible don't like any of them. I guess because because there's a boat on it. I'll go with rhode island when in doubt. I'll put. I'll go with the boat kentucky or tennessee in 2002 is just their musical heritage.

It literally just says musical heritage and then there's a guitar and a fiddle and a trumpet like try to create a a concept try to create some sort of tableau don't just throw things together. Ohio also has the kitty. It has the airplane on it but then they also have an astronaut on there because a ton of the astronauts including john glenn and I believe neil hunt. Neil armstrong are from ohio and honestly that that is a a spike in the face of north carolina that they don't have they they don't just have a claim to airplanes. They have a claim to space travel. Louisiana just has I love louisiana. It's got an outline of the united states and then it has within it the purchase which the vast majority of which is not louisiana. You're what that's not that's just a name man what the brag about indiana's shape in any way and then they've got a formula one car because they have the indian fo indianapolis 500.

There brutal depressing mississippi is the clear winner in 2002. It's a big a big bush of magnolias. It's got. It's it's it's floral. It's nice. Mississippi definitely wins the 2003 two ones okay illinois once again shape you're in bad shape there with the shape but then they also have a barn on one side and then they have the willis tower on the other and then a young abe lincoln standing where illinois is. I love lincoln as you guys know But I would have gone with just lincoln's face or something or like with the hat or something why do you have to do the shape of the stupid state. Alabama has hilariously helen keller just sitting in a chair which if you know that she was a pretty committed communist. It's pretty funny that you've got the state of alabama commemorating a commie but as a design very uninspired. Maine's got a lighthouse and a boat which is nice. I like that missouri has the stupid.

 gateway arch and lewis and clark on a little canoe and arkansas bafflingly has a giant diamond and then like a swamp I guess are there diamonds in arkansas is is it is there some sort of mining operation in arkansas that I'm not aware of if anyone knows anyone from arkansas. Do they mind diamonds there. It's a swamp diamond oh little rock is that the rock they were talking about well whatever not very good. I got to give this one to maine. The the the lighthouse is nice and of course. It's got a boat in it 2004. Michigan. Just the great lakes the outline of the mitten and then the great lakes themselves once again those aren't your stealing them okay. Apparently there are diamonds in the ozarks okay interesting so yeah. Great lakes for yourself florida terrible palm tree like clipper ship and then a space shuttle because that's where cape canaveral is terrible just put a big orange in there or something or mickey mouse. I know they'd love to do that texas what a shock just the shape of texas and then their big stupid star. I'm not the only one who noticed this of course but doesn't that the star on the texas flag just look like an someone's asking about if we talked about in the republic for which it stands. 

We did talk about it yesterday after this. I'm going to talk about it a little more because I want to talk a little bit more about the panic 1873. And how it happened. It's pretty interesting So then we got iowa little red schoolhouse foundation and education dorks might as well. Just say nerds might as well just say. This is a state for dorks and nerds poindexter state and then wisconsin which I have to say one of the worst. There is. It's just a stoop. It's a cow's head and then a wheel of cheese and then an ear of corn and then the state motto forward embarrassing embarrassing all around you've got the cheese and the cow you can't commit to one or the other. They're both dairy related This is a terrible year. All of these are bad I hesitate to even pick a favorite.

Oh. I guess I i hate to say it. But I guess I gotta go with texas just because that star if any at least is a you know is a stark symbol as opposed to the cluttered space. Shuttles blew up in the ass jesus christ florida stays winning california. You got john muir looking at yosemite lame cluttered why not just use the condor why not just put the california condor on. There they got the little condor in the background just do the condor lame minnesota.

The stupid shape and then a lake guess what up wisconsin has more lakes than minnesota oregon. Crater lake nice lake. Some trees serene not bad evocative not cluttered but hard to beat kansas just a good old. See kansas is great because you've got a buffalo but then you've got a little sunflower which is the state flower right next to it. So you get an evocation of the state. You get the landscape or I mean you get like the floor and fauna and it's historic. It's it's history. You don't have to have the stem shape the square shape and then west. Virginia is a bridge over the new river gorge which is nice but a little cluttered but yeah. Nothing's beating kansas kansas definitely number one on that one 2006 nevada nevada is very busy but I actually kind of like it. It's a bunch of wild horses stampeding across a desert with a rising sun. In the background says the silver state on it. It's good. I like I like nevada and then you got nebraska.

You got conestoga wagons and chimney rock and and some sun I mean it's basically doing the same thing kind of the nevada is but less interestingly and less dynamically because the the the wagon train looks like statues. It doesn't look like. It's in motion as opposed to the horses that look like they're in full gallop. Colorado. You got a hill you got a big mountain of course. It's the rockies kind of no-brainer. There north dakota also has buffalo like kansas does but to buffalo with the sun way more busy. Not nearly as good. So not only is it the second buffalo quarter. It's the less distinctive less well-designed buffalo quarters so north. Dakota stays losing south dakota mount rushmore which by the way has anyone bundle up mount rushmore.

I mean I know obviously that it's a horrifying cultural crime. It's like it's essentially. We did an end zone dance to celebrate our ethnic cleansing of the black hills by taking a sacred mountain and carving our greatest war criminals onto it but forget the politics. If you ever go. It is insanely underwhelming you you go out onto this promontory like this big parking lot and there's. Bathrooms and gift shops and there's just a big flat plane and you just look across a little gully and then there's the the outcropping and then you look at it. And it's exactly what you think it is and it's not that big even it doesn't look that imposing it's lame. It sucks gust up. Borglum was a. It's it's one of our least intrep impressive pieces of national monument realty sucks thumbs down of these.

I will go with nevada for sure with the with the horses 2007. Montana is badass. It's got a. It's got a steer skull with the horns and then some mountains in the background. Washington's got a jumping fish and a little hill and water idaho the bird and then the shape of the state. Boring wyoming has is a great one. It's an outline of a lady cowgirl bucking on a bronco and it says the equality state which of course it's known as because it was the first state to allow women to vote which it did as an enticement to get them to move there because like many western states it had a wild gender imbalance in its early. Days and then utah nothing not the beehive I would have thought the beehive would have been a no-brainer. Instead they go with transcontinental railroad and the in this and the spike at at the cross. What the was it called promontory point promotory point right something like that gotta go here with yeah. I'll go with wyoming I like. I like the the cowgirl it tells the story and then finally the last year 2008 um we got oklahoma. We got a bird and some flowers new mexico points for their great symbol from their wonderful flag points against because it's laid up against a stupid state background which when you're a big square state there's the least reason to put your state shape. On there. It's a what is arizona's oh. There's arizona oh the grand canyon of course that's a no-brainer. Although honestly the grand canyon depiction isn't very good. It doesn't really look like a canyon. It kind of looks like a mountain so they don't they kind of bungle it alaska big old bear with salmon in his mouth that's pretty good. I like the bear and then hawaii is I think king kamehameha holding out his arm and then the archipelago I kind of give hawaii I give them of any of the states. They're the ones who I understand putting the shape in there. The most because it's a bunch of islands. But I gotta go with alaska there with the bear. So that's so if the best ones are alaska wyoming nevada kansas texas maine mississippi rhode island virginia and connecticut. I think my favorite honestly. I think my favorite is kansas. I think it's kansas. I think that's my favorite one.

I think in a future one. I'm gonna do the president quarters which happened. Shortly after these. They did all this all the quarters. I don't even know if they got. They did them all though because I think they might have stopped. I'm not sure let me see if they did the whole thing all right. They were dollar coins yeah. They did all of them. They did everybody up to george. H.w bush but they haven't done one since that's the last one. They did let me just. I'll just look through these and see. If any of them are good The nixon one is hilarious. It doesn't look like him at all. These are all pretty underwhelming but you know what are you gonna do. It's just a bunch of white guys The van buren one is nice because they get his amazing haircut yeah. They're all pretty boring so there we go. Those are the state quarters. None of them are very good. It's amazing those states had a long time to think of them.

They often had like contests to decide and that's all they came up with was mostly very uninspiring collages which really tells you what you get from group artistic decision making so right but now let's talk about the panic of 1873 which led to the longest economic contraction in american history over 60 months straight of economic attraction in part because the liberal orthodoxy of the of the dominant republican party refused to increase the money supply and inject cash into the economy which led to contraction and deflation and helped kill reconstruction because the election of 1872 which saw republican governments take power in many southern states was relatively violence free compared to many of the other post-civil war southern elections but then the election of 1878 was marked by a convulsion of violence and a return to democratic rule in most of them and a lot of it was because the republican project was invalidated in the minds of The small holding white and poor white population because the election failed or because the the economy failed and it didn't have to it didn't have to god damn it. But anyway what caused it to happen. Was that the so the civil war saw the biggest accumulation of capital in america since the since the revolution which is what happens when you have a big war that we have talked about that before about how the napoleonic war is what created the like the capital dynamo that burst english industrial dominance and that a similar thing happened in the united states but after the war there had to be something to take the place of of that spending of that of that investment that used to go into procuring and producing material for the war and that was the building of railroads both through the reconstructed south and into the west and it was accomplished by the government subsidizing private corporations to essentially just take land along the route and giving it to them and that those the the economic engine of the economy the the the paper that underwrote the economy because we weren't yet on the gold standard. Yet it still took time is was railroad bonds. Were were bonds that railroads sold in order to finance construction and expansion and purchasing of other railroads because there was a drive towards monopolization in every level of the railroad economy. But the thing about it was is that the more bonds you sold the more interest you had to pay on the bonds and that necessitated if you didn't have a profit if you didn't have like a profit engine under girding. The business which many most of these railroads didn't. They did not make money any more than silicon. Valley makes money now and that meant that they had to sell more bonds more new bonds and then new bond money from people. Purchasing bonds today paid for the interest in the old bonds that other people had purchased and there was a economic risk a sharp stock market collapse in europe first in vienna and then shock waving out throughout the rest of europe then hitting the united kingdom which is where most foreign capital was coming into the united states and that led to a reduction in demand for american railroad bonds and once there was nobody there to buy the new bonds. There was nobody there there was no money to pay for the interest on the old bonds and all of these railroads just went into receivership almost overnight and that engine that was keeping the economy.

Going was keeping demand for steel and lumber and was providing speculative opportunities for wall street. Went away and you read that and you think my god how could anybody let that happen it's a ponzi scheme. It's a mother someone says does that count as a kanzi scheme essentially and the thing about. It is that's everything now that is that's the essence of finance is that it's all paying new money. It's all using new money to pay for old debts that was the essence of the um that was the essence of the real estate collapse. In 2008. Too the money there was there was a there was a reduction in the flow of new money to pay for all the bets that have been placed on these mortgages and as soon as that happens the whole thing shudders to a halt. It's inevitable boom and bust it can't be done away with with it with 

With capitalism. It's an intrinsic part of it and the funny thing about people who love the gold standard not 70 by 70. In the panic of 73. There was no gold standard not yet anyway but there was a huge collapse. In 1892. I believe which was during the gold standard and then of course the great depression happened under the gold standard too. It is amazing gold gold. Buggery is one of the least defensible one of the least like coherent intellectually compelling fetishes you can have. It is pure and very blatant ideology and it's kind of astounding that there are still people who fixate upon it and I think it boils down to the fact that as much as capitalists like to make fun of socialists for saying oh we haven't really had socialism. Nothing's been tried that every single time at capitalism causes mass admiseration. There has to be an explanation and it always boils down to well you're not doing capitalism right and as I have said the same forces that pushed for the gold standard are the same ones that coordinated the move over to a federal reserve system and the end of gold convertibility and then the end of the gold standard. In general. It was it was not the government doing that it was not some sort of big government colossus that is anyway inextricably linked to finance capital. It was finance capital. It was to their advantage at every point and the gold standard now is just a thing a a a fantasy alternative and honestly you know. The the bi-medalism of the populists was a similar thing but that's because they weren't able to imagine a economic reality outside of capitalism and so what if we put some silver in there and increase the money supply became sort of the signal reform but it was generate. It was motivated more just by wanting there to be an alternative wanting there to be something other than what was not working. When the fact is that what had to go what had to get rid of it was the end of that system.

I chanted. I sang a brian brian brian candidate for president who sketched a silver zion. I read that vashta lindsay poem about the brian campaign like eight months ago now on when I was doing these on instagram. I don't know if anyone remembers that I mean yes there was there was a nationalization as part of it. But you know limited. Nationalization is still capitalism. I mean like the french model is more socialistic than ours. But it's still it is still a mixed economy. It's just the degree of mix but no the the silver. The silver bugs were definitely better than the gold bugs. I mean the gold buggery at that time was pure and has always been pure reaction whereas there is like a progressive motivation. At the heart of the the silver movement was william jennings bryan the silver the gilded age bernie. I mean the closest thing yeah definitely and he was a guy who like bernie started out as a third party guy. He was nominated by the populist party for president and it was a deal where the democrat ah. It was for the democrats so as not to be outflanked nominated him too which is also what happened in 1872 with horace greeley who was nominated by the third party liberal republicans and then the democrats nominated him too just because he was an alternative to republicanism basically and the democrats at that point in the north which is where they were you know electorally coherent. Had no real raison d'etre. Besides you know opposing um opposing reconstruction on behalf of their southern constituents which greeley by that point wanted to do away with the liberal republicans in general wanted to sell out the friedman completely and move on.

It is funny to imagine horse greeley getting elected and they're dying right away. I'm not sitting on the toilet good lord who were these people with with whose bathroom has a window directly behind the. You people are freaks. Modern vampires somebody's asking about I've never heard of this movie. They all. I saw as they said squibs you have my interest.

Now you have my attention but it's amazing when you read the the history of the railroad specifically in the way that that they were wildly subsidized to no good end. Like there there was at no there is no rational justification for the way that the u.s went about funding railroad construction after the civil war. The only thing the only way any of it makes sense is bribery was fraud but the ones doing the bribing and the fraud fraud were largely the same people who were condemning tammany and and graft essentially because some of that money went to the the you know jobs for the teaming irish masses in the cities and not to the not to the you know well-ordered protestant homes of stock speculators and that's why any alternative reconstruction would have required a a force would have required a coherent organized political a self-interested political coalition whose interest was not could not be bought off essentially because that's the problem with the working class in the united states at that point is that due to the fact that it was largely ethnically and religiously segregated and the fact that it was stuck into ghettos in cities like boston and philadelphia and new york is that they could be and were handled on a client basis and that prevented them from doing any real like class-based organizing that came later. But by that point you know capital accumulation had become so successful and so had so leviathanic that their ability to fight it was much much worse. Somebody was asking about grants. Grant's third term. He did try to run for a third term and I like the way that richard white puts it in the book where he says that grant was sort of reluctant to run for president because he didn't feel like he was prepared for it.

But then he needed. He felt he needed to run for a third term because he wasn't prepared to do anything else. But it's hard to imagine if he'd gotten that third term anything would have been better. I mean the compromise of 1877 which formerly ended reconstruction was of course a death knell for progress in this country. But by that point it's hard to imagine it. Anything else going the polit anything else happening even if you hadn't had that occur because the the political will in the north for any further expenditure of men or money to maintain black rights in the south was completely exhausted and like the thing that changes that hypothetically if we're talking about wish casting is not anything that happens that late in the game.

It's things that happen very very early after the war. Things that allow black economic and political power to be organized harnessed and asserted and in the immediate aftermath of the war which would have created a momentum of its own and changed. Political calculations made for example the black vote in the south something that was uncontestable something that couldn't be neutralized by terror and by manipulation by former confederates because there would have been enough at the early stages federal support and federal protection for freedmen and freed women to allow for the building of economic and political institutional power and again. I don't know if that's possible in this country in with the with the material we had but it couldn't. It certainly was not going to happen with andrew johnson as president and as much as lincoln was a man of his time. He was also a man who unlike johnson could change his mind and his views on things like the ability of blacks and whites to live side by side had radically changed from the way they were at the beginning of the war and there were enough northerners who would have been changed by the experience of fighting the war who in the very after in that moment in that moment of triumph could have made different decisions collectively that could have had a cumulative effect anyway.

It's certainly fun to think about it's certainly more fun to think about than the future of the actual world. We live in which might explain why I'm so drawn to it. Grant was kind of a himbo. He was not as dumb as he's remembered. Historically. He was I mean he was militarily very adept and he was and he had a aptitude for for military grand strategy that was superior for most of his opponents certainly more than lee lee of course wildly overrated. Lee was a was a pretty good tactician but part of that was the fact that he was mostly fighting against overmatched political hacks for a large part of the war and you know buffoons like mcclellan. I mean my god. How are you gonna take credit for beating george mcclellan. The guy basically didn't want the union to win for christ's sake. How the hell are you gonna take credit for that.

I mean like there's a whole theory that the that the howl brothers the who are the naval and and army commanders of the of the british. Colonial military during the american revolution who and who are both freemasons and and wigs were basically kind of rooting for the colonists and weren't trying that hard which kind of explains how the the colonialists were able to avoid destruction so many times most notably after the battle of brooklyn when howe had a chance to absolutely wipe out. Washington's army and took so goddamn long to cross over from staten island to manhattan that it gave washington time to escape to the mainland.

There's a similar thing with mcclellan. I mean not only was he a democrat who hated lincoln posed emancipation but after he got to smart discharge. He ran against lincoln in 1864 on a peace platform on a let. The south secede platform how the hell are you going to give lee that much credit for beating him especially since he didn't even beat him that many times he lost tactically almost every one of the seven days battles and then. Mcclellan would just retreat because he was he obviously believed he was outnumbered and then of course he couldn't even he was battled to a draw and antietam. Anyway he was okay tactically but he was a strategic nincompoop. He invaded the north twice who who who could look at the disposition of forces of the confederacy versus the union and the south versus the north and say we should be invading the north. That's madness you are you are you are outnumbered. You are vastly less resources. Vastly fewer popul vastly smaller population you fight attrition. You make you fight until they can't fight anymore.

You do not spend men and. Material what trying to take washington dc you. About richmond why are you taking richmond is just the capital. It's just a bunch of buildings. It's it's it's some buildings and some boxes of files. You can put them on a horse and ride them away. So so grant was definitely a better strategic thinker than lee was but he was not a great political thinker. I mean most of these generals weren't like if they were they would have been. Politicians you know and of those like of those generals who take the reigns. None of them really are political minds. Washington wasn't a political mind um grant wasn't a political mind. Eisenhower was not the difference between three of those is that washington essentially had he was there to lend his credibility to the enterprise and to assuage all of the wary colonies. Former colonies that nobody was gonna be over awed by this federal government because everyone trusted president general washington because he had had the chance to be king and turned it down. He was the cincinnatis and um eisenhower was able to preside over what was essentially a bipartisan political economic consensus as like deeply entrenched in its way as neoliberalism is now 

But as I said yesterday grant was was was coming onto a scene of absolute protein liquidity and he was not really the man for it. I mean I don't necessarily think that you need like a lincoln third term or anything if he doesn't get assassinated hey. Maybe. He gets assassinated somewhere in his second term but then you need an actual politician. An actual radical republican to be president and more importantly than because of their individual um. You know values or anything what they represent of a coalition like the interest because grant was not indebted in any way to the radical republicans. He was standing sort of on top this rickety collection of of republicans of the liberal and stalwart radical and conservative types. He did not really represent any one faction as you would have needed somebody who actually did represent the radicals and not just the radicals represented the economic radicals among them. Because there were plenty of radical republicans who were fully down with laissez faire but yeah. Benjamin wade benjamin wade would have been better so another another what if that we dodged was what if they'd republican benjamin wade as president but sadly for him.

A lot of people knew that and didn't want him to be president and were betting on grant so they that was one of the reasons that he they couldn't get johnson out but yeah you need to not have johnson in there at all just throwing up literally just throwing a. But he was you know what he was doing and then more more even than his like tactical brilliance was the fact that he could He was able to master the the um rapid deployment of infantry which was very difficult. During that period. You know they called him foot cavalry because of how fast jackson could get his guys around and that was a huge I mean that's essentially that was not that was a large percentage of napoleon's innovation was his ability to take the increased mobility of a of a republican military force that had esprit de corps that came from a shared mission as opposed to the collection of mercenaries and and conscripts that made up you know european old royal militaries and used that to make them move much much faster so and that allowed him much more maneuverability relative to his opponents and jackson had that same thing I like thinking I like talking about the worst confederates more though john bell hood might have been the very worst of all of them just in terms of how disastrously terror.

I mean he's more responsible for the burning of atlanta and the destruction that sherman wrought than almost anybody because he destroyed his army. People talk about the idiocy of pickett's charge which was of course idiotic and another of on many pieces of evidence. That lee was a overrated hack. But at least pickett's charge was preceded by a huge hours-long artillery bombardment that was theoretically supposed to destroy the center of the union force and allow them to just kind of march through it. It didn't work they they were firing over the heads most of the time but porter alexander but at least had an idea at at franklin. John bell hood sent his army against the fixed and the fixed position of thomas with no arc hillary from bombard. Whatsoever just sent him into the thresher and destroyed his whole army in the process killed like 13 generals. I believe so as you can imagine. He's one of my favorite confederate generals and I do think it's funny that two of our big military bases that are named after confederate generals that we're supposed to be mad about and it is ups in the whole. Goddamn confederate army. I'll tell you the one I hate hearing to hearing about it all is because he is every every soft confederate apologist's favorite confederate general because he said hey let's emancipate the slaves and have him fight for us. Why would they do that. I don't know I'm sitting over here eating a potato like an apple don't up because it was a dumb idea and it was unconnected to everything and he got murked at.

 gentry loved their horses but he was m.i.a. For the first two days of gettysburg when lee needed him most which helped lead him into a blind bleep blundering in to means forces and then he got his ass killed at yellow tavern good riddance to bad rubbish ah. I do go back and forth about mead and whether or not he should have attacked lee after gettysburg. I mean I totally get that they were really mauled but lee was even more mauled and when you think of how long it took to drive them down after that and how many how many dead there were it's hard to imagine going that much worse william mahone is an interesting character because he was a confederate general and well regarded one who like james longstreet became a republican after the war a scalawag as they called them but even more so in the 1890s headed a a multi-racial populist political organization in virginia that oppose the bourbon reactionary democrats and if and when you think about guys like that and there were not oh they're not a few of them. There were no there were not a few ex-confederates who who who ended up after the war supporting the reconstruction governments and becoming republicans. I mean my god albert parsons. One of the one of the haymarket martyrs was a confederate veteran when you consider how many of them there were in the context of the you know shitty and economically exploitative reconstruction. We got imagine how many we could have had imagine how many more there would have been in a context where the reconstruction of the south was economically revitalizing instead of you know exploitative where everybody who was not a slave owner and a plantation owner got land and got a chance to prosper as holders. The way that you're supposed to do in the north.

There were there was plenty of There was a lot of potential. There was ferment. Things didn't have to go the way they did. I really believe that they definitely should have hung jeff davis. There's no question about that I mean they should have hung. I mean you don't want to get too bloodthirsty but they should have hung most of the confederate leadership. The cabinet for sure they obviously should have banned anybody who served in the government from ever voting again. I mean that's a no-brainer and on obviously obviously obviously anybody who owned land anybody who owned plantation should have had it taken from them. Sherman was a good strategic mind but he wasn't very good tactically. He he would get he would get in his head about the opponent and and he would kind of second guess himself and double clutch. He doesn't like his his battles dirt his his battles during the march to the sea and and to atlanta and then the sea aren't terribly impressive like I said a lot of it was facilitated by the fact that the the armies of the west were getting mauled by the army of the cumberland and franklin and nashville. Difference between strategies and tactics is so like the anaconda plan that winfield scott devised at the beginning of the war to defeat the south naval blockade split it in half that's a strategy tactics are like at chancellorsville for example when faced with superior numbers of um. That was pope right yeah pope's army. He split his forces and had stonewall. Jackson like do a surprise flank attack that's a tactic but yeah sherman didn't do great like bad like kennesaw mountain and stuff he he was. He was prone to sort of wasting troops and direct frontal assaults.

If I wasn't a podcast or would my dream career be. I thought about that and I think I'd like to direct a movie which is pathetic because the art form is dying as all art forms are now anything that requires capital is is going down the tubes. But I would like to direct a movie and I think I'd be a good teacher too. If I i mean you want to talk about more realistically. I could probably get a certificate or something. I don't. I mean probably yeah get like a teaching certificate be a cool sub. I could do that well podcasting is an art form. What makes it so is its low capital investment homeless alcoholic. I mean possibly. I wouldn't last long. I don't think I got a limp. I would be easy meat. There might be a pot if if if spotify eats the world the way they're trying to on podcasting there might end up being like a podcaster's guild or like a union which of course would be the that's the trajectory of all artisanal forms of labor being being turned being proletarianized. Yeah.

My my dream project would be to write direct something about the mothman mothman and mk ultra someone is saying that having citizenship based to property ownership is is doomed and dooms liberty correct and that's one of those things that would have had to have been destroyed by the the by the contradictions of the of the post-civil war era being heightened and sharpened faster like it would you would not have had. I really think that like a successful reconstruction would not in any sense be peaceful it would in fact be in it would be a more explicit war. It would it would be a more violent. It would be another stage of violence because it was the stage of violence. It's just. The violence was mostly carried out against former slaves and so therefore was able to be absorbed by the political consensus pretty easily because these were people who were not really considered citizens by most people even if they might have technically acquired citizenship by the post-war constitutional amendments you would have you would have seen violence. It just would have been It would have in fact been more widespread. It would but it would have involved violence against recalcitrant former slave owners and and the people that they could whip up into militarily supporting them and it would have hopefully ended with the destruction of the constitutional order which is why I don't think lincoln would have done it because lincoln loved the constitution and I think he would have not have been the one to preside over its destruction but somebody would have because if the contradictions had been brought to the fore if black citizenship and he and personhood was more firmly established as something that a even if it's a thin majority a majority of northern whites supported.

The constitution would have been shown to be unviable and the property-based conception of freedom would have been unviable and it would have had to be replaced by something else. Not not socialism. There would have not been any forces for that but something that had more flexibility to it and something that allowed for a force beyond mere bribery to determine the shape of political economy which is what the we ended up getting. The civil war created a new class of finance capitalists who were sitting on government bonds and then railroad bonds and those men bought the government as surely as the oligarchs bought the post-soviet government and the only thing that would have stopped that from happening is a coalition of political will that would have been asserting common rights not property rights. Oh someone's asking about us the tryhard christmas episode thank you for liking that.

I know a lot of people don't like those because they're very inside baseball and it's all references but if we only do like one a year. I don't feel like that's too much to ask to be indulgent. Once in a while to have a little fun. You know a little reward for the people who have who've spent too much time listening to us. Over the year you know but we it was me chris and will we we sat down and we we punched out a script and then we basically allowed felix. Once we recorded it to just riff so he he wrote most of his own lines as we was as he was reading them because he is the rift master unparalleled whereas I mostly stuck to the script because when I'm doing a character or a voice it's hard for me to improvise too much well.

Class. Consciousness is an id. Some of that says class consciousness is idealism idealism is the idea is the idea that ideas are what change things people have but everyone is operating off of ideas every day. It's just that those ideas are shaped by their material reality people with people who are exploited people who are working class. They are. They are whether they are aware of it or not subject to capitalism. Subject to capital exploitation are immigrated by it in some way or another but they might not be aware of it. Coming into awareness of that will change their actions but you don't get a permanent change of conditions until people coordinate their activities relative to their role in the productive mechanism by for example withdrawing their labor collectively and then by doing that you establish new structures and new relationships and a new mode of production and then that generates new ideas. The thing is is that you can't separate them completely. You can't separate structure. Super base superstructure are not separate concepts like I said it's like muscle and bone. If you take the bone out. The muscle will just turn into a pile but if you take out pull the muscle away you just have a skeleton it can't dance. It can't do anything they are fully inextricably linked and that's why I like trying to label things and fixating on whether or not something is idealist or or materialist that gets the only reason that that happens.

I think is because people are mostly just arguing. People are mostly just trying to argue about things and so they need labels to pick the good. Things from the bad things they're not applying ideas to their lives and so anything they do in that world. No matter how materialistic they insist. It is will end up just being idealist talking points and and and and hypothetical gabbing like when you say hey like marx's hagel on its head. The the head and the they're still real you know but if you turn something upside down it doesn't mean that the side that was up is no longer doesn't exist anymore. It's just it's at a different level of It's at a different point of It's just at a different point relative to to the other ideas. Like. It's all. It's all part of the same thing non-dualism like if we're just talking about like identifying strands to analyze. But if it's just an analysis it doesn't mean anything anyway it has to be action. It has to be 

It has to filter into your life and the decisions you make with other people do you think that psych this will be the last question. Do you think that psychedelics will ever have a formal position in society. I hope so honestly. I don't want to you know be a or timothy leary or anything. But in my experience psychedelics are more. Can be anyway a more effective therapeutic mechanism than most of our regime of a formal like pharmaceuticals which are mo which mostly exists as like instrumentally to make people functional within a dysfunctional society. Like a a functional society. Drugs of all kinds would be assessed for their for their use not as to make somebody like productive but to make somebody actually heal but certainly not our society like if we do if there is some and I think there probably will be a move towards decriminalizing psychedelics but that's if but that will end up just being the same thing that we've seen with marijuana which is another a form of indulgence. Another another form of escape another way to keep people from feeling too much their alienation but not allowing them away outside of it but yeah.

I would. I would. I would imagine something where you have like psychedelics you know in a therapeutic framework where they're taking taken like in conjunction with a like a coaching system or shamanically but not just for you know silicon valley who could afford to go to chile for ayahuasca experience for anybody who needed it alright guys gals. I hope everyone has a good new year's eve. If you can. I know everyone's in covet hell but if you can have fun try to and yeah you know what 21 20 21 will probably be a veil of tears but you don't know yet have fun if you can bye-bye.
