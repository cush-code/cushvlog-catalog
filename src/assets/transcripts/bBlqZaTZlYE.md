The festival was over and the boys were opening for a fall your. Cameraman was quiet except for the drilling on the wall. They're clear if you had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down. Anyone with any sense had already left town. He was standing in the doorway looking like the jack of hearts backstage. Molly was playing five cards studs by the stairs. Lily had two queens she was hoping for a third to mesh repair. Big. Jim was no one's fool. He roamed the town's only diamond mine. He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine outside the streets were filling up with his diamond line and silver cane. In every walking place. He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it off the waist but his diamond mines and silver cane are no match for the jack of hearts.

Hi folks so tomorrow. We're going to do the chapters four through six of the black jacobins which is a cracking read. I hope everyone's enjoying it. It's a lot it goes down. Smooth doesn't it. we're talking about the the rise of the slave rebellion and also the rise of tusson louvature who james is making a case as one of like history's great historic figures which I would agree with and I really do think that james does a great job of contextualizing like the romantic appeal and and sort of the intuitive sense of like the man of history. You know the great men like there is something that is narratively soothing and and engaging about the imagining history as actions of embodied selves and therefore concentrated the forms of like these great figures and therefore and that they have a they have a role.

Their individual will is able to count more than other peoples in a fundamental way. You know the consent of all the actions of all make up a social corpus but some people get to make more important decisions than others and then when history starts cracking open and crisis emerge. They throw up figures who would otherwise have laying dormant through the social strata and like one of the great tragedies of capitalism is that it as it overwhelms all of life and destroys. Initiative destroys. The capacity for human initiative for human action to actually affect a change capitalism and technology literally strips humans at every level of our autonomy and that means at the top too. The feudal lords of europe did not want capitalism to emerge. They acceded to it in an exigent need to compete with each other for resources and power in the closed socioeconomic system or the closed. the closed order. The westphalian order of european states and we're literally stripped of our ability to affect the world around us. Now we don't accept that fully that's what ideology is there. For that's. What our superstructure is for us is the culture we enjoy live in inverts all values and takes all that's bad in terms of good and gives us an explanation for why things why we have less power. Why are we not able to do what our What our forbearers have been able to do why we couldn't turn the wheel and they had some explanations that they carried with them.

But there's a fundamental sort of dimming of one's connection and eventually you become overtly aware that you're not in control of anything anymore and then you are defeated then you are made into a slave and it destroys your belief in the system sufficient for you to motivate yourself yourself morally and intellectually and energetically like you. You are not able to fix yourself with with any investment behind a position and then you are you are literally disenchanted from the system and that is where we find ourselves where everyone at every level has been stripped of autonomy. But these sys these jobs still exist. They're still filled with people. We're still here. We're still here we're filling the same roles but with less belief in them than ever less self-motivation than ever and that is the crisis of americans social fabric. It's why people cannot do anything other than the most selfish thing because they are fundamentally unable to engage with each other in anything other than the the marketized relationships that have been enforced upon us by technology and time and capital accumulation.

No you can't go come up down too hard on the romantics they were that was a necessary response and like they provided necessary friction. I mean it wasn't all great obviously but you you can't blame it. It is a humane response to dehumanization. It can yes it turns into things like fascism and and nationalism. it has to that that heat has to go somewhere because capitalism is in control But no that the tragedy of our age is that it is a romantic. There is no romance. There is no sense that you can affect anything but there is no belief in anything but the south and its most narrow construction as a as an agent of economic. inputs yummies and yuckies that is what we have become and now we're trying to make sense of a world where we are supposed to fulfill these social roles that had historically encoded with them a rituals of a firm affirmation of belief in a system affirmation of belief in something beyond the self.

That's something that was worth worth um honoring that goes away because if you're not building anything that matters if you're not actually responsible for anything that's another big part of this. This is highly underrated is it one of the reasons that the system does such horrible. Things to people is not the the other side of the equation of these decisions being made by the algorithm. What that means is that the people associated with the decisions who have to execute them as a moral question have to make the choice they are making a choice to execute and even if they and yes you could say. But they could resign somebody else will do it yes but everybody has to make a moral choice and the fact that there's somebody else who will do it means we can avoid responsibility for doing it and I will implicate myself entirely. In this. This is it this is not nobody gets to choose out of this. This is like the dunning-kruger effect. This is universally applicable if I don't participate in this machinery of death.

Someone else will therefore my involvement in this system is superfluous and that means I don't have any responsibility for what the system does so. That means that I can benefit from an unjust arrangement without ever feeling like and I'm an exploiter because the system will go on and we all know the system will go on regardless of what happens to me and that feeling is associated traditionally with like higher high being high in the hierarchy where you feel like you actually can control something the idea that if I didn't do this it wouldn't happen you need to have that sense that something else can happen to make it a real world question for yourself like because we're all going to be a verse from self-sacrifice. If we don't have connections other which we don't we have had them stripped off of us. We can only believe in ourselves and our pleasure so that we participate in these systems and we get sorted really demographically and by chance into slots in this machinery and then we are asked to make choices and the fact that the choices aren't real allows us more indulgence to do the wrong thing and now we have a system where the logic of capitalism the algorithm of capitalism drives everyone to doing. The wrong thing drives everyone to universal immorality because responsibility has been taken from them because responsibility has been taken from them and that is not anyone's fault to feel that it's real. It really will keep going if you don't stop because remember the dream of a general striker. A mass uprising is a coordinated one and we can't visualize those we cannot live in a world where those are things are possible. We live in an era that has killed those possibilities the same way the 19th century people killed god. We killed the capacity of there to be an overwhelming spiritual overlordship of the individual self. no then there was the hope that there was a species consciousness which is god in another name that could envelop the self and integrate it and nope. The answer is no that's how well.

That's what we come to understand the world to be when we observe it so we cannot imagine acting in Universally we can only act independently and so our independent refusal to do something will by definition not change it so why don't we just get the benefit rather than somebody who's a jerk. I mean virtue mongering on the liberal on liberalism. Liberal virtue mongering boils down to the fact that these people are accepting hierarchy accepting perpetuating hierarchy and have rationalized to themselves that they deserve it more than others. Morally that's that's because these people are the that's the lingering sense of internet. connection to other people that that that exists in the residue of the death of of the search for a species consciousness that's more that's just our guilt our sense of guilt our not any sense of love connection our sense of guilt which is mediated by that big other that dominates us and it was god and it was then the possibility of a class-based humane revolution a a synthesizing of capital to the needs of all that feeling that was associated with that is gone and what was left is liberal guilt the conscience. The the the self projected outward the other that must exist to observe us and to make our individual identity. coherent it was god. It was the the race maybe this the human race. No now.

It is just the self because of the domination of capitalism and it's dehumanizing effects literally dehumanizing effects and so we're all trying to live in this world. How do we make choices that we can really strip to their essentials because we're all going to make compromises everybody reading this everybody listening this. we're reading this everybody listening or watching this including myself everybody participating in politics at this level is of course participating in capitalism in a way but to greater and less degrees of individual importance which means greater or less degrees of leverage that could be utilized if it was expressed outward in solidarity and not individually but that requires staying in the system enough to you can't. If you can't quit a job because because of the company that you work for and keep the connections to the other workers you have to make an end you need jobs to live. We need to work to live in this system at least for now we'll see if they fulfill the ubi where we can just be pure consumers which honestly might be what ends up happening to those of us on one side of the of when the when the final walls go up. When the when the laser motes and the drone perimeters go up if you're on the good side. If you're on the lucky side of that. You'll probably see a ubi where where act where livelihood is at a certain degree detached from labor so that everybody can consume even though our labor is totally because of in the interior because at the end of hyperexploitation at the at the inside technology our labor is superfluous to the system. Now we can just be the consumers because our consumption is what drives it our consumption is what keeps the wheel moving so as long as so it's a perpetual motion machine of dis of greed of individual desire collated by the price signal.

There was an actual article by some demonic christians about how the price signal is proof of god's design. This perfect system for distributing understanding of this. This is their idea of the human mind a demonic selfish. um self-consciousness devoted entirely to self-pleasure. The the vision of all seven deadly sins cohered into a will that's their idea of god's will the price signal. They're literal demon worshipers but for now you got to have a job and then what about what job is it going to be what obligations do you have to other people. All these negotiations you make about what to do inform every decision that you make even though you take many of them for granted as I do as we all do and so our challenge in life really and in this thing is to strip moments to the to the bear and then evaluate what work where our chain of interests really lie and the thing is we can't do that logically you need to be honing in on other people honing in on other frequencies to collaborate your instincts because you're when making decisions you are battling your own body sensations which are independent of what you think is happening and that is where you get feelings because feelings are the undigested and unrationalized first like pass of stimuli from the outside. That is what you do to make up the world but it is not. At some point. There is an inflection of self-consciousness that arises and that creates a barrier because an inflection point cannot be by definition at some point symbolized symbolized and then symbols. Come later and symbols therefore come not connected and that is why our feelings are.

This undigested thing that we try to give words to and our whole like the human search for meaning is echo locating our our symbols and our and our our hearts and minds are symbols and the feelings are generate our symbols into one another and then harmonizing them and creating symbols that that transcend rationality and they convey truth that convey truth of human connection of of the systemic nature of the universe of our integration. Our fundamental integration into a a cosmic fabric that means that our notions of like self-interest that we think we carry with us from our genes are illusory or illusory. It is a fundamental misapprehension of the universe that is caused by that gap in perception from a feeling to the ability to express feeling which makes up civilization that we then live in that builds. This black iron demiurgical cage that we are trapped in and then we can only echolocate against one another and we are all therefore obligated in every moment to be present enough in our decision in our bodies. In this in the time of crisis that we are harmonizing our feelings to the words. We're using to express what we really want to do because we're always as rational beings at the end of history.

We're always rational consumers. We're always looking for our best interest defined delusionally as some sort of individual interest. A pursuit of pleasure that is by definition illusory a pleasure that is never attained. This is the important thing. The the rational pursuit of pleasure is irrational because pleasure can only ever be pursued. This is basic buddhism lacan talks about it in in continental philosophical terms. It's to my mind. It is undeniable. Never seen anybody argue that this is incorrect desire cannot be fulfilled so a society based on desire of the individual will never run up against any natural boundary we'll dissolve it. In the pursuit of this thing unless our desires are tethered if the thing we desire could be can be pursued because we're going to desire things. If the thing we desire could be pursued. Say it's a communion with all like actual communion a sensed communion with the with all the a sharing of the hive mind. Now we can't have that in life you can have moments of it but they are forgotten as soon as they occur because they cannot be symbolized. But and that is why we are always struggling to understand our own feelings and our own. Relationship to the to the divine and ourselves is because we don't know where these things come from. We're just guessing but that can be pursued beneficially because all that energy that drive towards the desire that is motivating you why it can go towards building something it can go towards building.

A thing that involves the thriving of other people whose condition you care about as much as you care about your own condition that can drop that that that is everybody moving in the same direction in a way that does not require a state. This is what marx talks about when he talks about the withering away of the state. The state is there to enforce transactions and interactions. Marx's conception is that if you get a situation of post scarcity remember this is post scarcity. This is we have accumulated enough capital to work technologically our will on the world with minimal human labor input which we have absolutely reached by now the industrial revolution and then the technological revolution that came after the the The silicon va information revolution that came after it have given us the tools to do this and they've given us the cultural tools to to comprehend a notion of like collective identity. If we all believed in each other the way we believe in ourselves in a social context where we're born into no real danger of precarity never really feeling threat from outside never having those spiky adrenaline fight-or-flight relationships established at a young age. We never get that because for them I mean of course we don't get none of it but it isn't. It is absorbed into an otherwise calm universe of humanity which is allowed because technology is doing all the really bad work and the remaining alienating work.

The remaining unfun stuff is shared or if there is some sort of division in time it is paid for in time like you got to do. There's shitty work to do somebody does it one four hour. It's like a volunteer shift because enough people because there's enough technological carrying out of the system what is left. There's way more people than there are jobs. There's way more people than there are jobs so you rotate people through the jobs at low levels of commitment well. Most of the rest of the work is done technologically if you get to that point the coercions of the state will be unnecessary. You will have returned to civilization the pre-historic um police force of mutual consent you will have you didn't have. There was no cops no formal police force no formal state in a hunter-gatherer band because if you didn't do what was good for the group you were censored culturally one way or another away from that action over the course of your life. Because people were paying attention you're bouncing up against other people.

You aren't just flying frictionlessly through a plane of consumer capitalism where all this technology is destroying the world around you and hyper exploiting people all around you without you being able to invest yourself at all and in that context all the mechanisms of state coercion become superfluous. The state withers away and as marx said you the final state is a formula a social formula instead of being towards capitalism towards profit from each according to his ability to each according to his needs meaning what people need they get and the thing is you can't the reason. People don't get that when they're trying to conceive outside of marxism why it so seems counterintuitive and wrong to like libertarians who say well that means that all the lazy people just sit around well. All the people who have ability the smart people like me will do all the work no because they're imagining individuals living in an isolated capitalist social order instead of people living in a communal social order. There will everything you need will be provided because the need can be socially filled. The need and the capitalism can never be filled and so you have to have a hierarchy. There has to be a if. I'm smart. I have to there's got to be something in it for me to participate in society to give you my labor to give you my smarts.

I have to know that I'm going to get something and sure it starts as stability. But then it becomes I want a boat. I want two boats. I want two houses and look at these other rich people who are getting even more. I want more of what they have and that cannot be extinguished. That fire was once it has to be transformed and so that fundamental fact of of the of the innate suffering that comes with life. The unquenchableness of human desire as the engine of human action shows that that action is either being channeled towards humane ends. Because it is it is it is a definition of self. It is a definition of desire that is socially defined or is it a definition of desire that is can only imagine personal pleasure either in the direct sensual form one way or another or the pleasure of relative ease and comfort compared to others. The the the bene the sensation of cl of hierarchical elevation over others the fundamental idea that I am higher than other people because if I'm seeking life to be only pursuit of individual pleasure then I have to define myself individually and that means I have to hierarchize myself and I have to ask myself do. I deserve this power do. I deserve this position so I can feel safe in it. That's also a sensational pleasure.

Liberal masochism is a sensational pleasure of capitalism and all of us are operating out of one or another of those to the degree that we are captured spiritually by these ideas. How have we translated our feelings in our lives and so the challenge that we all have to face is how do we change fundamentally. How do we fuse our notion of desire our libidinal energies to a felt emotional connection to others that transcends the barrier of the liberal subject. That is that that's the engine of of meaningful revolutionary action and I have to say many people either don't get to this point because they're stuck in liberal pieties and ideological blind spots or even if they think of themselves. As like rigorously marxist. They get to this point and then they lose heart. They say you know what I can understand the logic here. But this is this doesn't feel like the world.

I live in or can live in. I would argue there is a counter example of this and of course. It's not perfect. It's not fantasy. What it is is. It shows that the market is not the ultimate solvent in all contexts with humans. Now that there are humans now who can coordinate actions and of course you could say it happens everywhere and every day yes and our lives are peppered with humane action generated by a felt connection. Others it's just. It's we don't feel it enough. It's too. It's not. There are places that you that show that given a social context that encourages it.

You can create this and I would say the example now is yes cuba. The fact that cuba survived the fall of the soviet union to me. Proves proves that between 1959 and 1989 cuban communists did something built a system that then was turned into a mass political organization put into place structures of power and democratic control of economic forces and distribution of labor and alienation through the system in such a way that when the time came when the crack of doom came and the and the f and the subsidy from the soviets dried up under the most immense pressure imaginable pressure that broke regimes that were much more economically viable and much less close to the united states and its wrath and much less attacked by capitalism and isolated from capitalism it didn't fall and the thing is we would have if they had done it through violence if they had cracked down on like this collective revolt of a desire for freedom that you saw in. Like the eastern bloc it would have been a bloodbath. It would have been tiananmen square on a countrywide scale and the same way that neoliberalism was installed in china at the point of at the barrel of a gun in a country that thought it that by that point was trying to build socialist relationships. Meanwhile in cuba they kept communism without massacring. Everybody did they use violence did they use state authority. Of course. They put people in prison. The the most the most the most alienated people left went to the united states. They have a high prison rate in cuba relatively high and not just political prisoners. Just they have like. They have a lot of common criminals who they put in prison because it's a very poor country but there is a degree of social of day-to-day social. Enchantment day-to-day social um consent absent the machinery of the state that keeps people working together and it's under attack and it might be destroyed. We've been trying to destroy it for 60 years.

But if conditions this is what I mean when I say this is possible if you would if if conditions in cuba got better in the sense that they got like brought into supply chains but not in the capitalist supply chains. They were brought into a socialist supply chain the way that the russians thought they were going to get hooked up by the germans after their revolution that never happened if china if china if cuba got hooked up to a conveyor belt of like economic development from outside that system that was not predicated on neoliberalism that they would turn into the closest thing to like a scandinavian fantasy social democracy without the inherent racism that is born of being in the colonial center. Like general multicultural the real synthesis. The thing marx said would happen the thing that now feels like a fantasy it is in my mind. The germ of it is in cuba and for my ma and to me anybody who says I'm wrong on this explain how communism didn't fall after the father soviet union when you see what happened in every other lifeblood and did build it like a genuine esprit de corps out of the nationalist fight went neoliberal. They made the choice to to to to give up the long-term the idea of of of a people being motivated by something beyond selfishness and the thing that and I and I and maybe the reason for that is because the united states didn't strangle them so much like you could obviously you could honestly argue that the fact that the united states embargoed. Cuba is what saved the revolution. It was the embargo because it's literally they're getting to an asphyxiation point and you know the thing about vietnam is you can say well. They weren't as embargoed as as cuba was which means that they they were more engaged in the market anyway even before they went neoliberal and therefore they had established relationships and then like a way as a short-term mechanism of of especially and the other thing is when you're when you're vietnam.

If china neo-liberalizes you basically have to because china and vietnam historic enemies it was so hilarious how the domino theory which presented presided over american The cold war policy in asia goes into is what dom says that it's supposed to lead to the communisation of entire asia. Meanwhile a year two years after the vietnamese the north vietnamese take south vietnam. They invade cuba they invade cambodia and then china invades vietnam and so no matter what you want to do with vietnam. If china's is going to liberalize you have to liberalize because you are still in a conflict because those both of those communist movements were based in a nationalist movement and the nationalism in my opinion sort of transcends the communism over time as as as the system of asphyxiates under the capitalist global system that slowly strangled communism everywhere and it was the re-emergence of a potential conflict a competition with china if china was gonna. Develop faster and everyone knew by this point knew that capitalism whatever else it will do will help you develop faster because it will alienate all of the violence of the system into the market and therefore give create a system where people are consenting to their own destruction because they have abrogated responsibility so the world system cranks everything up and it pops off and there was no resistance. The vietnamese acceded to it because there was no more belief there was no more real belief or not enough not more or less.

It's never it's never binary. It's always gradations there's always fellow feeling. There's always a transcendent understanding of the self in every government in every system in every social relationship but it is to greater or less degrees felt it to greater or less degrees is symbolized in the mind and given as a name to the feelings we have and maybe the fact that cuba didn't have that he didn't have that cuba was a nationalist project or I guess you could say that the nationalist the nationalist stage of the cuban in the initial bourgeois cuban revolution which was the rebellion against spain had extinguished itself had exhausted its capacity to enchant over the course of the machado and batista dictatorships. Meanwhile the communist movements that took power in vietnam and in china were part of a overall nationalist struggle. The nationalist phase had already been extinguished in cuba. The people who had dominated cubans on the island had been cuban for the entire 20th century by 1950. By the 1950s the idea that there was some nation that they could serve that they should be serving. It didn't have any kind of emotional weight by that point. Meanwhile service to the nation was a fundamental driver of both chinese communism and vietnamese communism and post-colonial communism all throughout the third world and that meant that decision making becomes enmeshed with a national concern and so when the time comes to make those decisions what do we do about the market.

What do we do about the western wolf banging on our door. They they choose to to unleash the virus to unleash the pathogen that's going to dissolve the social fabric that has undergirded their entire project communist nationalist. It's all going to fall before international capitals dissolving grey goo. singularity scythe stripping human agency out of human relationships replacing them with the machinery of an algorithm of profit extraction based on desire. What's wrong with the audio god damn it man these sorry. It's whatever my favorite thing people say on the internet. It's whatever it's united my. It's my united states of whatever is what it is. It was my united states of whatever still sounds like a robot well.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I hope. I hope you can hear it because I feel like. I'm making some strong points so if you want to ask yourself like well. Why do I why do. I commit to this why do. I commit to this belief. This new belief that there is a there is a frequency that there is a homing there's a homing device in all of us pulling us together that we can hear if we turn it up. I'll know because the world is organized to dim that it is organized to make us only hear the most the most selfish and self-destructive. siren desire the carnality and I don't just like. I said. I don't just mean lust. I mean all selfish desire to that is not connected to like a greater good and that is also going to always be there like. I said that's not going anywhere. I mean we're not going to all be booties bodhisattvas. If we were we could all just close hands close our eyes and we would literally transcend.

We would cr. We would wink out the universe in a moment if we could do that we ought. We aren't though we're regular people. We're still driven by desire but what desire for what desire for what that is why we must all put ourselves in positions to act meaningfully from a awareness of that homing sql. Signal because if we do that at key enough points in our lives and key enough decisions we can start driving the truck because we can start cooperating cooperating which is what the only thing that defines anything meaningful nobody has politics. Nobody is a political actor to the degree unless they're acting. This is not acting. This is this is also contributing to our selfish indulgence but if you can imagine our degree of technological sophistication and a social order that at key points is dominated by people acting from a felt spiritual connection to the species as a whole you could move things in a direction that yes you would still have oppression you would still have violence. You would still have conflict as as the various forms of domination that have been inscribed by the malforming. Effects of capitalism are resist but you will have a movement in a direction away from catastrophe but what would make that happen.

It's not those people changing their opinions. It's not everybody having a thing and then acting at once. It's people every day coming together to move the thing to believing in the thing enough to move it and the reason to talk about something like. Cuba is just to give another form to our rational symbolic understanding that we need to have to keep thinking this way. Because this is all about convincing yourself. This is all about hypnotizing yourself. It is about putting on the daily glasses and I gotta say if cuba does go the way of vietnam if somebody smarter than biden does decide that the way to smother the revolution is to just turn on the charm and turn on the money hoses they might. I think over time they would win if there's no other um resistance outside the system you know or if the system doesn't collapse without without some other. I need somebody else for cuba to stand up and resist this thing it would be but look at how long it took look at how long it would have took compared to everybody else.

I think I've understood fundamentally a just deeply important um like fundamental cuny and incommensurability between two intellectual factions of the left. I mean. I don't think the left exists but there are people who engage in leftist intellectual discourse. It's all online it's all monetized. It's all parasocial. It's it's very gross but it really is our cafe seen in like revolutionary france that's sad. But it's true times change things. Technology changes things more than anything and there are people who all use the same words that mean different things by them like marxist or socialist or left fascists. All these things people are arguing over definitions because they genuinely don't think the thing means the same thing but they cannot convey the difference in words. It's it's a deeper connection that transcends the logic of their position and I would say that a lot of friction within the left online is predicated on to one big fault line in the united states. Let me say the u.s lab people trying to understand how to do leftism. In america.

There are those who think that the constitution of the united states represents a transcendent value system generated by the people who made the country a transcendent positive schematic for human relations or you think. It was the product of emergent finding a political sanctification for the rule in the context of common land ownership rather than feudal land ownership of free real estate rather than feudal feudal divisions where that where where the peasants could not get the land because land was power so you can't give the peasants land because that that what are you there for here land is distributed relatively freely to any white settler. So power concentrated differently and they created a system to concentrate to give democratic consent to aristocratic rule to tell the hordes have them walk around all day thinking that they were participating in these decisions that they were making decisions. They get to go through the system and think that they're doing their best interest when in fact they're inscribing the power of an immersion capitals class. They don't notice at first because they're getting the free real estate they're getting to be their own boss. They're getting to be their own little baron and so they accede to it and over time that the form of that deal changes once the land runs out it becomes what you can do in the stock market.

You can get a small business and you can get a home after world war ii. It's you can get a home you're you're a life. You're at someone else's will. But hey you got a house. That means you have some degree of investment in the system and an independent of power. Even though you're fun you've been cut off from the land.

You didn't notice though you didn't notice. She got cut off from the land and I do think that that might seem like a pedantic point. But I really think that if you see a lot of the arguments between people who seem like they should be on the right the same side and are arguing about a lot of the times about definitions of things. Because remember this is all abstract nobody's speaking from experience. This is all hypothetical. This is all as a hot dog a sandwich because nobody has the direct experience of anything is that the difference ways that people see different issues boils down to do. They think that the constitution represents anything other than class rule. Now there are other divisions that fraction off within those divisions but I think that is one of the most fundamental and I honestly think a lot of people call themselves marxists. If they got to put to them black clearly would be like oh yeah. You know what I do and it's like. I'm sorry. I don't say well the thing is. I don't get you're not a marxist. I don't care about that. I don't think it's true my now my the way I understand history built on a bunch of different intellectual foundations. One of them. I think marxism tells me that that's not how it works so. I don't care if it's if it's socialism or not.

I don't care if it's populism or progressivism or whatever the america and I'm going to piss on the flag. All the time no because most people do think the constitution. By bribing them is that bribe that mean that is the residue now and people who say yeah the system's. Rich people are in charge of it and it's all the class. We need class working-class people to come together but along the constitutional grounds they have missed it and you don't get at them though from saying you're wrong. That is where I s that's why I say so. Much of online disputation is harmful people trying to make these points through debate. All you're doing is solidifying sides because you're not arguing about the real distinction and even if you came at it like that you're not going to argue them out of their belief that the constitution is meaningful because it's deeper than a argument it's deeper than rationality.

It's deeper than reason because america has a national that had a nationalist movement that had a meaningful impact. Yes. Marx did support the american revolution as a fundamental development of capitalism correct. But it was that's what that but what that means in practice is that it makes a bourgeois government which is bourgeois. Class rule. Unlike in europe is able to gain a greater degree of public ascetency to that among the important classes the white people close to positions of power. The white people on the hands whose hands were on the machinery building the country able to buy them off enough to solidify it and generations of people prospered. First is yeoman that is pioneers all of this at the expense of black labor and and indian land. Obviously that's that's the whole thing of capitalism. It puts all the externalities off the balance sheet and one of the ways it does. That is by having these people within the bubble who think the thing works away that it doesn't who have seen in their own lives.

The system work because it's designed to work for them. Of course. They think it works and so then when things start breaking down as they are worse and worse because the system is breaking down the ability to give those treats. The ability to make people think the system is working is wearing away and people are asking what's the deal and then you get responses and if you start from the premise of well the constitution's good. Therefore these guys are against the constitution who is for the constitution republicans are for the constitution. These are deeply welded things they might get disillusioned from the republican party but that's deeper than the republican party in their estimation republican party. They support it as a vessel for their deeper national fusion of the notion of their best interests. The constitutional order. The patriotic regime of the united states the identity of an american but once again this doesn't mean you can just argue people out of thinking. The constitution is good or saying. I don't like the constitution or the first amendment. Because this is deeper than those arguments you can't argue them out of that.

What has to happen is struggle at the level of labor that self-interest where at the root of my life this thing isn't paying off for me because it is in the root of the experience that you that other people who have a different understanding can say hey. I am in the same six experience look at my experience look at where I have put my finger of play and then watch if enough people come together. Under this is how misery and so all we can do as consumers and producers of political media is treat it as the entertainment it is and only take from it a greater will and desire to apply meaningful action in our lives day to day. I would love to join a union but that would be a artisan. I don't know and I'm sorry any union. I would join would be like what podcasters.

I don't know if somebody wants to start one whatever and the thing about this like fundamental. What I like anyway about this like take away from all. This stuff is as an action call is that it does the least amount of harm if you're wrong because if you do this what happens and and oh no I should have been online. One. You'll never know you'll never know if you were wrong. It's only in your head and two you're going to find yourself waiting for moments to act and being driven by a desire to help that is going to be hard to overwhelm because this is the important part you have withdrawn your libido. From this spectacle you have stopped imagining yourself to be an actor within a political struggle. You have castrated yourself before you've gone online. You put your dick in balls or your vagina in a jar and you went online to entertain yourself the same way and you did not tell yourself that you were being a that you're being a political actor but if you say. I'm gonna participate in all this stuff. I'm gonna. I'm gonna I'm gonna make these I'm gonna have these arguments all day and I'm gonna fixate. On these things. These hot dog sandwich arguments if you're wrong about that if you're right about that you'll never know because everything's just gonna keep getting worse probably and if there is anybody who fights against it. You're not going to be there because you're going to have convinced yourself that anything that actually happens isn't good enough because you'll be too scared of being wrong to invest in anything because in the process of engaging in this battle of ideas you will have invested yourself in these hierarchies sufficiently to fear more than anything falling. You will have the precarious paralysis of the fascist working class or fascist middle class in crisis so every actual eruption of meaningful action will be You will scoff at it critique. It maybe support it but only from afar because you don't want to be wrong. mad projection. I'm describing myself what are you talking about. I'm not projection when I say I guess when I say you. I just should assume.

I mean me because I'm still doing this. I'm not in any way politically acting and the thing is. I feel that I feel that I'm not politically active and so that sensation and my association of that feeling with that thought it changes the way I interact with the world changes my It changes my decision matrix but here's the other thing is that if I did do stuff outside of it. I'd still do this because I do this for reasons other than a sense of I'm doing things. Politically. This is for me something that has its own reward but participating in this. Like at the level of of content consumption of of consuming the arguments the arguments that make up the news cycle that is that is eating cheetos for dinner and you gotta you just have to feel like it and if you if you hook up your dick to this thing. If you hook your genitals up to this thing it won't feel like it it'll feel like a delicious nutritious meal. A balanced breakfast until your teeth fall out and the question of what to do is predicated by your skills. your interests and your position your fixed position in space-time. What is what your social conditions are and of course your entire suite of illusory individuating personality traits and traumas both conscious and unconscious and desires. I I you think you fuse you fuse the you bring together.

The two halves of your mind. Because there is the body-mind duality is is perc. It is a perceived thing but it is a perceived separation that hides the fact that it's it's one being. The mind and body are the same thing mind is the body and vice versa but there is this line between the two that is my opinion generated by the literal distance between the exterior of the body and the central sensational trans processing area and that like the transcended state we seek what we imagine the mystics imagine. What we hope happens after you die and what is just what is always there but is not perceived is of that being one thing and then that one thing being connected to the other thing of the dividing there that is defined by the physical distance. It takes for sensation to be felt and that is consciousness that is assigning symbols to feelings without a direct line to where those feelings came from and we move through life trying to negotiate that barrier time try trying to tear the veil of maya and you can do it. You can feel that but it requires conditions of will and and concentration and and emotional palate and self-restraint that are only possible in certain conditions and we the strive. I think is the stripe to create the conditions where those feelings can be experienced.

The most frequent and we're traversing that barrier and trying to will our way to action with incomplete information is what it is because at the end of the day we're guessing at the end of the day we're leaping into a void every single decision. Every single decision on what is around us is a leap into the void because we don't really know what we're experiencing and our consciousness is shrinking its perception even further in order to make it easier to sort. Everything like we're less perceivers than win over is down of information. As it gives a body. We can perceive vastly more than our brains taken consciously to make up our world hear more smell more. But it would be too much. We have to differentiate and those differentiations are made arbitrarily in the mind and the thing is we know that we have to paper. Over that awareness we have to leave beyond our ability to describe what is going on which is what our symbolic. After current of accumulated consciousness is it's not it is. It is arbitrary to our consciousness. There are reasons for every decision. Every decision at every point has a reason for it. But we aren't aware of them. We can't pin them down and if we can't pin them down we cannot follow to a a We cannot get a feedback loop that is perfect. There is a signal. There is a noise that accumulates in the signal over the over the gap. Yes of course. It's part of the physical state.

These things these decisions are being made by the body not by the mind. The body and mind there is no distinction like you're thinking mind. You're thinking this thing there is something below that that is still mind. It's just separated by distance from the gathering point. They're saying it's not arbitrary. See. This is this this is the difficulty of talking about this stuff because in the sense that there is a cause and effect going all the way through yes. Obviously. It's not arbitrary but to the point that their mind must make a choice from within a veil of ignorance is also true so that means it is arbitrary. People are arguing about a damn robot in the chat what you all y'all.

I ain't scared of you. I don't care that I cease making sense. I realize. I'm getting to the point where I can't just explain myself anymore because I see it my head. I don't necessarily have the words. It's very frustrating all right bye.
