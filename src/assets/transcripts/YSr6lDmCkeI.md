Too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks. It takes a lot to make a stew. I love you extra nice wake up open something too many cooks. Too many cooks. Too many cooks too many cooks. There we go there we go all right god jesus.

I really am a why does anybody pay attention to me look at me. I am an I am a poorly groomed madman. What is going on here man that's the downside of cutting your own hair is that once it starts growing out the deficiencies and failures become pretty Obvious. I gotta cut my hair again. Ah I gotta get my hair again. Definitely gotta cut my beard again. I will lose 10 pounds as soon as I just snip this.

Thing many cooks too many cooks anybody excited for croods too. I know I am. I know we were all asking where's more croods. We were all sitting here waiting for croods waiting with cupped hands for the beneficence of the croods to be to be lauded upon us and we sat through a horrible election in 2016 and and it's four years of fascist tyranny and and a horrible pandemic and the whole time. We had no mother. Croods now here though at the tail end of our pandemic which thanks to the election of joe biden and the release of these 95 effective no problems to worry about everything's going to be fine vaccines. What do we get we get the croods to bomb the soul of a nation. I mean what's not to love about all of our large political and economic and cultural institutions that yes they might lead you in the lurch for a while and have a crazed cheeto-stained dictator ruling by tweet and then his incompetence unleashing a biblical plague upon the land. But at least those systems can correct themselves and say we're very sorry. We allowed that to happen goodbye trump goodbye coronavirus hello croods 2 croods 2. You know what the croods are called.

You know what the names of the characters and the croods are. Emma. Stone is the daughter of the crude clan and is sort of the main character that's eep nicholas cage character who's her father. The patriarch of the croods is grug and there's and his wife is katherine. Keener's character named ugga and then there's. I believe eep's younger brother thunk played by clark duke and then you've got eep's boyfriend. The more evolved more worldly more globalist cave person who's tried to lure the croods out of their cave and into some valley. I.e breaking up traditional society and turning it into globalized capitalism. His name is literally guy. The rest of them all have just noise names and then the worldly metrosexual who comes to take the young girl away from it. All is named guy. It's amazing propaganda on full display anyway.

I'm very excited about the croods. I'm very excited. I mean we were all waiting for more crudes weren't we. That's the crazy thing to me about the way that they keep making sequels to every cartoon franchise because it does seem to me that cartoon movies kids. Movies are the only films where you can have where a studio will put money on an original piece of intellectual property in the form of big big tentpole stuff. But even you know like the croods isn't that old the crews came out. In 2015. There were two different movies about bigfoots and sasquatch and yeti's that came out like last year boss baby. Like they actually the kids are because there's always new ones and they're all very small and they don't really remember things because like the kids who you know liked frozen by now. They're too old for those movies anyway. You're pitching it to their younger siblings or or who who don't have necessarily haven't seen frozen so you can give them something new and yet we still keep creating these sequels. When the audience is always changing. It's astounding zedaya is michi. It's true so when the croods came out. I remember just having that word just clanging around my head a non-stop. I wrote. I look back actually. It was reminded today by the croods and I look back and I saw how many tweets. I had done about the croods back in 2015 when I had no followers and no one gave a who I was including myself and it was all of them are terrible. I do not recommend looking at them but they definitely showed that like the the croods as a concept stuck with me and then having a sequel come out. Now at this moment of time. Like hey you know what else more croods the croods you love are back. The rude crew dudes with the crude attitudes are back just a little too much. I am now definitely crude pilled that's for sure it definitely shows how nothing how how like the the logic of the cultural logic of late-stage capitalism using obnoxious term does mean like a event horizon of creativity where nothing new can be built and we just get more crudes oh man.

A movie about operation midnight climax that whole operation they had in san francisco is pretty amazing and you could imagine would be an amazing movie but yeah I would like to see it that's for sure there's a couple things. I've thought about trying to well. I mean. I don't know probably not me but movies. I've wished would get made by somebody Mk alternate in general but specifically midnight climax really interesting if anyone doesn't know what that is that was part of the overall mk ultra program of mind control and interrogation research with drugs that included lsd dosings. A lot of it was in the form of grants and this is the important thing about you know the the the nature of institutions and capitalism is that most of that lsd was distributed not by you know cia agents dousing water tanks or whatever but by grants to universities and prisons oh and hospitals mcgill university and ca. Had a Their medical center had a huge grant from the mk ultra There harvard did and it was at harvard that young ted kaczynski was unwittingly dosed with tons of lsd and where a nearby prison a young whitey bulger was dosed with tons of lsd and I believe I'm not sure of that this is true. I mean one of the of course the haight ashbury free clinic in san francisco where charles. Manson visited on a daily basis with his parole pro probation officer.

I believe the hospital that sirhan saran went to to deal with his riding injury because he had a concussion when he fell off a horse because he was a jockey. Was treated at a hospital that got mkl. Trip funding. I'm not sure if that's true though. I remember reading that a long time ago and I was more into assassination. But the most outlandish way they did. It was they had a bunch of former and current federal narcotics agents who are either cia operatives or contract officers in san francisco. Pay local sex workers to dose their customers and it was often filmed at cia front bordellos through two-way mirrors or one-way mirror or whatever the hell. They call them and that's kind of nuts when you think about it that the us government did that the us governor has like eight millimeter film of like some mirror because he just got a ton of acid put in his cocktail or like some Some marin county square in for a fun weekend goes jumping out the window and sock garters kind of wild that that happened so yeah that would be a good. I would love to see someone tackle that subject it's very ripe for inquiry but another one. I've thought very fascinating is the mothman phenomenon in 1966 and 67 in point pleasant west virginia.

Now there is a movie called the mothman prophecies that deals vaguely with that story but it's a deeply terrible film and a horrifying waste of one of the most interesting para phenomenal para phenomenal events in american history because the mothman prophecy was not simply a case where a bunch of people in the appalachian boundary between ohio and west virginia in the mid-60s saw a flying thing that looked like a moth. Although a lot of them did and people described being pursued by a giant flying creature with big bright lamp eyes down highways but also a ton of a ton of ufo sightings that went to and included close encounters of the fourth kind see will be or is that fifth. I don't know but people described being brought onto ships and like conversing with aliens who had names like indrid cold and and part of it. One of the prophecies was A rook was um and was phone calls made in a very odd ethereal sort of robotic voice to local reporters and and citizens that spoke of a coming catastrophe in the area and then I believe in the winter of 1966 or early 1967.

A local bridge over the I believe ohio river collapsed and it killed dozens of citizens. It was a massive massive catastrophe and then it stopped shortly after that or a little. While after that nowhere was everything explained nothing's ever explained it. There was a former there was a military former military munitions plant in the area that is like what led to the initial town existing. They like made dynamite up in the hills and it was in the on the grounds of those former. Military munitions facilities that a lot of people which was like a make out point in the area that a lot of people saw the mockman and there's a lot of explanations for it. And I think the idea that it might have been a essentially operation midnight climax on a local scale is certainly one of them. What if we gave a whole town asset what would happen it. Sort of does seem to be the next logical step to what they ended up doing and there's no reason to believe they ever had to stop for any reason other than their own inertia because who knew what was happening and who would have stopped them if they could have or if they had note um.

I always thought that it would make a really interesting visual narrative either like a film or a tv show because of the multiplicity oh I forgot. It's also where one of them. It's either where the men in black were first established as a trope in the culture or one of the most concentrated places where that was the case because one of the big elements of mothman prophecies was weird looking dudes in black outfits showing up on the side of the road riding with people coming to their houses asking them about if they've talked to anybody about any encounters with aliens they've had having weird confused reactions to basic human technology and when you take that whole thing into account. It's this big prism of you know of 60s. It's like. It's a sort of like a micro nervous breakdown within like the greater social organism and what caused it you know where to come from I think any interesting narrative that dealt with it would want to not establish any one answer to that question would. It would attempt to leave to to assume ambiguity as the as as the natural state and to resist the imposition of a false explanatory model. I also the guy. John keel who wrote the big book about mothman prophecies and very well might have been a huge fraudster who was responsible for the whole thing or large chunks of it which is another explanation.

People have proposed didn't think that they were anything had to do with aliens from other planets. He essentially thought that they were mental projections of the people in the area because of the ability of the mind to interact with like the physical reality in such a way to to change it if like if through some fluke. Concentrated will is applied to a moment you know with enough vigor and you know that's it might not be true in some sci-fi sense. But it's true in this in the sense that if enough people believe in something hard enough they can remake the world in the image of whatever that thing they believe is no matter how unconnected to reality. It is there have to be enough of them and they have to believe sufficiently to and and that doesn't just mean they think it you know close their eyes and think about it. It means they live and act from that belief a tulpa yes. But I would like to see something about the mothman. Prophecies that includes all of those elements is like keel being a con artist the cia or the army doping up everybody mental projections real ufos being involved in real aliens being involved or extra dimensional beings all of it on the all of it all of it on the table and all of it interacting with each other even though they're mutually contradictory realities. I definitely do think that if there is such if ufos do carry with them an alien intelligence it is more likely to be interdimensional than extraterrestrial. But I've talked about that before croods croods someone wants to know what superstructure is.

[18:04](https://youtu.be/YSr6lDmCkeI?t=18m04s)

I think of. I mean you can get a definition from wikipedia but the way I think of it is is. The it is the flesh and muscle and skin that are around and supported by and in response support the bones of the means of production that undergird the social order itself. So capitalism would be the bones of our social order. The thing that actually moves around the thing that actually gets you from one place to another and occupies and you know moves space moves through space and touches things and manipulates. Reality and everything else is is the sinews that move it around culture broadly construed our political institutions. Our cultural institutions and the products of those cultural institutions are um our social beliefs.

Our religious beliefs. Our values most broadly stated and there is a vulgar based superstructure argument that gets pulled that kind of kind of unfairly boiled down to saying that none of that superstructure stuff like matters because it's not what's generating social conditions and that's not true it matters a great deal and all change occurs first at the superstructural level like I'll. I'll I'll change any way that is that can be funneled towards like you know human human freedom. Human humans. Reaching consciousness is what I mean when I think of that like. I don't mean freedom in the western sense. I mean like freedom from species alienation that all starts at the superstructural level and then you know within that level It's that is it then changes people's behavior and their interactions with the social the modes of productions that they are part of like people joining unions. For example you know that's generated super structurally but the question of what superstructural elements are load-bearing and which ones are epiphenomenal and have no and cannot have any impact that is a question that has to be answered it cannot be assumed. I feel like one of my goals here on this thing recently has been to try to say that that the critique that a lot of people have a lot of elements of the political structure that things that they have dismissed as sort of you know time. Wasters is more expansive than is assumed because it in reality. The stuff that can't really move the wheel includes a lot of the stuff that we is. That's all we have because of our denatured and de-socialized existences. I love being orthogonally or undergirded booed. It's great. I love it if it wasn't for orthogonal undergirding.

I would be up shit's qrik that squirrel that amber has in her. Is not her pet in the sense that he doesn't live with her. But it's she has a lot of squirrels in her yard and they are very friendly and that is the friendliest one. I guess clearly has some sort of prior relationship with humans so sometimes comes inside and says hello it's pretty cute. She really is turning into saint francis. I have seen a black squirrel. Recently. I saw a white squirrel. Both very cool. I hope to still play cold war with felix.

[23:09](https://youtu.be/YSr6lDmCkeI?t=23m09s)

At some point we have to. We've had a trouble getting that gaming rig set up so it's. It's made things harder and of course. Cobit has also restricted our ability to get together in the office. Anyway so hopefully after we're all microchipped. We can do it do that I gotta say man this vaccine. I don't think it's the great reset and I don't think there's jeffrey epstein's jizz in them but is there any reason to think that this process of creating these vaccines would meet any standard of of that I that you would feel comfortable with.

I mean the main thing that makes me think that is that I've talked before about how the real problem from the standpoint of the this government you know from capital broadly like the ruling class with kovid is there's no ability will whatever you want to call it to suspend the economic circulation that we currently have involving our consumer-based retail um economy. Is that that it's well they're not gonna suspend it and in the absence of suspending it with with cobit out there and with people afraid of cobid. They're just no matter what they do with opening and closing places. It's going to make it that much much people are much less likely to go out and spend and and circulate the capital the way they're supposed to the way the system requires them to now what the trump administration was going for was herd immunity. They were saying get everybody infected and hurry it up and we'll just act like it isn't happening and the thing is is that that might have actually worked in the sense that we could have kept people out and about kept things. Open kept kept the the big collapse of the economy from happening Now a lot of people get sick and a lot of people would die but we could accommodate that if we focused our covet response on that maybe we could do it. The problem is people aren't ready to take that risk they have to be managed into it. They have to be got to get to the point where they're willing to take that risk as a as a way of you know recontributing to getting back out there which everyone wants to do and the big problem for trump.

The trump approach is that they were governing from within the epistemic bubble of the republican party because trump only watches fox news and even his advisors are mostly totally bumbled off in that they took they assumed that their stance it it's not real. Let's just go out and drink margaritas would could be made the default stance through essentially um a propaganda campaign. In this form of telling people. What are you a you know and the problem was is that it didn't work is that the republican base is really a minority of americans like they aren't. There aren't that many of them like you've got all the democrats who vote who don't like them and don't accept their framing and then you've got the people who don't vote the vast majority of whom are not tied into this stuff. These resentment factories the way they are and so they could never sell to people ah just go outside who cares now when I say this could work.

I don't mean it's gonna save lives. People will die. I will mean it will work in the sense that you could keep the economy open. Maybe if people just accepted covet as a risk. The republicans did that because most of them didn't believe it was real or that it was made up. Now you might say yeah. A lot of them died choking to death sure but they didn't get to say anything. After that they don't get to write an op-ed saying oh by the way kobe's real. They're admit. They were wrong anyway if we're all just like dying one by one. If we're all dying alone in america which is the only way you can die in this country then even as the bodies stack like cord wood. It's just part.

[27:35](https://youtu.be/YSr6lDmCkeI?t=27m35s)

It's just it's not as bad as it would have been if we hadn't done it this way and they but the problem is. They could not convince anybody of that they cannot. They could. Not convince anybody outside of their bubble to do that they were everyone else is like nah man. I would rather not risk permanent lung damage to get a hamburger and as a result you have this contraption that we created the worst of both approaches where you harm the economy as bad as it could be harmed without actually saving that many lives and preventing the spread. Because we were wedded to keeping the economy open and everything started from that and so we got this dog's breakfast response but even for the democrats especially now that trump's in they have every incentive also to get people back out there and how do you get them out there. If they're not going to be swayed by the republican pitch. You give them a vaccine that and that and does it does. It does it have to work up.

95 effectively. Does it have to give you any of the outcomes that it's supposed to not really. It's supposed to get people back out there and if there's a problem we'll deal with it. Then we'll build. Some mass graves we'll build some more hospitals. We'll get a big machine that makes bucking ventilators but people will be back out shopping. The emergency will be over the demand for government subsidy at the demand level will be reduced which it must.

Because these people need to shut the up about getting more checks because if the people find out that money is made up and that the fed literally just puts numbers into a goddamn machine and they can they've given trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars to the wealthy in the form of in their banks. The banking sector that is just conjured from thin air and that they could do that for the regular people of this country. It would be a existential challenge to the existing system cannot be allowed to occur so every incentive in the world and of course the the financial incentives of the drug companies. All run towards rushing this thing and fudging the numbers and maybe and then you've got an entire media which believes in science. They you don't even have to brainwash them or bribe them. They will just because of their naive enthusiasm for fixing things their secret but an unstated preference for biden over trump and the biden approach to the vaccine to trumps and their now very strong association of between being skeptical of vaccines and being a benighted reactionary even independent of the trump stuff. If you're an anti-vaxxer in educated circles it means you are a You are a neanderthal and so when this vaccine shows up they have every incentive to go along with whatever pfizer modern in the government say they have every incentive to look the other way whenever stories appear about problems with it. And I'm not saying there is a problem with the vaccine. I'm just saying. It's.

It's not a very trustable process as they say in philadelphia. I'm just glad that no normal person is gonna. Get it for months anyway. So we can we can take a look yes. I am just asking questions. I'll admit but come on someone has to with this. Like the vaccine language is so poisoned that you cannot say anything about it without becoming one of them and it's like yeah. Those people are morons but also this in with biden in office. This is going to be how they keep you in line is by contrasting what they want to do with the alternative in the form of the unreconstructed trump hordes who are waiting to take power so if everybody gets it and they're fine. I'll take it and I'll go back out to eat fuddruckers here. I come oh no. It's gone. I mean.

It's not gonna make. It doesn't have a microchip in it. That's stupid you couldn't even that technology if the technology to get a microchip in you with a vaccine exists guess what we're already microchipped. They would just put it in the drinking water. But I'm certainly not gonna say. I won't take it if if people are doing all right and there isn't every other. Every third person doesn't have permanent dream work space. I'll take it did. You just say terrified of liabilities who's liable for anything in this. Republicans are making sure that whatever meager stimulus we get is contingent upon a blanket immunity from of everybody from all of the people they killed in the public sect the private sector by making them work in unsafe conditions that's like the basic starting point of negotiations around everything else you can get enough money to prevent your child from starving to death but only if you give what wave your right to sue the person. The great reset anti-facts paranoia stuff is everything you're afraid of. It's already there they don't need to microchip. You. No one needs to be microchipped. You have a negotiated the terms. They knew they weren't. Gonna have to worry about it yeah like we don't all those so much of this terror and and especially on the right.

So much conspiracy thinking is like mid 20th century. John birch fluoride in the water of reactionary paranoia and the thing is is that the stuff those guys were worried about all happened because what they were really horrified by was capitalism's inexorable monopolizing atomizing grasp. But they couldn't see it because they had all the american dumbass ideology in their head and material interests that prevented them from seeing it. But what they were worried about besides losing hierarchy. What they were really worried about was was the the everything solid melting into air and that happened. But it wasn't the communists who did it. It was capital conspiracy theory holy. Did you did you think of that bad for business. Bro. Conspiracy theory is true crime for boys.

[35:35](https://youtu.be/YSr6lDmCkeI?t=35m35s)

Wow we have a winner. There. Somebody gets the amazon gift card of the week on that one that is correct. It serves the exact same purpose. It is a fantasy of powerlessness. It's a fantasy of of being dominated and losing control the the fantasy of a victimhood that women engage with with true crime oh she was kidnapped walking her dog. What happened next will horrify you and for the boys for whom that kind of fear is inaccessible because we're the ones who do that well who could who could dominate us who could make us supine who could render us ball gagged and thrown in the trunk of a car. The deep state or the reptoids or the bilderbergers or the international communist conspiracy or aliens but yeah in both cases. It is a like gender-coded expression of underlying a um an eroticized feeling of of loss of control that we that we that we have to eroticize in order to to live with because it is so so destabilizing and of course. The the conditions that create both of those sensations are are both generated by the same underlying dynamic of social atomization.

Blah blah you know you know the drill. The whole. This whole deal that we live in yeah like the conspiracy theory. The the true conspiracy theory that all other conspiracy theories are are just a a sort of a blind man grasping an elephant refraction of is the international capitalist conspiracy and it's not a conspiracy. But it's spoken of in language that has essentially been had its polarity reversed by the hegemonic ability of superstructural institutions like the media to define reality and to find our relationship with reality so that they don't have to hide anything. It ben bernanke went on 60 minutes during the 2008 crisis and said when the fed lends to banks. They just put numbers in the machine that doesn't mean anything. It doesn't come from anywhere. They just said that yes it is a banal take.

It's true but all things are true and this is one of them yeah. We're only able to do that because we're the reserve currency but no matter what china and russia are doing. We're going to be the reserve currency for the foreseeable future. We could try to fix the economy with a direct massive injection of cash. At the bottom of the distribution curve we could do that tomorrow helicopter dump bloop and that's what mmt says they say we could do that and the thing is yeah. We could but the reason we don't the reason we don't do.

It isn't because at the top they don't think you can they know you can. They don't want to because the interests that they embody and represent are opposed to it and therefore it's not going to happen so it's beside the point whether or not it's true. It does not change the calculus of those in power because convincing them is not the question and even if you're saying to use it to convince regular people. I'm sorry at the end of the day. This is all noise and as much as we like to think that we can meme our way and lack off our way and frame and overton window our way to something that's really us justifying our contribution to the discourse because maybe all those voices blowing together will push the sale but the sale is is not. It's not there there's holes in it yeah. Mmt is descriptively true but I don't understand if it is descriptively true all the arguments about it. They seem premised on something else some idea that it means something that it's systematically true that. It's that it's descriptively true unless unless people organize to change the calculus of power. Nothing's going to change and I don't think that you do that with those sort of appeals maybe down the line it can form like a a way to convince some nerds in the media to give you a chance once you have established a real beachhead of power and are pushing forward but once with all else in in in left spaces.

[42:28](https://youtu.be/YSr6lDmCkeI?t=42m28s)

It's putting the cart before the horse but that's because there's no horse. I wonder do you get a choice of which vaccine you get has that been determined is it by states and one of them is one shot and one of them is two right. I don't really know they're both two shots damn that feels oh boy that's not great just getting people back for a second one. This is gonna be such a pain in the ass. I wish they were like bright green like the in reanimator can we have like fun how much how much would it cost just put a little food food coloring in there just get that like the radioactive green like ecto cooler looking thing from reanimator. I think that would be pretty boss but speaking of putting cart. Before the horse. A lot of people are like oh we have the vaccine well now it's going to be. I mean okay fine. It's good. It's a great vaccine. It does the job and people want to take it. You don't even have to worry about the fact that what 35 40 of the population is going to resist taking it 

How are you going to get it to them. Do. You really have a lot of faith in this country creating a transportation infra. It's probably going to be like the in his stupid pillows or just like a subcontractor have all of his delivery. Trucks right going around and his drivers are just shooting it out of t-shirt cannons of people. I mean unless we put it in the mcburgers if we don't put in the mcnuggets and and such. I don't know how the hell it's going to work.

I would be surprised if the the the coercive mechanism that they end up using to get people to take it is with people's jobs. Not the government because the same people who would say you know mulan labe come and take it. I'm gonna barricade my family in my house and with my gun and kill you. If you try to have the government forcibly vaccinate me would probably take it if their boss told them they'd be fired if they didn't and they probably would just whine about it a little bit and then forget about it. And then you've got all these guys who think that they're fighting for liberty and think that they understand with the threat to human dignity just shrugging their shoulders and being ordered by their bosses to do something that they thought was fundamentally opposed to their their identity because it wasn't the government because these dumbasses think that there's some fundamental distinction between these coercive institutions. But the main thing about when I say like it might not be it might not even work at the way it's supposed to and it won't matter is because by the time we find out it doesn't really work are we really all going to go back inside probably just accept higher risk of dying of covid as a fact of life and have assimilated it just takes time to do it. But you're at the place that republican policyholders wanted everybody to get on in march and then everything between march and whenever that date comes is essentially just the time it took to manufacture the consent for it what undergirds the superstructure the economic base the bones there would be no whistleblowers sure there'd be whistleblowers and I bet they'd be dismissed as anti-vaxx cranks and even if they weren't. What's the big what happens. Even if the story gets out there. It's gonna be assimilated by people who just what do they do all day assimilate news and then get annoyed about it and then don't do anything about it do. I think this is kind of an interesting question do. I think that um. I lost it do.

I think that covet response is like eugenics I think this is a perfect example of how a lot of these categories get confused and and all you know the the explanatory power getting getting removed from concepts that should otherwise be useful. I would say that the covert response absolutely has a eugenic effect and that the distribution of infection and death which is disproportionately among the poor and therefore disproportionately among economically deprived or disproportionately economically deprived communities. Reduced any incentive among policymakers to actually deal with the virus and allowed them to do the most expedient thing which would have been harder to do if the demographic makeup of the victims had been different but it was not eugenic in its intent. It was spend. The least amount of money require the least amount of non-market social interaction basically and keep the wheels meaning that was the actual that was the ins and it just it just so happens though that the function of the system creates things like eugenic disease outbreaks and and a a mass concentration of a miseration that is disproportionately felt along ethnic lines by its very nature but the nature is one of profit extraction. It is not one of specific racial animus and I think that that's more than penetrate because that fact suggests certain other facts about the way to organize to devote to defeat it. Majority.

White podcasters can keep working from home absolutely. I would never complain about privileged people on earth when it comes to like actually privilege not privileged discourse when it comes to being able to deal with covet without not have to risk my life or or see. You know me have to risk the lives of family members just to complain about it. I know it's it's it's absurd and it's obscene no. I'm not. I don't. I wasn't thinking that I wasn't taking offense at that. I was just acknowledging. It's like yeah. It's up that.

I specifically get to live this way than how how hard it is for so many others to to live not that anyone should live the way. I do the way. I live should not exist. But the the the removal from from the removal from precarity and the the anxiety and misery accompanying that or physical like physical bodily compromise should be universalized. I sound disingenuous yeah. Probably. It's just. I don't know what else to say about it. You know. It's like.

I can't. I mean. I could. I could get a real job. I guess but I don't want to do it. I'm sorry and and I mean maybe. I even would do that if I felt it would help any other person on earth have anything like have their lives be any better but it wouldn't. I would not last one day as a crude and I think that's one of the reasons that I was so entranced by the croods because it's it's a world that I could never live within. It is fully alien and I just imagine those those croods. And I just think what's it like to be a crood and I feel like if I could ever really imagine myself living as a crood loving as a crude. If I could ever find myself in that mental place. Then on that day. I feel like. I would finally have achieved the ability to inhabit any consciousness and will have truly transcended the illusion of separation god. The croods came out in 2013. Jesus christ eight seven years later wild seven so all the kids who saw the croods when they were seven are now 14. They don't want to watch the croods and the kids who are seven now weren't alive when the croods came out. Now.

Maybe they watched the croods you know on video or something but they've watched 500 million other things. Why do they need to see more croods or I guess. That's it is it like you had the croods and you were a kid and now you're grown up and no that's not long enough. I guess. I don't know. I don't know how long kids watch the croods. Adults aren't watching the crude. Like it's pixar anymore and by the way I hope adults aren't watching pixar anymore. I hope we got over that phase collectively where you had to pretend that those are real challenging artistic tales for grown-ups. It's fine to watch them and have fun with them. But people wanted to turn them into more than they were. I hope that that moment has ended. I guess that's it. It's like croods 2 is for your parents like oh croods that one's not too bad. I could. I could stand the croods. Okay. We'll watch croods too in which case over time. There's only going to be sequels and we're not going to even get the occasional small foot small foot that was one of the two yeti or sasquatch themed children's films that came out in the last couple years. What's the name of the other. One anybody see that one zendaya abominable that's it zendaya is mishi. It's true the missing link. That's it damn. There were three usually only get two in a year missing link. We do need a crude's origin story where they're where it's like the croods like the croods ancestors as like very early hominids maybe or The aquatic apes if you believe that theory they could have croods like the crood's great-great-great-great-great-grandparents or aquatic apes or modern-day crudes. You could do like cloud atlas with croods throughout the ages like different croods at different times in history.

Oh some people are asking about me about jimmy dore and I don't care but somebody has a wonderful quote that I want to end on because this is the only question you should ask yourself about any of these. These left wing media flap doodles. I'm a jimmy dore fan. I don't care what you guys think he's entertaining if you like it if you're entertained by it. Then what that's all that you're actually talking about that's all you're actually talking about if you like jimmy doris because his specific like brand of like catharsis and like screaming at people and yelling at enemies like. I mean I've done my fair share yelling at people that's the reason that people tune into entertainment if that hits your pleasure center fine if you find that hectoring and unpleasant and don't like it don't think and there's no value-add with like insight that you would want to be entertained. Then. I get that too but whether he's right or not is not what determines any of this because it's like. It's. It's it's monday morning quarterbacking. It's it's. It is sports radio. It's talk it's calling in to talk about the jet secondary.

There's no relationship between what these people talk about including myself and a practical appliable politics. The croods folks the croods thank you for being the cruise traveling down the road and back again. Your heart is crude. You're a crude and a crude fanat. If you threw a crood and you invited every crood you nude. You would see the biggest crood would be for me and the crude attached would say thank you for being a crude.
