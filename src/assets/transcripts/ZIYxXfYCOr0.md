There we go it's going or is that oh. It's hosting a song oh. It's no hosting a song sorry. Guys sorry for any of the teens. Any of the young zoomer child soldiers who are enjoying hassan on our feed. It's me now hassan's hassan's weird uncle. I guess that's me there will be no sound complaints today. I've got my thing on there and I've made peace with everything else. It's finally getting chilly out and that's gonna be a storm. This weekend apparently storms are coming ah oh bodegas boys. Girls gather around let me tell you about bodegas. They're just magical places where you can go at any time of night to acquire goods. Food stuffs basic household necessities. I know. I know those of you who live anywhere near a 24 hour. Cvs might be a goddess but yeah.

It's true ah yes. Every this we were talking yesterday about how there's these cycles. These these discourse cycles that re-emerge we got to drag the clap. Another one just happened to just the clat like. I was talking about david foster wallace the classics in general now being dragged by a bunch of why a people I always find that funny because it's called young adult but none of the people involved in any of it writing it. Reading it or talking about it are young or adult. They are old babies. They are old children. They are like 30 plus emotionally stunted emotion intellectually Gnomish kid they're chill they're immature and that's why they read and write stuff for kids exclusively because they are emotionally intellectually children. I don't really know why that should be considered elitist or hostile or anything.

It just seems like a recognition of of of the dynamic at play there anyway so you got dragging the classics for being having not enough. Wizards in them got david foster wallace being dude bro steely dan and then of course another one popped up new york and it's it's It's eustis tilly like disdain for the rest of the country and I get it. I get it on all sides. I certainly understand the hostility to new york especially because honestly I think more than anything. It stems from the fact that the united states is a country where you are only worthwhile to the degree that you are a success right and because of its position in global finance and media. New york is where successful people go so if you're not there how successful can you really be. I don't think that necessarily everyone thinks that but I do think that it's a thing that motivates this sort of weird hostility but of course the other thing is the genuine overcompensating parochialism of new york mostly by transplants who are trying to justify the fact that they're spending a zillion dollars to live like animals with basically no real difference in quality of life to any other major city other than that being worse and specifically during coronavirus during kovid a time when any city certainly new york is a ridiculous joke to be living in because you're just cooped up for no reason.

It has no benefits to it but it still costs the same it's chumpish. You're a chump and so you have to do things like decide that the bodenga experience is some sort of spiritual thing. One of my favorite moments in recent film was in the harley quinn movie when there is a five-minute sequence of someone lovingly creating a bacon or an egg sandwich at a bodenga because harley quinn she loves her sandwich at her favorite bananga and you watch that scene and you know oh. This is meant specifically for the very narrow trans. People who watch this online or who like who live within this bubble of media people who want to talk about their who justify to themselves their ridiculously expensive existences. So it's just It's self-loathing reaching across the aisle which is all like. I've said that's all culture and politics.

[05:25](https://youtu.be/ZIYxXfYCOr0?t=05m25s)

Same thing are. It's it's competing. It's resent. It's mirroring resentments pure resentment on both sides new yorkers resenting that they live in a sh in a that's supposed to be the center of the world and everyone outside of it who doesn't live there presenting that either they're not there at some level. If they've really bought into the notion of you know virtue is flowing from success or It's undeserving-ness as as the place that determines these things as as the as the defining referent point for success or glamour or money or anything power ah and so that's what you're on always end up. Seeing with these things is one concentration of resentment purple's force like that person who did the viral tweet about what do you people. What do you people call it where you can get all these things at one. In the morning. She lives in new york under a pandemic. It's a misery but there's the badanga which you yokels don't have or if you do. It's not the same that's just my resentment of people living somewhere else and then it hit the resentment of people who are sick of new york for one reason or another either in the one way or the other. They think it's undeserved or they think it's deserved and then it's just a reflected self-loathing for not having attained it and then they get to fight each other over it.

It's great it's a lot of fun. We're all having fun. We're all having a lot of fun and that's the important thing so yes. It's nice to see that all the cycles are completing themselves. Everything is continuing to go nothing has ever learned nothing's ever changed. The cast of characters shifts a little bit but largely through just people washing out of the cycle not really realized not transcending it. Why do. I call it a bodenga that's because felix who is a very resentful new yorker. Not not. He's like got both because he hates and resents new york like someone who's not from there. But he also lives here. So he has both sets of resentments in one which is tough and so he hates bodega culture more than anyone and he makes fun of it by calling it. A bodenga felix is a walking contradiction that's true partly true partly fiction. Everything is a paradox ain't that the truth everything is a bundle of contradictions that must be resolved. Oh. I got a new one today. I got a poland spring. I thought. I'd try this pomegranate lemonade not bad. I'll probably stick with black cherry but as a as a change of pace not bad now. I have this on the this is from the fridge it's nice and cold.

I don't think we're going to do a series on iran contra specifically. I mean we'll probably talk about it a lot when we talk about when we do episode two of the bush episode or on episode two of the bush series because the same way that nixon was the white the executive branch point man like the white house point man for um the bay of pigs. George h.w. Bush had the same role with iran contra him and oliver north were the ones running it and so we'll talk a lot about his involvement in it in being a mega kilo drug trafficker while telling people that winners don't use drugs while having the dea entrap. A 17 year old kid into selling them. Some crack outside of the white house so that he could hold it up in front of the camera and then the kid gets 10 years one of the most despicable little moments of the bush administration this. This is not a joke in order to ramp up the war on drugs and increase the incarceral state.

He wanted to have a a speech where he laid out the case for a more punitive approach to drugs and what he wanted to do is. He wanted to hold up some crack that had been purchased within sight of the white house or something to prove how pervasive the problem was only problem was for them white house that there was nobody who really sold there. There were not open-air drug markets within side of the white house. Even then even in the high crime early late 80s. So the dea did is they they got a they got a in touch with a dealer in anacostia. I think and they had him come to the the reflective pool or something and then arrested him and then he did 10 years on that into the country to be sold in the first place. I mean it's it's astounding and his we'll talk a lot about his role and enter the broad country more broadly and although you know I think for the most part. We're it's. I think we'll stick to broad strokes. I mean but his specific involvement and the specifics of the drug operation.

I think are going to be very very well investigating so we will be talking about our encounter in the next bush episode. I don't know when bush character is going to come up. My guess is that we'll record it sometime next month to release because it doesn't have a it's not topical. So. I think we might we might do it early to bank for the holiday season. Although who the knows if there's even really going to be a holiday season. This year it does seem like everything is in this weird perpetual state. Even now of stasis. I hate to show you guys my hairline there. I know it's pretty dramatic. I should put a put a trigger warning on so 

[13:18](https://youtu.be/ZIYxXfYCOr0?t=13m18s)

I wanted to say something about jd vance and not not him specifically but sort of him as as an example of sort of the the new man that we've created in america and not just a man or even exclusively a man. But in the sense that soviets were trying to build a new man a new socialist man who who would transcend the the the restrictions of what we in bourgeois society convince ourselves as human nature and this is like that is the en that is the the metaphysical battle within or That is the metaphysical alchemy that communism seeks to engage and I think that they weren't wrong to imagine things that way I mean they were wrong to think that they could happen within a anything other than a global context. And I think the fact that when the soviet union collapsed it collapsed into rapine and kleptocracy proves that they didn't create a new man. But they did recognize that the new man needed to be built in order to live communally to be broke to to to find value in unalienated labor of not expecting the the the fruits of one's production to be the consumption of it directly but rather the the enjoyment of a social existence that what allowed them to freely express their their creative drive. Their animal spirits without having it stripped away and then re-given to them in a reduced form in the form of a wage and a consumption and access to consumption economy well. They didn't do that but meanwhile what was happening in the free world and in russia too and and eventually all barriers being broken was the creation of a new capitalist man even out of the the the clay of modern man like 19th century man which was already being you know warped and buckled by the the hyper speed of capitalist social change.

 but what the last 40 years specifically have done has created a new capitalist subject. A true homo economicus a the the the people that they made up in those textbooks. The people the communist. The the the evil mirror image of the the imagined transformed human of communism the the antichrist version and that being is one who sees all relationships as transactional who defines all things as to have a market value and that's not you know that's not something that is traditionally.

I think a way people have believed because we live socially we have lived socially and that existence of social bonds by definition means non-marketized bonds because you can't put a price on that. Like there's a reason that's you can't go to the pawn shop and get the sentimental value on your items because it only means something to you well that idea that idea that there is a value an emotional value. A bond to anything or anyone that can transcend the market which has been you know part and parcel to social existence for the entirety of humankind. We are now in the process of replacing with a fully transactional human being who has no connections to anything that cannot be quantified in if not in dollars in a crude calculus of advancement personal advancement versus personal. Demerit like what everyone we know and everything that is in the world is to be used to our advantage or to be ignored to prevent disadvantage and that we build around that the words like love and hate and you know the economy and politics and good and bad but but at base what had been a social relationship with a transcendent definition to the person who felt it to a fully exchangeable value and obviously it's not happening.

It hasn't happened fully. We still have that remnant feeling that we should have that there is something other than our benefit or a dollar amount or to a person or an item and we're getting there because our time is being abstracted away from us. First it happened geographically but now thanks to the internet first comp first television and now the internet we are stripping from the days of our lives. The chance to even have an emotionally freighted engagement with another person by replacing time with people with time with screens broadly understood and what that has created along with that's just the technological part of it. The broader part of it is creating a culture whereby precarity is so deeply felt and the safety net non-marketized social interactions are so few and far between that we essentially can't afford to do anything other than assign value to our relationships. If we want to get ahead.

So those things combined are creating. A new man is creating a a capitalist new man and jd vance is par excellence. One of those another one and I wanna I wanna draw this contrast to talk about how in many ways these two people who seem separate and are seem. Very different to come from different backgrounds are in I think and obviously you know. I'm. I'm speculating on a hypothesis. Here. This will all like end up looking like character assassination but you know if. I'm wrong. I'll apologize But I'm just talking about like looking from the outside at the contours of their careers and lives and writing is gia tolentino. I feel like they are both perfect exemplars of this new type of person and like I said this person.

[20:54](https://youtu.be/ZIYxXfYCOr0?t=20m54s)

It's no one's fault that they turn into this. It's how you end up responding to a life and a body that you did not choose and we can only we can never really judge anybody the decisions they make so. There's only so much that you can blame anyone for anything but I do feel like like gia. Talentino and jd. Vance were both americans who came into a world where there was a value system and there is a yardstick for human happiness and they had an ability to navigate it from a young age. They knew they did they went to school and they found out that unlike some of their other peers that they could pay attention and give back what the teacher had given them and they had an awareness that doing that would lead them towards what was broadly understood throughout the entire culture including everything their parents ever told them or the world around them to ever told them would be. The good good a a goodness that you have to have to build any greater goodness on top the first slab of the maslow's hierarchy and they went through the ideological sorting mechanism that constitutes applying through the to the edge applying your mind to the educational system that we have and came out of it going to college and going there and experiencing the full measure of the rule book for success in life which by that point they wouldn't have gotten there if they hadn't made this decision far back along the way of moving.

Along this trajectory. They decided that they needed even if they didn't want to they needed to treat everyone as fungal and every relationship is possible if they were going to succeed and the difference between them the difference in the reason. The reason that one of them came out and became a journalist. A left-wing writer and memoirist and the other became a republican hedge fund guy and like quasi political operative is that one of them grew up a of course not the only reason but like the structure that made all of these subsequent reasons. Happen in the first place is that she grew up in as the child of wealthy immigrants who were actual no joke human traffickers in that they were. They operated a business that had philippine filipinos who wanted to teach in the united states would help help them in the process of gaining the paperwork to do so and then moving them through it. And it was a it was like a more high-class politer version of the coyote system that gets immigrants across the immigrants or immigrants or migrants sorry migrants across the mexican border. It involved confiscation of passports and and ill treatment in in barracks like housing and accommodations and it afforded her. A very very very successful life very wealthy but she was also a a female which rendered her subject to like a patriarchy as she discovered in her in her the political awakening that comes with acquiring an understanding through the the cultural through the educational mental structuring that tells you you know who's responsible for all the bad things well. She's female and the other is she's non-white. She's she's asian and the the child of immigrants who are of course.

Besides you know black americans. Sort of the most stigmatized minorities are racialized racialized immigrants because of their tenuous status here in america legal and social and so in making her career as a writer. She mined that childhood those experiences to create a narrative whereby her parents were these eager strivers who had to negotiate the morass of american racism in order to succeed and that gave her ideas about how racism and ethnic and hostility to immigration in this country are contributing to to human misery. Like the human misery she knows her parents were involved in although she never said that in her memoir and that turns her into a liberal democrat now jd vance is a white boy a and a poor white boy that or at least poorer than than our stereotype of of a white male childhood in this country the lower half and as he acclimatizes through the educational system and finds out what's going on where the bad things are. He gets he why why things are the way they are who's responsible for what you know forming the rudiments of a political consciousness. He finds out that there is an explanation for why things are bad and the bad guys are white guys like him. They are white guys by definition. They are either rich white guys responsible for economic oppression or poor white guys responsible for racism and racial oppression well. What good does that do you if you're a young shriver looking to get ahead you're going to apologize for yourself all day. Why would I want to do that. That instead what he did is.

He mined his family background to show how his how he was able to overcome like the tainted association and in so doing explain to audiences of educated wealthy liberals and conservatives who are trying to understand their fellow citizens much like their reid gila torentino to try to understand the exotic immigrant experience. This exotic lower class white experience. Jd gets to treat his family as marionettes to prove a point to them about how their failings are personal and his success by definition is also personal and that he is virtuous and but that that that that argument which personalizes blame it doesn't have as easy a adherence to the liberal The more sophisticated fully articulated liberal collegiate description of oppression in this country but enough for him to so that makes him a a republican so and and a bootstraps guy. But both of them are people whose fundamental everything they say and have done in their careers has been driven by a fundamental transactional relationship with all around them where you turn your family into just grist and the problem. We have now is that everybody who emerges from these structures everybody who everybody who is able to get a voice to be able to be heard because the thing about america is is that the the the most oppressed among us are silent spivak.

We can answer the question does the subaltern speak. I don't know but the subaltern does not tweet not in a way that enters what we consider the political consciousness. It's all filtered through spokespeople and media figures who many of whom are able to act as gatekeepers between the two two halves. The the college educated politically engaged half and those overwhelmingly among the poorest of us who are not part of this conversation. I mean they're tweeting right but they're tweeting about their own. They're not part of the political discussion. They're not part of the discourse unless it's unless it's been like co-legged and translated because of the the failure for people to be able to imagine outside their. Own their own bubble it means that there's a self-consciousness that permeates all attempts to engage and renders them impossible and yeah. They've never been part of the conversation but and really all we're seeing now is just how how stark that is because we have this social media that's hypothetically supposed to connect all of us and yet it reproduces the same hierarchies of structures as as our society itself because if you're really struggling in this country you just do not have the luxury that's going to say privilege because that's but the luxury of engaging with politics as a meaningful category of life because why would you waste your time because it doesn't do anything your lived experience tells you it doesn't do anything the thing that tells us that it does something is books and tweets and tv shows and our friends and family and our parents. Not our lived experience just just a translation of that a baffling of that a a mystification of that that we engage socially oh man somebody. I mean apparently they're not going to do it now but because people got mad but the very fact that they tried to me. It's another piece of the of the mosaic that you could just title rip subtext.

There's you can't you cannot do satire of this moment. So people don't know this story in la union center union station is the big train station in downtown and it is also right now. One of the main covet testing centers that they have and a lot of kova testing spenders have been overwhelmed lately as you could imagine because I hope it is as bad as it's ever been in this country and getting worse by the day and the la city government issued a permit for a gender swapped tick-tock cast remake of can't buy me love to film there and close it to the public and close it close. The te the cove and testing site so not only are you having a situation where you're allowing the shooting of this thing to happen. 170 people running around this enclosed building at the height of the pandemic they are. They are critically reducing the city's infrastructure for coveted response in doing so now that does not tell you everything you need to know about the death spiral.

[33:58](https://youtu.be/ZIYxXfYCOr0?t=33m58s)

The capitalism is in this country because of its complete control of government. Like obviously government is the ex and government is inextricable from capitalism but it serves the reason. It's there is. It does serve a function of alienating some of the decision-making away from self-interested individual capitalists so that you can coordinate and reduce you can't eliminate because capitalism is inherently wasteful and destructive and at least reduce the waste so that in times of crisis for example you can coordinate response in such a way that prevents collapse. That's why after the the there was a panic in economic there was a wall street panic in 1907 that nearly brought the entire united states. Governments or the united entire united states economy took collapse.

The thing that stopped it is the jp morgan locked a bunch of the biggest bank owners you know in his library until they agreed to a private bailout of the american economy of the of of the in the form of bailing out the the stock market and that was such that was such a close call and totally dependent on one guy essentially having the wherewithal individually to alienate himself from the mere logic of a short-term profit that he could override that and everyone else you can't guarantee that's going to happen every time so they created the federal reserve to do that at that level and similarly and what we have now is a situation where all the things that were built up since the federal reserve systems specifically after the new deal to steer the ship have been all torn away and stripped and sold for parts because the you've got to get money somewhere because you've got to replace that profit that keeps going down because we're not doing anything anymore. We're we're circulating money. Around us economy at this point is just purely about investing it's about spinning water wheels for no reason.

The reason that uber and all these other companies that have never made any money and in fact are so in the whole that even if they monopolized their respective markets it would take decades to even come close to making up for the profits that the money has already been waste. That's already been lost the reason they're going to keep giving them money. It's not necessarily. They don't recognize that it's it's good money after bad. It's that there's nowhere else to put it. There's nowhere else to invest money other than in like recreating 19th century and current indian practices of personal like servant servitude like all of the uber is just creating through the two bilateral contractual technological relationship of a contractor and a contractee. Old feudal relate oh feudal servant bonds that's the techno feudalism we keep talking about and part of that means is that the government is completely controlled completely controlled so that they can't even recognize any more than the capitalist can. The individual capitalist can that in the even just for their own good they need to plane.

Hey yes we got a day we got We got this shot for She's all that gender swap tick-tock show. We got it congratulations that's gonna net your company but I I've been a good 10 grand in netflix royalties or whatever the economy that this entire city is based on the movie theaters as we know them have closed and yes we already have streaming but there's gonna be a bottleneck there. As you transition from one to the other and a lot of money is gonna get shed you want if there's any hope of keeping that industry afloat. It is in tamping down on cloven as much as possible and yet the short-term interests of some who wanted to shoot a guy taking his glasses off and revealing that he's actually hot the whole time and then they do. A choreograph dance dance move to fat boy slim at the train station that is supposed to call back the corey grant's dance number from the end of the original. She's all that and you have you got that congratulations and in exchange for that the you have further doomed everything unless the only reason this makes sense is if the idea of intervening in any of the bad stuff is a fiction and that the thing that separates those on the inside on the outside is not that they're just chained to the profit motive so much as they are chained to the profit motive and also cognizant that because they are chained to the the shot in and that is what's going on perhaps perhaps perhaps perhaps like the thing that throws all of our models of self-interest. Even short-term self-interest into a tizzy is the question of how self-consciously black-pilled are our elites how much have they looked into the anus of satan how many of them have gotten their own personal ned baby speech where the reality of it is capitalism and barbarism or socialism and not barbarism you if you want to be on top of this system it will collapse do you want to not be on top and see what's behind door number two which in your heart you don't think is possible.

Because remember. These people are fully ideologically conditioned whereas they don't think that the alternative to capitalism exists so it is this it is this and barbarism. It is barbarism. So do you want to be the chieftain do you want to be in the castle or do you want to be sucking of the stick because if it's if all this really requires is for them to just remove one layer of self-conscious ideology. The layer of capitalism actually is for the good of humanity. Capitalism actually makes everybody better off every It's free shoes. It's the milton friedman fairy tale stuff that they could win everybody else with and that only a few of them ever really believed. But I think even now. I I think at this point even they have have let the the scales fall and what they've seen is the reality of oh okay no never mind. It doesn't make everybody anything everything better for everybody. In the long run.

It actually makes things very bad for everybody but very few but I'm one of them and I'm going to do whatever it takes to stay there. And if I want to have some sort of ethical reason for this well. What about my kids what about my family what about the people. I love don't. I have a responsibility to them if it's all the same if we're going down anyway shouldn't. I try to save my family shouldn't you pull your family out of a burning car before you pull anybody else out isn't that a responsible moral thing to do that's why the only thing that's going to break.

[41:21](https://youtu.be/ZIYxXfYCOr0?t=41m21s)

This up is is an eruption from without and by working class organs of power to disrupt the existing ones. They can't be taken over from within because within everyone within them. Everyone within them has I think internalized a lot of this. It's getting chilly out damn. Executive outcomes is coming back. The pinkertons are rolling in it. Yeah. No we're gonna. It's the new gilded age we gotta get the gun thugs back. Baldwin felts black water Gonna fill the crack as the steak collapses. It'll fill the craps it'll fill the fill. The gaps were you on april 15th you dumb yeah.

The pinkertons are apparently also in addition to getting staffed up as as security for especially urban areas. A lot of domestic unrest. They're also creating these executive catastrophe contingency packages where high with net worth individuals can essentially get a like a medic alert bracelet where if the mob shows up to the compact to the front doors or something they will they will be able to crash them out with a team of operators and extract them to a prepared remote hardened location like a bunker type deal and in addition to that the craziest one is that last year the year before there was a I think a honda or toyota executive hyundai. One of the big japanese automotive companies. There's a the chief. The the ceo was under house arrest on a bunch of finance crime charges. I think like embezzling and stuff. I'm not sure and he was up. But he's also he was like um. He's also a lebanese citizen and he hired some black water type guys to sneak him out of the country on a private plane and then get him to first istanbul and then cut up to another private plane to lebanon where he couldn't be extradited. They literally just they just said yeah no. I'm above the law literally nissan yeah. That was it so that's like the future is here you know there's nothing there's nothing that you could imagine that is not already in pupil figurative form happening right in front of us. Now of course. These there's a lot of them though not all of them are terrible. Some are good prefigured they could be pre-figurative all depends on which ones we water which ones we allow to eat after midnight carlos. Ghosan that was that it's so. I guess he's just still chilling in lebanon right that would have been funny if he got blown up in that ammonium.

[45:26](https://youtu.be/ZIYxXfYCOr0?t=45m26s)

 explosion somebody asked if the whiskey rebellion was a proto-working-class rebellion not really because you got to remember. These are all small holders now we're talking full-on yeoman. These subjects who were the hypothetical like the hypothetical subject of this constitutional order that was coming into being were these guys but part of that was that they had this this notion of liberty of being ungoverned. That was that was only viable in the context of yeoman farming which in those parts of the country nor western massachusetts and new england. That's where that model was born because that's where it was most viable like the land was good enough to grow stuff on but not good but not that good it was good. It was it was it was good enough for you to grow crops for yourself and family and a surplus. But you couldn't have plantation agriculture. You couldn't have large-scale capital intensive agriculture in that part of the of the continent. What you could have was a small farm that could produce a surplus and which would allow for the exchange of surplus for finished goods and the and then perhaps for more purchase of more land that allowed for an idea of a self-sufficient 

 subject who was this would be essentially for whom a state would essentially be redundant because the market transactions would regulate every part of his economic life and social life. That's where the libertarian idea comes from and like obviously the the way that the whiskey rebellion went with the vic the victory of federalism over it it you know it was a victory for the hamiltonian administrative state that was going to take these freemen and and lash them and and discipline them with with the with taxation and then later with with mortgages and and liens and things like that but in the context of creating a modern political subject because the thing about capitalism is it's necessary because you have to grind through these social forms. They're not going to and more importantly. It's not even a choice. It's inherent when you when when when the the colonies got connected to the dynamo of the british of british industry which is going to start the crank of wallenstein's world system as it wends its way around the cut of the continents. The the intensification of of trade intensifies the need for alienating and intervening mechanisms of bureaucracy both state and private and that means alienating liberty away towards a center and the thing that pulled away from that process in america was the emergence of this alternative economic model.

This alternative production model in the south that is where why you were able you saw this early contradiction because that was the central contradiction of the colonial project or the american project postcolonial. So it had two models of capitalist production. They were both capitalists but obviously there is a significant difference between small holding farming as our agricultural of agricultural staples as the as the as the as the model and when I say model. I mean the the model of resource end of this. The model in the cities is the same as it is everywhere. It's it's the it's the it's the maw that chews up all those things. It eats all the food and takes all of the the all the materials two ways to fill get this moth fed.

You had the smallholder model and then in the south you had the plantation over time the plant as as the ability to extract profit due to the expansion of slavery and then of course technological innovations like the cotton gym. I mean the main reason that the first the first ranks of founding fathers thought that slavery was something that they could just put off was because they thought it was going to go away naturally in the near term because it wasn't really that profitable it wasn't really like where it was where it was then where it was during the colonial and an early modern period before we expanded. It really wasn't that profitable the soil was already getting depleted in in the tidewater like george washington. Even though he was the biggest landowner in virginia he had to borrow 500 bucks to go to his own inaugural because he had a bunch of bad harvests even though he had huge you know slave plantations and the margins just weren't good enough. It was cotton and then the ability to to make cotton labor labor to reduce the labor intensiveness of cotton to a point where you could make more money make money off of it that made it a viable a long-term viable mode of production and that's what changed the politics of slavery over time and blew up the constitutional order.

So. I would say that whiskey rebellion. I don't think it's proto-working-class movement in that it has the form of popular over it has the form of a popular resistance to oppression. The thing is is that the the axis of oppression then is not really the one that you see in a organized working-class movement within a capitalist system. A fully integrated capitalist system where the yeomanry or the yeoman conception of liberty is not an overriding thing and honestly that's one of the chief hindrances of the american labor movement is the persistence of the omen. Conception of liberty was only been protest that has been that has persisted the way it has because of our dynamic of expansion that has governed our nation until very recently like you can say oh.

The frontier closed in the 1890s yes. But that's when we started our colonial wars and then very quickly we became the inheritors of a globe spanning empire. It was all. I really think that the myth died with iraq man. Those obelisks one of the things that that they've really taken from us is any ability to have any wonder about anything because no one could have seen that for a second and not immediately thought oh this is viral marketing for some and maybe it isn't maybe it's not maybe there's nothing else that ever happens. It's like hey what was the deal with those obelisks and we never find out.

It's too late then and it's all gonna be a slow like there will never there can be no collective intake of breath because everything we see we inherently distrust as we should yeah. It's getting chilly oh god. The clowns guys the clowns thank you for reminding me about the clowns that was probably the one thing that more than anything should have told you that in retrospect that trump should've was gonna win not because he's orange just because that kind of thing happening people are people are vibing on a weird people are vibing. People are waiting for something people are they're tasting something in the air. Something's getting weird and honestly. I wonder if the fact that trump won stopped the clown thing if it was just that clown like him being president diffused. The energy that was turning into it was expressing itself in in weird clowns and if hillary had won maybe the clown thing would have had become a like. A real extended phenomenon involving body counts and and cults and or unless it was all viral marketing for it unless it was viral marketing for it because if it was and they were cool about it we never would have known.

They weren't going to say hey. This is for it because like if they're really smart they don't know you. It's d you program them deeply enough you don't have to make the connection they'll make it themselves yeah. It is the plot of the movie joker and I wonder if trump being president didn't like defer divert us from the joker timeline at least temporarily now with biden getting back in here and like the normal folk. The the adults in the room again does that mean the joker vacation is gonna start back up are we gonna start seeing clowns again. Clowns in M95 masks we'll see after inauguration day after biden becomes president and doesn't get arrested by michael flynn after they've waved the servers around. 

Then I think you might see jokerification and intensifying I am going to become the joker damn right damn right you are we all are we're all going to be the joker sooner or later. We're all getting occupied. But no I feel like i. I went through my jokerification phase and I came out the other end and hopefully. We will come out to the other end collectively of our jokerfication phase. Feeling feeling like we're we're changed evolved upward. Maybe fingers crossed oh god cuomo. I I still think the funniest thing would be.

It's john ossoff in 2024 because it's so nothing more perfectly democratic about a guy wasting a ton of money to lose a center a house race the most money I think anybody had ever used to lose a house race then taking another boatload of money burning it just burning it flushing it down the toilet to lose twice the same senate race and then he gets the nomination as the president so that he can like end up spending three billion dollars to lose to john taffer or larry the cable guy or larry. The cable guy and john taffer strapped together like master blaster that would be that would be perfect. God. I got it I behind this. I keep thinking that the 2024 republican candidate if it's not trump will be john junior and I know that everyone's like and myself I agree. He has none of his father's raw charisma or talent of any kind. He's a perfectly null fail son the ideal fail son but honestly I think that takes that doesn't take into account how much stupider and more pathetic things are going to be in 2024. How much lower is everyone's expectation going to be of anything and how much will the toad-like anti-charisma of donald jr end up winning just by virtue of having some some transient trends some some transferred valor. Some stolen vibe from his dad compared to the other wet dish rags who run against him so yeah. We'll see we'll see. I have a feeling. I mean we'll see how we'll see how things are maybe they won't be so stupid. Maybe people will be less dumb but hey ossoff versus don. Jr. I think could be an amazing election. Let's all let's all hope bye.
