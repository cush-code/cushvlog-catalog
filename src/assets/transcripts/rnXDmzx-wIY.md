Tell me who that rhyme john the revelator tell me who that rhyme john the revelator tell me who that rhyme john. The revelation down to the revelator wrote the book of seven seals. You know god walked out in the cool of the day called adam by his name. He refused to answer cause he's naked and ashamed tell me who that right john the revelator tell me who's that ridin john. The revelator tell me who's that right john. The revelator wrote the book of the seven seals.

Howdy folks we're back. We're back with book five chip part five of uh leo panic and sam gindin's the rise of global capitalism. This section called rule of global capitalism. We're talking now about the moments that the decades the crucial last decades of the 20th century when capitalism became substantiated as a global system beyond uh. Uh the american role in it because you have the the system as it's being set up in the post-war world is headquartered in america and and is in many ways imposed by directly by america. But in these decades uh us capital is able to use its leverage against other capital formations and nation states to dictate the terms by which international trade and law are going to operate in a way that is fully american and that leads to the situation we're in now where the american role in global capitalism is now fundamentally in conflict with global capitalism's greater urge movement towards the deterritorialization because america really has at this point much like capitalism outweighed its usefulness within the system uh but there's nothing else there's nowhere else for that power to go so even though like the the american state is the thing. All this other stuff rests on and yet our political class is in the process of uh destroying itself and destroying the uh the legitimacy of the system that props the whole thing up and that's only possible because we cannot assimilate democratically our decline and our loss of uh position in global capitalism because we never spoke it.

It was always a secret. It was always uh being sublimated into other conversations and other politics and now so now we can't face it. It's literally impossible uh. So this first chapter nine is called a rule of law governing global globalization uh but before we get into it.

I have to do another a little digression to begin with here because somebody dm me and asked me to go into keynesianism more because we talk a lot about how keynesianism is enthroned as sort of the uh the theory that dominates like the economic thinking of the imperial managers of america in the post-war era and that keynesianism comes into terminal crisis in the 70s leading towards neoliberalism after it sort of exhausts itself as a governing ideology and the question. This person had is is to what degree is it true that keynesianism came to a point where it could no longer be applied or did. Other factors cause people to just lose faith in the keynesian solutions that they could have pursued and I would say that at the end of the day it's meaningless distinction because what doomed keynesianism was the fact that it supposed as its basis.

The notion that there is an overriding interest that can be uh discovered through democratic deliberative governance that can at every point uh dictate terms essentially dictate conditions under which capitalism will operate and that is you know why guys like keynes could imagine like why good liberals could oversee capitalism while knowing that it was at that point knowing that it had failed because they all lived through the great depression but thinking that they were putting capitalism on a path to extinction. Keynes used to talk about the rent the euthanization of the rent-to-year class. He basically said we have to do what the soviets are demanding get rid of class rule. It's not it has to they're a barnacle. They're a parasite that will destroy the whole system. But the communists say you've got to line them up and shoot them.

No no no we can use reform to control the economy build institutions of like real democracy that can essentially buy out the ruling class so that you know. They can keep their relative positions of wealth maybe in the short term. But they have given up the ability to pass on their wealth generationally and dynastically and that power and wealth is then socialized. Uh that's the dream of keynesianism uh but and the problem is is that that was a false and incorrect uh and intentionally delusional read of the situation. What made keynesianism work when it did oh look. We don't have to worry about boom and bust. We don't have to worry about the destabilizing destabilizing effects of cyclical downturns like the  uh. The neo classicals that how you can insist we have to we can stop that from happening completely by by moving the toggles keeping us in the straightened arrow between inflation and unemployment. The sure that we can we can fill the bucket with with uh federal spending. Uh supply our demand side stimulus uh that will keep us on an even keel and by being in an even keel you legitimize institutions of democracy and they expand and therefore democratic control of the economy increases. But what actually happened is that democratic control. The economy during the period of keynesian uh supremacy was dissolved. We've talked about it a million times with starting with henry wallace being replaced on the ticket in 44 to the uh the the republican wave election at 48 and taft hartley. Uh the red scare we talked about all this stuff uh and like that's that's what that's the stick.


The carrot of course being you know mass home ownership for for white uh workers that success capitalism's success at essentially supporting the state to operate it for it to operate legitimize its own institutions its own interests uh like a  parasitic larva eating out the insides of an animal without it even knowing it uh so when the crisis came keynesianism was at a loss not necessarily because there wasn't a theoretical thing that keynesianism could have suggested but because uh the constituency for uh for any values beyond profit we're totally uh obliterated because at the end of the day the whip hand is with the profit motive. Everything else is subsidiary to that under capitalism regardless of the institutions that are governed and that govern capitalism uh in crisis. Profit motive becomes the only thing that is protected because it's the only thing that is actually unifying everybody in power. Everybody is aligned along a profit motive whereas people are discreetly bunched together along ideological and empirical questions. They're all polarized like  iron filings around capital whether they're in government or whether they're in the private quote-unquote private sector which is of course just the same thing from an institutional structural perspective. We just create these uh these veils of separation and then perform them and everyone just believes it because there's an alternative what the  is water so that meant that when a crisis comes there is nobody there to speak for a keynesian solution because at the end of the day the system is not governed by uh a a a disinterested notion of the greater good.

People within government might imagine themselves to be operating off of those assumptions and they might do their best to uphold them. But their effort is only resonated with the effort of those who are just looking to make money so that is the failure of keynesianism and that is why the mmt thing kind of annoys me because they're insisting look we've proven here that money isn't real and it's like well no. What does that help us you're explaining how the system actually operates without the the mystificating mirrors but getting people to believe a certain thing is true. Like that does not make them act and action is what is necessary now like because the mmt fantasy is that if you get enough people to believe that this is how it works then that will make them act in a way that re-democratizes our institutions but that's going to require work at a much more uh confrontational level.

A more grassroots level than at the area abstractions of monetary theory and so yes like keynes. Keynesianism was also correct in a narrower sense but the thing that makes keynesianism fail inherently is because embedded in keynesianism is the same theological belief that undergirds classical liberalism which is that class rule is an inevitable and natural component of life not hierarchy in some generic sense. The way that guys like jordan peterson bring it like you know differences in abilities or or uh skills. You know distributed through a population no uh a rule by class as in people with a specific relationship to production nothing having to do with their intrinsic values or abilities. Their position relative to capital is what determines their uh ascension and what what the entire liberal tradition accepts and embeds. In itself is a secularization of the theory of individual of um original sin that permeated christianity which was used to prop up feudalism.

We cannot socially sustain a belief in a risen living god anymore. But we can still believe that the natural world is outside of us and it is governed by rules that we can only obey and one of those rules according to the high priests of capitalism. Since the 1900s has been that class rule is inherent and inevitable uh and in fact necessary because first you had first you had like liberal orthodoxy post-protestantism post-puritanism in england saying you know here's here's predestination in in practice. The market is god what its dictates are is god's will. We must submit submit ourselves to it which is why they took the gold standard as their religious um like their religious sigil. Gold had a uh abstract natural value that was outside of human uh uh values and human uh measurements and that is of course not true that is the dilute.

That's that is a religious belief and it's nested on top of the religious belief. That class is inevitable because these religious traditions exist in a context of domination are reproduced by systems of domination. So the people who would live within them and then benefit from them of course are going to accept those theological conceptions. Marx comes along and says actually no that's all fake. Humans are in charge of everything what are you. Talking about no natural are you insane. We make values so that means that that rock is not what's going to determine how much money there is. We determine how much money there is only right. Now the we is the ruling class is the capitalist class. It could be that we could be us all of us led by the working class and then we can socially determine where the  money goes and what value is and what what what what to pursue and that has been that's the radical you know non. Uh. That's the radical like anabaptist uh uh christian tradition that got suppressed by mainstream christianity.

The one that says actually we're all saved. There is no uh original sin. We don't need christ in the form of the market to determine our worth. We can all live in heaven here on earth and I believe that that if you don't have a utopian horizon like that in your politics somewhere it doesn't have to actually like come into practical consideration ever you never have to argue anybody with it because it doesn't matter. It's. It's it's just part of your identity.


Without that you will eventually drift towards some flavor of authoritarian genocidal fascism brutality over social uh civilization because if you accept class rule is inevitable therefore capitalist uh the capitalist market. Uh is in is god then if we are being destroyed by the market as we cannot argue is not happening. Now no one can argue that's not happening no matter what they say uh well. Then we had it coming essentially and the question only becomes who will suffer first and who will be saved and who who will be protected and that is always going to come down to some sort of schmidian enemy distinction and that's that's everybody's politics at the uh if they do not have a belief that there is a human ability to control our destiny now. The thing about that gold standard mysticism of the 19th century is that eventually it was no longer sustainable because during the 19th century you saw what it led to cyclical uh collapses which the austrians called the real business cycle and that was no longer sustainable. Once the economies got big enough and the working class got organized enough used all of the uh technology and social relationships developed by capitalism to challenge it.

Oh. We can't just let the economy collapse every 20 years and then tell everybody tough. Help any to prevent anyone from starving. It's like you can tell people that when they're a scattered bunch of of yeoman and recent immigrants but once you have like a coordinated uh working class movement with organs of power like labor unions and political parties. Oh  pull a trigger finger pull uh pull the trigger finger in or unwield a gun all of a sudden you've got to do something you have to do something and out of that necessity to find a new modus vivendi. For like the theology of capitalism you get keynes who says okay actually. It's not a sin to determine the money supply. We can determine the money supply but when we say we it has to be central banks.

It has to be a capitalist class because they are the ones they're the only ones who have sufficient information to make decisions of this kind of magnitude and of course that assumption rests on the perpetuation of class rule like that's. The thing. Like all the things that that make this all sadly inevitable uh are are assumed are the assumed transcendence of these things that we can't even conceive of getting rid of and so you get central bank independence and you get uh this new dual mechanism of uh pressing the button uh pressing the uh the interest rate button up and down determining money supply and basically keeping a steady flow of capital that creates a consistent overtime stable conditions of growth not the wild cycles that have predominated before which is going to prevent the very revolutionary situation that they're all terrified of but again. It was all that it was all premised on colonial super profits and america being the consumer and producer of first result or of uh of first and last resort and when that relationship changes it had to to accommodate the reality of you know other capitalist economies coming into their own as spokes and nodes in the system.

Uh it widely destabilized the situation and the only way to prevent to the reforms that would have had to have happened along the keynesian road towards euthanization of the rentier class. As they imagined would have meant direct conflict with capitalism and it's and its manifestation in state power. There were no horses for that. By that point the horses had left the stable because of keynesianism's very success. Now you've got plenty of people in america who come from you know the the the populist tradition without a root in materialism uh who really do believe like absolute fairy stories about america as like a transcendent concept. Not like do not understand that like even if these things have meaning. It's all socially constructed they do believe in like a transcendent american value and the constitution is having transcendent american values you know that's the kind of like reactionary populism that emerges when you don't have a well organized working class and there's plenty of these people who want to end the fed and go back to the gold standard because they've seen what financialization of the economy has done in the last 30 years.

They're horrified by it rightly but they also share the same underlying premise as the liberals which is the class rule is inevitable and in fact preferable and necessary. But because they're not aware of the way these systems depend on each other. They have a fantasy that is just allowed to persist because it's politically useful to people who get these idiots to vote for republicans uh that they could fantasize one day we're going to end the fed and get rid of the of central banking even though everything that you claim to love about capitalism depends on it but then the liberals are left sputtering and and and gawking and not knowing what to do either until they all decided all right well. You know what we're there's nowhere to go. Capitalism is the real god we can only serve it and meanwhile the actual regulators and central bankers. They have no ideology even though a bunch of them are like ein rand aficionados and like supposedly hardcore libertarians and friedmanites. Like uh alan greenspan. They take for granted that the state will be intervening in the economy uh that's the only way to make neoliberalism work.

You can't have a financial speculative economy unless you have guarantees of state intervention to prop up industries and pump in liquidity when there's a crisis in fact what this chapter is about chapter nine rule of law governing globalization is the process whereby uh the u.s regulatory state went from trying to prevent crises from occurring in the keynesian sense you know intervening to stop an overheating of the market. Now the market depends on overheating. That's the only way that it's like it's an engine that's really long gas. It's literally running on fumes. These are bubbles are the only thing that will keep it moving forward because its engine has been removed uh so that means now you can't prevent crises. The the role of the state is to intervene afterwards in crisis and of course that gives uh in those crises. Capital is able to determine the rules for all these countries that have been resisting american capitalism in one way or another all through the 20th century. So the main mechanism that is used uh to pry open these small.


These middle and lower class uh uh um income countries uh is trade. Treaties wto the imf and specifically it's part of it is trade treaties like nafta where it's like you know groups integrating but mostly it is bilateral trade treaties. This is it like it's not one big trade network made up of uh of like a u.n of trade. It is individual relationships between the united states government and specific other governments which of course makes sense that that's how it would work if we conceive of global capitalism as this hub and spoke situation which is what it is uh. If that's the case then uh you're only you're going to ha everything's going to have to run through washington. So all these treaties now are put in place which uh they operate by first absorbing in the near term. All of the dislocation of uh creating free trade between you know the us and the country that's got much lower.

Wage costs by having american uh employment take the hit basically because we could afford to. We had other ways to try to make it up to people in the short term to make them imagine that you know oh. We're not having a tremendous step backwards quality of living. Uh no we're still in control of our destiny but they use the political threat of protectionism as a leverage point to kind of get these countries to pry open their markets. They were able to go to these countries and say look we love free trade but if we keep getting hammered on this stuff. If you uh eventually our um our voters are going to demand tariffs or you could open your markets and we could tell our people hey. Now we get to trade there and we get to send our stuff to them uh and that really helped grease the wheels. Although for the most part there wasn't a lot of resistance like we talked about how this is an imposition on these foreign countries and it is it's certainly an imposition on their people. None of whom would have voted for any of this none of them wanted it. It was not in their best interest in the near or long term but their ruling classes were unified in their demand for for access to u.s. Capital and markets that was how the the people who are already rich already capital holders in these countries we're going to in this new competitive framework be able to make money. It's the only way because again the other thought the alternative to this is democratic control of the economy which runs directly counter to their interests. No demoralize the working class hyper-exploit them and then be basically the middleman between uh u.s capital and your supply of resources and labor and since capitalism is pretty much in the driver's seat. Politically everywhere.

These these people relatively enthusiastically adopt this new trade regime and uh what these what's embedded in these treaties are legal structures. Legal theories that our marginal things in american jurisprudence aren't even accepted as uh as legal facts in america but are now inscribed legally in uh pretty much every governing uh policy. Uh thanks to the it's being written into these treaties again going around democracy saying hey you can't vote to do this you can't vote to do that to your economy because private property is transcendent of all other uh rights which again this is a religious thing based on that religious belief and in hierarchy the need for it and its expression through property ownership and one of the main. Uh legal theories here that is imposed in these treaties is the notion of regulatory takings. Now we've already seen how a big part of globalizing capitalism was making it so that countries would not expropriate foreign investment. They couldn't just say the government wouldn't just say hey uh that's ours now that banks ours now that that mine is ours because that's gonna keep capital from coming in if they think they're. Gonna lose it so you'd already seen a huge decline in expropriation in the 80s as as these countries were sort of disciplined by their need to access the market but regulatory takings took that even further and said actually uh not only can you not excorporate.

There's always it always is the assumption is you can explore if you pay like the the worth of the item which is never going to be worth it for anybody to do. Because the rate is just set too high because it's set by them. They get to say how much a thing is worth so that means they'll always set it above what you can pay so practically you can't excorporate with that rule. But there's in addition. There's a reading that says any regulation on the economy that you have as a country that might take profits from not even excorporating their actual capital. It might reduce their profits. Going forward also has to be compensated for because you are taking from their firm through regulation and this is like.

I said it's a it's a marginal legal theory that had uh its support in american jurisprudence was shockingly as you'd imagine. It was big during the gilded age. Then it went away. It became a fringe doctrine during the great uh during the new deal and post-war era and then in the 80s presto comes back and becomes imposed everywhere as a legal concept. This is a thing that is only present in american law and is now internationalized without anybody voting for it and what this means is. Now you got all these trade networks that are all being uh regulated with these treaties and those treaties have to be uh arbitrated because there will be conflicts and so the main uh institutional. Uh enforcer of this new regulatory regime is the bank of international settlement which arbitrates on an allegedly impartial basis between states and uh and corporations basically uh and you know. This is classic bourgeois justice claims to be disinterested. Third party actually made up of us and uk lawyers who are fully enmeshed in the revolving door between finance and government service and they dominate what is called the arbitration community. All these arbitrators for these institutions who are all essentially working for u.s. Capital and therefore are able to create a corpus of rulings of arbitration that substantially and consistently favors capital against democracy. Basically now this newly volatile system still needs uh some sort of regulatory structure because you know yes. We're now accepting that uh huge crashes are going to happen cyclically and that the government's job is going to be to stop the contagion by dumping in liquidity and nothing else.

But if people are going to start speculating loudly they have to be able to know what where their money is going and so this risk management assessment risks risk assessment becomes what uh stands in for actual regulation. The only real regulation now is that certain securities require a degree of uh of uh like a price like a assets to to um price. Basically they have to have a certain percentage of the money. They're lending out in reserve to cover a loss and they create a sliding scale which grades these. Uh these instruments. According to how much uh collateral essentially is is is still in reserve uh with the institution making it uh or not. It's not collateral. I'm. It's a ratio basically of of money. You have to money you're lending out margin requirement uh and the the more s the safer. They are the uh the less leverage. They are basically uh and but this and that's set at an international level but then wouldn't you know it. The international standard is only applied to small domestic banks. In emerging economies. The big multi-national conglomerate banks essentially get to regulate themselves. They create a independent rating. Agencies are created which are funded directly by the big banks so they are essentially able liquidity. Cap thank you. They are essentially able to dictate their and determine their own rating uh for their own. Uh instruments which of course we know ended up being uh disastrous for the housing market in uh the auths because the the the issuers of the bonds or the mortgage-backed securities were buying their rating but the smaller banks the uh the banks in smaller developing countries they have to uh. They are disciplined by this like actual standard on the international market.


This is the two-track justice system that guarantees that capital will win and we will use the american state to enforce that uh victory over any social formation anywhere nation state or otherwise so the other thing that is uh needed though to uh pin. This whole thing down uh is the monetary policy that can be dependent upon because we've talked about how you know. The government is the state's role in maintaining capitalism is in determining the money supply uh because that is something that cannot be privatized. Private money is impossible so it is where the private it's the nexus point between our uh fake division between private and public. That's why it's so dicey. And that's why so many reactionaries are fixated on the gold standard because it removes the it pushes back the abstraction. It's like this is literally beyond. Our control money comes from how much gold we have. We don't make that of course us deciding that gold is what money is is the choice. That's what determines the pool but we get to pretend. It's the actual amount of gold that determines it. There's. There's this right-wing fixation on it because it resolves that contradiction liberals of course are more happy to uh wallow in contradiction uh and so they're happy to sit there in the nexus like good lutherans uh between private and public. But because they understand they can't afford the illusion that these things are separate.

They just think that it's still natural because they have a deeper transcendent relationship to capital than even sort of the lump in populous reactionary does and so what these countries in these new uh emerging markets that are now connected to hub and spokes style to the us supply chains and and money markets is uh central bank independence because we got rid of the gold standard. It's not coming back but we need an artificial constraint that is not accessible by democracy to determine the money supply and what that means is a push to demand as part of all the package of structural adjustment regulations and reformations that that go into any creation of a neoliberal economy. In these states. They were going to have to promise basically not to print money if things go bad to have a central bank tasked with the same thing that the central bank in uh that the u.s. Federal reserve is tasked with lower keeping inflation low and so what is presented and pushed as an attempt to create independent social central banks for all. This country is in effect actually creating a franchise model where all of these central banks are essentially branch offices of the u.s federal reserve because they will as policy as ideology as theology follow the dictates of the federal reserve and it is that guarantee uh that that gives the incentive for capital to start flowing to these countries.

Like that was the condition for many people might not know this but some of you might not the condition that the uh afrikaner government uh extracted from mandela and the anc to abolish apartheid was central bank independence. They needed to assure that if they gave up the reins of democracy that they would maintain the actual control over the economy because if they didn't have that then there would be an attempt to actually there would be at least a pressure from below to actually democratize the economy which could not be allowed to happen and of course. You can you can even imagine squint hard enough and see that action as uh not just grubby self-interest because I guarantee you those scumbag afrikaners you get them drunk enough to be like look even if they could do it. It won't matter because if you try to do it you'll get crushed you will be destroyed. Capital will flow out of your country and you'll never get it back and you can look at what happened in zimbabwe in the late 90s early aughts for what would have happened in south africa if they had not accepted its central bank independence. So they could even tell themselves. They were doing the right thing not even just for their faction or for you know the white afrikaners uh or the white south africans. All basically all afrikaners are right um. They can imagine I'm saving the country from disaster because if the us is there to  uh punish you it will if money can flow out of your economy. When you try to socialize economic activity. It will and there's nothing you can do to get it back that is why piketty and others have said the only way that you're going to deal with a global inequality or rein in private capital is with international standards. International minimum tax rates like global capital controls basically to prevent money from just moving around because otherwise every independent nation state no matter if it's governed by communists or populist reactionaries who are going to fix everything by creating like heronvolt democracy. Their efforts to socialize the economy will be disciplined out of effectiveness. Same thing happened with venezuela and of course that's what makes it so infuriating when people point to places like zimbabwe and venezuela and say look. This is why socialism doesn't work and it's like yes.

Because it is it presents as an existential threat to the system and it initiates a white blood cell attack from outside of it. So this new regime of liberalized economies and capital flows. It has one big obstacle and that is government corruption now of course as we know. The reason that the west isn't corrupt is because the actual corruption is just legalized. We have we've settled. We've tamed the corruption that we used to have in the 19th century and the thing is is that money over time will can't uh will t team corruption because people will grow up benefiting from a system and therefore have faith in it and and desire to see perpetuated which they understand is undermined by by corruption corrupt individuals act because they have no faith. The system is going to benefit them which is why in emerging democracies uh and in in uh crisis-ridden economies corruption is endemic because there's no reason to trust the system at all uh so by these guys own lights. None of these systems would actually give the sort of broad-based the broad-based prosperity that they were promising if people were corrupt. But the thing is the only people who are going to go along with gutting their country's economies and destroying every mechanism for democratic accountability of the economy are going to be uh motivated by money.

What else is going to motivate them. They don't have a religious faith. In this. They haven't been conditioned in it in the soviet when when the soviet union fell the us had this remit we're going to create a non-corrupt government that is going to dismantle all uh uh public ownership and and watch the uh what standard of living of their fellow citizens collapse down a  urges who is going to do that out of out of uh nobility of the heart yeah. A few like totally brainwashed randy and ideologues but most people are only going to do it if it benefits them in the very near term because they know that they're  country that us uh the struggling and uh post-communist and and uh post-colonial that had to accept these structural adjustments. The only people agreeing to do it in these countries are  crooks and then oh no there's no broad-based demand. There's no broad-based prosperity of course. You know that the liberals will talk about uh reducing poverty uh in the in the 20th century all in china on the last 30 years nowhere else little bit but mostly stagnant if not declining everywhere else oh that's because of corruption. We didn't want that but corrupt and corrupt officials are the only ones are going to carry out your policy. So there's this fake charade of imposing anti-corruption measures on these countries. But that's just to get pr to reassure the markets to pat them on the back and say your money's safe there. But because you know corrupt people are at the end of the day uh dick uh disciplined by the dollar disciplined by the deepest pocket.

There's no worry that they're going to go against the greater interest of capitalism and the us actually used anti-corruption as uh an excuse for why they did not offer a bailout to russia when they had a uh economic crisis in the late 90s. Uh along with a bunch of other countries and we'll talk in the next chapter talks about it and we'll end talking about russia uh and why they were different than all the other. Uh big countries big crisis countries that got hit in the 90s by financial panics. But the stated argument was you're not doing enough anti-corruption which is hilarious. The only person who would have done what yeltsin did sell his country down the river for global capitalism that he could not have believed in is because he he's a  drum drunk scumbag because he's a pirate that's the only person you're going to get to do that job poor. Gorbachev pure believer. Gorbachev had to go down the chute he wouldn't have been corrupt but to tough  door because he couldn't recognize the moment. You either had to fight that thing or you had to submit to it and the only ones fighting were the delusional communists who got shelled out of the duma by uh by yeltsin in his coup and everybody that he got on his side both in the coup and then in the 96 reelection was bought and paid for by us dollars and that's why starting in the late 90s. Russia drifts out of the american orbit because it's just not working the the the benefits aren't accruing the capitalism uh to for its perpetuation in the country. So it becomes a gangster state ruled over by an oligarchy because those are the only people who give a  what is this person doing someone's having a stroke in the stream can you get rid of.


That person can you can you delete. These okay was that uh was that portuguese look like it was portuguese. But I don't know okay so chapter 10 new imperial challenge managing crisis. As we said they got out of the regulating game. They got out of the crisis aversion gang. Now they're firefighters global capital systems. Uh central bank's treasury departments exist to pump in liquidity after a crash prop. Back things up keep the  drunk staggering around so that you can keep charging his credit card because this is crisis mode capitalism. That's all we have left this crisis because we've jettisoned any uh democratic accountability control direction uh intervention in this thing so that means it's it's straight into the side of the wall at 100 miles an hour so as I said what this we have this new paradigm. Uh disaster capitalism for all uh the system depends on overheating. Then you have this moment to uh intervene from the point of view of you know state policy liquidity but then with liquidity comes uh conditions further liberalizations further deregulations. Further financialization of the economy necessary now if you want to get the money and of course what's perverse about this all the crisis. I'm talking about now and all the crisis that have been in the 20th 21st century since we talked about them as bailouts and in of of these countries right like we're going to talk about uh the bailout of mexico in 94 and then the asian crisis none of that and then but then going into the 20th century 21st century the pigs. None of those bailouts were to the people of those countries. The money did not go into uh the budgets. The money went to their creditors. The money just went to banks all they did was reduce what they owed on. A ledger did nothing to actually stimulate the economy at a demand level which is why they've languished and they continue to languish the keynesian response. Hey demand side stimulus is now off the table because we have too much we have to you can print tons of money.

The mmts are. Right about that but where it goes is politically determined and it can only go up. It can only go to the top. It can only go to in the form of liquidity at the top to the finance system. It cannot go everywhere so in the 90s uh that meant that there are 72 crises significant financial crisis in low and middle-income countries which is just blowing the doors off of any of any of the the decades after world war. Ii. Uh and this and these were all caused by the these busts were all caused by first booms and those booms came in the form of u.s. Uh direct private investment to the developed world that went from 170 billion dollars in a year in the late 80s. Early 90s to 1.3 trillion dollars a year uh in the night in the mid 90s and that was all because uh after taming inflation in the 80s. Uh interest rates in the us were now much lower which sent money out of the country looking for better return and these developing countries with their new. Uh their new trade bilateral trade treaties with america. Their new regulatory uh regimes their new constraints on capital flight or capital control. They're all very appealing uh places to invest but because this is you know this is not the sort of grassroots demand stimulation that like builds sustained economic activity uh it all goes into a series of bubbles and then those bubbles end up popping. When inevitably something puts a kink in the hose of funding and in the form of mexican what happens in mexico which is the poster child for structural adjustment. In the 80s. They do everything they're like thank you sir may I have another and that's because of the pri. It's because after the mexican revolution. This like clientist single party state emerged that got rid of the fear of dictatorship that had dominated mexican politics in the night in the 19th century by replacing it with this uh this corporatist model. So this client this client structure is very happy to get u.s. Markets get uh.

U.s funding uh get us investment and so it does everything it's asked of it and everybody is just pop patented said saying look at mexico and then they sign nafta look at mexico. They're being so good but in the 90s but in 94 uh in uh interest rates go up a little bit and the money spigot goes the other direction and the whole thing  collapses and there's a 30 billion hole thrown in the mexican uh into the peso. As as the pesos flee the country uh and this triggers a treasury and fed bailout of mexico 30 billion as I said which again not going to mexicans going to their banks. The creditors that supposedly are taking a risk that is what justifies their interest and mexico. Uh of course ascends to even more structural adjustment in uh exchange for this money which sees a significant destruction of the lower classes of mexican society. A huge move with this with nafta leads to essentially the annihilation of the agricultural economy in rural mexico and takes millions of farmers off the land to find jobs in factories in mexico or in the united are or to work in the united states. Uh of course you know this is the context that's always forgotten when talking about immigration that like this is not just a bunch of people making independent decisions. This is the result of and this is an or they're moral like oh they're breaking the law they're bad people uh. It is uh. It is just a title uh flow caused by uh this massive restructuring of the mexican state that cut subsidy uh cut direct uh employment uh and also brought in uh highly subsidized american agricultural products to destroy the margins of independent farmers but growth economic growth in mexico. Up up up nafta boosts exports so it's a success it worked. The next big crisis is uh in asia so in the early 90s people are saying look at mexico they're doing great.

They also you see people talking about the asian tigers. These economies in uh in mexi in asia vaguely kind of racist thing to say you know hey look at those oh. Those asian economies. They're all like tigers and it's south korea thailand and indonesia and what's happening here is. It's a similar relationship to japan. These countries have a similar economic relationship to japan. As mexico does the united states you've got a similar situation. Low interest rates in japan cheap yen that means easy credit to loan for to uh to high margin speculative investments in specifically thailand but also uh to a lesser extent south korea and and in indonesia. Uh and then but of course again creates a bunch of uh speculative bubbles including in thailand a huge real estate bubble where the army officers who basically run the economy there uh get in bed with japanese. Uh investors to just build a bunch of housing uh and hotels and stuff and then all that has to happen is japan makes noises about raising their uh interest rate and the pot. It starts a chain reaction that goes through all through asia and the u.s. Essentially subornes japan into playing the same role with those as with thailand as we played with mexico and they didn't want to do it uh. But we said no like this is how this works you are our main client here in east asia have been since the war. You are carry out our remit here which means you're. You have a role as a node with a nut with a role related to these other nodes so japan and the imf uh.

They do a bailout of thailand once again bailing out the the just giving money to the banks that loaned it to them uh and in exchange for structural adjustment uh in indonesia suharto who had been put in power largely by the us in the 60s to stop indonesia from going communist killed a million people in the process. The success story of the cold war people talk a lot about guatemala and iran those were all coos up. Those were all you know ku's in more sense than one for the cia. But indonesia is their crowning jewel um but you know live by the sword die by the sword. Like he was a u.s puppet his entire career. That's who he depended on and uh when the tide turned we let him hang out to dry and let him get overthrown and imposed an imf structural adjustment that devastated the indonesian economy. Very similar thing happened with uh in the congo zaire as it used to be called with uh mabutu who we put in there to uh neutralize lumumba and who by the 90s had been uh totally delegitimized uh the economic conditions and uh with the war in rwanda. Next door failed to stabilize them and we we we sent them packing and of course when we send. These guys packing marcos same thing happened in the 80s we all we pat ourselves on the back that like yeah we're stopping we're getting rid of dictatorship when we're just.

We're firing uh. We're firing an associate who's not working out now. Korea has another has also has a big crisis. What's interesting there is that you know even though the korean working class is as beaten down as any of those uh any of any in your in asia. After world war. Ii you know korea was ruled by a a right-wing dictatorship during most of the post-war period that only recently the 80s got in democracy quote unquote uh was still able to carry off a huge general strike. Uh. Obviously you know not one not the big strike that overthrows the state but something that certainly rocked people in korea and seriously uh spooked potential investors uh in korea who were terrified. Now that the south korean government was going to come out of control especially when a left-wing activist sort of uh tangentially associated with the strike was elected president uh and what happens is the same thing we've seen before uh some uh with meter on guy gets in mandated. Sure is the same thing gets in mandated the people to stand up to capitalism gets. The talk understands the real consequences of going against the demands of the imf and the u.s government what that would mean for their economy what that would mean for their prospects their democratic prospects and uh they disciplined their working class. They they accepted a huge job losses. They cut their already threadbare safety net because there was no alternative. Now this is this the asian market crisis triggers a big crisis in russia and here the money stops flowing.


Here there is no uh bailout essentially because russia wouldn't play along with america's demands because they didn't have to because they actually had independent power in the form of their vast nuclear arsenal uh and that meant that russia defaulted on their on their debt and that really is 98 when you see the breach because russia is is brought in as like a corrupt client state with yeltsin uh but then by 98 when putin's getting in there the cracks are appearing and putin's gonna take the us take russia out of the u.s orbit because at that point he and the other uh people in like positions of power in russia understood that subordinating themselves fully to the dictates of american capitalism would lead to the same sort of uh subservient status that all these other countries had and they didn't have to accept it. They had an alternative with all their gas and oil and their  missiles. They could take their own path and they have it ever since and we have been punishing them ever since we've been expanding nato. Like crazy. We you know did brinksmanship. We got the war we wanted in ukraine. We're hoping in the long term to finish the job of buck breaking russia and they're resisting but of course you know there's people who want to make them hinder heroes for that. But it is just this sclerotic corrupt national bourgeois trying to maintain their power their narrow control. It is not any kind of resistance to regimes of domination.

It is simply a uh a decentralized one that they want to maintain control over rather than be turned into total handmaidens of washington. So there's two sides to this new reg quote unquote regulatory regime uh and it's uh these bailouts. This guarantee that if the ship goes hits the fan there will be a spigot of money to keep liquidity going but that has to be matched with a new legal regime that accelerates speculation and encourages monopoly capital formation because again growth now is determined and by speculation. If you do not have maximum accelerating speculation. You don't have an economy. You don't have capital circulation and of course. That's incredibly destabilizing which is why the bailouts are there so everybody can keep playing the game and not have to worry that they're going to go off a cliff because the the daddy fed will be there to protect them in their ever everlasting arms and part of that means the final end to glass-steagall. Any sort of uh partition between commercial banking and investment banking everybody gets to invest everybody gets to uh have their securities.

Everybody gets to have derivatives. It's a derivative revolution. They call it you get a derivative. You get a derivative. You get a derivative more derivatives. We make the more we can circulate the uh capital. The more we can uh compensate for the decline in actual productivity of the economy. The real one that this is all supposed to be based on and part of this derivatives.

Revolution is this amazing third way clinton triangulation that you gotta actually admire for how elegant. It is so clinton has you know this remit with african-americans and minorities as part of the democratic coalition he wants to. They do have like an interest a actual like narrow political interest in seeing them advanced so that they'll vote for him uh and that means making uh home ownership accessible to people who were denied a chance to get in on the lottery of the gi bill in the post-war. Uh cheap financing direct financing now there's no more gi bill. There's none of that that's all that's all an extinct political economy but what we can do is financialize mortgages to facilitate lending. If you allow the creation of these mortgage securities. You minimize the risk of lending money to any specific uh person which means people who systemically and structurally have less wealth because they were denied. Access to wealth.

Can now have access to credit and for people who already have home. They find that thanks to the mortgage interest rate deduction that allows you to deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage not the actual mortgage but the interest from your from your taxes. It allows you to uh borrow money against your home's equity at a lower rate than is posted basically a special subsidized cheap rate and then that stimulates consumer spending you know uh and compensates for the lack of wage increases because remember wages stop rising in 1980 basically but people have to spend more over time and so cheap credit for mortgages subsidized by the by this tax code allows for access to the credit that will allow people to do that spending and of course because they're borrowing it. It means that they are not free that they're digging their own  grave. They're they're paying for their own prison but there is no alternative if you can only express yourself if you can only express your identity and your uh spiritual self-conception through consumption. Then you have to consume and honestly the most horrifying thing in this chapter and this is really like a this is a love crafty and realization uh so he they talk at the end of this chapter about brixley bourne anybody who watched like any of the frontline shows about the uh about the crash.


In 2008. I think she was in one of the alex gibney movies too. She was the cassandra uh who was uh in the clinton administration. The regulator who was saying like if we stop regulating this stuff it will blow up she was telling everybody that uh and larry summers and those guys they all patted her head and told her to go away and you know it was. Sexism played a role of course uh and they were all bought and paid for wall street stooges but once again just like with the afrikaners negotiating the end of apartheid. They had an i.

They had a story to tell themselves that made uh getting rid of regulation even knowing that it's going to cause a crisis as the smart and only and correct and adult move because this new economic paradigm. This financialized economy requires maximum flow which means the lightest amount of friction in transactions because again we're talking about it. That's the only way to keep it to keep the acceleration of capital is to have people trading things slicing things into smaller smaller tranches and then selling them to each other more and more times and every regulation. Every intervention slows down those transactions. So if you were to actually enforce a regulatory oversight to prevent a crash you will cause one. It's better to lean back and let it come naturally.

This appeal to a fantasy notion of a of a true natural uh market that reveals the invisible hand of god. That's that's the invisible hand of the market. It's whose hand is that it's god's and this is where once again we get to the theological basis for this stuff. These are all these are all theologies and it's like that's not that's why it's been all to even say it to say. Something is a theology of course.

It is all this is an extension and a trans in a materialization of of theology. The question is which theology are we gonna  live by the one where our separation is eternal and existential. The one where we are hostage to a idiot psychotic god or the one where we are fundamentally connected and that and through connection can come to mutual understanding sufficient to direct our actions and I think the evidence is we do have that capacity but that capacity obviates the necessity for class rule in a way that our rulers will simply and not allow to happen. I really do think that you need hell like hell exists as a concept to justify class rule. The notion that some are damned and some are saved that there is like some eternal place of torment or or reward that that that raises the stakes right of life so dramatically that it necessitates structures to enforce codes of behavior and ideas because if you don't you will lose people but what if there's nothing to lose not that there is no heaven not that there is no hell but that we are all saved by virtue of being human. If that's true. Then we can make mistakes and we don't have to rely on alienated institutions to enforce orthodoxy of any kind but again that has to come from outside. No system is going to come to it the realization.

Like all those good keynesianisms keynesians in the 60s and 70s they didn't say oh. I guess we have to go to war with capitalism. Now we thought we could have reform but it turns out we have to go to war. No. They submitted because they wanted to think they were good people. They wanted to think they were moral and were trying to lead people towards some sort of post-scarcity promised land but that was all a delusion that was all self-talk. They were the handmaidens of capitalism. The entire time and of course. The irony is that this insistence on uh you know patrolling hell creating creating a a a system that uh you know separates the safe from the damned rewards. The saved and punishes the damned which is what we imagine. We're creating with our economic systems. Whether we're liberals or democrats oh what's actually happening you're literally turning earth into hell. Earth is turning into a I i hate to use the word but god damn it. It's one of the best terms coined in the 21st century a geo hell and and anyone honestly who cares if the book is gibberish. If anyone knows about geohell uh the book is gibberish who cares book schmuck being able to uh encapsulate a concept that uh pithily is that's a real that's a real uh achievement and I salute salute but yeah we're turning earth into hell in our pursuit of heaven what a joke what a cosmic joke and a cosmic shame hmm. That's a cosmic shame lots of cosmic shame. That's a cosmic shame folks cosmic shame isn't it. I should rename this that ah never mind all right see you guys so next week don't know what date yet. But next week we'll do uh part 11 or I'm sorry part. Six part six the global capitalist millennium yeah that's right welcome to them the willingness the 21st century where it gets real hairy real quick and where every fairy tale. These people told themselves throughout the 90s gets woken up from and then new and even more fantastical uh vehicles for delusion are forged by.
