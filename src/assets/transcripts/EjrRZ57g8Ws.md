They blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts. They never drank water but whiskey by pints and the shantytowns rang with their songs and their fights navigator navigator rise up and be strong. The morning is here and there's work to be done get your pick and your shovel and them all dynamite where to shift a few tons of this earthly delight yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight. They died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where save the brass in the pocket of the entrepreneur by roadsides and rock blasts. They got buried so deep but if death if not life they'll have peace while they sleep navigator navigator rise up and be strong. The morning is here and there's work to be done take your ticket your shovel and them all dynamite where to shift. A few tons of this earthly delight yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight. A mark on this land is still seen and still laid a way for a commerce. Her vast fortunes were made some loyal to an empire where the sun never set which is now deep in darkness but the railway's there yet navigator navigator rise up and be strong. The morning is here and there's work to be done take your pick and your shovel and then all dynamite we're to shift a few tons of this earthly delight yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight.

One of my favorite songs navigator as covered by the pogues. That's not a poke's original. Like the band says band the band played well sing matilda. Also a cover two of their best songs were covers but that it just shows the breath of your musicality in a way that you can get a you can make the definitive cup version of something somebody asked if panda express is good and you know what I wouldn't have been qualified to answer that until a couple weeks ago. I just the last couple weeks I found myself by happenstance going into panda expresses not in malls which I honestly before this month didn't think was a thing. I thought panda express was exclusively available in malls that there weren't any standalones and now two times.

In the last month. I've found myself in a situation where I needed to eat something on the run and I'm in a car and oh there's panda express and I've gone twice now. I've had the. I had the the beijing beef. One time the bowl and the other time I had um. I think the garlic pepper chicken and I have to say pretty good and I realize at least this is my theory. I don't know if it's true that the reason that um panda express now. I really feel like this is new now. Has these standalone locations because I swear to god. I swear to god. I never saw panda express outside of a mall before and since. I don't go to malls as habit as a matter of course. I kind of thought well. I'm never going to have panda express again and then boom. They're out there and my theory about it.

This might it's totally made up by me. Theoretical style is that it is the market responding to the creation of the chipotle level of like ethnic food. Delivery like chipotle invented a new way to get a ethnic ethnic cuisine right in a way that was like rationalized and standardized and homogenized for a suburban palette that had existed at the end of fast food like taco bell. But it had not existed at the level of the the attainable like up market faster food. The the area for the more well-heeled among the the middle class who buys things and goes to make restaurants that you can that are a sufficient number to make a business to make to make an industry they created. They found this sector of people with a little more money in their hands and yes. Subway was the first of this but it was really an outlier and really ahead of its time. It was and also you know. The sub is sort of a different thing. You know they kind of invented something there but so chipotle is this new type of consumer experience for the people who want to gesture towards like urban sophistication that higher price-pointed food offerings represent but live in the context of you know economically and geographically in like a suburban milieu attainable urbanity attainable bohemianism and that created a new market really because people found out oh there's money here and so now you have a bunch of attempts to do that for different foods. Pizza has two pie ology and blaze which I believe is owned by chipotle.

It's like a play for a new sector and that is hey what if you can do that with pizza what if you can make pizza bespoke enough to transcend like a hot and ready or a a day class say five dollar hot ready from little caesars but is it like a brick mortar neapolitan place that's more expensive. It's the new era and so that's gonna come for every type of food and maybe panda express saw the spot and went for it. Sort of the way that blockbuster could have been could have evolved into the streaming platform that we all use for movies. But they up like they had the slot and there was even the awareness that it was a reality and there was a desire within the company to move in that direction but they were two more poorly managed to handle it and so pan express is sort of does the anti-blockbuster and slides in there hey panda express here. It is machine level chinese food but presented and the thing is. It is presented like it wasn't. In the this is a rebrand all along you have to remember this because the original panda express play really was taco bell for mexican. For us chinese food.

It was de clase but I tell you guys these two ones I've gone to they are chipotle to the letter to level. They're absolutely trying to be that and It's it's tasty. It's not bad but again. I just made that up. I have no idea. So you're saying that these are not new and it's always been that way. I guess that's just the spot that panda express has been sitting in. It's been in the cut waiting to to come to life sounded. It was fine. It is it's about as good as that level of thing so that is to say pan express is not bad. The beijing beef was pretty good. I gotta say you can build a bowl with the different type of things. They have like six different versions and you can go with low main or fried rice as a base. So yeah pan express is fine. It's like chipotle yeah. Chipotle is not great. If there are better options you should take them but if you want a burrito and you're like getting gas you know or doing errands.

You could do worse. That's for sure look at all. Those emotes there are no bodegas. In la. There are seven elevens and I gotta say. I'm with matt burning on this. 7-eleven is superior to the bodega in every way. It is the highest level of bodega. Yes I do have wisconsinite taste. I always have I like ketchup I like ketchup on I like ketchup on mac and cheese like a canadian. I'll admit it yes. There is no chumped cheese at 7-eleven but they do have a lot of other great options. They've got decent pizza little thin slice or the thin crust. They've got those little kind of egg rolls with the exotic flavors in them and they got slushies whereas what does a bodega have chopped cheese and the dustiest sandwiches you've ever had yes. Bodegas have atmosphere and they better because that's what you're paying for living in a city with bodegas. That's how that's that's what makes it. All worthwhile is that is that exotic touch to make you feel sophisticated. That is that's that's the value you get from the bodega experience. The writing is coming pretty well. The interviews that are going to form the basis of the book have been completed and now I'm going to edit them shape. The language add stuff and turn it into something legible. So that's the the final sort of writing by editing process is coming up and I'm excited.

You also get a lot of convenience that way with the bodegas because if you live in new york you're never more than about a block away from a bodega in most neighborhoods so that's not necessarily true of 7's 11 in other parts of the country because you know they can only compete against each other. So much I went to a quick trip when I was in wisconsin visiting my parents and I've got to say they have definitely risen to the challenge of the 7-eleven food experience because they don't just have the the case of summer sausage and cheese curds that they used to have now they've got a whole prepared meal section with their own pizza and their own little nuggets and hot dogs and all prepared and arranged very much like a 7-eleven. Apparently those those upgrades were very expensive for 7-eleven owner operators because it operates on a franchise model but 7-eleven has this contract where their they dictate to their franchisee. What they have to keep in their store to say just keep their license as a 7-eleven so they have to say like to be in a 7-eleven. You have to provide x y and z like as part of your your arrangement and now their contracts are requiring them to keep these food items in there even though it's very expensive to maintain a a essentially restaurant inside something that's supposed to be a convenience store and so it's actually a loss for a lot of these franchisees.

But they have to pay that basically to keep the franchise and so it's led to this really grim and and honestly illustrative phenomenon where the mostly immigrant owners of sevens 11 who were brought into like their franchise relationship by a concerted effort by 7-eleven to reach out to the south indian community south asian community specifically and say hey you want to come to this country. Here's an opportunity you don't have to worry about if your engineering degree is going to be able to get you a a similar job to that in the united states. You know you don't have to worry about maybe having to drive a cab if you could own your own business and there's like there's networks that created this and now they're imposing all these requirements on the 7-elevens that are making it making the margins so thin for the operators. I mean while 7-eleven is just getting. The franchise fees you know and getting the profits.

 is that they're essentially working for like 20 grand a year like they have been fully proletarianized and they're hyper exploiting their own time too. They've been even though they're they're members of the petty bourgeois like they are the yeoman holdout because of their position. Their vulnerable position as immigrants largely like 7-eleven would if they picked up a fuss about this stuff 7-eleven six ice on them like they literally collaborate with the state to bring bargaining power away from these owner operators so now quick trip is becoming like that this. This local mainstay is becoming like that you know it's It shows that everything every every sort of social construction short of socialism that you try to build to damn up the the power of capital to just proletarianize everybody including people who are who hold a stake in capitalism like the petty bourgeois that you could steamroll them because there's nothing they could build that can that can resist it. So we had this cr. American idea of the yeoman small holder first of land then of some sort of business as a bulwark against the the condition of proletarian which is what you're trying to avoid and if you think a system will help you avoid proletarianization you will engage with it enthusiastically but then that relationship changes as the pressure of capital accumulates the the drop of profit. The rise of the liquidation of all classes save owner and provider of labor and that means that a lot of people in that middle sector are not going to be brought up and bought into this new ruling power.

They're going to fall out of it. They're going to fall out of the middle section into proletarianization and that is the agonized position of the american middle class that makes up whatever kind of reactionary formation around trump. You want to talk about and it is a resistance of proletarization by this middle strata of people who are participators and beneficiaries of the amer of the american capitalist order and so what looked like looks like a battle between like some left and right between some working class and and the ruling class is really just this. This cultural battle waged between peoples on different sides of this equation as the thing falls apart so you've got this. The last remaining believers in capitalism right are your liberal media class and the media people that they create and the culture that they create. Those are the last people who really believe in capitalism because they believe that even under fully fully proletarianized hyper capitalism that they will be on the winning end of it that they will have to reach the position within capitalism well.

They will be a a rentier and not a laborer a eloy not a morlock and that's because they believe at a level of a deep existential conviction that their talents because these are the last meritocrats that their talents will earn them a spot away from the conditions of exploitation that make up being a proletarian or a member of the reserve army of labor. The totally destroyed and cast down a lumpin that is created inevitably by this system. There's no guarantee that you're not even gonna just you're not you're that you're even gonna be able to work with your hands or work or exploit your time. You might not be given any reason to exist in this system and have to scrounge for yourself in what are essentially post-apocalyptic conditions like when we talk about the capitalism being unevenly distributed. So is the apocalypse the apocalypse as we imagine it in our mind post-nuclear apocalypse. The the global warming idea of apocalypse that it came after the cold war vision of ecstatic extinguishment was gone that vision exists for those who are no longer of use to capitalism and who cannot sell their labor in the global south. But in the in this city a block from where I stand the apocalypse is here for those who have reached that condition within capitalism and we've reached a point where the war the culture battle is between those people who think that when that time comes they will be inside the house not outside and for our lumpin bourgeois that make up the trump base. The the the heronvolk democratic the fascist whatever you want to call it base of populist nationalism. Those people believe that when the time comes given the current arrangement of capitalism they will in fact be consumed and extruded and cast out into the apocalypse. A post-industrial post a post-industrial world of total pollution scarcity and breakdown of basic protections of law and contract and on the other side of that.

The the good guys from a cultural perspective. Because they uphold pluralism. They uphold the notions of like universal humanity that we need to survive as a species. They have that going for them but it is on top of a belief that these things can only be advanced by capitalism. An embedded understanding that only capitalism can sustain this and so that means that on the other side of that you have the people the meritocrats in addition to the people who are just so wealthy that they know that they already own. They already own the means of production. It doesn't matter it's in their hip pocket. This is all just a game to them but like that tenuous class the academic elite. The media class the people who make up the conversation that we're all participating in and that makes up our understanding of the. Like the terrain of the country we live in because we don't know what's going on in the country. We don't know what's going on in the world. We echolocate through an engagement with the culture that is made by this class of people.

The last believers in capitalism because they think that their talents either their labor talents or if they've deluded themselves into thinking that they're part of a a political project that will bring about peaceful socialism from within capitalism. Those because you can't discount that there are plenty of totally earnest comrades who adhere to capitalism at a subconscious level at a faith level because they think not that oh it doesn't matter I'll be a winner. I'll be. I'll be a holder of capital. They think no my political project that I'm going to be part of is going to eventually overtake capitalism and so everyone will be in the tent and so my participation in capitalism in the here and now is justified and those those people are battling on a cultural firmament. But at the basic the the machine is operating independently of the political engagement because we have detached from class because our politics is purely a representation of our understanding of the world which is the simulacrum which is the this cultural fake world the the world where where the the destiny of the nation is on whether or not we accept critical race theory whether or not that is going to determine whether capitalism lives or dies. It does not it is a it is a delusional participation. It is a it is a performance by a class of people who think that they're going to be okay one way or the other and so they can articulate a politics that is based on capitalism and is assumes without any metaphysical question that it cannot be overtaken and that is why the politics as we currently have.

It is sterile and doomed why it doesn't matter whether if they ban crt from schools or if they if they ban any kind of ableism in any entertainment and make critical like you can ban critical race theory in schools but that will only make critical race theory mandatory in the culture. So there's no way anyone can win this battle because things are going to keep getting worse and at the level of law. The places where republicans rule are going to use the law to stamp out the ability to express left-wing political ideals critical race racial consciousness that can transcend the. Racial apartheid structure of american social life you that you will somehow stop the drift of culture because that's what you're actually participating in towards The sort of mongrelized culture you're afraid of guess what you're only making it inevitable because if you make crt illegal in schools you will make it mandatory in cultural production.

Now they're not going to use laws to make it mandatory. They're just going to use the market in the form of what people will pay for what media platforms will pay to have produced that is gonna that market that invisible hand is gonna determine. The actual market is going to determine that you cannot get anything made or consumed widely within the culture unless it fully makes if it makes race and racism the central and foundational message purpose for being of it forget art. There is no aesthetic question. Here we are only going to ask the question of does. This perform a political act of being anti-racist and those dynamics will inflame each other and ratchet each other up and drive us towards civil conflict. But the engine of that will be a immiserating social context of hyper capitalism overtaking everything and casting everyone out of any position of safety into full precarity. But that's not going to be in that's not going to be addressed by any of these either cultural or political fights because they're independent of capitalism who all right so this was supposed to be the episode where I talked about red plenty or no red planet we should talk about that book actually. It's fascinating francis spafford.

It's a historical novel about the soviet attempt to solve the riddle of price point of the price mechanism how to reproduce technologically the um the price signal. That was the that was what the soviets actually tried to do under khrushchev and president. They tried to create a command consumer economy by and having the efficiency of the market reproduced cybernetically and that is the challenge of socialism that is the fundamental challenge of socialism because when you talk about the about the working class seizing control of capitalism at a point when its conditions of capital accumulation have created the necessary technological capacity to distribute labor outputs rationally and not through the market and you can say that one of the reasons the soviet union failed is because we hadn't reached that point yet a point that marx was probably too optimistic. In his own understanding. He underestimated the degree to which technology could put off the end of capitalism. The technology could smooth things out socially enough to allow capitalism to sustain itself to buy off revolution.

Essentially he underestimated his capacity to do that that's not his fault that is something he could not have known that is one of those unknown knowns that that that's the ignorance that you like have to revolve around. It's the. It's a black hole at the center of the universe of our understanding of the world is this unknowable future and that's what every one of our understandings is built on and so marx built this perfect. I think framework for understanding capitalism is as in as an economy and as a politics as a culture as an as a reality but yeah as with anything you can either know momentum or speed. You can't know both. There is a great unknown known and for marx. It was technology and the technological capacity to create to ease to distribute rationally resources by which I mean to keep the host alive and not kill it. Rational distribution and rational distribution happened at the center of capitalism because of imperialism because the hyper exploitation of the global south allowed for a rational distribution of resources at the center of production where capitalism was most vulnerable away from crisis and that was buying off the working class that is why america became the world headquarters of capitalism. It's why the german revolutions of 1918 and 1920 failed because at the center of capitalism rational distribution had been culturally facilitated and it spreads through the system but at the level of the hyper-exploited endpoint of capital accumulation. The colonies you have just pure savagery. You have you have you have no room for a social heart. To beat you have the cold steel you have the whip of the slave owner. You have this the sneer of cold command of the slave owning aristocracy the old junkers and that meant that when the great crisis of capitalism finally came in the early 20th century the capitalism marx had been predicting and was correct in his understanding of about when it would happen. The technology had existed long enough to distribute rationally at the center of capitalism sufficient adherence to capitalism among the working class that there was at the time of crisis.

[29:58](https://youtu.be/EjrRZ57g8Ws?t=29m58s)

There was no one there to fight when the real moment came because you can forgive the social democrats in germany for example for voting for war credits because they assume like everybody that it world war one would be like every previous european war since the end of the napoleonic era since the council of since the the the council of vienna short one season long affairs bloody nose and a treaty they were all assuming that they shouldn't if that was insane but it was underlining their logic because you go by when you're trying to make a decision you go by what had happened in the past. That's one of the fundamental things that's going to doom us as a species so you can forgive them for that public opinion was patriotic even among workers because the system had been rewarding them it had been giving them better lives. It had been giving them political control. It had been distributing the the the surplus of capitalism rationally and away from just the market hoovering it up towards in profits towards ownership and that meant that sure they voted for war credits but then in 1918 after four years of the most horrifying war. Anyone had seen since the 30 years war but on a mechanical scale of death that was unprecedented in the in the in the folk lives of these people a a technologically aided massacre of unprecedented proportions that leaves the the cream of the german working class.

The french working class the british working class dead in in a field at each other's hands. The working class of europe had committed suicide at the behest of their rulers but in that moment the working class of the the the remainder of the working class of europe turned towards their leaders turned to upward and said holy. How did you let this happen and that crisis came all across europe. But the only place that it broke towards revolution was the place where the working class was the smallest and where the spoils of capitalism had been distributed least rationally towards the maintenance of some sort of thriving middle middle section and so it snapped the system snapped in half and and the incohate working masses of the of the of the russian cities were able to seize power now if that had been the extent of it if they'd known that it'd been the extent of it. There's a real question of whether they would the bolsheviks would have gone on and carried out the revolution because an isolated russian revolution was going to die every single person among the leadership of the bolshevik party and I would say the majority of the people at the leadership levels within the soviets. Themselves among the workers and sailors and and soldiers was that they were going to spark a world revolution. The questions of the soviet union that left all the blood on the hands of socialism and tarnished marxism were all made in the context of what do.

We do now you could argue. They made the wrong call you could argue that the one guy who knew what to do was bakarin who said this has failed that means that we have to step back and let the bourgeois do the job of building capitalism to the sufficient point that we can seize it because we're not there. Yet we have to admit that climb down buy off the peasants buy them off create a more rational distribution of resources through central planning but through through like a collaborative effort of a of a party that comes from the working class but introduce capitalism and by buy us back into the system as it exists so that the moment of crisis can come and we'll be better prepared for it instead of yoking ourselves to a monstrous project of hyper exploiting the the The peasant class turning it into a proletariat at the cost of millions of lives which is what happens everywhere that capitalism is introduced but doing it under communist auspices wouldn't that be worth doing and they would say though maybe now it is if they if they ask themselves honestly they might have said that wouldn't be worth it. But they made the choice that they made and we all had to fight the fight. We had the war with the armies we had. But the reason they got to that point is because they believed they were going to be a world revolution and there was god damn it. There was going to be one in some universe. There was one when the keel mutineers refused to let the baltic fleet out in a suicide mission to to be destroyed in honorable combat by the british navy. Doing a a massive sepuku they didn't want to do it because it wasn't their war and it started a a revolution that if it had been yoked to the project in russia could have created a a genuine conflict at a point of of fluidity with a capitalism that might have been disorganized enough and weakened enough to be challenged by it and why didn't it happen because in germany because that's one of the places that capitalism had developed first.

It's it's it's its flesh was most robust. It its tendrils into the working class were the strongest and that meant when the moment came the majority of the german social democratic party. Both rank and file but definitely among the union and political leadership of the of the of the party itself were aligned with capitalism at a material level because it had benefited them and so the fry core the the brain fried. Death. Worshipping psychos who had been turned into orcs essentially by contact with industrial warfare were organized and let loose by the social democrats to stamp down the world revolution which was what anybody with eyes could see should have. Known was the moment the apocalyptic moment that marxism was premised upon and so the soviets challenged that it failed to meet after the end of the the world war after we failed to turn the world war into a class war after we offered a after they offered a truce with the united states and allowed them to build a world economic structure that they would be excluded from where the u.s. Dollar would be the reserve currency of earth where they would have to participate in capitalism in extraction of surplus value for the market in order to sustain themselves in the state competition system that they had agreed to after world war ii instead of extending the war into a new phase which you could argue is.

Stalin's greatest crime is in that moment turning towards cowardly self-preservation and you could say he might have lost but we lost anyway here's the important thing to note. We lost anyway and of course you can't blame these people for not having this the knowledge to know that at the time they did what they did because they didn't know but we have to recognize it. Now. That is the whole point of history is to recognize in the now where our opportunities lie so that we don't let that happen to us because if stalin had built up that industrial behemoth turned that working turns the the clay that the potato sack of the russian peasantry into the beautiful. Twice baked potatoes of of the five-year plan in industrial russia allied with workers. Movements all throughout the world that were essentially appendages of them at that point and putting down the fascist beast in a climate before the before the before the creation of um like the the a bomb on a massive scale would have fully tipped the balance. Maybe you could fight a war with capitalism and win but if you don't fight it my god. What was it all for it was to save your ass disgusting honestly disgusting stalin's greatest crime because all the other ones would have been redeemed if he'd made the right choice in that moment.

The choice that tito wanted to make which is the basis of tito's split with the warsaw. Pact is that when the um when the civil war in greece broke out and there was a real contest for power between the the greek partisan communists and the reactionary monarchists backed by the british stalin decided to trade greece for the iron curtain sell out. The greek. Communists and tito said if you do that then this is all for nothing because we will not be able to contest capitalism in the context of the market. On their terms they will eat us. They will dissolve us and stalin because he was scared said we're done and of course you could say but they would have lost anyway you have to.

[40:22](https://youtu.be/EjrRZ57g8Ws?t=40m22s)

The blood on your hands has to compel you to something beyond your own disgusting self-preservation but anyway people are people and the system of a bolshevik party in power absent. A world revolution was going to mean stalin was gonna. A figure like stalin was was guaranteed to take power and by that I mean is the bolshevik party was a vanguard illegal party and this is the important part. It was an illegal party that operated through the vast majority of its time as an illegal entity in russia where its leadership was largely exiled at either exiled internally to towns in siberia where they frequently escaped from or in exile in western capitals where its activities within russia were banned. Its newspapers were banned. It operated as a criminal enterprise so that it could be at the moment seize power and they did it and they did it on the right context and I'll tell you right now.

Lenin is the great genius of all time because lenin was right at every moment until he until but the thing is he died at the moment where we never had to find out. We died at the moment with lenin where we don't have to find out but lenin was perfectly suited to seizing power with that going to war with the army. He had he but his assumption that seizing power in russia was worth doing was premised on the idea that it would launch a world revolution. It was all premised on that underlying assumption that trotsky had conceived of the permanent revolution. That is what solved the riddle of how to move forward in a context where marxism couldn't really be applied to a system where there was no capitalist class to work against you had had capitalism brought in as a cargo cult by this this feudal ruling class that was been thrust into competition by capitalism and was frantically trying to keep up and that's the most important thing to remember is that none of these ruling parties. None of the ruling classes of any of the european powers save maybe the dutch the ones who started it. All wanted capitalism to triumph wanted things to change the way capitalism made them. Change wanted to move power away from central hierarchical authority and towards a ritual of social affirmation. But they had to do it because they were in competition with each other and capitalism provided a superior mechanism for wielding state power by rationalizing the redistribution of resources of the state a way towards private profit and towards socially advantageous mechanisms of governance.

They did it because they had to the youngers of germany didn't want to chalets doing horrifying sex crimes to each other looking out on their fast. Acreages do you think that they really wanted to be cheek to jowl with a bunch of of foreigners and jews in a city using little tokens to make fake fake value. You think they wanted to do something as honorable as that as dishonorable as determining value in a way beyond honor and conquest on the battlefield. No they had to because the french were doing it and the spanish were doing it and everybody was doing it and they were fueling it with the spoils of empire and conquest in the new world and the hyper exploitation at the point of the spear of imperial capitalism allowed them to distribute profits socially because capitalism gave them up to equalize the system look at russia. The russian revolution was essentially preordained by the fact that the the absolutism of like feudal rule was so recently intact at the top of the social order in the form of the tsar that instead of facilitating capitalist development in russia like the royal houses of western europe were doing the romanovs were sticking a goddamn. They were shoving a stick into the spokes of the thing the entire time because capitalism had been thrown up in the lap of the of of a medieval order meanwhile in england.

The the country that develops capitalism at the point of like the cerebrum where its brain is stored. Their royal family was literally brought in was essentially hired for the job of being the royal family of england by a a um by the emergent merchant class of england. Like the glorious revolution of 1688 where the last vestiges of land-based rule in the form of the um in the form of the stuart line the jacobite line. The the catholic stewards of england was overthrown by the by the new emergent merchant class of england which had first overthrown. The stewards before were unable to form a social basis around capitalism that early and therefore brought the stewards back. But once stuart absolutism reasserted itself. They essentially fired their ceo and hired a new guy someone from the place where capitalism had been birthed in the modern era. The dutch lowlands by importing a constitutional monarch into the system with the understanding that his job was to go to parades and wave at people and so capitalism in england is presided over by this machine that is designed to lubricate the system. A parliamentary system that just throws water onto the gears to keep it from.

Smoking keeps the friction to a minimum by distributing rationally as much as it can in russia. Medieval absolutism shows up is forced by competition with europe to sustain capitalism to to indulge the whims of sergei vitta and peter stalin. But at the end of the day it has to reassert itself and and the effectlessness of of of nicholas where he goes back and forth between liberalizing and and and going reactionary. It always has to be understood. As him having a natural inclination towards reaction being forced by circumstances to give in but then putting the lid on as soon as he can until he can't anymore which is what happens when world war. Ii blows the whole thing up but in every other system in europe every other monarchy.

In europe there have been sufficient infusion of capitalism. Capitalism had been around long enough to infuse itself within the mechanisms of power that those ruling classes could preside over a system that allowed for more rational distribution so even the kaiser reich which was slow on the uptake bismarck genius of geniuses. One of those 19th century geniuses like like marx honestly like some sort of a a revisionist marxist in in in the highest level of power you could almost put him as like a guy who understands we need to keep civilization alive here because we cannot allow these two things. This this this system of absolute power held by a small minority with capitalism ripping people towards the level of total sub sub submission to it of straight of a slavery enthralled them to it which created social reaction. That's the thing that matters is that as you create misery as you create proletarianization you create a reaction. You create social formations alienated from the system willing to fight against it and capitalism cannot deal with that because capitalism can only extract maximally. It is those middle people within all classes who can do it by creating politics and mark and brismark was able to look at the system and understand that there needed to be a rationalized buy-in of these workers if they were going to sustain the state project of the german empire and so that's why the one-two punch what did he do during during the 1880s what did bismarck do to the to the emergence of capitalism as a fully formed system that was going to be undergirding the the economies of all the european powers and was going to determine the the conditions of conflict between the states okay state state conflict had been the rule since westphalia but now it's state conflict under the conditions of universally applicable capitalism. What do you do every leader at the every level of power. Both private and public in the western world had to answer that question in about the 1880s and the answer was determined by where there were the technological the combination of technological efficiency and extraction of colonial plunder that allowed you to buy off the moment of of reckoning and allow you to compete now in the interstate conflict. Bismarck said what do we do we legalize the socialists we let them vote for socialists. We left socialist serve. We let them get essentially turned into bourgeois everybody at the every now that you you've you've validated.

The working class. You've created new jobs for the working class that are no longer working class jobs in that they are no longer connected to the process of extraction of surplus value. They are now there to facilitate capitalism and that's his cushy job. You're you are no longer feeling you're of course still exploited with capitalism. But it's now a mixed condition and you don't feel exploited. You feel rewarded you feel that you are the beneficiary of alienation at a material level because you are and then you have to rationalize it one way or another. But it is your condition now and that but you invested in capitalism.

It makes you invested in the perpetuation of a system that has allowed you to feel this comfort. So now you believe not a conflict that will see you annihilated you believe in a conflict that will see you victorious over time because of how smart virtuous you are and that's how the smart and virtuous rule leaders of the s dp. By the time world war one rolls around vote for war credits and then when the crucial moment comes in 1918 they dark ritual and bring the fry core into existence which will then be the the the needlepoint end of the spear of fascism that ends up cracking open the social. Fabric of of germany and then destroys half of the world and all of that is just a way to say that your system can compete in a in a multi-state westphalian conflict contest with other states under capitalism. If it could distribute rationally at this at the center because of technological facility and some degree of like social cohesion and outside resources from the exploited half of the world and the exploited half of the equation both within the country and outside of it and so that means that the challenge of the khrushchev's after stalin out at the moment of of truth and puts us on a conflict of of where we're assuming capitalism is the conditions. Then you have to create a consumer society you have to buy off your own working class because yes things were provided universally within germany russia in a way that they weren't. The united states but comforts and pleasures of a consumer society were not there not in the same amounts.

The bounty wasn't there and it's because there were less there's less to access you have a smaller based area than the capitalist west. You have vastly less developed technological capacity. You have vast much less concentrated capital that can circulate within the system you have a lot of poverty and impoverishment and you have a lot of undeveloped areas that is still in the production of the production of agricultural surplus which has to be rationalized. You have to rationalize the distribution of agricultural surplus first and foremost and so.

Khrushchev is the challenge of how do we create plenty and therefore allow ourselves to compete with the west and they tried it with computers and read. Plenty is a great book about that and it's not it's fictionalized so it's really it's. It's a very interesting format it just goes through the era and you see where there's a real attempt to marry planning with like technology with with algorithms and stuff and it falls short in large part because the soviet leadership is too adhered to their own power to risk losing it by the machine making decisions that aren't to their benefit which they wouldn't necessarily be like they were too ossified as a ruling class and that's because they were the party that had taken power. They were an outlaw party that operated as a criminal organization which meant once lenin died once the moses made brought them to the promised land and they had to start fresh the person who was going to be closest to power and most able and to effectively exercise it in the conditions that they were presented with would be an amoral gangster psychopath only in amoral gangster psychopath in the conditions of a criminal organization ruling under conditions of total encirclement and attack first a civil war in an allied invasion and then full economic warfare after that and then of course the germans showing up and killing half the country. Those are the conditions that are creating that are forging the conflict within russia and with the soviet union rather and that means anybody with any thrown away by the wayside.

They were going to be destroyed as were the dumb cynical people who couldn't just operate from from wiley planning. The only ones who win are these cynical people who are also smart and that's stalin and he did a great job assuming the conditions he did which is all right now we're just going to be. We're just going to care about this state existing and what's good for it is good for socialism and there's no more socialism outside of it in the rest of the world so that ends up becoming the framework for the rest of the cold war and what a shock that we lose but the challenge of khrushchev the challenge to crucifix to build sufficient technological capacity for solving the price problem to distribute things to allow the soviet idea to to conquer because it is an idea. The reality is capitalism. The idea is socialism and it can only do that if it is pressed forward with an idealistic way. But the soviets didn't do that they operated largely through. Realpolitik now not totally not like american empire and that hurt them too. But they couldn't spread the idea after a while and that's because they were locked into preserving the party not preserving anything as transcendent as the idea of socialism. But anything that happened in russia is not their fault.

It's germany's fault that is the thing because germany was supposed to answer the call and they said who's this new phone so once it was clear that the soviets weren't going to be able to answer the question in the 70s. When the when the oil what happened in the 70s is that all of the urgency on any meaningful question of solving the contradiction of a consumer socialist society under restrained resources was solved by oil prices going up the big. The big oil shock in the in in the 70s boosted. The vastly boosted the soviet export economy and therefore allowed for this stagnation where the political crisis was bought off for the first time with the consumer the consumer glut that had been promised by khrushchev but it wasn't because they'd actually solved the question of price and created efficiency there like they wanted to do like cybersin and chile wanted to do what before it was destroyed by pinochet one of the great disasters of our time. Is that they provided them with it black sea vacations for workers a new washer dryer in a shitty car. They actually were able to provide that for a little bit but of course the iron ironic thing is is that that oil shock they they thought that it was the solution to the problems of the soviet state. It was actually dooming them because once that shock wave went all the way around the world. It resulted in the full neoliberalization of world politics and the destruction of the soviet union because it is that oil shock that breaks the keynesian consensus at the top of capitalism in the united states and forces us to crack the whip in the political realm essentially to to to stop buying off and to start start you know enforcing austerity unevenly distributed towards the bottom away from political power which is why the people at the center of the center of capitalism succeeded and and we're fine with it the homeowner class in the united states today. By the time the crisis came they could they were bought off sufficiently that they're still republicans. They're still the base of this reaction within capitalism but first it came for the urban blacks like people think people talk about the the the collapse of the of the of the black community in the 70s and of course. The conservative argument is that oh their their culture went to thankfully because we got rid of segregation because they started commingling and living lewd and lasciviously. They lost their community center because they lost their their segregated character. That's the liberal that's the conservative argument for what happened what actually happened is that the the small black working black working to middle class that had been established for the white working to middle class after the world. After world war. Ii was actually taking hold they were actually starting to build some of it in the urban centers. They were actually going to build some wealth build build infrastructure and a social reality. There a fabric within capitalism but then that oil shock that resulted in the reorientation away from from the labor end of distribution of profit towards the ownership end that's going to un tip over the keynesian consensus into The final unraveling starts with the industrialization of the cities which means the people who move their most recently. The black emigrates of the great migration period are the first to be just deprived by it and what we see in the 90s and arts and and the hillbilly elegy phenomenon of white people. Oh my god. These white people they're acting black that's the big horror of the charles. Murray thesis is why are these white people acting like black people socially and it's like well no.

It's nothing it's nothing to do with culture. It's nothing to do with brain shape or any of this. It's that the conditions of total admiseration in america. The total proletarization hit them first and now your social order is seeing the same disruptions. The same pathologies emerge what a shock but it hits the bottom. First. It hits the bottom the poorest the poorest urban. Minorities then later the poorest rural whites rural and suburban whites. They fall off the board and they stop and they they become. The they are now are are the poor. They're not as essentially as social. They are as politically alienated basically as as as black. People are like not quite but it's it's it's similar and then you have those remaining homeowners who got bought out after world war ii.

Now it's shrinking. The the the ring of protection is going away and their their expression of that alienation is this culture war because they are consumed by the same matrix. The rest of us are and they cannot express their politics in class terms because they don't live them and they don't believe themselves to to exist in in those categories. Those aren't defined to them with meaning what means things to them are questions of race culture nationalism and therefore their politics reflect that so that's that's the conflict we're seeing. Now. That is that's all we have instead of politics and that's why our only hope is the reemergence around labor of first resistance first strike culture and then political culture coming out of strike culture that's going to be.

It is going to be the the the conflicts. These sparks lit in labor fight conflict like not the cultural con cultural realm of politics that'll come later and it's going to also be going on at the local level now to seed bed because remember all big changes. All big shifts politically are driven at the base by the ferment of class conflict but they are like those torrents are moved through tributaries defined first by culture by politics by formal conflict by ideal conflict because the people carrying out the people creating these social forms that we live are all outside of class conflict. There's they're not living class conflict they're living there. There's the fabricated conflict that their adherence to capitalism demands and so their culture reflects that and of course the real the real tragedy of the moment and this is why I said read plenty instead of ministry for the future and why I think ministry fear of the future is a book that has similar questions on its mind.

 is that the the question the the the dilemma that failed the soviet experiment that failed actual existing socialism in the 20th century has been solved to a large enough extent to guide humanity away from total annihilation towards the continuation of like a social conflict. A social project because cap the tribe of capitalism equals the annihilation of the social that is I think that is that's a math. I would write that on a board if I knew how math worked because it is total admission at the bottom which means a smaller and smaller percentage at the top protected by technology until there aren't any left until they're destroyed mutually somehow maybe a few of them escape into the singularity and they win but the rest of us are annihilated. That is the axiomatic endpoint of capitalism. Socialism could technologically given that if we have the existing given the existing level of technology that we have a rational distribution of resources in which capitalism the end the profit motive has been extinguished from the machinery. The machine that capitalism built its software its programming around capital around profit accumulation around surplus extraction has been removed has been bleached out of the system and then you boot in a new software protocol towards rationalized technologically facilitated distribution of resources within the system. We have the sufficient concentration of capital now to do that.

I think that is the fundamental argument of the book ministry for the future. I'm not going to talk about it too much today because I kind of went on a tangent. I'll follow up more on this tomorrow but suffice to say for the moment that I think that question has been answered and the book ministry for the future is largely about making the case that that's that's true. And I think that is why the book has basically nothing to say about how this thing would happen how this machinery would be seized by the working class of the world in any meaningful definition of that term that is left pretty much unexplained marginal. It is it is turned into like a voice it's turned into a feeling. It's turned into an experience rather than a description and that's because that answer the question cannot be answered. No. It's the same reason marx couldn't know. The capitalism was going to defeat the the conflict that he saw within it. Technologically. He didn't know that was going to happen because that was the x factor we're in a new world with new x factors. So the thing you can't know is what is going to move this thing at a grand level.

[68:27](https://youtu.be/EjrRZ57g8Ws?t=68m27s)

All you can do is know what to do in the moment and this book is essentially kim stanley robinson saying imagine you're in the moment when it matters imagine when you're in the moment where you can feel like what the right thing to do is and instead of rationalizing your way around doing it. You do it imagine every moment of your life where that counts and you make the right choice. The choice that's against maybe your best interest because you're blackpilled because you've decided that nothing matters but you that there's no point in fighting anything truly that politics really is just a moral costume that you put on to validate your position within a system that you benefit from and that's been rule. That's that more or less has been what has ruled us all through our lives. Now it doesn't rule us all all the time but it rules most of us most of the time and honestly any any like the arc of history that that martin luther king talks about that arc is defined by people pulling against that but the thing is they don't do it. Uniformly they do it one by one but then if the right chain reaction is triggered by action then in punches and then you can actually see the hand of god move into human affairs. But those moments are only retroact retrospectively understandable as such in the moment. There's still contingency decisions that we have to make instinctively and what drives us is an emotional thing. It's not a it's not a reasoned thing and so we will be driven and the question is is that emotion tied to our self-interest our narrow belief in ourself or to a greater belief in others in the world in reality in love to be incredibly cheesy about it in meaning beyond words and beyond sensation. Because if the world can be defined by sensation then words like love don't mean anything. Emotions are essentially alien. They're basically random and all you can do is pursue the most predictable ones the most selfish ones the most indulgent ones because they're the most sure the other ones require belief. They require you to be able to get in your head and imagine something and have that thinking give you a feeling that only comes from experience and by adhering meanings branding them with meaning through words through words and symbols that we carry with us and so if we're going to win. Humanity is going to win this thing which is a big if I don't think. I don't like our odds but because we're here there's a chance. There's always a chance definitionally because remember this these this moment is always there. The moment to choose love is always there so you can't know and so the book really does leave that what's left is the skeleton of stuff that we could do if we felt like it and that makes it very unsatisfying obviously but it does. I think still mean that it is a useful contribution to literature because for the people who are more inclined towards the rational more inclined towards believing that emotions don't have any kind of effect on reality. That reality is essentially knowable and that emotions do not form its reality that we don't essentially make reality emotionally and that is that is the rational delusion. The fact is is that all beliefs all understanding. The world arrives from emotion. First and foremost emotion is what defines all everything else. It comes in every sense after in the temporal sense and that it comes it is a response to feeling. It's the response to bodily and sensorial and pre-verbal emotion. You have the feeling before you can put a word to it which means rationalism is always going to miss that part of the world that is composed of pure feeling but that is made by our rational perception of the world that is the dialectical tension between the two and if you have to have a faith in that to act and if you do you will find the moments to act and if enough of us do and the right and we hit seven enough times on the on the craps. Table of of the universe and the right hand falls the right way we can do it and this book is there to give the more rationally minded a little bit of faith in that because here is the what we could do if it was possible. There's a different energy in you know rushing at a cockpit like flight 93 style. If you've got a pilot on the plane who you know could land it than if you don't you have like you you think about it longer you plan more ahead. You coordinate your actions better because your fear has been overwhelmed by your belief in your future. If you work together. You don't have a pilot and the pilots are dead and there's these guys aiming the plane 747 you'll fight for yourself. We know that and unless that didn't happen who knows like I believe that's a possible result. I believe if people knew that the plane was been hijacked. They might do it if not to just sit there because they'd be driven there by fear. But they'd be driven there purely by fear by angel. Animal fear untethered to reason because why they wouldn't really have any reason to believe that they'd actually survive. They're just frantically acting and and an understanding of this dynamic reading history through this lens. Seeing this dynamic play out throughout history and in the world around us applying that dialectical lens itself us. It soothes our fear and allows us to see the world through more clear eyes because we are not being ever so momentarily made anxious by the bleeping alarm sound.

The knowledge that we're on a flight 93 with no auxiliary pilot. But if you really do you have that knowledge tethered to some transcendent understanding of the world. Some transcendent understanding of meaning residing beyond the self that gives you praxis and so that is why I can't really ever. It's why I really sympathize with robinson reading this book because I feel like with a lot of these talks that I'm doing and a lot of my my like I guess you'd call it artistic project pretentiously of my career. Insanely you could call it has been to give voice to that understanding that dialectical fixedness that explanatory framework because it can soothe fear a little bit. It can give you reason to believe that there's a possibility that there are machinery we can grasp if we can push ourselves out of the matrix. Together there's machinery in our grasp yeah. My throat is getting a little. I should wrap it up though. It's been. I've gone long already so I'll talk more specifically about the book tomorrow but for today just that's a long way of talking about why. I think it's interesting to study history politics in the contemporary sense. It's interesting to apply the historical materialist heuristic to the culture that we consume because it can make us fitter actors in the world history can make us sharper. It can make us less fearful more more truly virtuous. I mean I hate to be pretentious and sound like a like a greco-roman but like apply virtue to our public life which is a real thing that we really have to deal with because the left that we have created online. I'm sorry is the left defined by capitalism is the left of defined at the base level by the equation of your self-interest with the left's self-interest. The idea that if I prosper materially that's good for everybody which is the same delusion that powers capitalists rising tidal. It's all boats if I'm in the arena posting or if. I'm doing my job at my podcast or I'm doing volunteering for the dsa or I'm voting the right way then I am essentially earning my spot in the human tugboat of virtue because remember you're still doing lifeboat ethics from within capitalism without even knowing it because as I said this is a culture created and reinforced by the reality of social media and so that is the only way that I can think of to take the fundamental contradiction that my job is to entrance you into this fantasy politics with the fact that I my goal now is to It's disenchant people from that you know the howard beale thing like how do you do that is that not a fundamental contradiction and it is. But it's one that can be transcended by belief by belief.

I will keep doing this to the and I will continue to feel good about doing it that's the important part. I will feel fulfilled. I will feel centered. I won't feel anxious. I won't feel guilty. I will not feel neurotic. I will feel kind of at peace the degree to which I do what I think of earnestly is a good job of making the case to disengage not at the level of discrete content consumption because everyone now is a cyborg. No one can log off because our understandings of ourselves are embedded in these matrices merely a question of emphasis and mindfulness to be pretentious about it and and and and and yoga pant mom about it and so I can only feel good about doing this about spending my time doing this if I could feel that it is contributing to that and that means that I have to be doing stuff that I believe in and so. I find that that's usually the case when I'm like doing these like I feel very on the beam. I feel like this is good stuff but it really is when I try to write when I try to abstract in the cold in without the like the the light on me when I try to fill in the gaps. I find that that's when doubt starts creeping in and that is really because I have no doubt that what I'm saying now is is correct. But it is the specific language of reinforcement that I'm less confident of because. I'm not that talented because these are different abilities born by different neural pathways that have been reinforced over time that are now largely fixed because your neural elasticity stops around 25. Like the brain you have at 25. It's going to develop over time and change but its basic structures are basically fixed you're going to have essentially the same amount of capacity to to add neurons as as you did at 25. So I'm pretty much fixed there at this level of we want to call talent so that means when I sit down and have to like in front of a thing then self-interest in the form of do something that's more engaging and pleasurable because it's less anxiety producing like post or watch a movie. Since you can't do that why wouldn't you little gremlin the demon on my shoulder and so that means. I'm less productive and then that creates a cycle of of self-doubt and self-loathing and recrimination and fear that then pull me towards indulging and not doing the work that I got to do and so that is the dynamic. I'm working with and what I've come to terms with and I think it's like kind of me um. Hopefully. Making a breakthrough is that this is not a conflict that I can resolve. This is the conflict that drives the whole project. This is the actual atom. This is the split atom at the center of the reactor because like that state that those states of of of of contentment and tranquility they what interrupts them is intrusions of of the selfish desire and so they're going to pull you away from that unless you can constructively spend time and so you balance the two because if you do it for too long then then eventually you know you're not unless you've reached a level of spiritual attainment that I'm not at yet you get pulled in that direction devil. The devil gets louder in your ear but the fundamental conflict. The manatee and delusion of christianity is that that can be resolved one way or the other and that's what powers are deformed. Politics are are the cycle of indulgence and puritan abstainiousness that drives our culture. It's because we think we can stamp it out. We have to embrace it. We have to let let those atoms spin around that nothingness at the center and then power our machinery of life and your challenge is to be aware of that condition so that your actions are driven by a felt belief that what you should be doing is what's good for everybody else because that'll drive you towards good work in every sense. It'll drive you towards doing your job earnestly and well to your best abilities but also doing service in the community helping people helping friends helping strangers operating out of a felt sense of universal love that is maintained by a rational understanding of what you should be doing in a moment and that's where that the the the they live. Glasses of historical materialism are for you getting.

A little froggy somebody says um just to wrap up here because this is a good. This is a good capstone somebody. Says is this like in 1984 when winston says that he believes in the end the party will lose yes because orwell was only talking about the soviet union. Like there's. There is no universal application of of his vision of dystopia which is why it's aged so poorly and why it's so irrelevant to the current moment or any moment frankly. It's because he was so fixated from capitalism from the bosom of capitalism with with defeating the soviet union and you could argue he had good reason to because by that point it was a snarling beast. It was this whipped dog. It was this this self-interested brutalized traumatized halfling trying to survive in the wilderness you should still have fought for it pro if you're on the capitalist side. You should probably still have fought for it in the way that you could have and he didn't for whatever reason he didn't and I honestly don't blame him too much because the seeing seeing barcelona in 1937 when the when this the communists crack down on the anarchists being on the anarchist side. It's hard not to take that personally. I can imagine but so he's assuming this condition of scarcity. This condition where you have a party that is actually rationally distributing but in a context of complete scarcity and that might have happened if the soviets had somehow beaten. The united states in the market in the market conflict or like one ex one maybe one a nuclear war. I guess that's what could have happened. The soviets had won a nuclear war that might have been how the future goes. But if you assume that capitalism is going to win which you should if you're in the west and that that would be a bad thing which you have to you have to assume that the triumph of capitalism will be a bad thing. Then you have to imagine what that would look like and then you have the other guy the opposite of orwell aldous huxley whose brave new world supposes what if capitalism wins but on its own terms. Capitalism is able to reach a level of technological sophistication that eludes the question of impulse that obviates the necessity for exploited people that obviates the necessity for any labor input at all and since that book also has a nuclear war in it. You can kind of imagine that those two books are two visions of the future after a nuclear war one where the soviets win 1984 one where the united states wins but also from within capitalism so that assumes that it can sustain itself. It assumes that it's a stable world and it assumes that stability through technological innovation. Yes there is still need for a physical labor at the human level. But we have sufficient technological capacity to create humans designed to work that way without feeling exploited literally changing humanity technologically and that is always the understanding of capitalism. Every utopia and dystopia of capitalism is premised on its ability to technologically overcome its own contradictions because capitalism can only technologically overcome its own contradictions over time as it is comp as it is triumphant and so you have to ask yourself if you're a capitalist first of all if you win your best case.

Scenario is a brave new world. Everyone is a hedonist. There is a kind of a ritual jungle orgy that takes the place of religious ritual people live for eternal youth. They fixate on youth and then they just die. They just snap dead around age 60. They don't have to worry about seeing people get old. They don't have to worry about dealing with age or time. They get to live in a delusional fantastic now until the moment they essentially get assassinated. It's like hey what if capitalism was you get to eat drink and be merry and then you shoot you in the head when you're 60. That's a way to solve the question of inputs right. Like okay. We don't have to worry about us outstripping resources because we're culling the population but they don't mind because they're having such a good time. That's your best case scenario under capitalism. So if you believe in capitalism and you also are a believer in any kind of like traditional reality some traditional masculinity. Any of that stuff no not going to happen you're probably going to be an upsilon semi-moron and then you're going to get to watch all the suck until they get thrown into a meat grinder. Now you're forgetting. I said 60 but part of the technology they have is that they extend vitality so that people aren't feeling aging. They feel you feel like you're like you're in your 20s or 30s until 60. And you look that way too that's the important part so you got to say if you like capitalism. That's your best case scenario. But here's the important thing that will never happen because we are now at the point where we see the inputs capacity do. We have it do. We have the technological capacity to rationalize human production yes not without bumps not without conflict not without violence not without mass death but mass death was going to happen anyway. We're talking handleable mass death. George c scott. I'm not saying we won't get our hair must mass death. The alternative is mega death with a few people left in their bubble sucking and for eternity until something breaks in their equilibrium and then they are eliminated and annihilated or they all become computer programs. But then the computer program will end and that moment will be eternal. The moment that will be fraternal is the moment of extinguishment hell or heaven because there is a non-brave new world de-sacralized hell world version of that post-scarcity reality that is possible a world where people get to live natural lives. Live natural life spans are content and happy. Along all of them are in some sort of harmony with the world have some sort of spiritual belief that transcends the the x's and o's of of human life. The limitations of a singular life lifetime you believe in a life beyond that an everlasting eternal reality that you are of course also part of for every moment but which you lack the senses to be able to be aware of most of the time because you've been thrust into the hell de-atomized end of history. We are now shredded. Moan heads trying to rebuild all of our sensory organs from scratch every moment every moment. We're like that we're feeling the raw tendrils of our severed social connections and our need for some sort of meaning that transcends our physical place in the world and then it is seared shut by the grinding mechanisms of the market over eyeing our ability to act independently of them driven more and more to become androids. This is unstable it will break the system will break how will it break will be up to us.

So we must be ready. We must be vigilant all right. I'm gonna get some drinks. I'm a little well parched after that. So see you dudes later dudes and dudettes. Major league butt kicking is back on what is it dudes and dudettes. Major league buck kicking is back online is that it back in town for some reason. That's not what that sounded like dudes and dudettes. Major league butt kicking is back in town.
