Foreign to where our Billy Bones resting now one nine billionaire all the time laughing and singing on the Lebanon nine came into Camp not looking too pretty never even got to see the holy city now Billy's out there in the Desert Sun and his mother cries when the morning comes and there's a mother's crying all over this world boys and girls. I wanna I wanna find the remarks I want to find Trump's I don't watch his speech because the one who does prepare remarks. It's always boring four years ago. We launched a great National effort to rebuild that country to renew its spirit and respond the allegiance of the government to its citizens. In short. We embarked on a mission to make America great again for all Americans as I conclude my term as the 45th president of the United States I stand before you truly proud of what we've accomplished together.

We did what we came here to do and so much more now how could anyone believe that anyone I mean I'm not even talking about actually and there's all these people who died from covet well that's because of Democrats next question. well what about the economy going bad. That's Democrats next question. The economy was doing great before China unleashed the virus next question. You lost you lost and the child eating pedophiles are taking power again.

How is that accomplishing anything you let them steal it from you. According to his own claims he let them steal it if you take him seriously at his word. None of this holds together as as a justification. It's astounding I mean I can see why he accepts this and thinks it makes sense but why anyone else who is supporting his agenda would think that it's wild oh man. It's really going to be something tomorrow when they swear at Biden and he is not immediately arrested and shot the head on live television. Although I have to say that if that does happen boy will my face be red I will have been certainly owned. That's for sure how's that is that better looks fine on my. Let me see what else he says here. this week we inaugurated new Administration and pray for its success why would you pray for its success. It's filled with child eating murderers and Global Psychopaths. You want the wisdom success at eating children's brains.

That's the problem is that this is all this is old. This is the way politics used to work the idea they're all on the same team and at the end of the day you go home and it was a hard-fought match but you respect the other team and how hard they play because everybody knows at the end of the day. This is an intramural scrimmage and we're not dealing with existential conflicts because both parties have accepted the terms and conditions of being a political party in the heart of Empire. The the thing that Trump has done with his person not on purpose in creating an army of people who are now existentially alienated from all these institutions that they used to think were enduring means that all of these appeals to bipartisanship are genuinely idiot incoherent and and frankly insane and I'm frustrated seeing it because that alienation is a good thing. I know it's scary because the people feeling it are the most heavily armed Americans the most reactionary socially and mostly economically and that it sucks that they're the ones realizing oh yeah. I know these. This is a rigged game but everybody needs to come to that conclusion at some point and so I want to do wonders if you haven't invested yourself completely in the in the idea of trump. As a person. How do you absorb this I get how you were able to absorb everything else that happened because he was still fighting. He was still claiming he wanted to win and he was telling people go fight but like ever since the sixth and specifically. Now I just don't know how the hell you square any of this and of course.

The real true believing like the people are too committed spiritually because Q Anon is a religious movement more than it is a political movement. The people who are religiously and spiritually committed they're going to have their own. They'll do what the millerites did. After the great disappointment. They'll figure something out which means there's going to be some q and on David koresh in the near future. Because David kresh was a was a the Branch Davidians were offshoot so the seven-day Adventists who were offshoots of the millerites and I know that that took you know like 100 years but nowadays with this with caffeine and the drinking water and all of the internets and such things move much faster so we'll probably get q and on David kresh within six months.

But if you're a regular Republican who has over the past four years moved towards a psychic identification with him whoa he sold you out when did it. Happen did he get replaced by a hologram was he lying the whole time and if he was lying the whole time what does that say about you we extend our best wishes and we also want them to have luck a very important word. I think that's him some people are probably freaking out thinking that that's a coded threat. I think it's him saying that if it had been for the Unlucky event of coronavirus I would be re-elected and of course. That's true. Although he also doesn't seem to absorb and never could that he did up just as badly. As Trump did at the state level Newsome 2 the big Democrat Governors that are supposed to be Our Saviors are awful. Huge butchers built complete incompetence but they took it seriously in front of the camera and Trump never took it seriously because he's too stupid like I was talking genuine rustic dumbass to understand that he couldn't just insist it was gone and then have everybody agree with him.

You could get your supporters to do that but his ego wouldn't allow him to understand how few people that was relative to the population if he had pretended to care even it might have been enough and of course another check would have done it. I'd like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made a remarkable Journey possible like he's see like he's talking like he's writing in. Someone's yearbook at this point have a great summer remarkable. Journey I thought this was a war to the death with the pedophile. Elite let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular first lady Melania and let me ask to share my deepest appreciation to my daughter. If I my son-in-law Jared and Barrett Dan Eric Tiffany and Lara you fill my world with light and with joy. This is a this is the Oscar acceptance speech that he has dreamed of giving and never gotten a chance to I also would like to thank thank vice president Mike Pence his wonderful wife Karen and the entire Prince family. The guys the guy who you have put in Jeopardy for the rest of his life. Mike Pence is going to have to hold his breath when he turns the Secret Service agents are not. It's amazing all right let me. See I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people the United States Secret Service even though his wife even though his daughter and her her husband wouldn't let them house. also wasn't it a secret service agent who domed one of his supporters in the capital. He literally is thanking the people who killed one of his supporters who was trying to save the Republic on his behalf. Like he told them to do foreign most of all I want to thank the American people. The civilian president has been an Arabia description thank you for this extraordinary privilege and that's what it is a great privilege and a great honor.

We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements we are a nation of incredible decent faithful and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very very successful and good man. Maybe he did write this himself. We are truly magnificent Nation either. He wrote this himself or like Stephen Miller or whoever it is one of the people who's been able to figure out what he likes has figured out how to write like him at least how to use words in a way that he will find familiar and authentic which is small ones and a lot of intensifiers because you know vocabulary is pretty small but that's one of the things that supporters like about it. They don't feel condescended to all. Americans were horrified by The Assault. On our capital political violence is an attack on everything we cherish. As Americans it could never be tolerated now more than ever. We must unify around our shared values and rise up a partisan Rancor and Forge a common destiny. What is this this is the most complete surrender I have ever. I mean obviously.

This is what he was always going to do and everybody it's funny. The only people who didn't know. This is what he was going to do are the Q Anon and and Maga diehards and the Biden sucking liberal psychos. Those are the only ones who thought that he had some trick up his sleeve where he was going to somehow cancel democracy. Even though he is a toddler all right I'm looking for some more good stuff. In here yeah. He left he left he was an outsider. He wanted there to be Summits hard-working Patriots America first we achieved more than anybody bought possible all right.

Let's hear. The list tax cuts and reform well done once again all for rich people. regulations once again job killing regulations. That's a thing that maybe your average dumbass might think helps them but in reality helps their boss. Broken trade deals withdrew from Pacific partnership. that's all either they either just change the name or it's all going to go back left the Paris Accord. They're going back into the Paris Accord immediately replace NAFTA with usmca basically the same thing tariffs on China a terror war that we lost we got our asses kicked in the chairs in the Chinese trade. War billions and billions of dollars I'm pouring into the US and then the virus forced us to make a bad Direction. Ah we prefer we heart. We America outperformed other countries during covet because of our incredible economy. This is a good one America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy we built if he didn't write this if he didn't write this that there is somebody in the White House who has mind melded with him. Our economy outperformed others because it's incredible and because we built it without the foundations and footings it wouldn't have worked out this way. We wouldn't have had some of the best numbers we've ever had of course. He's talking about the stock market and what he's talking about economic build. What we built is the Banks.

The exact same stuff that the most hardcore reaction areas in this country hate the people who love him the most hate that's what he's falling back on. It's almost as like there is no alternative to this within the political system and even a guy who appears to be such a sue generous maniac and a guy who is in many senses. A complete completely defies all all conventional political arithmetic and is able to draw on a leveraged network of support outside of the traditional political structures. Nothing changes nothing significantly changes you you get cheap money in one end. and Neo serfdom on the other end. That's what everybody's doing with different flavors regardless of how much of an outsider they are and I know and that's why while I was supporting Bernie and I really was invested in that campaign. More than anything I did not have a lot of hope that his presidency would be in any sense successful as in getting things accomplished. If there was going to be any any forward progress from a Bernie campaign.

It would have been in building a constituency for policies that could do the work of pressuring existing systems from outside that was the hope and what we got instead was this we got Trump and Q and this sort of this atavistic. lower middle class I guess I would say revolt foreign with no political coherence to it and no political point. A pure demand for the TV to be turned on to what they want to watch that's it. They want to make sure that the TV is on their channel. It's a fight in the living room for the clicker. We also had lacked our energy resources and became the world's number one producer of oil and natural gas by far and that right there honestly is like the closest thing to a like a a America. First policy that is outside of the consensus which does recognize climate change is real and recognizes that there has to be a adaptation of of the the energy Market if we're going to you know avoid catastrophic destabilization but you have to have read something to know that you have to have understanding of things happening outside of your. Because as I said when we were talking about like what the actual politics of this trumpist movement is one of the keys is it is how are we gonna unleash. Prosperity just let everybody dig for any oil. There is on Earth the American Earth anyway any any anything that anywhere there's a natural gas pocket or a for a thimble full of oil. You should be able to go and get regardless of how wasteful or pointless.

It is because hey you could be Jed Clampett because if you recognize the Trap that we're in we recognize that we are in fact as a as a as a world but like that specifically that the downwardly mobile middle classes of America are trapped in a situation where there's no hope for them or their children having long-term stability. A career-wise economically the home ownership a thing of the past Health Access to Health Care on more than like a Patchwork basis probably a thing of the past if you recognize that but you have also rejected any kind of socialist alternative if you have committed beyond anything to capitalism like capitalism is the Bedrock that everything else flows from which is true of these people. Then the only way to get around that is well. Everybody can be their own little Jr Ewing with their own little pump going in their front yard and what the hell does that do for anybody because I know that's neolib to talk about climate change because it is like an abstract question and most of the answers to dealing with it just so happen to also benefit You know transnational 

Capital accumulations and and people like Elon Musk but it is a real thing that really has to be calculated in your political projection and a political project that is premised on rejecting the very concept in order to to support this um. This re-emergent fantasy of the American smallholder striking it rich below the ground is madness. Foreign wages. Boomed income did go up. A little bit. Incomes went up a little bit but it was a little bit. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted out of poverty and if you're done now that's that's none of that's true. It was a miracle. The stock market did get very high but that doesn't mean anything and I love the argument that a lot of these people make that well sure the stock market has mostly hell stock is mostly held by rich people but what about 401ks first of all half of those things all your. All your games are going to be caught.

Away by fees from the scumbags who are interposed themselves as middle managers of the thing and also not that many people have even those anymore we went from pensions to 401ks to nothing in. Like 30 years we rebuilt the American manufacturing base opened up thousands of new factories. There is no way that's true I'm not even looking it up and brought back the beautiful phrase made in the USA and there's another problem with your any attempt to turn trumpets into some sort of coherent populism. That's an alternative to what we have is that if you just if you incentivize Manufacturing in America but from like a supply-side perspective the way they do and tax breaks or whatever what that ends up meaning will either means you have to lower American wages to make them competitive with foreign countries or allow for or and in fact incentivize automation to offset them and that has been where a lot of the decline in American manufacturing comes from a significant percentage of it is not necessarily from Outsourcing. It is from Artemis automation that and if if the gains of that automate automation are all privatized which none of these people have any interest in changing then you have done nothing oh. There's a factory at the edge of town filled with robots that belch is.

Showing of Hamilton in our ice rink foreign nation was hit with a terrible pandemic. We produced not one but two vaccines with record-breaking speed and what was so quickly follow. They said it couldn't be done but we did it. I don't know if anyone said it couldn't be done. I think everyone assumed there was going to something to be a vaccine. They called it a medical miracle and that's what they're calling it right now a medical miracle. No one. No one is saying that zero people another Administration would have taken three four five maybe even ten years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months.

One you didn't have anything to do with it. This was all once again out it was public research outside private companies and secondly I really don't think that that's true I mean 10 years come on come on buddy he brags about the covet intervention and economic intervention and honestly. Even though it was obviously very insufficient. It was still so much more than people are used to that it did have a very significant effect just that two thousand dollar check. The first one did drop poverty even as employment was collapsing. That's how on the edge people are this country and that is why you saw such a bipartisan effort that and the election to make sure that it wasn't normalized because we'd only give people the idea that you can just get rid of poverty that way and then you can't obviously you know by itself. But you can really get the boot off a lot of people's necks. That way you can't have that stood up to Big Pharma in many ways V8 Choice via accountability right to try Criminal Justice Reform.

None of his supporters care about any of this. Democrats stole the election from him so what good were. They we get the borders we gave him the ball while we did it. He didn't even say anything about the wall oh God. He says he achieved the more secure Border in U.S history did not say we built the wall because they didn't build a wall four years. They got like what how many new miles of fence were built. It was it was like something like what I think a couple hundred miles something like that 450 miles. It's a 2 000 mile border. I mean I know you don't need a fence for all of it and some of it would already had fencing. But we stood up for America at the United Nations withdrew from trade deals we rebuilt the American Military I made it the USA bragging being an American president bragging about increasing the defense.

Budget is so funny like oh wow that you had to really fight a lot of vested interests in Congress in order to get more money to the military stood up against China. Recognized Jerusalem is the capital of Israel a thing that suffering people should really care a lot about principled realism got. Midi's peace deals if the dawn of a new Middle East I have to say that that has been funny watching them try to ring good press out of making the back room alliance between the GCC and Israel public and that's why they did it. Hey Trump wants to win. We're gonna yeah okay we like it as real now historic change like oh yeah the UAE and Israel. They were really a daggers drawn before Trump showed up but nobody cared that's the flip side you don't get nobody cares about this. the new secretary of state is saying that it was it was like a good idea poorly executed wow we're in for some great times but gonna be wonderful We have asserted the sacred idea that in America the government answers to the people. No you didn't you didn't by your own argument by everything you have said and done you have not reasserted that because you lost the election in a scam where the elites stole it from you and then you let them take it. How is that reassuring you have had that the sacred idea for millions of Americans has been permanently destroyed. This is actually very much reminiscent of Kenny Powers. Autobiography I was up as America as president my top priority. My constant concern has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course by far. It was actually the most difficult I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism I took on the tough battles. The hard fights the most difficult choices because that's what you elected me to do. Your. Needs were my first and last unyielding. Focus suck my dick everyone.

They put American people back in charge of her. You put American people back in church of the country. Even though the Godless child eating pedophile is now going to take power tomorrow after having had the hammer and scorecard supercomputer drop dump rather millions of illegal votes into the system and guarantee that you'll never see another free election in this country. Wild the key to the National greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity that means Focus again what we have in common the Heritage that we all share. That's always been America's crisis. We don't have one of those all we have is money.

All we have is buying. All we've had is free real estate and consumer purchasing power that has been the shared American experience and that's what shared American culture is. It's a culture of convenience and consumption. That's it and now everyone's brains are exploding and we're the we are reaching record for the modern era levels of of polarization in part because that balm has been taken from us thank you he was complaining about cancel culture. All right our future is bright I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be great yeah what a loser man what a loser and I got to think that some of these people who've been investing in this guy feel like losers now too.

Although who knows who knows the ability to self-deceive is pretty pretty bottomless. somebody was asking about these 1776 project. Thing I only scrolled some of the highlights man just the most Middle School. Not even Middle School book like Middle School student on Earth and of course what's really frustrating is the whole thing. It was just this childish response to the 1619 project which is also wrong but and and this is like the horror of being blocked in this chamber of idiots in this fake. this fake cultural conflict that has very high emotional Stakes for everybody but which actually doesn't penetrate any of the deeper crises and and issues we have in this country so you get the 1619 project which is this and this.

This is advancing this new understanding of American history that essentializes race as like the founding engine of America's institutions from all the both political and economic and wouldn't you. Know also means that capitalism is is only is it can be a tool to out root out the the most egregious base issue which of course. In this. Frame is a is a concept racial animosity that is totally Evanescence and subjective wonderful. But it's written by real Scholars and it's got footnotes and it's done. It's put up in the nice house style. Of the New York Times and it gets the immature of Academia it hits all the right buttons of of left liberal um historical understanding and of course. It flatters all of the very well-meaning well-off white people who read things like the New York Times magazine because it gets them to remind. It gets them to think man sure would be nice if we could get some social justice. In this country. Oh well all the other white people are too racist to let that happen and then what do we get as a response what is the reply to that it is this government-funded book report where a bunch of crayon eaters go.

The Constitution was written because to protect the liberty and with about freedom in protecting freedom and there's America. It's about doing good freedom and that there's a bad not freedom and we fight against those so death. America is biting the bad freedoms with the bad not Freedom with the good freedom and that is your argument and of course both of them. Essentialized capitalism is unmovable with sorrow more than with sorrow from the 1619 project and with of course you know exaltation from the 1776 project but both of them committed to the same basic attitude towards our fundamental political economy and then that's the argument we get to have and then you get to watch that play out and pick your side essentially based on which one gives off the cultural signals that you are more amenable to not any underlining arguments because there aren't any I mean especially with the 70s 76. It's just pap. It's all circular nonsense. The Constitution balance the need for government to do the things that we wanted to do with our needs for individual freedoms without defining terms without without talking at all about on whose behalf these freedoms exist for. It's. It's it's it's America is good because America is great type and then you get to have this idiotic argument and then yeah. It's grim.

It's frustrating I gotta find I gotta find one of the 1776 I I remember reading a few of the quotes from it and just being blown away by how banal It was like how could anyone above. A middle schooler read the thing and find it compelling as an argument as opposed to just the thing to smile and read and feel good about which is of course why it exists. I understand and people talk about how you know oh. It's racist and stuff you know like. It says that the Civil Rights Movement is bad because it goes with for group rights which makes it this race. This is John C Calhoun yeah of course that's terrible of course that's bad. But it's all in the service of such vacuous non-argument. I don't even understand how you can get mad at it yeah okay. Here we go the principles of the American founding can be learned by studying the Abundant documents contained in the record read fully read fully and carefully. They show that the American people have ever pursued freedom and Justice which are the political conditions for Living Well to learn this history is to become a better person a better Citizen and a better partner in the American experiment of self-government. Like that's not that's not an act that's not an academic argument. It's not an intellectual argument. It is a slogan. It's just a bunch of slogans to get you head up and it's in response to a challenge from the the 1619 project but both of them boil down exists to comfort one segment of the people who read this which is basically college educated people from this from the excerpts and from the city center. That's what distinguishes which one of those you believe and neither of them have anything to do with the the truth or falseness of the statements that they're making considering especially that most of them have no real content.

Anyway. I've had a McRib that sucks I get the McRib every time because they only do it every 10 years so. I'm like maybe it's better this time I had it for this last time. It is not. I saw the bill Oakley review and that kind of made me want to try it because he said it's basically the same McDonald's flavor but for pork instead of chicken or fish or chicken or beef. And I like the McDonald's flavor.

I'm a pig. I know that it's programmed I'm programmed to like it and they they got me like they got me like the things that taste like McDonald's to me taste good which I'm looking forward to the plant-based versions because I guarantee you whatever they. Whatever Tire Treads they find to replace the Big Mac burgers or the McChicken. It'll taste basically the same because it'll taste like McDonald's. So I had it and it really does not taste like that. It's got this and it's not really even The Taste. It's for one thing. It's the barbecue sauce which is not the McDonald's flavor. It's something else and secondly the texture it is not like pork. It is like the only thing I keep coming back to when I taste it is like cartilage. It's like a shark fin or something. It really is a cafeteria food in a way that even regular McDonald's isn't No thank you no thank you.

I do not think a Henry Wallace presidency would have necessarily changed the trajectory of America too much because to have him be the president of an effective president. You would have to have different conditions so that he could then utilize as president and by the end of this war the American left was was in retreat. It had been co-opted into the into the the Democratic Party and the the liberal state and you could argue that they didn't really have a choice considering that there was a world war with Nazis to deal with and yet all those decisions were defensible in the moment but the accumulated. The result of their accumulated momentum is that by the end of the war there really wasn't a constituency for pushing moving far forward and the real. The real nut cutting came with the strike wave after World War II but not because there had been a no strike pledge throughout the labor movement during the war so that they wouldn't have to worry about um production problems undermining the war effort. So a lot of grievances a lot of arguments. A lot of complaints that were pushed off came to the fore again and there was a huge explosion of of strikes both authorized and Wildcat and in that environment there was the the 1946 elections and then 48 where the by by the end of which even though Truman held on the Republicans had taken Congress which is how they were able to pass the taft-hartley bill which put a stake in the heart of the American labor movement. Even though it took a while to work its way through to the to The Killing point and it's hard to imagine Wallace by himself changing that trajectory.

Especially considering the fact that he was kind of a sap. He was he was like an Upton Sinclair type. He was a a a naive idealist type the classic like Salon socialist It's hard to imagine him standing up to the forces of capital. I mean maybe his Soviet advisors could have helped him because of course. The fun thing about Wallace is that by the time he ran for president in 48 on the Progressive ticket he was being handled by Soviet Soviet agents. There were actual Communists among his his highest levels of advisors but even with that even with them in the white house with him leading them around by the nose what do you do with a country where the where the energy has sort of gone away where the urgency of the early 30s and the earth and the bite of the depression has has been eased a bit and where the the the ritual of a Patriotic War that included the entirety of the American social order coming together to defeat Nazism. It's hard to see where apps and any other change you get the the momentum and the organization and the will to challenge capitals. Reassertion of control see that's the thing why it wasn't easing the pain good it is good.

It's your work. You're working always to try to make people's lives better but part of the part of the deep dilemma of being a like moving towards leftist politics and specifically working class and labor politics in a putative democracy is that by making things better yes you demonstrate your worth and value. But you also make people comfortable and in America specifically that Comfort was expressed by after the war. The project of turkey that rest of working class the white part of it anyway that had been so threatening there in the early 30s and that FDR had been able to ride like a tiger for a while and making giving them middle class livelihoods and lives even if you know they're still working for pay and a alienated life. Even if they still don't have control over the the conditions of their labor. They get to live the way that the middle class had traditionally lived and if they're living the way that the middle class traditionally live. It's only a matter of times until they start thinking the way that the middle class thinks and the fact that you move them away from each other.

They scatter them into these suburbs and then replace social life with a synthetic spectralized life in the form of mass media that process. It's it's designed in many ways to diffuse radical energy and diffuse working class mobilization and militancy and that was the context where the the purging of the Communists and and the leftists from the CIO happened where the second Red Scare asserted itself. There. Just wasn't the will to resist it amongst the working class broadly thought because it was splintered along racial and ethnic lines and was part of it was in the process of being of having a lot of their material demands ameliorated. I'm gonna get another drink foreign.

Here I go I'm back drillies are pretty good someone's asking about if the original robber barons were the beautiful voters. Basically they were and the process of turning like we've talked about in the book and we'll talk about more tomorrow when we finish up the Republic for which it stands the process of creating like the modern liberal managerial state that the Progressive Movement enacted was a largely a process of domesticating our nouveau riche because guys like Carnegie and Rockefeller they really were. They were a new type of rich person and the they were and they were creating fortunes that were unheard of in their size and they commanded the lives of way. More people than like a feudal Lord could have dreamed of holding in their thrall and that and they acted in pure self-interest They competed like crazy against one another to destroy their rivals and in the process cause destabilization caused prices to drop caused a run towards lower wages in these industries that led to labor unrest and violence and the political class and and the in the intellectual class saw this and realized. Last night fair was insufficient and the Progressive Movement and the creation of like a professional managerial class interceding between ownership and labor had to be built in order to channel there. The the the sort of lump in base interests of these individuated billionaires and millionaires into a coherent.

 class interest and creating the trusts was a big part of that because competition was one of the things that really stirred up labor unrest more than anything because competitions were the things that drove wages down and well you could have if you had like a larger market share you could afford to negotiate more with labor at least not do things like Andrew Carnegie did with homestead and refuse any deals and break the union and end up having a shooting war on the Allegheny River between pinkertons and Strikers which was very bad PR and gave energy and and wind to the sales of a labor movement that was truly radical and terrifying to property owners so by the end of that process. By the end of that that managerial process you create the fort estate by the end of World War II where the ruling classes truly been professionalized. Turned into stockholders turned into chairman of boards and stuff and that and and expected to have come through education into these understanding of what it means to be a capitalist but that was only at the highest levels of wealth.

At the local level. You have these mini carnegies. Many many Many Rockefellers bur bursting a force and they never got out. They never got the speech. They never got the disciplinary and instructive social process. They're still wild ornery wildcatters out there and like one of the first four main formations of that was the Texas oil millionaires to emerge around the middle part of the 20th century. The guys who a lot of people think got Kennedy killed Kennedy the Hunts and the Richardsons and such they got people who were who were the subject of Dallas and that's just like one version of that but like The Waltons others like the it's all similar. expression people are giving me the business more about moving to Oregon and I'll move to Oregon shut up. Guys are giving me giving me give me my comments give it to me with me. I would like to say also just while I'm here that everything I said about the Democrats trying to take this the capital Insurgency as as a new 911 in an attempt to recreate the war on terror.

Domestically. It's all happening according exactly as that was said to happen there. Everyone is they got the media rounds going National former National Security Council Members. Former military leaders. Democrats saying we need to reorient our intelligence agencies towards internal threats and we and there's even now a trial balloon being launched about creating a domestic spy agency because technically the CIA isn't allowed to spy domestically and the FBI is not an intelligence service. The NSA of course also no and the pitch will be.

This is justice. This is justice not get making anything better for anybody making everything equally bad for everyone which of course is ironic and hilarious because that is the reaction conservative critique of socialism right. Oh it doesn't make everybody conservative capitalism is about spreading wealth and socialism is about spreading the poverty around you know making everybody equally poor and of course that's dumb. But it does apply to the logic of liberalism logic of liberalism because it has a ceiling on how much it can offer normal people anything other than subsistence and and alienation and more than anything the knowledge that they are disposable is is to alleviate their sense of felt differentiation and treatment from others. That's it that you can do. I am also very much joined people saying that because Biden and such are talking about a big stimulus that it means neoliberalism is dead or or that like the leftist won the policy argument in the halls of power. Another thing that you could see coming a mile away an attempt to push off as far as possible. Any Day of Reckoning between Biden's actual policies. and the expectations that people might have had who voted for him. But I will say that on this is that last day of president that Donald Trump was was bad. He was a bad president. He was very funny which Obama was not. Obama was a very bad president too but was very unfunny. So in that respect alone Trump is actually very good. You can clip that Trump is actually very good because he was definitely funnier than Obama and I do not I will not accept any argument that he was a worse president than Obama. I'm sorry if you mean worse in terms of worse better in terms of worsening the conditions. For people on this planet. I mean if you want to talk about you know oh in beginning America's values or whatever spew to ignore talking about the actual real consequences of power. Sure you can have an argument that that Obama was better or something but he you know he didn't otherize people and he made people feel safe to live. In America. I mean yes I can understand why that would matter to you But when you look at the actual numbers the numbers on the graphs going up and down the human misery indexes I'm sorry.

All terrible all committed to a system that will grind us all into dust but the important thing to note about both of them Trump and Trump and Obama. oh bungler is that their actual autonomy within the system is pretty. Limited like we can say that Obama and Trump are both awful presidents but it really wasn't either of them who made that made the awfulness and when you consider how different they are as people and how their differences are so Stark that they have created like these competing social categories that people invest with meaning but one of the reasons they do. That is because their actual ability to affect change is very much non-existent. They both came through a partisan political process that selects for if not beliefs than willingnesses to go along with things as they are and more importantly ensures that no one in a position of being anywhere near them in any room they might sit in is going to not be on the same page every time a bungler sat down to talk about what are we going to do about this housing crisis or any other question everybody in that room was on the same demonic team so no matter how smart Obama was or how much he had pondered the the fundamental questions of American democracy and the the contradictions at the heart of the American dream he sat down. Everybody is already on page on the same page and every question is comes down to a range of options that have been predetermined and then by the difference and the same is true of Trump trump gets. In that room. It's people with the same stuff maybe they're maybe they're Their domestic political um imperatives are different and the structure is different there. But the underlying fundamentals are the same and the difference boils down to one of them can you know make a public show of of wrestling with the powers of the office and write a two 700 page self-excupating memoirs about how they did the only thing they could possibly do and then if there was anything wrong with what he did. It was a tragedy Beyond his ability to remedy and then Trump who is just going to presumably build a 700 foot statue of himself with a running video of himself in the Grimace in the in the in the head. That's the difference what is white people talk about vouch again I don't like why do people want to hear why do people want to deal with with. YouTube. Drama come on come on people.

Let's be grown-ups. He's got more hair than me. I'll give him that he's got like a top knot. So he's got more hair than me so I'll give him that tip of the cap I sound like him. I haven't heard his voice. I mean we're both government issue. Beard white beardo so I wouldn't be surprised. If that's true. I understand that I am not a I'm not a unique specimen in any respect bread tube. My God what an embarrassing term especially since it refers to anarchism well. I'm going to sign off in a second I hope to stream tomorrow. We'll talk about the book the end of the book and also we'll talk about the executions that will be carried out on the capital steps. presumably I'm I'm from going when I've read on the internet that's going to happen around noon Eastern. So we'll have something to talk about. But we're still going to talk about the books that would be very funny and I and you know what I will do it if the if the plan really does. Happen and Trump comes on TV and says I'm president forever. It's me and then he just cuts bite his head off with a scimitar. I'll still talk about that book because it's the last it's we said we were going to has anyone seen.

Any of these like attempts at creating at doing local protests and state capitals not go not much not much happening there when everyone goes home when everyone goes home to posts and to watch football after tomorrow what are you gonna do if you were a cue person but also if you're one of the mirror Q people who thought that the Revolution was at hand and that you were going to get executed for for for being non-binary or whatever 25 000 troops in the nation's capital and people are relieved about that Kevin Baker wrote an article I think for Harper's like 20 years ago. Now I remember reading it in college. There was right after 9 11 and it was about how the military is the only institution with any kind of bipartisan trust in this country. How it's the only organization with any kind of infrastructure or capacity to respond in crisis and I remember the last words of it were at the end we'll beg for the coup and we've already got half of the voting population in this country literally begging for a coup and that's what they were doing like. They weren't doing a coup when they went into the capitol. They went in hoping that someone else would do a coup because that's all anybody including Trump can do because nobody has any kind of nobody's part of anything. So everybody was just hoping a coup would happen and now you've got the National Guard coming in and securing the exchange of power and securing the Biden Administration and finally ensuring that the dastard Trump is removed from office you get closer to that other half of the voting population salivating for a coup which means that the next Crisis that comes the most realistic outcome will be someone coming forward speaking the neutral technocratic language of the military at a Regis at a register that is heard neutrally by both sides which is now impossible between the political sides. Anything.

A republican says is filtered because they're saying because they're saying it because they've been trying to say it. They know what works with the people. They want it to work all their vocabulary. Their presentation everything is designed to make one group of people very happy. One group of people very angry that's true of both sides. Neither one of them will be able to come forward and say we have a new We have a new government that would be rep with anything less than instant resistance from the people who hear those dog whistles because it's dog whistles each way. They'll hear those dog whistles. Negatively. Only the military can speak with words and in and with symbols that both sides read as neutral. Both sides read as not part of the enemy both sides read. Maybe read as as sincere read as a friend in the friend enemy Smitty and distinction cool. So Thailand does anybody remember the Thai coup from a few years ago when there was when the president got or the Prime Minister got removed from office and his supporters flooded the capital and they got into a big public battles with the opponents because the Prime Minister was incredibly popular among the rural population but hated in the cities and could and that that could not be bridged and then when the urban parties were able to kick him out of office. It sparked this massive resistance which was only resolved when the Army came out of the barracks. When the tanks came down. The streets and everybody went home because the military is neutral all right folks so we'll see if if I haven't been neutralized by a q wet team.

I will hope to stream sometime tomorrow. After the inaugural I would say that I'm looking forward to Trump's or Biden speech. But we know that they got some special adrenochrome for him when he has the big moments and it'll be boring and it will be mostly confident. But hey who knows teeth could still fall out of his head. Eyeball could blow up. Anything can happen all right. We'll see bye-bye.
