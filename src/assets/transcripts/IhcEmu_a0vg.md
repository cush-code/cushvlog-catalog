Baby here I am I'm a man on the scene. I can't get you what you want but you got to come home with me me getting back into chocolate milk loyal viewers of the flicks. Vlogs will remember that I went through a chocolate milk phase at the beginning of quarantine and now I am back where I started it really is delicious. I have to say the chocolate melts with the milk creates a sensuous truly indulgent combination of flavor and texture okay. I wasn't gonna mention it but babies are not workers. Why are people mad at that kids can't work. The only way you make money in our capitalist system is through wage relationships if you're not an owner so kids can't work so that means the more kids you have and you the jobs pay per person so if you get wages as a parent or as two parents. The more kids you have the farther spread. The money is among mouths and therefore the more the inequality exists. How is this a thing to be controversial. How can you get mad at that unless you have like everybody online confused moral arguments with empirical questions. Like they hear this they're non-workers and they think oh my god he's saying they're bad. He's saying that they're parasites no. He's saying that they can't contribute to the labor market and get money on the labor market which is the only place you can get money if you don't have capital and so therefore the more families you more the bigger your family is the heart. The more inequality will be between you and somebody who has the same job and makes the same pay but has fewer kids and the only reason. The only thing this might wave. Any of this makes sense is if people are hostile to the idea of people having children. They think we should not be encouraging it through all their leftism. What they really are is a eugenicist progressive who wants to make sure that people don't irresponsibly over breed as if that's the real problem we're dealing with. In this.

People have been yelling about matty b stats my boy matt brewing who look the man has the arks you do not have the args. The people yelling at the thing that makes me most annoyed about. It is everyone who's trying to yell at matt burning knows less than he does about what they're talking about who are they because and they half the arguments are made up and mis understandings of the of the point. For that. Very reason they literally don't understand what he's saying because they're too dumb but they they decide they're going to take them on fools. Fools and the thing is is that like the people who the closest thing to a real coherent critique of it is. It's not actually the labor market that it crosses inequality. It's capitalism okay no no. That's not what he's interested in matt b matty b's entire idea as like his contribution to the public good is that I am very good at the args and the numbers that means my job should be to create policy ideas that presupposes the existing political structure that we live with it that presupposes capitalism because we're not getting rid of it right away. There's nothing to be done about capitalism right now. But as it brought up a broader left project having policies to talk about and push for in the cur. In the reality of the world. We live in that that's it's not any less valuable than anything else anybody's doing on the political spectrum. Let's just say that it's certainly not undermining any like greater revolutionary energy. It's providing a service. Now you can say it's useless you can make an argument that there's no point at this point in the in the decline of capitalism to even be humoring the notions that we can do any kind of systemic reform to this thing.

There's no reforming this as people like to say and to that I say okay fine but then don't get mad at matt brennan bruning because he doesn't agree and he's not operating from those principles you're essentially yelling at stradivarius because he doesn't make pianos. He is. He does he does wonkery. Therefore he presupposes that you can do some sort of change to capitalism that could move it in the direction of socialism and make people's lives better at the same time. If you say that project is dead you might be right. I might be persuaded but that has nothing to do with what he is saying and getting mad at him is stupid and it's about positioning yourself as somehow smarter or more informed or more right or more good or more virtuous than him in the marketplace of ideas and personalities. That's online and it's because everybody's a idealist everybody is an anarchist at the end of the day. No matter what your tendency is if you've really invested the discourse with meaning in your life. You're an anarchist. You believe that it's all about phase shifting reality through persuading people because how else could you explain using all that time and energy to make arguments on the internet unless you really think if enough people hear you you can convince them to change their beliefs which will somehow change their actions as though their beliefs are not the byproduct of what they have to do to survive or where they find themselves in the in the hierarchy of precarity within neoliberalism. As if that's not what generates their ideology. I'm not I am for.

I mean. I'm projecting in that I'm describing what I'm doing too yes. But I've also accepted that and part of my what I talk about is an attempt to break me and people listening away from the cycle and using examples of how if you don't do that you end up wasting your very life you're not even having the fun you you're not even having the most fun version of of diverting yourself. There are more fun ways to get your rocks off than this. They're more they're less. There are ways that do less to like tighten you up into a ball of anxiety. The way that obsessing about online politics does there are ways to get off that get you off like actually relieve and out end. An orgasm instead of this like agonized edging that is what political ideology as subculture amounts to like go to david buster's for christ's sake virtual dave and busters. My vibes are good. I feel good. I feel pretty good lately. I feel like I'm in a good place. I think part of it is because finally understanding the scope and structure of what I want to put down on paper which I really feel like. I have to do at some point to justify keep doing these because it is indulgent to do. This. Like this is easier than like a harder but maybe more meaningful attempt to express myself could be but as long as I feel like. I'm doing them with a a real near-term goal in mind They're very fulfilling so. I feel good other parts of my life also. I think not coincidentally going better going well because it's just. I'm better able to deal with everything around me including stressful stuff that means I appreciate the good stuff more.

It's good and of course a lot of that 99.9 of that is not me. It's not my mindset. It's my absolutely privileged condition. I'm in a little ball. I'm I'm I'm tucked away. I'm genuinely not affected by this slow motion catastrophe of living in america. It gives me the freedom to work out my stuff and feel and and like you know address my relationship to you know my indulgent artistic pursuit of a career whatever you want to call it and that's you know that really is. I think why I understand people who do turn into the gay state's communism fantasy because they imagine like people who feel are relatively positive within the structure but also feel a sense of guilt and participation and exploitation because they do participate in exploitation and then they imagine well. If everybody could have this we'd be okay. But the problem is this is too bound up in your personal pleasure. It's too bound up in consumption as lifestyle what this is is an atomized de-spiritualized socially dead existence that has to be sustained through the transference of meaning onto objects and then the consumption of those objects the physical pledge using surplus to assuage existential anxiety through consumption is the engine of everyone's idea of what the good life is even mine in my little bubble being my little in my little artisan bubble which of course is still connected to networks of exploitation that I participate in and benefit from and I feel that same spike and you want everybody to feel good like you. But if everybody felt good like you it would be a nightmare because it would require full automation and but it would end up with us being the wali people because we would have no spiritual drive.

It would be. It would be it would it's it's dead like Like that's. The part of you know like the conservative response to to modernism. You know like the the meister reactionary argument against the enlightenment and the french revolution is that you're losing a a felt spiritual communal identity a a a crucial part of life when you pull it pull human existence out of its social embeddedness and the thing is they're right about that. But the problem is there's nothing you can do about it that process is inevitable. We are driven we're going as soon as we accumulated the capital surplus to create the cultural institutions that gave us permission to to hyper exploit. The way capitalism did the technology both in terms of physical things like electricity steam engine whatever metallurgy and then social technologies like the printing press and protestantism and and humanism and yeah the enlightenment as soon as those as soon as those tools exist in the hands of humans. They're going to use them and and accumulating that surplus requires the these the the eviction of people from the rural idiocy of smallholding tenant farming into the urban environment of markets and exchange because that's where surplus gets made or that's where surplus gets gets lived. It gets taken from the country into these concentrated areas and that was going to pull us away from that social network. No matter what the question is how are we going to integrate that you know the the ghost of that into the institutions we were creating and we have had done a bad job so far. But I argue that if we do build any alternative any class collaborative challenge to the existing paradigm it will come with a a spiritual dimension that will be infused throughout its structure whereby and it won't be religion. It will be a civic tr. It will be a civic translation of the old religious feelings. A modernized secularized spirituality that will emerge as a byproduct of and generator of class consciousness and class mobilization. But that's why you that's why that's why we have to work together because it's far too easy otherwise to convince yourself that the perpetuation of a status quo that sees you as a fat happy.

Little sack of of dopamine is actually justice. I don't really have any thoughts about maradona. I'm not a soccer guy. He seemed like a pimp seemed like an absolute pimp. In a legend. The guy was doing bumps after after scoring goals king. Cheated and then kind of admitted it. In the world cup against excuse me. The disgusting english anybody who beats the english is a king of course. I hear. But I'm not a huge huge soccer head. I'm not a footballer mate. I'm not actually a gooner that's a bit when I say that I'm not a gooner. I'm not a bloody gooner mate yeah dudes. Rock has definitely taken a taking it on the chin here with the death of maradona. He's a dude's rock icon. What is a like a jock who embodies all of the most zesty. Hedonistic cliches of the sporting life combined with a you know perhaps theatrical and perhaps indulgent but still deeply felt left-wing religious sentiment. You don't see that too often because it's not like you know yeah yeah like a lot of a lot of famous people have like fake politics just like a lot of non-famous people have fake politics but he was like hanging out with fidel castro that's pretty cool.

It seems like another one of those type of people. They don't make anymore the edges have all been smoothed off somebody asked for a book recommendation on american history which is kind of a hilariously wide topic. But I would say that to cover a subject an area of time that's generally understudied by even like you know casual but serious american history. Hobbyists or or academics or something is the the antebellum period like the development of the of the first two party systems before the civil war and sean williams who is an insufferable lib awful politics but a damn good historian which is you know true of a lot of people. Wrote a book called the rise of american democracy from jefferson lincoln which I think does an incredible good job of laying out the dynamics between the two political party. The political factions that emerge out of the constitutional order He is very clearly pro democracy. He's pro he's in favor of the jacksonian turn. His essential premise is that once the two like factions factional of government like broke up the federalists and the anti-federalists what happened is you saw a general correlation among the federalists and then later wigs with restrictions on the franchise in terms of 

Like I voting poll taxes and you know land ownership requirements. Age limits things like that um and the jeffersonian and the jacksonian party was favored expanding the franchise and that boiled down to The fact and and and and willins is right that you know the democratic urge like if that were going to assign a progressive value to the america's democratic notions of one person one vote that we now sort of take a sacrosanct than that drive even if it was at the behest of a party that was essentially made up of at that point drunk award healing crooks in the in the cities and drunk indian scalping scotch irish psychopaths in the countryside. But they were the people and what they wanted expansion what they wanted land what they wanted the ability to get some to be have no man be. Their master was the democratic impulse and the federalist wiggs who wanted us to hey how about we slow down and build up a little bit.

So we can compete in this new like global politic. This global trade system that we find themselves ourselves in and this like alliance system like we are now part of like an emerging global world system. An economic world system we have to participate in that we're not going to be able to have an actual coherent government power that can compete at the global stage but the people who understood that were people who were at the heart of commerce in cities. Like new york and boston and philadelphia. They weren't out in the countryside which is where the people were breeding like rabbits and more were coming in every day and so these people who had the best interest. I would argue of the the united states as a political project.

Even in addition yes like were they looking to exploit labor absolutely or did. They want to financialize the economy and like bring people under a yoke of like economic compulsion yes. But that's government the only reason that feels like a some sort of norman yoke is because we're operating under the delusional notion of individual liberty that can only be persist in the fake. Eternal expanse of america where everyone has operated off the assumption of land as being infinite. Can you imagine that you could be ungoverned because you could be subsistent. You can live in a current world. You can interact socially you don't have to go back to pre-civilization. You could be civilized but you cannot be compelled because you could always grow your own. Stuff even though to do anything with that to you know buy more to improve your land to inc to acquire the fruits of surplus like the finished goods that you can only get by trading with cities.

Any of that requires cooperation that does involve a alienation of authority to a third party. To adjudicate these. Exchanges you have to give up some liberty and because there were so many people who had an interest in just expansion in its own right. Southern slave occur southern slavercrats who made up the intellectual backbone of this movement by the way they were all southern slave owners who made up the the intellectual heavyweights behind the jeffersonian expression of this political reality. Um demanded this endless expansion but without any ability to hook any of this together internally improve create canals great networks. Create a national debt reduce tariffs between areas so you don't have to pay.

And that's the two-party system. It's the superego and the id with the ego being like the overall project of capital accumulation in north america and that's the party structure and so at that point the democratic impulse which we now which we now post working class as a the rising of the working class and then the arising of racial and gender you know resistance to those hierarchies. Now the democratic experience in our minds is connected to This virtuous sort of you know on the left we'd say like a working class socialist demand for for you know freedom and liberty for everybody meaning a freedom from and a freedom too. But that was not the original conception of american freedom. It has been turned into that or I should say like proletarian like closest thing like mass little guy you know because we all imagine that we're regular people in this country. No matter what we owe that that the definition the democratic definition of who though it is and how we conceive of it is different. It was individual freemason or yeoman families striking out into the wilderness to make unfettered fortunes and so willans is sympathetic to the democrats just on the argument like hey.

This is the democratic impulse you know but there's also a book called what half god wrought by daniel howe that covers the same period but from the point of view essentially like as a as a partisan of the wings and saying that all the stuff that these hillbillies wanted required the creation of these institutions and the thing is that's the way like the reason that this is a dialectical process is because these two things need each other. These two things are inextricably linked but the nature of their the social relationships of the people who live in these in this system. The fact that people who understand the need for trade and the need for strong government and the need for organs of state live in cities all concentrated together sipping tea with one another and the people who think that the next thing the only thing to do is grab. The next acre of land you can find are all just running off into the countryside and just larger in number and only like aggregate through their votes and have no other understanding of a desire other than just personal advancement of their family unit. Their ability to pile up means they have to fight each other even though they need each other and in the fighting you create a new thing and the fighting led to eventual the whole thing blowing up because the sharpening of the contradictions and the civil war which should have like I said and maybe could have without lincoln dying bloggered in a a a self-conscious like. I wouldn't say working class but like proto-proletarian alliance between ex-slaves.

Essentially the mobilized yeomanry and working class of the north in the form of the union army and the republican party against the econ and and hopefully the The small holding and poor white population of the south could be could have united to essentially instead of making a A treaty which is essentially what happened like the united states over the decades of the reconstruction worked out a peace treaty with the southern slaveocracy. The terms of which were all right no more slavery but racial caste system and compelled labor through sharecropping and convict leasing that is equivalent to slavery and then they spit their finger and they that made the deal that was the real end of the civil war. It was the treaty ended with with the real treaty was not in appomattox. It was the it was the 1877 agreement to allow rutherford hayes and the republicans to hold the white house. Even though samuel tilden had won the popular and probably electoral vote in exchange for ending reconstruction that was the real end of the civil war and the reason it ended on. Those terms is because any capacity to create that coalition was destroyed by johnson essentially by immediately reimpo by immediately reimposing in power the former confederate army and the former confederate state apparatus and its ruling class if they had been surrounded. They would have fought back like it wouldn't have been they wouldn't have went meeklis. The reconstruction still would have been violent but the fight would have been essentially a continuation of the civil war which had ended with the north end of dominant position and with this new coalition of forces would have been sufficient to finally win a actual unconditional surrender like the one. U.s. Grant demanded at donelson and then you could have initiated a new conception of liberty and new conception of democratic freedom and built on a structure. A governing structure around that presumption not maintained this news this this this chain around our neck of the constitution which is predicated on this notion of unfettered individual rulership literal ownership. Not just of land of course but of people and the labor of people through direct dominion people. Say won the war lost the peace.

I think that's. I don't know maybe the better way to think about. It is is that the war didn't end until the end of reconstruction like they had a peace treaty and then they negotiated the settlement. Like the tweet treaty of west failure took years you don't say the thing ended until the treaty was signed and the turning point was the lincoln assassination hard to get around that opinion hard to get around that in my mind that that really is like in america history because you look back at what we have and it's like yeah. We really never had a chance did we all. This land drove us insane. All this land is what drove us insane and all this land is what meant that absent lincoln we were bound to do what we did absent lincoln. It was over. They were going to recapitalize the south reconstruct the planter economy which required essentially required compelled labor because it was labor intensive. The thing that ended slavery in the south like the condition of slavery was automation of agriculture. The thing that led to the great migration was the fact that in the 1920s automation had caught up to the agricultural sector to the senate. It was much much less labor intensive to to get the crops that that were able to be grown as staples in the south and that led to a huge reduction in the demand for rural agricultural labor and so black people move to the urban centers to become part of that army of industrial labor.

That's how you create a working class as people move to this from the countryside to the cities for one reason or another either enclosure of some kind or technological change. But it's it's to me. It's easy to imagine a way where if if the coalition of forces in power is different that instead of reestablishing planter agriculture the yeoman model that had settled the north and that the the republicans had extended into the west with the homestead act during the war. Saying go out there grab some land and you stay there. It's yours could have been extended southward but the reason it didn't have to be is because it was able to be extended outward. We could always get more of that yeoman land out there meaning there's no pressure for any kind of internal that means that the ability to just keep the south. As just this cash cow persisted instead of forcing the confrontation over the land because if they've because if yeomanry had been extended through confiscation and distribution of former plantation land the 40 acres in a mule you would have broken up the system the structure of of racial oppression that underlines southern life even if you don't necessarily break up. The the the habits and the important thing is is if you extend this redistribution redistribution of land to poor whites and you make the consequence of the civil war that their lives improve. Then you change the dynamic of every relationship. These people had but also there's those engines those infernal mills out in the east and they demand they demand. They demand.

They demand. They need. Cotton they need staples. They chew them up spit them out. It's not that cold. It's not that cold. It's been a relatively warm november.

I'll say that we've hit it at 60 a couple times. It's going to be 60 the rest of the week. I think this is you know part of our new normal that we all love so much don't we love. It folks. We love it. We love you. It's so warm. I gotta say though that given the pandemic and the quarantine I very much appreciate it because you know. I can only really see people outside and I've been able to see them later than I thought. I would be able to because it was getting really cold a couple weeks ago and I was like damn it. I think I might have had my last outdoor hang and I know. I don't think so. I think there's a few left free state of jones was very disappointing not when I saw it when I it disappointed me essentially as soon as I saw the trailer. I remember hearing the movie was going to be made and being excited about it because that's a very interesting story but sadly the film itself even by the time it came out. I was like oh this kind of looks like they.

The dog mainly just because of how dreary it is like more than anything else more than any historical inaccuracy or anything. It's just very dull. Mcconaughey is just one of those boring righteous kind of gandhi-like hero figures who is very very boring to watch because we're just supposed to observe and bask in his virtue. Like look at this good southern white man which of course the fact that mcconaughey cast himself in that role it really does speak to the lib need. The liberal need to be seen as good that that is like the presiding element of like our culture of liberalism and this is why so many people hate it and think that it's some sort of cultural marxist conspiracy. It's just the incentive structure if all if if if if evil is inherent in our world if we're fallen in the sense that capitalism is real and cannot be changed. Then the only reason that bad things and good things happen is because they're bad people and good people and it's about dividing them into those two groups and then one group kind of yelling at the other group and so part of that is establishing yourself as one of the good ones and here's matthew mcconaughey literally playing a white southerner who sep who leaves the confederate army in order to fight for black liberation in a multi-racial army oh my god.

This is awesome you know it's fast. John brown fills out a very similar character like he's the fantasy of virtue that the guy playing him is imagining he is and the viewer who of course imagines himself as the protagonist imagines that they are. This reminds me of the fact that brad pitt produced 12 years a slave and he also has a role in it. If you've seen that movie there's one scene where brad pitt pays a canadian carpenter who comes to build a a barn on the land of michael. Fassbender's plantation and fastband is this monstrously awful slave owner and all pit does is give a little speech about how he thinks slavery is bad and then he smuggles the letter from a solomon northrop home that gets him sprung out of slavery and so he saves the day. It's like. I'm gonna. We're gonna make and it's hard to not think that he decided to make that movie to do that you know what I mean yeah. It's gonna be 60 on friday. Gonna go to the park. Enjoy it well. It lasts 

I actually just rewatched a little bit of the john adams. Tv series and giamatti is great. But it is just a baffling decision. The fact that they it is. I mean. It's like almost perverse like the gimmick seems to be with john adams that well you guys know all the about the revolutionary war. You know all the cliche stuff right and what about the stuff that like fell through this. The cracks what about the stuff that's like less remembered. Let's appreciate that and it's sort of this and honestly. It's part of that like more than anything. It's part of that cultural turn. In the late 90s the david mccullough.

Stephen ambrose dad history thing of looking back on america and like nodding our heads. We nodded our heads proudly of two things the founding fathers and the greatest generation like for american revolution. The constitution well done and also oh wait way to go with that world war ii. Just this smug self congratulations and that meant there was a bunch of books about the founding fathers and guys like joe. Ellis became household names on the best seller list and mccullough wrote this book about adams and it really did seem to come down to. We know all the big stories so what about one of the less known guys and that what that ends up being is that the documentary or not the documentary the the series. It's six episodes and it's in one of them. He's just like going to france during the revolutionary war to like just curtsy with some guys. Then there's a whole episode where he's the vice president and literally just sitting around and then you know. He's got one episode as the president and then they have an entire episode. That's just him getting old because one of the things about john adams is. He lived to be like 92. He died on the same day as jefferson so they give him a whole a whole episode of him just getting decrepit and it's like there is it more than anything to me.

It says that the received wisdom we have about the greatest the founding fathers like that bad history that wig dad history. We were getting both from school and the culture about that it was so banal was so taken for granted that all they could think to do is just pad this out because like these are interesting questions about the founding of this country. These figures did things that we live with that are interesting and the insistence that the only lens to look through any of history is is through the personal. These are the great guys and gals who made our history because it's a celebrity culture. These were the stars the all the stars are here john adams button gwinnette george picks charles pinckney dewitt clinton elbridge jerry and g smith and the saturday night live bed so all they could do. They could spend an episode on him just his teeth falling out because there's nothing else to talk about. It's like yep. Hamilton said this and then jefferson said this and wasn't it a battle of ideas like it's just vapid but giamatti is very good. The episode where they debate the constitution is pretty good but that's always great like 1776 is a fun movie to watch because that's a really cool story and you got the big big rousing speeches and everything and everyone's sweating and wearing wigs. But that's because we and it in the first episode shows the early in his career moment when he defended the boston massacre british soldiers and that was true because john adams was mr. Damn norms mr two damn norms because the federalist tradition that he helped establish that turned into the whigs and then the republicans then transformed transmogrified into the democrats.

Now is this super ego. This structural. This impulse to build structures of of of coercion but towards a productive goal. Now you can say yes exploitation correct but they're operating in a world where exploitation is inevitable. Exploitation is built into human existence. They do not believe in the transcendental power of a species coming into its own being and why would they they were they were before that was a coherent concept.

They were before the working class had come into its own and brought with them the historical agency that had eluded every other class before them. How would they know not to do that. So they thought they were doing good and and in terms of they were looking out for the best interests of the project of american capital extraction and surplus extraction. And but that means that they're going to restrain things and they're going to adhere to norms and traditions. The id the demand of like the average american. Since that's who now who gets to call the shots is more land please. More land land plan land or if they're stuck in the city in a wage relationship more patronage jobs. My cousin needs to get a job at the at the cholera pit and also more wages at labor jobs at private though eventually as it coheres into a working class.

So that's why I think it's silly to root for one side or another in this stuff and I understand why you have instincts and like in certain cases. I think you should have rooting interests you know like the civil war. That's a clear one but when you're talking about something like you know those jeffersonian and those those revolving conceptions like that generated america's contradictions and then overcame them and created new ones. You can't pick one or the other because they cannot come separated. They're inevitable. I got a polar king. I got the king no I think if you're going to make them. I'm trying to think like if. I wanted to do anything about the founding generation which would be tough because I don't find it terribly interesting because it really was just a bunch of fancy doily boys getting together and creating a play-acting government creating a fake.

A fake little funtime play-doh government because they're their built-in assumption is that the structures they had imposed would limit popular participation in government enough to ensure that it was essentially a a talking house for a what they imagined to be unified ruling class because those morons thought that their their refinement and adherence to values was a byproduct of their social position and that it would be the reality and it would that it would form the reality of their class collaboration forgetting entirely because they couldn't even realize it that no those fancy beliefs you think you hold are generated by your economic interests and those interests are in conflict and as the conflict deepens the ability for these play fake. Pseudo-political institutions to to restrain to Redirect energy and reduce friction is going to collapse and the thing is gonna bust open and it started to shake and shimmer immediately.

I mean they write the constitution bill it writes and then second term third term adams puts out the creates the alien and sedition act. It says it's illegal to say man think bean things about me on the internet because the guy said that I was a hermaphrodite and it's not just like that was john adams the reason it was. John adams is because washington didn't need to do it because he was george washington as soon as he was gone replaced by a reduced figure. A guy didn't have his aura. The game changed and washington himself who by that time had been like converted from a guy who thought he could transcend politics like all these idiots did two. By the end of his second term. A convinced federalist approved of the alien incidion act and the whole thing started breaking apart and the thing that solidified it for a little bit was the twin attack.

The twin moves of the louisiana purchase and then the war of 1812 would settle the boundaries of america in the near term because those were both jeffersonian democratic moves towards accumulation of land so that the yeoman fantasy could be could persist the the myth that greg grandin talks about and those two war. Those two acts created the equilibrium out of the instability of the dem of the conflict between the land-hungry expansion-hungry conflict with indians. Hungry democrats republicans democrat republicans and the federalists who wanted to intensify market financialization and trade specifically trade with england and louisiana purchase bought so much land that it essentially reduced the investment that the jeffersonians had in preserving certain things you know because early on jefferson was freaking out about everything like they opened a post office and he's like this is tyranny because the size of the country like the ability to expand within it was still up in the air. How are they going to limit like the war kind of started the revolutionary war. The real starting pistol was the proclamation of 1763 which set the appalachian mountains as the limit of colonial expansion into north america that was as soon as that happened conflict between the united states and great britain was inevitable and they were worried about that happening again like the worry about tyranny that that moved. Jefferson was really a worry about the federal government in the form of this merchant tile class in the new england and new york limiting our ability to grow the way that the british had and louisiana purchase relieved a lot of that pressure. Now. Louisiana purchase also got it into the huds of the democrats that we could have the whole thing which led to the war of 1812 which was a democratic attempt to take canada that was why we really went. To war in 1812.

I know they say impressment of sailors in the history books. But that's like how they say that we went to world war one because of the lusitania. Even though that happened two years before we declared war and the lusitania was sunk in 1915. In 1916 woodrow wilson ran for reelection on a campaign slogan of he kept us out of war that's how much the lusitania was in people's minds when they were voted for president and then a year later. But anyway. It's like one of those justice stories. The real thing was canada. We got louisiana. We're gonna get. We're gonna extend freedom our ability to persist in a fantasy of freedom north and then it was the war of 1812. It discredited the federalists because they freaked out so bad that the first real secession movement in america was the hartford convention of federalists and high federalists from new england who contemplated a secession of the united states in protest of the war of 1812. Because they wanted to make a trade union with britain. They did not want to fight britain and then it was the terms of the war of 1812 which was essentially okay never mind. It was a slap of the hand getting out of the cookie jar from the uk like okay you you got it. You got it. You got louisiana. You're done and that satisfied the wig of the federalists and you got that brief little moment of fantasy.

The era of good feeling the last time that the president ever ran for election effectively. Unopposed was james monroe's re-election campaign in 1820 and that was because the the actual material underlying conflict between the two factions was momentarily at a stalemate. What broke the stalemate was the explosion of the profitability of cult of cotton cultivation in the south because that first generation of of of democrats the jeffersonians were all operating at some level on the assumption. That slavery was a short-term solution that it would give way over time because it was its profitability was limited for one thing. It was deeply extractive and damaging to the soil that it operated in which means there was a shelf life.

Of there was there was a limit to how long you could actually get get profit out of particular acreages and it was incredibly incredibly labor intensive things like the cotton engine and other and the opening of international trade and the infusion of capital into the south made it more profitable and what that meant was that slavery became more salient as an economic system separate from the greater american political economic system like the free labor that operated that that the assumptions of government within constitution assumed because slavery was just sort of left as this thing that existed but was unaddressed in the constitution because they could they had they couldn't get an agreement on it. So they just punted it but they figured it's okay. We'll always be able to figure it out because it's always going to be this little tea room full of fancy lads which had immediately broke up into a real political fight because there were real stakes which they didn't. Assume would exist because they were dumb asses because they were idealist dumbasses but you can't blame them because they had to act that way. The constitution had to be what it was at the time because of the unique situation that the united states was being formed out of states that were separate imagined themselves to be separate organized governmentally separately and had this conflicting economic interests conflicting populations for conflicting.

Not I'm not and or at the very least somewhat different cultures and none of them with the power to militarily overall any of the others they had to compromise. Like everything we got in the constitution we had to get it should have been destroyed by the civil war like the order that that it had supported until then when it no longer when it failed to The it's. The constitution failed its first real stress test and the fact that we've had like a synthesized like completed bourgeois revolution after after reconstruction ended and we haven't had that like degree of conflict within the body politic until now we've gone this long without it happening again. But it's built in. It's built in and like this this presidency. This biden trump biden presidency where he's the pr. He's the king and mitch. Mcconnell is the prime minister and there's a global pandemic and economic collapse happening. I don't know how it'll be very interesting to see. I say that's for sure it's it's going to take another stress test.

That's for sure hell yeah 666 viewers oh my god somebody's talking about who's most evil it doesn't matter. Man andrew. Jackson profoundly evil person but his position in society. His position within cap the emerging system of of ex of surplus extraction that was being created in north america. The great project that he was part of threw him up because he fit the moment he was willing to do the things that the moment demanded so yes evil but because the times were evil the times are always evil. The people in the positions of power are there because they accommodate and support evil.

They have made the choice they've justified it in their mind somehow either by being a sociopathically self-absorbed or if they're a nice tea drinker and a nice well-behaved boy or girl a nice sublimated individual. They convince themselves. It's because they're a smarter good person and that they've made the right choice and that hey this is bad but it could be worse and if it wasn't me. It'd be somebody who's less smart who's less compassionate like I like obama and they're all going to be empty shells. They are empty gels that just contain the evil of the age to direct it. That's all they are if they weren't. They wouldn't be. There they would not seek the job. They would not have made the compromises they made in their lives. They were only able to do that because they were steamrolling over their own human impulses they were steamrolling over their awareness of any connection. They had to anybody but themselves and the the thing is is that that is the reason they're in that position. Those exalted positions is that we're selecting for that behavior in our social order in our in our economic order. So those will be the people who will rise so their evil is to be assumed. It's not to be judged one against the other. The times are what determine the degree of like vileness. The degree of per like personal sadism is is honestly secondary to the whole thing and usually a byproduct of the trauma of of living in those times which were more which were less civilized than ours.

Because like andrew jackson is the only president who ever actually led a couple of slaves on the natchez trail actually leading slaves to a market. He did that the only president we know of and also of course. The only president murdered people in a duel including one duel where he basically cheated by wearing a very bulky coat and standing to the side and then shot the guy in the dick but that was a time of slave coughless and dick shooting. So only one good at scuffling. Slaves and shooting dicks will rise people who I think a lot of people like to think about the evil of great figures of history because they imagine well I might not be consequential. I might not be remembered. My life might be filled with frustrations and failures and inadequacy but at least I'm a good person well. Your goodness is I mean in a way yes like you can't bring yourself to do the things these people can do and that does make you a better person but also you probably didn't find yourself in a position where making the wrong choice was that easy. If you're born into wealth and privilege you can do the wrong thing very easily. It's harder to do you have to commit to doing the wrong thing if it's work. That's why a generation of that's why the aj soprano syndrome. That's what the fail sons are you're not willing to do what it takes to make it in this world. This sociopathic hell realm and so but you're also addicted to the pleasure of it. You're addicted to the consumer indulgence the soparific of consumption and ease of life. So you don't push through to find something place someplace where you can affect work and challenge yourself to do an alternative and so hunter.

Biden is a perfect example of this he couldn't do that like beau biden was evil bo biden got one of the dupont scions a sweetheart epstein level deal for raping his child. His three-year-old child. He uses a and your families they would. They would they would allow a dupont to bring a truck to your house and waterboard you with teflon because he was going to be president. Someday oop oh got to answer cancer bro oh owned. Hunter had every chance to do what beau wanted to do but he couldn't bring himself but he was too addicted to ease to do anything hard. So what did he do instead the second easiest thing destroying yourself with drugs and sex as a distraction and of course as a way to punish yourself because in the long run you only get more miserable because those pleasures lose their luster over time inevitably and the thing is is that that's really the choice we have because we live so atomized lives because the alternative like doing a life living a life where you can find meaning through labor.

Not necessarily the work you do to live but like a work towards making the world better. We're working towards a world where your labor is less exploited and you have more free time and you're more free from alienation. You can put that energy there if you think that if there's a if there's a path before you that can plausibly get you to that you can always choose that the problem is for millions of americans because of our social atomization because of the decline in the collapse of those working classes any kind of self-organizing principle within a society without a self a self-aware identity. All the options are be evil or do nothing be evil or distract. Yourself be evil or delude yourself be evil or drown your brain in in fantasia and and um and rude pleasure and find yourself hating yourself every moment of it but with and more over time. Because the third option the channel of those things into you know meaningful rewarding soul crafting work is not as real. In fact it's invisible you would have to talk to other people you'd have to live near other people you'd have to live for and with other people in order to spark that as an option and instead we don't have that we have this despair and and the you either despair or you sell yourself. You you despair or you. You you kill something within yourself. You cut you sever the ties that bind you to everyone else like jd vance and hillbilly elegy where he's that whole movie is just him severing the connections between him and everyone who ever loved him so that he can get ahead and that's why he's the disgusting reptilian scumbag.

He is now if he'd stayed with that family. It's not like he would have had a good life. He probably would have ended up drinking turpentine and dying of fentanyl addiction. That's because those are your options. Some people get out some people may if they have like an extraordinary drive or talent. They are aware of and have an ability to pursue that isn't interrupted or destroyed by happenstance. They can make out of there but those are the broadly the two options you have and like if you choose to kill that part of you and you are adept at the rituals of you know the managerial class you go to college and you come out a dull-eyed liberal or conservative freak and you channel that freaky tude into some sort of political sadism and a life-pursuing misery for everybody. If you don't you come out stunned and stunned and and failed to launch and you just go back to your mom's basement or you.

 curl up and you retreat to the internet and and sucker your fantasies of virtue because you are unable to find a virtuous life within the options given to you and that's most people and then there are the very few lucky who are able to marry any kind of you know autonomy to marry participation in the market with the ability to maintain any spiritual connection to the world around you and the people around that's very difficult but the people who are successful for the people who decide can't beat them join them and cover cut the connection. The ones who go to college that's your ruling class. That's your managerial ruling class. Those are your democrats the ones who reject it either because they aren't able to apply themselves intellectually in the way that they want. They can't sit there and type. They can't get enough words per minute. They don't understand what they can't get their head around the technical elements or they can't get their head around the rituals of etiquette. They either what maybe they if they if they have hustle and and connections and luck maybe. They start a boat ownership place maybe maybe yeah. Like these are the beautiful voters the non-college educated wealthy people who make up the base the most consistent base of trump support but also the ones who don't vote for trump but maybe have you know a hvac job or something like that a few remaining working class work with your hand jobs that that are available to people but then the rest. If you have cut the connection you are going to be a criminal you're going to take your disregard for social forms out on the society itself. Which is a all of these are the rational response to the horrors that we're dealing with that's the monstrosity of it. So lucky. My brain happens to have the right shape to make tech money correct. You have nothing to do with it. Wherever you are in this hierarchy. It is. It's the a throw genetic dice and not just genetic dice. The dice the gene the genetic dice of everyone you grew up around and with and interacted with who shaped you in the way they did so.

Only podcasters are virtues is what I'm saying no. I'm not see once again. None of this is about virtue. None of this is about virtue. No one is anywhere that they are because of virtue that's the fantasy of neoliberalism. Neil is a neoliberalism yeah.

You see this random spray of people where a bunch of people are miserable all the time and a relatively small handful of people get to hold on to some little chunk of indulgent pleasure on the top end of a distribution curve yeah. That's awful but at base some of them are there because it's all there all of them are there for a reason and it makes sense and as matt iglesia said about buildings collapsing in bangladesh. It's okay because the liberal and and the conservative says yeah smart people succeed but dumb people fail and if that's if that distributes itself along racial lines. Well facts don't care about your feelings look at this iq chart if you're conservative. You say or if you're a liberal like you say yes people are suffering why well if it's if you remember a minority group. It's because of racism that's too bad. But it's also part of our society darn oh between the world and me am. I right folks and now we even are expanding that to white people with the kill billy elegy which is hillbilly elegy is a perfect copy of a white version.

A white like identity palette a a white scotch irish id paul like lived experience version of like a one of those movies that's essentially a an extended college admissions essay like about about like antoine fisher about somebody struggling from poverty and then finding success in the marketplace because of their stick-to-itiveness. Their their adherence to good values in the face of trouble and in the in the racialized narrative that liberals imbibe these people break out their families are held back by racism and the legacy of racism and you watch that and you go damn. That's too bad but the system can still reward somebody who has something else. These virtues and those virtues make him worthy in a way that even the people that we pity who don't make it. We can't aren't worthy nobility instead of it being racism. It's well the factory weapon. It's a wave towards class like they're poor why they're poor. We're not going to talk about it because we can't reduce it to racial category which is what we like to describe things with. Because we want to be liberal. We want to make it about personal animus. We want to make it about beliefs and ideas. That's why people treat each other the way they do not material conditions generating relationships between people that they then follow like like scripts that are determined by relationships. Material relationships. No no no.

It's personal ideas so but so they just say they're poor as an identity poor is an identity like fried bologna sandwiches and swimming in the creek. This is these are class markers the same way that like hair braiding and you know cookouts are in you know like menace to society or or boys in the hood or something and there are the people who fail and struggle even though they should succeed. But it's just there's something going on with them like amy adams his mom in the hell billy allergy. She's smart. She's a nurse but she's heroin addicted and why is she heroin addicted. She's just she didn't have the strength she wasn't. She was. She blamed other people and she was something wrong with her. Jd. Vance doesn't do that he's a good person he's better than her. He is better than her in a fundamental way and I say there's no virtue. Here no virtue. I am not virtuous in the sense that you're trying to talk about the alternative to submitting either to becoming evil or to being just ground to dust is to fight and we don't know how to fight.

But I am saying we will learn to fight but not through thinking it out on here not through hashing it out on here not through pushing anybody to the left or building meme armies or determining the correct position on your shoes. It's going to be. It's going to be stiffening the sinews with a lived experience ironically enough of struggle success. Not if not successful struggle hopeful a struggle with a horizon instead of just the the the seeming over determined cascade of misery that surrounds us this sense that before us everything is impossible and yeah. If you step back it all looks impossible. It looks like an impenetrable forest but you've got to get closer to find the chinks in the army to find the exhaust port to shoot the. Missile into the death star with and you're only going to be there if you're there not here all right guys. My battery is almost gone so. I gotta go peace and chicken grease.
