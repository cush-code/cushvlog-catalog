Under the Boardwalk down by the sea yeah yeah on a blanket with my babies. Under the Boardwalk we'll be having some fun. Under the Boardwalk we'll be falling in love under the Boardwalk. We'll be eating some cheese under the Boardwalk yeah just you and me Under the Boardwalk Boardwalk. Oh it smells of french fries. They sell under the poor walk down by the sea.

Here oh yeah on blanket with my bare bears hi everybody yes as I said on the show Great Lakes Federation. It's inevitable it will be the see here's how I see it breaking down the United States collapsing from the in from the center. As all great Empires do the decline of central authority to be replaced by regimes of regional Authority and I see that as you're gonna have big swaths of just uninhabited area where people are going to be they're going to flee the ones who stay are going to live in abjection of those who get out are going to be rounded up probably and into migrant camps of some kind. Then you're going to have hugging the coasts some concentration I would but I think and and then maybe in like Southern Florida. Just the tip that gets like damned up you get like city-states. You know like like Northern Italy New York Miami Caribbean ones and then you're going to have a land-based great lakes Confederation that's going to be able to hold a significant chunk of territory well. I think inevitably coming to some sort of political I don't know either a merger or annexation or merger with or annexation of Canada and then Canada and then that Great Lakes Canadian Confederation can sort of be the new Holy Roman Empire and then city-states on the coast and then you know a few vestiges of like local Authority. You know dukedoms baronis as they call them in the Dark Tower.

 Texas would be. I think will be some sort of if we do end up with like a formal regime of like military rule. Popular military rule not just like a a military dictatorship with no Civil Society but a popular military. Regime you'd have that most likely to emerge in Texas but of course. A big chunk of that place will be literally uninhabitable and there'll be at some sort of constant Warfare to Mexico in some form or another. That's for sure that border is going to be a blood bath that's going to be just a the Rio Grande is going to be running. Red. I think all those all those Midwestern states are the ones bordering the Great Lakes. Anyway are really going to have to come together get over their Petty sports related conflicts and become unified because they're going to come for that water if they are if they are going to take that water if you let the California if they let them divide the Midwest. The Californians. Colorado whoever else Arizona They're Gonna Take It but if they hold on to it that will mean the death of the Southwest. You know that's the thing and if the Southwest dies then the people are going to scatter back and probably be rounded up processed in some way turned into economic units with less rights than people who are already living there all right yeah. They're gonna have to get over like Packers Vikings rivalry. All this petty Ohio State Michigan if there was some way that we could cut Indiana out of it that would be nice but sadly they're right.

There they got a prime chunk of real estate there but God damn Indiana wow like if you you look at the Great Lake States. The outlier the cruddy one is Indiana and then yeah I know people say oh what about Ohio whatever you say is bad about Ohio multiply that by 10 million and you've got Indiana oh the people talk about Ohio. It's like you Ohio because it's relatively large and it has that very odd german-esque diffusion of urban areas instead of concentration that makes it kind of interesting. It gives a different. Regional flares like Cleveland is a Rust Belt State through and through or Rust Belt City through and through Dayton is a classic overgrown land-grant college town and Cincinnati is the Southern State basically or southern city essentially but Indiana is just It has Indianapolis which is the boringest major city in America. It's the only one not near some significant body of water. Architecturally. Brutal is just like looks like a bunch of charging like phone chargers sitting up and then of course. Gary the the most devastated Rust Belt hellscape you could find. It's it's brutal Indiana and yet there's they got that Coastline so they have to be in on the deal annoying they really shouldn't get full sovereignty though they should become a vassal. Don't say you can't hear me smart alec. I know that's not true. I know it doesn't just go out so suck me from back.

Now California does have a lot of agriculture. They've got that arable land they're Ukraine but if they need water that's a different story. Now the thing is though global warming has now changed weather patterns so that now this last season we have had significant sustained rainfall in California well beyond historical norms and building snowpack that's been lost over decades. If that is a semi-permanent feature. Then California can really punch if they're if they can have some sort of access to their own water and honestly if they really if California was like okay. We're going to be a state no. Around we got to be a functioning polity how are we going to do it. They really could because a lot of that water that gets wasted a lot of that water that gets used in California is used for the growing of cash crops like pistachios and Avoca and almonds in the Central Valley. You don't have to have those things you can say no now of course.

We can't say no because our systems will not allow us to address any core problems with our system but if if the knife of necessity gets to your neck Maybe holding on to a organized State supersedes keeping the thing in half which should be very funny. I think California is a contender the Pacific Northwest. I honestly feel like that Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest getting pulled into a political orbit of China if China is able to power project like if we're assuming that America's fall is does not mean China has fallen. The China is still you know moving through xi's plans for the future if China is still it would at that point be that new hegemon and I would be able to make hegemonic influence. I think it would have be able to make its biggest alliances its biggest influence in that Pacific Northwest region from British Columbia down to Oregon and then California would I think be smart to become not if not a vassal a junior partner in an alliance. Then you've got the military 

[10:08](https://youtu.be/9vYPdSioi_c?t=10m08s)

 Conquest state of Texas. You got the climate Wasteland belting a lot of that. Maybe Denver probably holding out of some sort of city-state based on the airport Pacific Northwest Chinese Bridgehead to North America. Then the North the the Great Lakes Canadian Imperium. There the South probably a bunch of private small private regimes like a techno and a self-conscious attempt to reinfo pose like some sort of feudal relations. But it's just this sad farago and in reality. It's there's just cosplaying on top of the same. Supply chain that the rest of capital is and like the capital does still exist there. We'll still be doing that real question is what happens to the nukes that is the most important question. The only real question what happens to the nukes and this is where I think the federal government does come in unable to govern in any meaningful way. The United States unable to compete with these new local forms that have emerged out of the collapse of the legitimacy of the central Authority. You will have what I've said it before the United States military as an independent Force I think at some point that military infrastructure gets taken over not by any of the competing powers in the continent. But rather is deemed commission decommissioned by the new chinese-led global economic order. Now whether or not that succeeds or there's a failure to collect all the nukes then Katie Barr the dang door but it's gonna be interesting that's for sure and none of us. Talking right now will probably live to see any of that. But we could and if we did this is the funny thing. This is what must be understood the thing I'm describing to you well from this angle.

That's the post-apocalypse right. It will not be experienced subjectively as such because the parts that fall into apocalypse the climate zones of death and the the liminal spaces that are contested over the people who are there get written out of the narrative. They get written out of the sub the culturally expressed subjectivity of Americans. They're off the table who the people still on the table are those who are surviving Within These rapidly changing institutions and while they might be changing rapidly by historical speeds by personal experience if you stay inside the zone of law. If you if you stand on the right side of the gambin blade that's coming to chop the homo saucers and separate them from the citizens. Frosty your life is the same as it is now you are. You are engaged in the same basic job in the same basic relationship to Capital your neighbors. The same mediated passive specter spectative reality and that's what I mean when I say the apocalypse has already happened and cannot happen again because we missed our chance to do anything collectively other than nuke ourselves and that's why the nuke really might be the end of this because pressing that button at a certain point becomes existential defense survival against extinguishment not of the self but of the concept of self and the concept of the embedded world that you represent because we are locked in a ethos of debt right.

Everybody owing something to somebody. Our economy is driven by the the settling of weight debts and the accumulation over time of debt and also interest on the other side of the scale. Historically cyclically in pre-capitalist systems. The in the ancient world there would be periodic moments of Jubilee where all deaths would be wiped clean so that the social order could be maintained because if you have too much debt accumulated for too long and the continued expectation to have to pay it back at a certain point. Full alienation between the debtor and the dead accumulates a recognition that there can never be redress and never be a end to a subservient relationship emerges and when that happens you have people in file in opposition to each other and the the social order that there are they're part of the Jubilee is necessary to stabilize that relationship and keep people moving through it. And when you don't have that outlet your social order collapses it happens everywhere it's happened every time. The debt-based social order has can only lead to collapse because there is no one in a position of power who can call a jubilee because they owe somebody too. There is no one who just holds the debt the debt is held abstractly. The debt is held by the by the machine it's held in the memory of the machine. It is not a human possession so that means All Humans owe no one can say let there be a resolution. To this let. Us have a jubilee because no one can be forgiven and since you can't be forgiven can I accept being willfully deciding to not be on the top of the social pyramid. Anymore can I willfully step down and be socially dominated. In addition to being dominated by the abstract algorithm. No I would rather die on my own terms and end the human pageant in my through my experience like if everybody dies with me. Then I will avoid judgment now and forever in the minds of of future people because there won't be any at least that's what you're hoping when you press the button.

I mean Putin is a very good case for this because you've got a guy who is he's getting older. Covet probably seemed to push his wig back a little bit and freak him out about his mortality. He's become a germaphobe if he wasn't before he knows that full enthrallment full surrender of national wealth. However you want to Define Nation to International capital is inexorable and NATO is just the tip the the material tip of the Spear of it. It's it's a all-consuming process that's mostly happening on. In It's mostly happening in ledgers and books of account and if that's the case if you don't do anything if you don't move off of your spot you will be destroyed. Then you gotta try something to validate your own worth how what are you worth if you will not act at the final moment. Now the problem is is that we have a subjective understanding of like how much danger we're in personally and existentially. That is not necessarily a reflection of the real threat that is grounded by the comparing the notes of your experience to other people and the higher up you get into a system like that A A personalist regime that has to hold in its person together all of these insanely destructive and termite-like contradictions of this of this state. This National project that is also just a pure oligarchy. Then you're going to lose it a little bit and you're going to decide I gotta do something because even if it brings everything down it will be on my terms rather than the terms because it is not defeat that we fear it is It is Conquest. It's being. It's it's not being losing in battle. It's being changed into a condition of servitude where a certain fundamental element of our sense of self-worth and identity is taken from us by our consent to be dominated which is what comes after defeat which is why if you launch a nuke you don't have to worry about Conquest because it's all over and so if if they can get Putin to climb down here without launching any nukes that will be a sign.

That maybe there still is a guard rail there at least for now but who the hell knows about the future I'm vibing though because I really have detached my need for the human project as such to be continuous in my mind plausibly and for like life to have meaning. And I think that is a big problem is that people feel like if if I don't believe that I'm contributing to a project that I can imagine extending outward. Beyond me for a significant period and transforming into something better and more than what I am now then what was the point of anything what is the point of anything and I say the point is never made by that that fantasy of the future that is only a reflection of of the life that you're living moment to moment. What you think you're moving towards or hoping for is also being reflected in your thoughts and actions in your life. So if you're like oh no it's not there we won't get there. What's the point the answer is it's here right now in everything and every every moment. Every moment of experience has the potential to shine with that light to to reflect that Eternal Vision and the actions that you would do with a belief in your heart that that thing will exist or a belief that it won't would be the same if you're attentive to what is happening to you now instead of deciding oh what difference does it make. It makes a ton of a difference because it's your life. You are given the chance to be the eyes of God the taste buds of God.

It's an insane an insane gift and so that means everything has meaning. Everything is charged brimming with with breathtaking meaning. Every moment is and your desire to imagine a future for Humanity. It's not as though that thing has to be made in order to mean that the thing you're in your heart is real. No the feeling is the real thing The Sensation that drives you to act out of hate be cheesy but love that is the real thing that is the Eternal thing. That's the thing that by definition must have happened somewhere in some way that we are in touch with and if they don't launch the nukes well then holy crap look what could happen wow shucks. Now we've created a blueprint for future Humanity in our in in some some small way some something that will Echo and I honestly think it will regardless but because you know you can't step in the same river twice the reason. For that. There's this overwhelming despair is that we create we we kill we Dethrone God as a belief in anything outside of ourselves belief in the reality. Like the fundamental reality of the subjective experience of others we kind of got rid of that and we replaced it with a totally sensuous personalized I self that it might believe in God. It might not but it doesn't matter because regardless it is a fundamentally antagonistic relationship between the subjective individual and everything else including God God is unknowable and separate from us. That is the definition of any God that that we claim to really believe in and that's what fuels The that's why modern religion cannot actually be.

[26:48](https://youtu.be/9vYPdSioi_c?t=26m48s)

The solvent be the the thing that reduces pain the Opium that Marx talked about it can't even operate as opium they had to switch to Fentanyl which is Sensational pleasure. Sensational pleasure is the sacred Sensational pleasure is the holy. Sensational pleasure is what is to be sought and that worked as long as there is a horizon of future greater sensory pleasure because we know it very quickly where the the pleasure wears off because you're moving through time conditions change. You're really just trying to ignore a hole in yourself try to pass stack. These things up so it gets old quickly which means you've got to keep moving towards greater the hedonic treadmill and that Horizon powered capitalism across the entire Globe. But now it has foreclosed. There is no way that you can promise anyone in the sensory enjoyment pleasure.

 God seek and worship of the West. You can't. It's no longer powered by a belief that contrib contribution and perpetuation of the system as it currently exists. We'll provide you with that and so now we're just in this. Panic mode banging against the glass cages that we all live in frantic like canaries in a coal mine because in the absence of of that Horizon then you're only left with the diminishing pleasures of life and the increasing knowledge of One's Own mortality and of the the ephemerality of everything that you've spent your life pursuing how do you deal with that Gap. That is the famed midlife crisis is that emergent Gap as you wear out. The pleasures wear out. They're welcome and there is that the the search for meaning is what's driving this. These religious frenzies that are now not religious anymore so much as political because we still only really believe in the sensory pleasure as as goal as Freedom. As self self-identification. We still believe in that we. Just want we just now want to change the system to give it back to us. So it takes this political term like Q Anon which is really is a consumer revolt. Among Americans who were like I have completely absorbed the idea that the definition of freedom is my freedom to consume. That is I've fully internalized that as the sum of my Will To Power is my will to consume.

But I am now in a situation where I cannot hope to consume any more than I am or any more pleasurably than I am now and in fact only to do less so this is unacceptable I am going to stop it and since I'm just an isolated cons media. Determined mediated creature I'm going to turn it into a a narrative a fun story to tell myself to keep me from actually doing anything which would take me off of the treadmill which I'm terrified to leave and yeah conspiracies just re reinforce the consumer model because it it takes you from a point of action. This system doesn't provide for me anymore and turn it into oh. Here's why this story and I have to now instead of doing something about it. I have to go and read about this story and watch stuff about this story and then tell other people about this story because how do all conspiracy theories and the fantasy of the end of all conspiracy theories is not people coming together and acting in any way. It is some truth coming to light and kicking all of our institutions which have perpetuated all this awfulness kicking them into 

It's like when they take the Krusty the Clown doll and switch it so it's not here's your problem. Somebody put this doll to evil like they just take the institutions of governments like a senate committee hearings and and the media and they just turn them into weapons for good because everyone finds out the truth but everybody knows as Leonard Cohen says all this stuff. Everybody knows what they do what they don't know is what to do about it and focusing on conspiracies allows you to avoid that question but again it's It's entertainment is the thing and that's fine it. Just it doesn't work as a political organizing tool and it needs to be understood. That way. Man I cannot believe that the Chinese ended the yemeni war is that actually happening wow I mean it. It wasn't you look at it now and it's like well. This was inevitable wasn't it because you had a situation that was fundamentally untenable in the Middle East. You had these this Rising these Rising Powers fueled by oil money creating a a regional conflict power block conflict broadly the Shia Crescent versus the Gulf States but and like fighting over the Levant and stuff and of course then America's Colonial Outpost in Israel and this is an obviously an incredibly important geostategic region.

That's got all the oil the U.S tries to the thing is the U.S during the Cold War. The U.S and the Soviet Union were both sponsors of different states within this conflict but many of the states themselves would play both sides against the middle to try to further their own more narrow goals which is how these relationships work. Then the Soviet Union ended and it was this Euler polar thing where now the United States is supposed to be the Arbiter of disputes that it is a participant in because of course. There is this the U.S as a government actor with alliances and interests can't be administering these International institutions that goes against the concept of internationalism and that alienation builds at the heart of these relationships and the United States becomes an absolutely a useless broker. It cannot be considered an honest broker in any negotiations. So the all. This stuff goes nowhere China over there so a a guarantor of something because it's a huge. It doesn't have military bases in the Middle East. But it's a huge consumer of energy and it has its own willingness to build energy infrastructure. So they are now able to come onto the scene without any previous alliances without any assumed bad faith and they can do things that the United States is even though they're supposed to be the hegemon incapable of doing even if they wanted to.

It does feel like yeah. China's gonna China's going to continue being a thing after the United States has stopped being a thing now what that means I don't think it means we get socialism. More likely. I think it means that Humanity churns its way back down to a new equilibrium between human population technology and resources. I don't know what that is. I don't know what the ratio is but then in that new Arrangement which breaks up previous political identities and and Concepts. Although probably leaves you know um geography as the print you know people place where people are now will be. The place people are still in the future even if there's fewer of them and then out of that will emerge a new relationship between the individual the social order technology ecology. Now we can will it be just a return to barbarism with robots or will the experience of having churned through the world as we have provide fertilizer to allow for new shoots to grow. I suspect that is how it works because it's how it's worked up until now. The only difference is that the human Stakes are higher than ever because we now for the first time have a truly global economic and ecological end state and we don't have an experience for that and the totalizing nature of that paralyzes us. But the thing is that totalizing effect it masks the still significant domination of place in the existence of a space-time that defines this Dynamic. We forget that because we live so much in the etheric plane foreign.

[38:30](https://youtu.be/9vYPdSioi_c?t=38m30s)

But when that Center collapses energy goes inward everywhere I'm looking forward to the Great Lakes Holy Roman Empire I have to say because it does really work like Ohio. Okay let me try to let me think of this. What what what what states would they be and I do that. I might actually save this for the hell of presidents wrap-up episode that we're going to be recording I think next week. But I'll I will follow up on that now but right then but right now. I'm I'm just trying to think what would be the equivalence to the Holy Roman Empire within like what would Ohio be. I think my gut says Ohio is Saxony. Big filled with medium-sized cities. No one big one known for partying. I think Wisconsin I think Wisconsin is Bavaria. Illinois is probably Austria Chicago is Vienna and then what would Michigan be. Then is Michigan the palatinate maybe. It's Bohemia oh yeah. I think Michigan's Bohemia but I'll think more about this and display my findings on the recap episode. I think California is Spain. Florida is the Italian city-states for sure you know what I think New York is the Dutch same as it ever was back time is a flat circle and New England is old. England Pacific Northwest is France. No I would say that the Appalachians are the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth the the Wilder to the the the less developed areas where where more formerly feudal regimes rule oh that's interesting the Appalachians. As as Switzerland. I don't know maybe the Ozarks or Switzerland. I don't know Texas is. Is Texas the Ottoman Empire. I think Texas might be the Ottoman Empire yeah. The Appalachians are the Balkans that's right because they're not formally part of the Holy Roman Empire I mean Croatia was and Croatia could be like Eastern Ohio. You know like by Athens which is which is pretty appellation and then the rest of the Balkans is is yeah. That's the appellation and then yeah Texas as like a military expansionist State there to the south of them. That's that's the Ottomans for sure Cajuns as their conquered janissaries absolutely thank you Andrew Turner 2125. That's very good.

No Chicago is Vienna because it's the biggest city. It's dominant like Chicago is. It dominates the economy of the Upper Midwest. The same way that Vienna dominated the empire like it's the it's the Imperial seat I mean and it it wasn't as much of an economic domination. But that's because now we live in a more economically dominated time. So take the authority vested in the in the emperor in the Habsburg headquarters and compare it to the commercial power that Chicago wields oh Detroit. That's a good one yeah Detroit I guess to be Prague. Maybe since well. Michigan is Bohemia all right. I'm gonna get a map I'm going to get a map of the United States and I'm going to draw it out and I'm going to decide who's everybody in the the new Holy Roman Empire of North America. It would be funny if there was still a president during this period and there honestly could be you know and it's just like Matthew McConaughey's Jr or something. It's just a pure celebrity and the elections are just a fun ritual that everybody participates in but all the real energy is in local political rituals of one kind or another.

Now of course. I'm not going to make it by state. This is going to be chunks of states because it's not going to just be the big chunks on the map I mean even the American Civil War really wasn't like that you do get a false impression when it's like here are the here are the gray States. In here the blue States for one thing huge chunks of those blue of those gray states were occupied for the whole War so they never even were under Confederate territory. Secondly the up country parts of all of these states meaning the counties up in the hills in the Appalachians in the Smoky Mountains then to the Ozarks across even Northern Alabama and Mississippi and Georgia. There the population was overwhelmingly pro-union anti-secession and disproportionately deserted from the Confederate Army avoided service in it or formed Guerrilla groups to defend themselves against the Confederate forces. West Virginia seceded from the rest of Virginia to avoid leaving the union that's why West Virginia it is. It actually was unconstitutionally ratified and they never even changed that they never got went back and made it legal and that's like that sort of visualization does a lot to clarify what the war was about. So you take that real map of the Confederacy. These gray lowlands and these blue ridges and you say what is different about these two areas and the answer is immediately clear plantation-based slavery cannot and is not practiced in those hilly areas. Whereas it dominates completely the economy of the low-lying areas and so in places where the slave economy is overwhelming and dominant and hegemonic. You have political systems organized around hostility in the central government and eventually secession where the social organs are dominated by people who are not planters and don't depend on planters for their livelihood. People who are for the most part small dirt farmers who have a hostile relationship to large Planters as competitors those people had no stake in the Confederate system and resisted it and made up a decent chunk of Republican voters in the immediate aftermath of reconstruction. A lot of those scalawags that are are blamed as awful opportunists who help the Damn Yankees destroy the South were actually up country farmers who resented being dominated by some Veranda drinking a mint julep and the one of the big lost opportunities of reconstruction is if there had been fundamental Land Reform and a redistribution of land to white and black landless farmers. In the south. You could have built a multi-racial democratic political culture. Now that's a huge if and we came very we didn't even come close to doing that but there were moments. There were opportunities where that could have been pursued. The big one is not dispossessing the former slaves who had been granted land in South Carolina by the march by the Sherman campaign through the South which had all these escaped slaves following in their path and wanted to be rid of them. Here just take some land that could have been the nucleus of a grounded durable political culture and if it had been joined by redistribution of land and resources to the up country. You could have had a situation where the best interests.

The perceived best interests of poor Southern whites specifically ones in the up country who are who didn't have the experience of fighting for the Confederacy would have could have perpetuated political power but the entire project was sabotaged by Johnson. People want to say Johnson wasn't that responsible for the failure of reconstruction because within it when Congress comes back after letting him have that year for presidential reconstruction. They immediately overturned everything he did and they and they overturn all of its vetoes and they govern from that point on but the year that Johnson ruled the year of presidential administer of a presidential reconstruction was the most important year. The first year is always going to be the most important year and it was completely controlled by this. Slave owners into control of government by letting them get their citizenship back if they asked nicely because he was just a vain little tailor. He was a petty Bourgeois who was always resentful of below and above him which is why the petty Bourgeois is. The is the poisoned rancid heart of capitalism and what drives it to self-destruction. It's that position where you're below one and above another and resent and fear both and have no solidarity for anything but yourself and that was Johnson. He hated slavery because it made those slave owners think they're so much better than him but that meant when he had a chance all he really wanted for them to kiss his ass and say that they respected him. All he really wanted was their respect and he had the power to extract it and so he took it and so he let him all back. He led all the slavers back into power and then he took forcibly the land that had been distributed to former slaves. He sent the Army to take them off the land. Those guys didn't go do that of their own volition. They didn't say I hate having I'm pissed off seeing these former slaves have land hey guys. Let's go down there and kick him off of it. They were following orders from Washington if they had gotten orders to protect those former slaves from their white neighbors. They would have done that too they would have gladly done that these are the guys who killed all their friends. During the war you want me to go. Rough them up. I would love to and instead he told them to go kick him off the land and that you can't get back and and nothing that that Congressional Reconstruction did did make that back they could they didn't disempower successfully the Planters they did not take their land.

They did not redistribute because they were fighting on terrain that had been created by close because the history of the presidency like all human history is the presidency of over determined moments where all we really are left to do is narrate to ourselves why we did what we were forced to do. But then there are apertures and openings and moments of fluidity where chance enters in an individual discretion can Dominate and that was the American Civil War and so there was a federal open moment there after the war and Linda and Andrew Jansen comes in and just takes a big wet. All over it like Buchanan was breathtakingly bad. He demobilized the US Military and handed over supervised the handing over of U.S military institutions and material to Rebels. He was like doing like you talk about what NORAD and given them the nuclear football but here's the thing the Civil War was going to happen. Civil War was on the agenda. The the Democratic model of placating the South had come to a point where it could no longer be sustained because the citizens of the north would not sustain it anymore. You want to know why it happened. That is why the what the northern ambient voter was willing to put up with from the south had shrunk and the demands of the South as they felt the walls closing in became more and more exorbitant extreme because they wanted to break up that's why if Franklin Pierce had been 14th president and not Buchanan. I think he's the worst president ever and if it's that fungible I don't think you can adhere to the guy that much but because like Franklin Pierce was a feckless doe face who only knew how to give the South what it wanted and had no other political heuristic to work with and he was this as as principleless as Buchanan. He was also completely shit-faced for his whole presidency you might not even know he was doing it. I mean it's easy to forget this but Jefferson Davis was James Buchanan's Secretary of Defense War. At that time. I'm sorry Secretary of War was Jefferson. Davis guess what he probably would have been Franklin Pierce's Secretary of War. It's that's over determined anybody. Any other conceivable human on earth that realistically could have been made vice president upon the death of or made president upon the death of Lincoln would have been better wouldn't have been perfect. We wouldn't be sitting in the Clover now but the terrain I think would have changed things in a positive way and that makes Johnson just a a world historic piece of and when you consider how much happenstance goes into that.

It's like damn. Maybe we do live in the world that has to for reasons beyond our understanding beware. Nothing ever quite comes together how the hell did I get on the Civil War again. God damn it honestly yeah. Shitlord theory of history is pretty interesting instead of Great Men like great man Theory doesn't really work. Most of these guys are great to the degree that they embody a moment and then stop being great the moment that they no longer fit the mold. But pieces of can like just grind history to a halt and redirect it in in dramatic and stunning ways Andrew Johnson being a good example in Among Us presidents John Tyler being maybe the greatest example. After so the wigs emerge as the alternative to the Jacksonian Democracy and with them the dream of a developmentalist merchant economy against the Democratic vision of Yeoman Conquest. Because that is the heart of jacksonianism is every man will be a king on his own land that we will take from the Indians we don't need to have taxes. We don't need to have Banks. We just need to have our musket and our skin cap and we just take what we want. We use the Army to distribute it. Everybody is is a individual Citizen and we get full Liberty and freedom. We cannot be brought under the Yoke of any power including the money power and the wigs emerge among the specifically strong. The the wig.

Heartland was not the merchantile East because there's a lot of Working Class People in the cities there that were Democrats it. It's real. Heartland was Henry Clayton's home area of Kentucky the Western. At that time Western United States which depended for its sustenance on development on building infrastructure roads canals that was the only way it was able to sustain its economy and get its goods that are that are. Made to Market hey you want to be a bunch of Yeoman Farmers. Congratulations would you like to do something other than live. At subsistence. Level would you like to maybe buy a nice. A nice Bible or a credenza or maybe some nice clothes maybe have some seasoning for your food if you want that you have to be able to sell your goddamn Surplus in a market and the only way to do that is if we build some goddamn infrastructure and the only way we would do. That is if we circulate some goddamn currency through a banking system I'm sorry and so it organizes around clay.

They get their asses kicked by Jackson and Van Buren as think when the when the economy is going well because as long as there's cheap land to sell that means you don't have to raise taxes on anybody or or tariffs because you can just sell the land and have that fill the coffers and as long as the Indians keep retreating we can keep taking more and look at this you know we won we. We We took the Louisiana Purchase look at this. We can do we can keep going. Everything we can do it but then there's a banking crisis that hits during Van Buren's term oh. No what's that oh gee Central Banking. If you don't have it. You have these periodic busts that destroy the entire economy. Oh man oh geez. What are we going to do about it and of course Van Buren.

Even though he was a political. Genius had no answer to that because policy was entirely secondary to politics. It's like I don't know I know how to I know how to get to be president. I don't know know what to do about the economy. None of them did and so they just did what they already knew which was ideological and useless and so America. Even people who had the the center of gravity of democratic voters were willing to listen to the Whigs when they said hey maybe we build a development of the developed economy. First instead of we hold back we stop expanding Westward and we do some internal development gain value. That way yes it means circulating money but it also means more opportunity Now of course. It also means capitalism and it also means wage slavery and the eventual end of The Omen dream. Now what the Yeoman who fought that didn't realize is that they were digging their own Graves anyway. But at that time they could still believe in that Horizon and they fought to maintain it and the wigs tried to propose this alternative.

But they never ever got a chance to really carry out other than a piecemeal in the states things like the Erie Canal and it's not a coincidence that one of the chief centers of wiggery is Upstate New York Buffalo. That's where Miller Fillmore is from but their one chance to actually govern with weak. Majorities in the House and Senate is after the Panic of 1830 two and then in 1836 election I believe when they defeated Van Buren but at that point Henry Clay had lost the election twice. They were like you're not a vote getter. Let's get this handsome General William Henry Harrison and he was a real wig. He was a committed wig but then they wanted to extend an olive branch to the southern Democrats who hated Jackson and the Democrats because of the Nullification Crisis and they got John Tyler that's Virginia planter.

It's like hey these guys hate Jackson thing is they didn't hate Jackson for any of the reason that the wigs didn't like Jackson. They hated them because Jackson was too much of a centralizer and allowed for too much of a federal system and didn't allow local landowners enough leeway to control everything. So when William Henry Harrison becomes president he he was a real wig. He was convinced about the ideal ideology of the Whigs. He would have had you know Clay as his political strategist. It could have done they could have done something. They could have like pushed Us in that direction but instead Tyler spent his turn just ripping the wiring out with the insane idea that he was going to get a second term not as a wig because he wasn't one but as the head of a specifically and explicitly Southern slave-based third party. He would be the head of a organized pro-slavery party that would dominate the South while the Whigs and the Democrats broke up the north that was his plan. A solid South against a north and west divided between wigs and Democrats never came into being and he left after one disgraced term and yeah. Like the historical process that that was all part of you know it was not changeable We're not talking about huge route up realm of possibility. But what we are seeing is an individual guy just sticking his dick in the gears in a way that is very hard to find comparably for Great Men so yeah. Lord yeah Tyler I think still has living grandchildren because after his was President he became one of those disgusting old men who marries an 18 year old and he had a bunch of kids with her go ahead.

Do I agree with Walter Benjamin that behind every fascism is a failed Revolution absolutely which is why I have a hard time using the word fascism to describe what's currently happening because that would mean that there's a revolutionary situation either now or in the recent past and since there isn't it's very hard for me to use that term but yeah like when the working class is defeated class resistance to solidifying capitalism doesn't go away. It's just transformed and the zones of conflict are transformed so once the working class of Germany. For example is defeated after World War One and then split by the geopolitics of the Soviet Union and the the contest between socialists and communists. While that's happening the the lower classes and the landowners. The small farmers of Germany were coming together into a new class. Consciousness which is the accumulated grievances of a bunch of socially atomized and fractured individual Market actors.

You have to see that thing somebody says 1960s. I don't think we were in a revolutionary situation in the 1960s in the United States. I think we were in a revolutionary situation in Germany in the 19 late 1800s. Late 19th century post-world War One you're talking about armed contests with the state throughout the entire place like if the if the RL. If all the armed rebellions that had occurred in Germany between the end of the world war one and the final collapse of I think like the Munich Soviet. They'd happen to all coordinatedly and at the same time you would have had a real potential to see his power in Germany. For the for that movement.

I don't think any array of of elements existed in the 60s and so you've got the so what what is fascism. It is this lump of pissed off Petty Bourgeois and smallholders who are brought together not by any of them but by Bohemians and former socialists overproduced Elites people who are outside of that relationship of of social reality but who can use their abilities as symbologists and as demagogues and as political artists. They can whip a story around whip up a story that can capture them yeah. Like you fascism is not socialism it is but it comes out of the failure of socialism and involves the social vocabulary of socialism that those who had sought to challenge the state are left with after it has collapsed and you can either go with one of the Remain. The hot hand the The Socialist Party or the Communist Party problem is those things. Those organizations are disciplined by their relationship to a class by the fact that they do emanate organically from the working class one way or the other. If you're a detached Bohemian layabout failed chicken farmer socialist agitator.

Any of the people who make up the early fascists arms dealing weirdo like Ernst ROM military fly boy and lauch Aristocrat like Hermann. Gehring you're going to gravitate not there to the working class movements ugh but to building new ideas building new vocabularies and trying to entrance the Middle with them and then once you have you've whipped them into a revolutionary fervor which is why even though this all bears a superficial resemblance to the Dynamics of politics. Now the difference is there is no Mass to be mobilized. There is only a techno regime of authoritarianism that is already here what you're scared of exists. Now it is not a a Eminence. It is not a threat. It is a reality your fear of that projected threat is your sublimated. Reckoning with the existing structures yes the middle class is fake. The middle class is a a media fiction. Mediated existence allows for the creation of this deterritorialized identity that pulls you away from your relationship to Capital and redefines your subjectivity along property lines. Middle class.

What does that mean homeowners not always yes there's urbanites in the city who rent and they trade equity for the excitement of living in the city fine. But it's fundamentally homeowners and the problem is is that once that's once that petty Bourgeois it is awoken it will not end. It will not cease until it is destroyed because it is an un achieved the death drive because it is life without meaning you are trying to enshrine the middle class existence as the totalizing experience of humanity. An existence that is by its definition empty of meaning can only be made meaningful through consumption through conquest of others that holds no meaning within itself once. Unleashed that will destroy everything but working class political movement on the other hand nurtured by an identity that is defined collectively. It is by definition extends outward of the self as opposed to Bourgeois petite Bourgeois identity which is a grieved isolation see. This is an interesting question is the middle class a social construct specifically designed by the ruling class to mystify the self away from Capital exploitation. It is that but I don't think you can say that it's specifically designed by anyone. I think the real powerful currents that have pushed Us in the direction of we are and have fixed us where we are are no one's idea. They are the response of people to changing social conditions operating from an assumption that they will maintain their social standing within a system and those decisions will create emergent properties that fix us in that situation. Like in the early 1950s we emerged from World War II.

We got the Soviets there. What do we do with them. How do we relate to them do. We continue the war or do. We actually pursue a peace that was the real question at the end of World War One and the Cold War has to be understood as a continuation of hostilities. There's a continuation of hostilities but that wasn't the only option on the table. The progressive wing of the popular front Democratic party and the Communists fellow Travelers of all Stripes. Large chunks of the most active base of the labor movement wanted cooperation with the Soviets and a true end to military production and a return to a A they wanted the newly created State Behemoth that had won the war to be put to social uses with cooperation with the Soviet Union and I do think that is the dream in the minds of people like Harry Hopkins and FDR yes.

They were capitalists yes. They prep rescued capitalism from its own destruction but they in their own minds did Envision I believe some sort of eventual Reformation of the end of capitalism. A a euthanization of the rentiers in the phrase of Keynes I think they believe that but they would have had to have fought for it and the capacity to fight for it was not there in large part because every other system within the American political economy was operating against them and and up working to neutralize them not because of a conspiracy. But because it was in the understood self-interest of all those other actors the Republican Party Main Street Main Street USA Chamber of Commerce types big industrialists. Everybody knew this wasn't good in the long term for them and so they pushed where they could and that meant red baiting against the labor union and the media with the Red Scare. But it also meant giving the rank and file something because the rank and file was politically mobilized and effective so they had to be dealt with and they were and in so doing. They created this new middle class identity.

In this new spatial relationship. This new mediated subjectivity that obliterated their ability to act as self-interested members of a working class but not because anyone sat down and Drew it up. It's because if you can't if you're if you if you're tired of fighting and you're coming home from war and you want normalcy and you want Security and somebody is off and somebody is offering you a quarter acre lot in a suburb because there was an immediate and massive housing crisis in America. After World War II there was no room at the Inn for these GIS coming back people were living in chicken coops in some American cities so where are we building this prop where are we building. This are we going to build up in cities are we going to build public housing in cities like like the Brits do where we have to go up against existing power structures or are we just going to take some of this up and offer people a mannered dream.

The the upper class vision of autonomy married to the Yeoman self-sufficient fantasy free real estate and it's because that's what everybody has been put that's the direction everybody had been pushed into by the reality of America's development out of exploitation of resources and real estate speculation real estate speculation. There is no coincidence no coincidence that our first president and our most worshiped public figure of the founding generation George Washington was a surveyor and land Speculator who helped cause the Seven Years War by killing a French officer in a skirmish while exploring land for a real estate company that he was a partner in and of course. The real tragedy is that the the Soviets were absolutely willing to play ball but that would have led to war too can't be forgotten but maybe along different lines maybe along productive lines. Well Stalin was good with it because he was his army. His country was exhausted. I mean they lost tens of millions of people to the war. Massive areas of of land had been completely destroyed in massive amounts of infrastructure have been completely destroyed there are no condition to keep fighting which is why you know.

It's like okay fair enough but at the same time you're also signing your surrender which is what they ended up doing when Truman got in there and told them in no uncertain terms. It's War they they did not realize the implications of that because they thought time was on their side. They really did everybody thinks time when you're on the top. You always think time's on your side and I think what we're dealing with now is a crisis in part because the people at the top don't think that anymore everybody doesn't think that nobody thinks that anymore I will give Truman some credit for really like being a fully. Actualized demonic entity because there's a story about him meeting Oppenheimer after they dropped the bomb on Japan and Oppenheimer shakes his hand and he's like I feel like my hands are covered in blood and then after the meeting Truman turns to the guy who set it up and goes don't ever have me meet that idiot again you're whining about the blood on his hands. I'm the one who pressed the book I'm the one who did it. I did it like that is someone who understands that power is Beyond Good and Evil and Oppenheimer yes being a little dork.

Somebody says will there be a new party. After the eventual demise of the Democrats I used to think the Democrats were going to collapse but with this with this Suburban shift and the the durability of it. I think you're more likely to see. The Republicans break up finishing off the job of the wigs because like they are in a real bind they are risking becoming non-viable as a national party which is what was happening to the Whigs and with if that happens then something else has to emerge you know and the Democrats really own the center. Now I know people I know a lot of Republicans find that hard to believe they say no. No Democrats are insane leftist.

[82:42](https://youtu.be/9vYPdSioi_c?t=82m42s)

Loony people who want to cut your kids dicks off and it's like look. That's how a lot of them like to present themselves on social media because it makes them feel radical and I know that's how they look to you. But if you're someone who doesn't make politics their sole source of spectacleized identity. If it's not that important to you and you're looking at politics relatively casually like most voters. Do you look like a weirdo. You look like a psycho and the Democrats who don't talk about that stuff.

Like except for a few you know people at the local level. You see very few National level Democrats making it their business to talk about the The culture War stuff because they're afraid of it. They do think that the average person is a Neanderthal. They do think that but that has the benefit of creating this asymmetry that regular people are alienated by so that means that the Republicans are going to have are probably going to have to do some sort of resolution of this crisis because they're the structure of the party is more and more held by people. Who believe like that they are in terminal crisis that like America is about to end and any anything needs to be done to stop that at a time when the people voting are less and less likely to want to endorse anybody who says we're going to throw the current order in the toilet because they're relatively comfortable.

They wouldn't be voting if they weren't the people who vote because they're not comfortable. They're always going to be outnumbered because most people who are uncomfortable don't pay attention to politics there's plenty of strong parallels between Marx and Martin Luther. One of the big ones is their invective hatred of hatred of anybody who they disagree with on relatively minor points. Mark said nothing like Luther and Mark said nothing like the hate for people who they disagreed with slightly because they fought like no I have figured this out and you're a idiot if you don't get what is going on. Here. They were both very Petty and I don't think you can have that kind of productivity intellectually if you aren't Petty to some degree at that level because what they have in common is they're defining this concept like Martin Marx and Luther both emerge to give voice to existing strands of thought that had not been synthesized yet and so that meant that there were a lot of people competing with them for different interpretations of this moment and they weren't going to look. They weren't going to let that slide. They were going to defend their version against others because they were in a genuine Marketplace of ideas about the reformation and about socialism Germans man. I still say it's something about the language. It drives you kind of crazy. Okay guys I'm done today. Let's talk to you later bye.
