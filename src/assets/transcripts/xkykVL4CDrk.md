Get up in the morning and sleep for breads so that every mouth can be bad for me. The Israelites get up in the morning say for Better Math can be fairly Israelites my wife and my kids. They packed up believe me darling. She said I was your missing on me a Israelites. That's another thing you don't have any more songs about ancient. Slavery was the last time we had a song about the Israelites Neo Assyrians Babylonians. You don't know he's talking about creatures. You know every songs about historical battles or ancient civilizations. It's all just about Satan. These days damn shame oh these Israelites. There we go pop that in there shut them up tear up trousers is gone. I don't wanna end up like body and glide for me. Israelites everybody watch the dang big game.

It's a big game legally forbidden from calling it the Super Bowl. Oh wig split where is Michael Keaton gonna be that guy what are they making in Batman again. I thought he was gonna be Batman in that Batgirl movie that they canceled. It's very funny how Philadelphia has become this like epic City you know people think it's epic and there's a romantic patina around it and a lot of the people who fetishize Philadelphia are politically on the left but the thing that they really are fetishizing about. Philadelphia is that it has still a white working class who lives there. Like that's what contributes to that whole like always sunny roughhouse atmosphere that they feel like you know as generally white suburbanites that they can access the only reason that that is the case is because Frank Rizzo and his Northern George wallaceites prevented the sort of white flight that happened in other cities so these guys all want to tear down the original Statue. But he's the reason that they all think Philly is so cool.

All of the contradictions of our age unbundleable you get to pick a bundle of contradictions and then live suppressing them rather than ever unwinding them because of the futility of action kind of a kind of a real boner. A real owner one thing that really hit me watching the Super Bowl was the end racism sign at the in the end zone like you're basically having a largely white audience. Pay billions of dollars to White owners to watch large mostly black people take years off their life in football games. Like that's the reality of football and that is ending racism again. You gotta love it bundle of contradictions delightful. So apparently all the trains are derailing. Now. It's happening. It's happening Ron Paul. We got two more derailments happening today one in Texas. I think and it's 

It's nutty folks. It's. It's got some nuts on it and of course the only answer for something. Like this the only way to make sense of it is to turn it into some sort of conspiracy right oh. They're they're trying to demoralize us or destroy the water supply or whatever. Simply because that explanation includes a cast of villains responsible who are taking what should be done and and preventing that from happening preventing us from doing what our systems are designed to do which is you know. Prev not have our trains derail and cause giant plumes of poisonous acid to fill the air and poison huge swaths of America. The system's not supposed to do that so therefore it has to be a nefarious plot of course. The reality is no. This is what the system is precisely designed to do one when the barriers to profit maximization are dissolved in the acid of of post-70s capitalism. All that's left is the prerogative to grasp short-term profit wherever it can be found and that means not doing the sort of basic infrastructural upkeep and safety maintenance that would have been assumed in previous generations. This is the system working as intended but if that is the case then there's no one really to hold on responsibility for it.

There is no one to vote out there is no plan of action that does not mean going to war with these structures of the economy. The structures of government and no one no matter how radical they argue claim to be who represents any manifestation of mainstream politics. Okay realistically promote that or promise it because the structures to the the political structures we have cannot harness energies towards anything other than the acceleration of all of these trends and the way you can see. That is everybody who is talking about this including elected officials at every level of government is only talking about. No one is talking about it because the Assumption the implicit assumption here in everything really is that there is a level at which public attention on a subject will turn into action will create a a moment of Tipping Point where we we all of a sudden things have changed but that's not going to happen. Because the talking is what we do all. We can do is talk so look at me.

What am I doing right now. I'm sitting here drinking my damn bubbly water talking into my computer because what the hell else am I gonna do what are any of us going to do except keep talking and then hope that enough people somewhere else hear it and do something about it. But you know I still I'm not a dummary no matter what because eventually people have to act out of necessity and necessity cuts through this miasma. But that of course is also very terrifying because it means abandoning all of the comforting layers of responsibility and Authority that we depend on yeah. But you know it's we got to take care of each other. I know that's stupid and certainly I'm coming from me who is one of the most selfish pieces of crap to ever live.

[09:22](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=09m22s)

The conspiracy angle though is very interesting the the fixation on having a narrative because as we've talked about tons of times and I've talked about here on the show. Everywhere like conspiracy stuff obviously is part and parcel of the governance that we have there is a deep State. There are structures that are not accountable that are not seen in the daylight and that have a influential force on the flow of events um. But there's a belief a very widespread belief that Drilling in and narrativizing that that contribution to the shape of the world that we find ourselves in will have that revelatory impact like if people just knew but again we know and there's no way to convince people if they don't want to know and there's no way to get people who do know to do anything about it. Foreign is emphasizing one end of this process. The the individual and of you know humans in in in specific positions making decisions and totally obscures the other end which is the structural forces that are determining those decisions.

The decisions being made are not being made out of discrete plans made by people who are trying to carry out their own agenda against the structures of democratic governance and capitalistic economic order. They are the outgrowth of those things I mean they are definitely not talking about this. This derailment nearly to the degree that it would deserve precisely because of how bad it probably is foreign other than the conspiracy angle you can take on it and that's no good. So it just has to It just has to float and the people who are affected get to be affected in their individual lives and they get to you know get cancer or die early individually in a way that can't be dissipated just like the chemical cloud. But yeah there is no there's no plan. The thing that my favorite thing is the people who fixate on the world economic forum and they say look what they're talking about in these meetings. They're telling you what they want to do. They're telling you their plans what they're doing is.

Like all these doofuses they're getting together in a room to give themselves an illusion of control to fantasize that the things that are happening as a result of these systems that they are enmeshed in but subservient to carry out their algorithmically generated agenda and then in the backwash of those decisions winding each other up that they have control and then they get Legions of credulous viewers and observers to go look look what they're doing because what what is being perverted is the question I have what is what can these systems that we have specifically the system of private property ownership enshrined and enshrined in the Constitution enshrined in the the form of capitalism that the United States has exported globally what in that should be creating another outcome. What is the other thing that should be happening other than spoilation. The collapse of infrastructure as money is siphoned into the private hands of investors where is where is the the The Godly agenda that these globalists are perverting foreign.

There is none. This is it and everybody within it is just trying to justify their position within. It keep them their heads above water a good example of this a good example of how we look at structurally over determined outcomes and then sift through them to find some thread of malevolent human agency to describe explain what's happening would be that article that was in Compact magazine this week by a a left-wing black academic who did a seminar with a bunch of um a diverse group of high school students who are going to be going into college and the whole thing is this very bracing description of this essentially a teaching assistant brainwashing a bunch of teenagers with hyper racially woke language. You know. It's the classic Boogeyman you know this thing was like. Hey you know that thing we're always complaining about how the damn the colleges are filled with all this my brainwashing look. Here it is and from the mouth of a left-wing black professor.

So it's like of course nobody else published. It ended up being in compact mag which is a Outlet designed to catch this stuff that the left media can't really talk about no matter whether it happened or not because of the immediate. Antibodies that get released as soon as something like that is said because it triggers defense mechanisms because the upshot of these stories is always the same thing the woke Madness of Academia but again even if you take this story at completely at face value. This is what happened and even if you want to say it's not an isolated incident. It's part parcel of the experience of going to higher education. At this point.

[17:30](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=17m30s)

 the implications have nothing to do with what culture. Warrior types want them to be. It has because the obvious response is we got to do something about these colleges and we see in Florida exactly what that means in practice we gotta take over the apparatus of ideological dissemination we have to create our own We need to create our own ideology to supplant the woke ideology of colleges but this phenomenon if you take it seriously of identitarianism run amok in in the universities only makes sense in the context of the academy as we know it graveyard. They're they're they're they're taking over Rubble the the the higher education is as we've imagined it. In this country is falling apart why because they stopped putting any money into it. They stop producing Scholars. They produced a ton of Administrators to base. They essentially bribed a generation of would-be Scholars to help dismantle higher education with six-figure administrative salaries and all of the the identitarian turn in universities is a bunch of people. Now in this more abundant institution who are still obligated to bring more people into it to Pied Piper more people into a beaves being brought to the Killing Floor.

Because there is no jobs for them. There is the the life of the mind they're imagining no longer exists but you have to tell them that there is you have to tell these kids who you're getting into giving who are mortgaging their entire lives to get a degree which will not give them what they think. It's going to that has a psychological effect on what people how people treat their jobs and that sublimated guilt really about their about complicity in like a real degradation of of material conditions becomes exercised in performances of virtue in other places. If you've accepted the the brutal realism that the fall of the Soviet Union taught us that there is no escape from capitalism that there is no escape from the the end of history and you're here in Academia and you're one of the lucky ones.

Then what are you gonna do you have to imbue something to your students. You got to tell them something and the idea that you can awaken them to the inherent racial hierarchy in American life is very encouraging. It's oh. This is this is a thing I can get across that will maybe help change things again. Not anything I'm going to do but maybe somebody else maybe these kids we teach will go and do anything of course. What you're actually telling. These kids is that any kind of real change is impossible and the only thing that they can do is curate their own virtue and and keep themselves above the their heads above the moral Waters. I do think it's kind of amazing when you consider that consider how many kids going to college right in the last 30 years are like white kids from the suburbs who basically have probably never encountered minorities in any significant number growing up and then they go to college where you know.

They're supposed to meet the world and they are told that every encounter they're ever going to have with a person of. A different race is going to be freighted with power dynamics and control and there will never. There can never be real cross-racial intimacy because of the power dynamics of life in America and then you send them out into the world. With that of course. The conscious thought is no they're going to want to work against this discrimination and this awfulness but the wheels of his the the mechanisms the the the handles to grab of all broken. Off that's another thing they learned in college.

[22:16](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=22m16s)

So all they take into adult life is a neurotic relationship to another. Now the compact mag argument is this is all part of some cabal. This is all part of some agenda. This is a woke mind virus any of that idiocy when in fact it is the inevitable results of the systemic breakdown of higher education and at the end of it now at this end here when like significant long ex like huge branches of the liberal studies portfolio stuff that goes back to the cannibalism there. There it is a it's crabs in a bucket like all of our all of our political Discord disquietition exists to whistle through the graveyard of systemic collapse in order to point fingers at groups of people who are only responding to the incentives of the environments they find themselves in and it's amazing how many of the people who worship at the Throne of homo economicus who say We Are all self-interested agents first and foremost that there is no sociology now that we act that way they're saying oh woke mind. Virus has taken people's minds oh that it's all it's part of a Marxist. Cultural Marxist conspiracy is people responding to incentives yeah so you've got a generation in colleges for example of just burned out guilt-ridden. Tenured people just trying to take out their their misery on others and then the younger generation just looking for any way to stay on the floating chunks of debris from the sinking ship and of course like that that discourse of of identity power politics is that's the only game in town there well that's why I really do think the solution is not to rebuild the academy not to reinvest in these universities but to break the model up completely.

You should be able to get an education in anything you're interested in for free in your hometown stuff that requires like bigger Capital Investments you know like the hard science and stuff sciences and stuff you can have for people who want to study them. You can have campuses but the the model of that it's. It was created really after World War II because obviously you know the universities has existed for a long time but like our modern conception of the university is a post-war product. Like so much else that we live in live with the the consequence of this anomalous moment of Imperial super profit bounty as extended continued daycare and credential machine for this new crop of suburban kids that this new group of people who didn't want to work in the jobs that their parents did whose parents didn't want them to work. In those jobs they wanted something better for their kids. It is really wild to think that a generation of American men went out into the world and saw some of the most hair-raising violence that you could ever imagine the ones who survived and then came home and we're told all right congratulations.

You saved the world for democracy. Now you're never going to talk about that again. Also democracy is getting a car every year with larger tail fins good luck yes if Henry Wallace had only won or I've been thinking about this what if what if FDR is incredibly bad Health gives out before the 1944 election. Well Henry Wallace was the vice president because FDR was circling the drain for a while there. What if he what if his what if that vein pops in 40 you know 44 not 45. I honestly think even if that happens Wallace gets railroaded just because the guy was for all of his good. Politics was the kind of well-meaning liberal simp that traditionally gets railroaded by somebody. I think you kind of need FDR there who at that point had concentrated so much legitimacy in his person and that would require um somebody to invent blood pressure medication.

A little bit earlier than they actually did apparently blood. Pressure medicine was invented in like right after World War II so very close. It's very funny like before FDR went on his last vacation to Warm Springs Georgia where he died you know like a hot tub or whatever they took his blood pressure and it was like 400 over 200 or something and they're just like wow that's not good but you know what maybe sitting in some. Maybe sitting in a hot tub will help okay. I think I got through most of what I want to say today. I do I would like to talk here for the second half about 

[29:52](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=29m52s)

The Last of Us on HBO yeah yeah world's burning and let's talk about television again. What else are we doing what else are we doing with ourselves. We're not creating militias at least not any that we can talk about just kidding I'm not creating any militias. But my God we still we still have the content right we still appraising content that really is why we're here right. Like appraising content is the American modus vivendi that is what we're here for to absorb the content and then to render some sort of judgment on the content. And I think there is a buried hope much like with the demand you know for people to open their eyes or or talk more about crime. About horrible news stories that if enough people have the right opinion about the content the content will get better which will then flow to our structures. When of course.

It's the opposite way around the content is bad because the structure is creating the content are bad and getting worse but so yeah it's sad that we're talking at this point while the the our own country is gassing itself about a video game TV show. But I do think there's something interesting to say about it. So that's why I'm talking about it for one thing. I I think it is a red alarm that the current like front piece HBO show is based on a video game. I think that is a bad sign for and things in general um and paradoxically makes the show more boring because the people making it are clearly aware that they made a video game show and they need to push against that so they're draining it of any you know actual genre enjoyments.

They're making it as sort of punishing and slack as you know a tightly observed family drama even though it's supposed to be about mushroom zombies that's another generator of bad media is something that cannot examine and be honest about its own nature. Demands to tries to validate itself as something else. So the show is very I think very bad very boring more than anything boring slack. That's the word I keep thinking of just there's no sense of any tension. Any Stakes so that's my main critique of it. But the episode that came out this last weekend has a lot of people annoyed because of its treatment of these revolutionaries who overthrow the evil federal government there in Kansas City because it does the you know the new boss same as the old boss. The revolutionaries are worse than the people they overthrew thing and people are using that to get mad at the show and mad at its creator and say you.

Libs what are you doing. But I think it's I understand that I understand why they went that way and it's because the libs are for all their delusion the libs who make this show are aware of one thing that a lot of terminally online leftists refuse to accept which is that the left is not a real force in American politics like that's like one of the big things that liberals tell themselves to justify why they support mainstream liberalism even though you know they're. They theoretically support all of the same goals as the left is that the left is too weak and that is correct they're right about that. Now the right of course sees the left and liberalism is like one thing and the government is like a Marxist conspiracy that's their fantasy so and they're living in that Cloud Cuckoo Land. But like the left is also living in a world where they see a show like like this and they identify themselves as the radicals who overthrow the government. But I think the liberals who make that show assume that the only people who are going to overthrow any government are the right so they think they're helping by saying hey you know Revolution. It's bad don't do that because who's gonna take who's gonna storm who literally did storm. A government building was it the left so if you're lip making the show you want you want to if you can communicate a message. It's hey settle down and also because liberals believe a thing that is a delusion that both the right and the left see through which is that there is a depoliticized government structure that can be wielded that that has like its own a non-political agenda that is distorted and warped by one or another ideological side as opposed to the reality that the structures are inherently political and always being guided by a ideological agenda. Also as someone said on Twitter and I think they are correct. The show is anti-mushroom propaganda.

[36:43](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=36m43s)

 my wife Amber points that out and she's very correct. Mushrooms are friends. Mushrooms are our friends. You should not be telling people that mushrooms are going to. Us up. I think a much more interesting version of this show would be one that jumps from two perspectives. One is of the Grim dark apocalypse survivors you know fighting it out in these burned out. Cities trying to you know oppose their Vision on the other on one side or the other and they're all shooting each other and stuff like that and then from the point of view of the people who have been mushroom fied who keep who are still people you know they still have their Humanity. They have their memories. They have their love and attachments what they don't have is the all-consuming fear the Reiki and armoring against the other that we are all and wrapped with because they would be cybernetically naturally connected to one another and so the show would eventually be what it would be like a comedy. It would eventually flip into a comedy just because as you went from one perspective to the other you realize how much of the horror of the non-mushroom people is all self-inflicted. It's it's it's it's a boot their own boot on their own neck because their refusal to see what's in front of them which is the mushroom people building a harmonious Society. That's the point of the second game. That's funny kudos yeah. I think sometimes of The human body is a Battleground basically between fungus and cereals order structure productivity and connection vibes 

It's we the human species is the tool of a planet coming into self-awareness by synthesizing. It's two sides. The two sides of life and one of the reasons that we're doomed is that right now the the Chokehold. On us we have been fully serialified but it's not one or the other of course. You know. It is a. It's a dialectical relationship that is worked out through human striving and eventually generates a synthesized Global consciousness. The apollonian cereals and the dionysian fungi precisely thank you damn boy put it better than I could but I guess if I if I if if I have hope it's because this is a This is not We are not at the end of anything because nothing ends it's a process. It's an unfolding and even if the end never comes the end never comes but the imagined and is eternally present and we humans.

The human consciousness is the is that agent of this process because we carry within our minds. The the the Vision the possibility the the ghost of the totality so yeah the HBO of course tool of the serial Lobby tool of the serial side and like there's a lot of attempts to externalize these this. This Dynamic with dreams of you know Warring sects of the ruling Elite or alien species that are battling for the human spirit. It's it's not any of that. It's us. It's us as part of a whole coming into recognition of that reality battling through it moving through stages of understanding one of the most interesting ideas that they get at in dawn of everything without getting into it.

[44:35](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=44m35s)

At all. They just sort of mention it in passing and don't emphasize. It. Anymore is that ancient Egyptian civilization you know as we know it the the Pharaohs and all that was potentially started as a way to Foster cereal production specifically for beer and they they say grab. Grab grow claim like it was because you know it was needed to this was like the food of the Gods. This is the drinks the Gods and that we needed they needed to make it to you know appease them and then it was that serial production relationship that then structured their society that fixed it and grounded it and that is sort of like. It's. It's the grain's relationship to the human mind thanks to you know our consumption of it as cereals but even more importantly as alcohol. It's like toxoplasmosis yeah grains domesticated humans. That's the that's a thesis that has been Advanced many times and these cereals like trained humans to make them to plant in a line to harvest to to to introduce a rigid concept of time and a rigid hierarchy of responsibilities separation of Labor in order to facilitate the creation of these cereals.

Now of course you know you could say oh the bad guy is bad. This is bad no of course it's not bad. It is. It is inevitable it's necessary. It's part of the process we could have come into any understanding of anything without building these enduring social structures that could generate art that can generate knowledge that can be shared disseminated but you know if it's if. It's the only thing that is fueling your social structure.

Then it will eventually destroy itself to maintain its hierarchies which it imagines as inviable and inherent and holy and necessary in not contingent. Not the product of a failure a greater failure to recognize connection. So that's where you got the the push and pull of the of the of the the fungus and the and the cereals and Human Society grows. Struggles creates destroys itself rises again. Leaving a residue that is then picked through that is added to a greater race memory. Storehouse of experience and knowledge and encounter toward what end we can't now because we are in the middle of it but the fact that we're aware of it the fact that we're all here experiencing it. It always suggests to me that it has happened and it is always happening and that our experiences are essentially suspended within it.

Maybe we'll become crab-like. I kind of think we're going to merge with the octopuses. Though you need you need the octopuses and the crabs to get together because the problem with the Occupy is that they don't live long enough and Crustaceans live hella long human animal hybrids. The use in the chat might not remember this but George H George W bush got really a hair up his ass about the potential for human animal hybrids. He was very he was always sounding the alarm that human animal hybrids were something that was going to happen in the near future and that we needed to do interventions to prevent. He used to say this in like the State of the Union Address and now 15 years later I got to assume that we're making progress on the human animal hybrids and yet there is no no one out there decrying them. Also George W bush. He's just painting. He's just out there around painting soldiers. Why isn't he still out there talking about human animal hybrids but you got to remember the context. This was around the time of the the cloning of Dolly the sheep and also the stem cell War which is one of the most baffling culture War. Precursors when you look at from the standpoint of the current moment. Like that was culture war in the Arts was stem cells and I think that the one of the things one of the reasons that we don't talk about it. Anymore is because the science has progressed that they're largely unnecessary ah yes Terry shipo that was another one it's wild.

[52:26](https://youtu.be/xkykVL4CDrk?t=52m26s)

It's wild all of this by the way at the same time that we were fighting a global war on terror that was an existential conflict that could have led to America being destroyed at any given moment. We're still worried about this one lady in Florida and whether or not she was gonna be put to sleep it was a crazy time folks because the because all you got was this stuff in top down media streams because there was no social media. I mean there were blogs and forums but that was it you did not have that kind of collective hive mind. The on the unmonitored um United States customer service line that is contemporary social media. So as a result it felt much more you felt like a a cultural hegemony on you in a way that now you get to pick between hegeminates you get to have a rooting interest you get to manage your alienation by yeah imagining opposition within the greater hegemony and then you know rooting for one or the other. As opposed to just this one thing that was just dropped on your on your face.

In the bush years I haven't seen the day of the locusts. But I have read the Nathaniel West Novella that it's based on which features a character known as named Homer Simpson and a climactic riot where all of the downtrend losers of La burned down the movie colony oh man rock against Bush that was pretty awesome. If I remember correctly the cover for that I had a cartoon a bush like holding his ears like he couldn't handle the Rock. This rock is too much it's gonna blow my head off but again. I think a lot of people were trained during that era I know I was to believe in like the the subversive power of of media precisely because it felt like there was such a pro-war reactionary hegemony operating and then we kind of carried that faith into the social media era and didn't really care to notice that oh all of this media consumption just gets absorbed and Def and all this energy gets diffused and that what we thought was one hegemony actually it could be almost infinitely divided. Is the technology exists to allow for different streams and different bubbles to be enjoyed within it. The one piece of anti-bush media that I really rocked with was this for the 2004 election.

Mcsweeney's. If anyone remembers mcsweeney's. They put out a CD. It was like the future and a book to go with it. The future dictionary of America I never read the future dictionary. It was like it was a. It was very embarrassing even at the time it was just a bunch of def. It was imagining a bush free future where we'd kind of cleansed ourselves of all these National demons that the bush era had had conjured and and it was like a better brighter. Future is exactly what Obama ended up embodying for many people including myself but it also had a CD and it had a bunch of songs on it that were meant to Rock the indie rock against Bush basically. I remember there was a There's a David Byrne song on there. There was a cover of the John Prine song Sam Stone. This time you know it's about the conflict. Overseas is now Rock and not Vietnam but the one song on there that has always stuck with me is this Clem snide song called The Ballad of David icky or Ike. However you pronounce it the English lizard person guy. The secret rulers of the world have stolen my girl that one. I remember that of all those things on that album that's the one that has stuck with me because that's the one that like got deeper than just like bush is a chimp.

You know that's the one that spoke to a thing that eventually became a dominant cultural vocabulary of lizards of Secret cabals of demons orchestrating things from behind the scenes. But even then I gotta say for myself. I was never attracted to that as a literal description or as a heuristic for identifying male. Bad actors to me. It more spoke to the fact that to hold a high position in a system like we have is to be turned into a lizard is to have your Humanity your. Your basic human connection drained of you not that you were part of some Immortal race that is directing human Affairs but that you're a human among humans who is brought into a position of lizardness of where where your blood has to turn cold in order to carry out the agenda which is inhuman which is reptilian but not carried in any mind or heart of any biological entity but in the very sinews of Commerce media governance the world system itself. But this is like even though the lizard thing is a great metaphor and can make you think about institutions in a meaningfully critical way. What happens if you use that metaphor enough. It's becomes literal and then you have to start looking for the reptilians and you have to start trying to justify your faith in the existence of reptiles and all of your. All anything meaningful gets lost in the noise because what do people want to hear do.

They want to hear that their institutions have enslaved them that or that there are lizard people out there in positions who can be overturned that the institutions we have are being perverted and warped and they could be reclaimed that the constitution can be reasserted in all of its glory and so the Constitution is not what all of this all the horror that we see around us. All of this is the manifestation of the basic code of the Constitution which is a theological enshrinement of property rights that is what the Constitution is and that is what we are living in. We are living in the hell of proper private property rights as the only enshrined sacred relationship. Nothing else is real. Property is real property ownership is real. Everything is is in the thrall of that and all the things that conspiracy people point to as perversions of the Constitutional order from the establishment of the Federal Reserve to the assassination of John F Kennedy all the response to 9 11. All of that stuff is not a perversion of the Constitutional order.

It is the organic outgrowth the organic response of this system to changing conditions changing more people. You know is the big one just as the country gets bigger and the complexity of governing it increases as the technological capacity of governance increases these things. Sprout out we need a federal reserve. The gold will not cut it anymore boom. We get one oh we're going to be a global striding Colossus and we're going to impose capitalism on the rest of the world well. Then we can't depend on Democratic accountable institutions to carry that out that is not efficient enough boom. We get a security state. All of these things exist. They emerge to reinforce and protect the central imperative of the Constitutional order and for me. The big problem I have with every stripe of conspiracy person and the populist. Concept in general is that almost always is embedded within. It is a faith in the Constitutional order as the Bedrock of like real human Liberty that has been perverted by Bad actors and if you think that then your plan to defeat the Bad actors will only end up reinforcing the very structures that allow them and in fact mandate them to do what they do. It's not corruption though is the thing I think thinking about it. As corruption implies there is something to corrupt there was never anything that to corrupt all the stuff that we think of as The Virtue stuff it's ad copy. It was never actually enshrined in our institutions. It's animated people who worked within those institutions. They genuinely believed in it in different ways but they were constrained in how they could express that belief by the institutional straitjacket of the of our political system like it has to be revolutionarily uprooted or failing that superseded by others in other places and other times. Having other experiences who are not Enchanted the way we are all right folks see on the flippity. Flop talk next week I keep promising I'll finish the second three body problem book. I think I'm like halfway done might have it done for next week. We'll see bye-bye.
