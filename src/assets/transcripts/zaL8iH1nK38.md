I walk along these city streets used to walk around with me and every step. I take reminds you how much you love to me. How can. I forget you when there is always something that do remind me always something that do remind me. I was born to love you and I will never be free. You'll always be a part of me whoa when shadows fall. I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night and I remember how it felt to kiss and hold you tight how can. I forget you when there is always something that do remind me that was always something that to remind me. I was born to love you and I will never be free. You'll always be a part of me whoa whoa whoa whoa ho if you should find you miss the sweet and tender love. We used to share just go back to the places that we used to know and I'll be there. I cannot forget you and I was always something to remind me hi everybody.

I hope. I hope that this works because I'm literally borrowing my neighbor's wi-fi because some cable collapsed in front of the place to yesterday and the internet is out and is going to be out for the foreseeable future. So I hope this works. I'm pretty sure it was the deep state pretty sure they're trying to stop me from from pilling everybody on the year anniversary of january 6th but that's okay. I can do it on january. 7th.

I even wore my commemorative boogaloo boys shirt to remind us all okay if the audio is fine. That's it you don't have to look at me. In fact I kind of recommend you not look at me while you're listening to any of this because who needs who needs to see this so yes. So yesterday was the year anniversary of the insurrectionary attack on the capitol and I remember a year ago. I streamed. I remember saw it happening on my phone while I was getting tacos and people like holy. And then I talked about it a little bit but mostly I talked about the book that we were talking about the um of the for the republic for which it stands and I mostly just said This is pretty much just funny and people freaking out about it should settle down and then I actually got my The stream got like cut down into chunks by weirdos who have put it upon themselves to hold people accountable for bad takes because it's making nazism happen or something and they said how look. This person says that the cap is just a shrine to um corruption and that there's nothing to be.

 there's nothing to be mourned there and I was correct and I gotta say a year later. I still feel very correct. I gotta say honestly the degree to which the insurrectionary energy that everyone was freaked out about kind of just dissipated after biden was inaugurated surprised me and I was minimizing it at the time. I was saying this is not the giant deal. You guys are acting like it is but even I assume that there'd be and I said it a number of times some sort of eruption of stochastic violence. Some some remainder of like super dedicated q people who would take matters into their hands and that didn't even happen. We didn't even get that the closest thing we've gotten to any sort of development of the the real cultic. Edge of trump die hardery are those guys who are like slow walking jonestown in dallas right. Now those people who are just sort of egging themselves into doing a mass suicide. Everybody else went home. Everybody else went home and decided to die of coronavirus to own the liberals. Somebody says 50 50 odds. It was a fbi entrapment gone wrong see.

This is where I think you got to think about it through the looking glass just like what tom o'neill said about the manson murders being a cia mk ultra thing gone wrong what if it's gone right you know not necessarily that there is any specific goal being desired but just that happening is better for the security state than it not happening and when you have as many fingers and as many extremist pies as the fbi always does stopping. Things from happening isn't really a good percentage because you're not going to get blamed either way. I mean 911 basically proved that you're going to get more money no matter what happens now you have to stop some things once in a while you've got to stop a thing so you can point to it but a really big thing like that stopping. It isn't the percentage play. Letting it happen is the percentage and in the years since the people who insisted that you take the insurrection seriously have pointed to as evidence that they were correct the fact that cue psychos and trumpists are taking all of these local seats and trying to take over state secretary state electoral boards and stuff so that they can do a legal nullification of votes next time and I gotta tell you. I don't think that has anything to do with 1-6 that has happened going to happen independently of that. The the the spectacular expression the one that we fixate on is the least important. It's the most epic phenomenal.

The one that the thing that matters is the structural ratchet of the republican party using its minoritarian levers of control to nullify the threat of being voted out of office by the fact that they do represent a rump of voters. But that process has been going on unimpeded for 20 years and if they do steal an election the way people are freaking out it will not be a coup. It will be bush be gore all over again and if that wasn't a coup. I'm sorry. I don't know how you can say that this one will be just because it's trump instead of a guy who paid his dues because he was a president's son who had been governor of texas or something and they all look like normal politicians. So it's okay. I mean my god people were talking about how horrifying it was that the democrats were all shaking dick cheney's hand in the in the house yesterday because of what he did with iraq and everything he did a coup. He stole an election. He did the thing that all these people are freaking out about. I think the desire for there to be some kind of coup is the same desire for there to be some sort of climate apocalypse. It's the desire for a rupture of our constraining reality that will somehow free us. We don't know how because we can't imagine it capitalist realism again but it would be different. It would be fundamentally different. Our lives would be fundamentally different and even if they were worse in some objective sense the familiar miseries that we have become locked into would be obviated and that is what people want. That's what people want out of a coup. That's what people want out of climate change that's what people want out of covet and it's just not likely to happen. If there's going to be a apocalypse.

It has to be individual. It has to be internal. You have to do it yourself. You have to push through the veil yourself. You can't wait for them to do it for you because there's no incentive in the system to allow that to happen. It's all up to us to decide what is too much and then act accordingly to change our conditions of consent. But I understand why that's scary and impossible because we are locked into this. Like the people. The thing that fascinates me about the the real doom heads about democracy like democracy's over is that all they want to do is make. Other people feel like them not with the idea that it's going to lead to anything. I really don't think they believe that. I think the more clear-eyed ones understand that well. I think democracy is ending. I think it's a crisis and yet all. I'm doing is the same thing. Everybody else is doing which is doing my job posting to vent stress but otherwise waiting for the asteroid to hit realistically logically that means that even if my communication is effective and I get other people to feel as deeply as I do that we are in a crisis. All you're gonna have is another person or another group of people with that emotional energy but doing the same thing allowing the thing to happen and I honestly think more than that more even than wanting other people to feel as you do. The real motivation is to have a consolation for if it actually happens and that consolation will be the ability to say as the lights dim. I told you so that is really what people who cultivate their anxiety and their cassandra visions of catastrophe are doing. They like who we all are feel completely locked into being a scared rabbit waiting for the end.

A only able to console ourselves with the with with the minor pleasures that we have become addicted to because it's all we know but then consoling ourselves with the knowledge that we understand something that the masses don't and that our enemies don't and the people we don't like don't which means that if we have even our momentary fleeting barely sufficient pleasures taken from us we will have at least the compensating pleasure of knowing we were right and that seems you say that seems like an absurd thing. But when you consider the degree to wish and I'm not. I'm talking about myself here obviously self-worth when you feel like you're not in control of your life when you feel like you are a cog as we all do when you feel like the human urge towards self-definition. That is denied us at this stage of capitalism and has left us unable to express those animal urges and made us compensate with with treats and when I say treats I don't mean oh snacks. I mean I mean the the aesthetic compensations of of life in the habit trail. One of the big ones for the over-educated overproduced elite of this country which is most college-educated people under 40. I would say is building a world view building an identity around perception of the world around us and curating it and validating ourselves by by cherishing and and fixating on the difference between our understanding of the world around us and what we perceive as general understandings of the world. Like I might not. I might be filled with self-loathing because I feel that I am trapped. I might feel like I've been thwarted in any attempt to to really define my life by my by anything other than the terms of capital like everybody else but unlike everybody else. I know that why this is happening or I feel like I know why this is happening and I know where it's headed and that is a real thing that that's that's a genuine element of self-interest is is that sense of self and this is why I talk a lot about how you can't speak to the self-interests of capitalists as people as being purely their material self-interest. Because nobody's self-interest is simply a material thing. It is filtered through a whole bunch of self-perceptions that are as deeply held and as powerful a source of pleasure as material security wealth. Epicurean delights are and so that means that you can feel like you're at the last days of a dying empire. You can feel like even formal democracy is about to be obliterated. You can feel like you have no way to stop it but you can still feel every day like. I can go on in these conditions because I know what they don't and more importantly if the day comes.

I can tell everyone that I told them so I guaran to you that if there is a coup an actual one like proud boys armed by the state in the streets to null in the nullifying election caravan of death chile. 73 type stuff like literal helicopter rides as long as the internet exists before it gets like cut off by the government or whatever and people are still able to post. The vast majority of posts of the people who are the most alarmed about that possibility are not going to be about how to resist it. They're going to say I oh you didn't think this was a big deal h . Where are you now what do you think now before it gets cut off. That'll be the last thing that that'll be the that will be like the cree decor. I told you so is what happens when your self perception is not as an agent of of history not as a being with will and the ability to exert it but as a passive critic which is the role that we have all a lot of us have instinctively taken given the paucity of options. But I think the funniest thing is that after all that fretting and the trajectory we're on would be trump getting reelected without there needing to be any shenanigans probably not a popular vote victory but at this point that's been who cares but like basically the same map as 2020 2016 without anybody falsifying any votes or stopping counting or any of that. The cyber ninjas being engaged because the democrats are shock of shocks who could have perceived who could have seen this coming so you hear of me being smug about something. Here's me being to be able to be like aha. I told you instead of doing anything about it. The democrats incapable of governing in a crisis. Oh man. I got red lights on my streamer thing and everything okay. There's a green light that should be better like I said apologies. This is stolen internet for now yeah. It's it sure is a hell of a thing h . It's pretty wacky what's going on hell of a thing okay good. The audio is fine just don't look at me. Don't look at me max headroom out. I can see the chat the chat's going so that's good oh somebody wants me to ask. Say to speak on the d d episodes and ask if say if jack and pat did a good job. Jack and pat did a great job and of course. Chris did an amazing job editing it. I am the least valuable appendage of the show when we do d and d stuff. I am most appreciative for everybody else when we do dnd because I honestly have never gotten a handle for it. I had more time fun this time because I was just a barbarian who didn't have to talk or think too much but just I realized it's I cannot as somebody pointed this out to me. I and it really nailed me.

I'm very bad at chess. I'm like supernaturally bad at chess. I will do moves that are just incomprehensively bad that I just literally don't see when I do them and I realize what it is is that I am so agonized by the choice to make a move that. I subconsciously steer my pieces into oblivion. I basically am death driven while. I play these games because I don't get any pleasure out of making a decision. I only get anxiety out of it. So I just want it to be over as soon as possible. That's also why I'm not a gamer like. I am. I think one of the reasons that I was able to put together this absurd quote-unquote career as a as a personality even though I don't really have any talent is that I embody the more than I guess most in terms of like perfectly embodying the the condition of paralyzed self-consciousness and then that gives me the ability to speak on that condition and to try to articulate how it feels. But that's it. I can't do anything else. I can't. I can't make decisions you know. I can't engage myself so. I do what is left which is critique and that's like worth very little except as entertainment. And I'm fortunate that some are entertained by it see like the book for example very hard for me to write because as soon as I have something written down I'm looking at it and as soon as I'm looking at it. I'm being paralyzed by the idea that it's bad and wrong and that it's going to be annihilated. I'm trying though we'll see like exceptional speaking works because it's gone as I say it there's no remaining vestige. It's it's entirely contained in the moment of expression. So there's not the the chance the the necessity of going over it and and and contemplating it and then being gripped by uncertainty about it. But I I'm trying. I have somebody. I think. I think I'm getting.

I honestly feel like what I've been the project of putting together. The next history podcast with chris has been very good at at focusing a lot and I honestly I'm starting to wonder if that's going to be how the shape it takes But we'll see like the contours of um of early protestantism in the age of the Printing press to me are fascinating because I genuinely believe that we are in a similar period. Like obviously history is a cycle right. It's cyclical and you see throughout human history. These inflection points where one condition is slowly changed over time. It's not stable. It's stable in a broad sense but changes are accumulating over time that eventually reach an inflection point and a crisis point and then something else occurs and all the people who are living in that moment don't know what they're building because by definition they can't. They only have lived lives under certain conditions and can only operate from the assumptions of those conditions. But the crisis that they live amongst is making them forcing them to make choices that are building new structures that they aren't even able to recognize and then their children and their children grow up in a literally different world and I feel like the the moment of the reformation. The early 17th the early 16th century in europe is a similar moment as the one we're living in now in that a type of human subjectivity is in a technologically and materially imposed crisis and it is we are in the process of creating a new human subjectivity. The abstracted internal culturated identity that mass literacy produced is in my opinion. More than anything what produced protestantism christianity faith which was necessary for life in the absence of anything else could no longer be sustained through social practice alone when you have literacy reading and modern urban life and it everyone's brain broke. I mean if you look at the history of the of the long crisis from the sixth from fifth from the. Early 1500s until the late 16th century 17th century you are seeing. This polity reformate reformat its mental hard drive and create a new subjectivity. And we are in that process now and the material driver.

In both cases is climate change. In the case of early modern europe the onset of the little ice age which fatally undermined in many cases. Literally the the ecological conditions that had allowed sort of the post black death. Feudalism to be re resurrected you had a intense warming period in the in the in the post black death generations and then in the mid 1500s going into the sixteen hundreds. You see this significant drop in in temperatures that causes significant damage to agricultural productivity at the very same time that people are living in their heads in a way they never had before and I think that that is where we are now. That was the that was the final crisis of feudalism interacting with a exogenous shock and then being disrupted and in that disruption we created the coping mechanisms the things that resolved those old contradictions and created new contradictions which is liberal secular capitalism exported around the world and now at the end of that process. The industrial technology that we use to do. It has destabilized our atmosphere destabilized our our ecology and once again interfered with the assumed conditions of production that had allowed the previous social organizations to exist at the exact same time that a new human subjectivity is being created by mass computer literacy because going from a largely illiterate. Social culture to a literate internal abstracted cloud-based like when you're reading about luther and about about the augsburg confession or whatever the and you're reading pamphlets about how the pope is the antichrist you are participating in a imagined social reality and you are imagining yourself as a synthetic being within that reality that did not exist before literacy. At least not in the intensity cannot be reproduced and reinscribed through the act. The literal act of sitting and reading the way that it could before and now we have reached the point where we are literally. We are like in a fundamental sense living virtually the the same abstraction as literacy but taken to a more intensified technological level which is degrees of difference reaching an inflection point like people said the same. I'm saying about the advent of motion pictures and television and you have marshall mcl an talking about the medium in the message and all that stuff in in the in the glory days of of the post-cold war consensus and that that was a shift that was an intensification but it was within a stabilized relationship that was then fatally destabilized by another level. A thing that is taking that process of abstraction and bringing it to an even more intensified level to the point where inflection is reached and we're no longer the same people that even our parents were or our grandparents were but we're all living at the same time together under conditions created by those previous generations and that causes significant crisis cultural crisis that is exacerbated then by material crisis and that is why I want to talk about that moment because it's it's what we've all been trying to do and what I've been trying to do with writing and talking about. This stuff is describe this moment as it's happening but the very the thing is about that limitation of it is that because you're in it you can't know what's being what's being. You can't know where the track is being laying. Really you can imagine but you are still that previous thing you are or at best a transitional fossil. You are not the thing that's being brought into being I am. I am I'm old man.

[34:31](https://youtu.be/zaL8iH1nK38?t=34m31s)

I grew up without the internet as a little kid. I was not digitally limited digitally literate. I remember coming in to little macintoshes and hell and elementary school playing oregon trail in carmen san diego. I remember the er of american online going booting up and I remember being able to I remember. It's taking 10 minutes to download the nfl.com home page which for some reason is the first one. I tried to look at. I was a football fan as a teenager and I just went to nfl.com and I remember sitting at the tv. The screen and watching it slowly fill over the course of 10 minutes and just thinking what is the point of this so.

I am I've been warped deeply by my encounter with technology like I got dropped into the toxic waste dump like emil and robocop and emerged a different more monstrous creature. But that experience means that I am not fully of this new reality and I can't really communicate with those who are because we have a different vocabulary. We have a different understanding of language. This is this is cooney and incommensurability. We're talking about so while I am fascinated by this moment. I feel like I've kind of reached the point where I can no longer speak too incisively about the specific kurt you know contrails of this largely because of how stuck it feels of course that feeling of stuckness is only subjective. If there are historians in the near far future. They will see the moment we're in not as a moment of stuckness. They will see it as part of a of a significant crisis but most crisis are perceived within them at certain points until they aren't as stasis and that means that we're not really able to say much about what is to be done so instead. I'm trying to look backward at another moment where this sort of alchemical transition occurred and see how that happened just to give the solace of a familiarity if nothing else and the thing about the 

This period that I'm really honing in on more than the reformation itself although I find it you know obviously fascinating and like the the way that the frontiers of the reformation were pushed. Past what luther wanted in every direction is really interesting to look at like materially you had the peasants of germany who took what he said to mean oh yeah. These earthly rulers are not legitimate if the church that upholds this order is illegitimate. Then the temporal power that they you that they express in the name of god is illegitimate and so you saw the the german peasant war which of course luther. A increasingly fat comfortable monk whose entire life was at the pleasure of rich patrons the elector saxony specifically who kept him alive after the diet of worms and kept him in sausages and and pumpernickel. Wasn't going to disrupt so he just he he denied. The peasants the validity of their revolt but they were put down materially and they were put down by force and and and that kind of let everybody know the limits of of of a challenge to authority coming from that.

But then you have those who took the The theology further like first the calvinists and then you know the anabaptists and all the splinter groups and and weirdos who emerged in in that moment trying to figure out how to make sense of a world where socially affirmed religion could no longer be taken for granted where we are now these abstract christians with a personal relationship to god whatever the that means you have a personal relationship to god how are you not looking in a mirror and of course that question is what creates modern neuroses. All modern neuroses spring from that breach because you could know god by looking around you but once that's no longer the case once you can only know god from looking. Within. Then you can never know god because you can only look in a mirror and that's why eventually all the the only way to the only thing to do is take this neurosis and secularize it so that the answers to it could be found within the market could be found within our structures of social oppression and exploitation and not outs and not outside of it because if it's outside of it then we might become fatally alienated to the system and attack it so instead. We abstracted everything into the that realm and that's and it made everything. It made a instead of a collective pursuit of the truth which is what the early protestants tried to create just like the early christians that they were emulating did you had an individual pursuit which can only be pursued where through the market through individual competition with others as a homo economicus and that's what we've been stuck with and it is the in ability to resolve that crisis that has created a runaway suicide imperative within capitalism.

People say capitalism is a death cult and that is true in the broad sense that we are carrying out a global social project whose encoded aim not our understanding of it. But the actual programming is of planetary suicide but unlike a cult where everyone within it has some understanding of what is going on and is participating in it who is saying we are moving towards a goal. We have the opposite situation where everybody is moving towards an individual goal and because we are doing that the only collective pursuit we can actually engage in is our annihilation which is what we're trying to do but of all this of all this entire era and this entire phenomenon right now the thing that I am focusing on and most interested in is the court of frederick v the elector palentine in the run-up to the 30 years war because it to me strikes. The most harmonic resonances with the moment we're living in because you had a situation where religious tensions within the holy roman empire had been cranking up for years the legitimacy of the courts of the empire's institutions its courts its diets were being undermined because of this snake in the garden of religious sex sectorialism you had lutheran you had you had the catholic habsburgs and their catholic allies. You had the lutherans like the saxons and all the one those who patronized luther. But then you also had these renegade calvinists who were not recognized by the piece of hausburg of 1555 which had after a number of wars between the catholic and protestant powers of the empire. The small cultic wars they basically did what the roman empire the holy roman empire was designed to do which is kick.

The can down the road if this sounds familiar at all and to say we can't resolve this conflict without open violence. So instead we are just going to leave things as they are and come back to it later and so The piece of iceberg recognized the idea that any territorial prince had the right to impose their religion on their area of control who's whose rule whose religion was the rule basically recognizing the conditions as they had been that had come out of the small called wars which were stalemate. The first kimoko war ended in a triumphant habsburg victory. The second small culticore though saw charles v get chased out of vienna and so they called basically a truce but that truce only recognized the lutherans because calvinism which was more of a threat to centralized authority more of a threat to traditional authorities because it decoupled the state from its ability to dictate clergy because luther who is the most conservative of the luth of the of the protestants because he was the first I believe in lutheranism. The relationship between church and state was basically kept as it had been under catholicism. The only difference was instead of the pope exercising authority on church matters that that authority was transferred to the secular ruler which is why so many princes it took a while but pretty. Soon after the luther started talking a lot of secular princes who wanted more authority who chafed under the the rule of the of the empire. Who wanted and chafed under the rule of the church itself started adopting lutheranism because it said now you you we get this. We've solved the investiture crisis that had you know cut through christendom all during the high middle ages by giving the secular prince full authority and of course they jumped at it but calvin the calvinist and of course. This is not a coincidence by the way that luther survives as a heretic which he was in the bosom of a territorial lord frederick. The wise elector of saxony and he of course then promulgates lutheranism which says secular lords should determine ecclesiastical offices in accordance of course with their people and calvin who went to the renegade. City-state of geneva which is now in switzerland. But what is that what was at that point had just recently overthrown the rule of the duke of savoy and become an independent city. A free city and we're looking for direction what to do like. We're now sovereign and and now religion is up for grabs. What do we do and it was there that luther or the kelvin promulgates his notion of a lay. Ecclesiastic authority church separate from the state and controlled by its members with the state as a guarantor with the state as made up of members of the church but as a separate entity which of course was hot. It's nothing that like the landed princes of europe wanted to hear but what was very resonant in the ears of the independent cities of early modern europe which chafed under the rule of territorial lords and wanted their own independence and it's not a coincidence that calvinism once he starts writing and the writing starts spreading across western europe resonates in the most urbanized parts of western europe of course in eastern europe. The only place that takes up calvinism is rural transylvania but that's a different story because of different conditions but in western europe in france and the low countries and the rhineland urban areas picked up calvinism and so you see the united the the dutch revolting against spanish habsburg rule to enforce their version of a reformed church. The huguenots of france fight against the catholics of of france and mostly get their asses kicked but but um but the huguenots were disproportionately traitors and urbanites and people who lived in their heads.

[48:37](https://youtu.be/zaL8iH1nK38?t=48m37s)

People who lived abstractly and so by the early 1600s which is exactly when the little ice age really kicks into gear when the sun literally dims the sun goes the somebody turns the dimmer switch on the sun in the early 1600s. At exactly that moment you have this electoral prince of germany which is the highest rank nobility within the holy roman empire because you have obviously just hundreds and hundreds of of secular and ecclesiastical princes. You've got individual knights holding small thiefs. The whole arena versus this riot of of degrees of nobility but at the very top of that are the seven electors who elect collectively the holy roman emperor three of them were um ecclesiastical rulers. The archbishops of cologne mainz and is it trier. I can't remember the other one and then you've got the electors of brandenburg saxony and the palatine the paletonite which is the rhineland north of bavar or northwest of bavaria and as I said the asberg treaty recognized de facto catholicism and lutheranism. But calvinism was still technically heresy and in heidelberg frederick the elector palatine with his trusted buddy christian of onhalt and his I got his last name. I gotta look it up to get his last name right because it's very funny. I think he might have made it up. A lot of those guys did that abraham abraham sculpted us the um the the top calvinist theologian of of the palatonite. They set about creating in heidelberg. A successor to geneva as the capital of reformed christianity in europe and they spent the run-up to the 30 years war.

While the bohemian estates were revolting against the imposition of catholicism in bohemia. They're building this narrative to themselves that frederick v who is a himbo basically but who had a very strategic marriage to the daughter of the king of england. James the first um they imagine thanks in part to having read anonymous tracks from a group called the rosicrucians about a a secret group of of godly men who were bringing about the apocalypse thanks in part to reading those guys and of course reading the bible through the lens of their own self-interest decide that frederick v is the prophesized monarch who will overthrow the devil on earth and bring about the end of the world and due to that belief they did a thing that no other prince in europe would have tried because of how dangerous it would have been which is except the renegade bohemians offer of the crone of the of the kingdom of bohemia in the face of the literally just elected holy roman emperor ferdinand ii and that started 30 years of worship that destroyed germany in large chunks and to me this is a this is a recognizable social and political phenomenon and so if we can look at what that leads we can. I don't know at least be entertained. I can't make too many claims but anyway. I think it's very interesting so that's what I've been working on and maybe. I'll put some of it down in paper hopefully but my the most interesting thing to me about this progression.

I said that goes from lutheranism right ecclesiastical lord's opponent appointed by earthly princes basically keeping the social structure as it is with its society of orders with its exploitation you know with its with it. Still feudalism is in crisis here and it's decomposing but it would be recognized as a continuity so let's call it feudalism and then you had calvinism which takes root in the cities where capitalism is not yet existent. But we are in this fluid state capitalism is being built in bits and pieces largely in the I believe along with elaine wood in brenner that largely being created in in rural england but also obviously in the in the dutch low countries in the In the rhine the the the commercial centers of the rhineland. I mean ausburg is also it's where you had the piece of that's where the piece was signed in 1555 and that's where the lutheran confession was promulgated and it's also where the footer family lent all the money to the habsburgs that kept the whole thing going in these areas calvinism and its notion of a individual a individualized christianity a personal relationship with god that is not socially reaffirmed.

The way catholicism had been that allows for commercial interaction that says we can treat each other as. Strangers in a neutral marketplace. We do not have to recognize each other as christians the way that you had to do in medieval feudal europe medieval feudal catholic europe. We can now really be strangers and it's and it's it is a rel. It is an understanding of christianity that better conforms to the the lived existence of a urban market participant. So all of these are accommodations with the changing conditions of feudalism and final crisis but then you add the one move the one push past that has no support within the existing structure and therefore cannot sustain itself as an independent political force and that is anabaptism.

So one of the chief insights of luther that gets the whole reformation going is that he says hey you know you got all these sacraments of the catholic church right. These things that you do for us this contract the thing that binds us to you we go to heaven. If we do these things these seven sacraments it's weird. None of them are in the bible dude. Bible is the book of god right nothing in here about the eucharist or any of this social technology. It's not in your head. This was created by a pre-literate feudal order. It has to be reinforced by ritual ah d but of course these people now those rituals are now constraining their their their chains on their neck as they're trying to participate in this rapidly shifting economic order. They don't have a name for it. Yet it's not cohered but it's not the rural rhythm that had a facilitated catholic catholic europe. So luther gets rid of a bunch of the sacrament says these aren't in the bible you don't have to do them. Then. The calvinists go a little further and they say actually you know what there's even more for example. Luther says all these sacraments except for infant baptism and the eucharist. I think eucharist that's the real stuff there's a presence. I don't know what you want to call it. I don't think it's transubstantiation but there's a presence in the eucharist. It's worth. It's meaningful then.

Calvin says you what are you talking about. It's a cookie. It's wine get over yourself but the thing is well. So they get in an argument right about and that's a big forms part of the big real conflict between calvinists and lutherans. That leads to a lot of strife during the second reformation where the the calvinists try to convert the lutherans and the root lutherans resist comes down to this question of the the eucharist and of communion and the calvinists have on their side. The fact that hey this isn't in the bible but luther of course has his own justification. But at the end of the day it's motivated reasoning. He wants to keep the eucharist because it's socially useful because in his imagined still feudal order having a church that dispenses eucharist is socially technologically useful so he can make up whatever reason. He wants that's the real reason that the eucharist stayed for luther now the city-based luth calvinists who maintain social coercion through the market now more and more than they do through like imbue religiously imbued social roles. They say no. The eucharist but infant baptism is also not in the bible. The same arguments that the calvinist made about the eucharist apply to infant baptism but kelvin didn't touch it because infant baptism was the ritual of affirmation of the existing social contract when I say existing. I mean not an existing religious understanding of the world.

[59:10](https://youtu.be/zaL8iH1nK38?t=59m10s)

Not an existing sectarian understanding or even geographically fixed understanding an understanding of oneself in an economic order as in the one who kills the land or the one who rides a horse or the one who counts the coins. The real social structure that animates all of this that keeps the lights on that keeps the torches burning the feudal capital. Early modern social order where feudalism as in serfdom is largely abolished in large sections of europe and the holy roman empire. The basically the further west you go or the further east you go in europe. The more surfs there are in in. I mean spain is kind of re-surfens in the 1700s because of the currency crisis of the new world silver mines but like in the center of europe large percentages and in the low countries and in england large percentages of farmers are no longer serfs with feudal ties to the land and feudal obligations. They are tenants or outright yeoman owners so that is a difference than feudalism but they're still operating in a system where land-based rights and money surplus is accumulated to owners and of course there that circulation creates the urban economy. But it's all part of a greater economic order and infant baptism is your assimilation into that order. Here you are a member of christendom which means that if your dad was a farmer you're a farmer you work the land we do that we do religion. We we go. We do warfare but you you work the land and in return you go to heaven. Like that is the real bargain being swept here. This this is the religious bargain you're going to get protected. You're not going to get killed by raiders. We have we you will be secure and so you will be able to like get the mere pleasures of life. Even as a you know broken back peasant and there are pleasures of life in every condition.

Even if it's just the temporary relief of suffering and that's enough to get people by and then there is a greater reward in the in the hereafter and that'll keep you farming which keeps the lords in their castles and it keeps the city people in their county houses so every type of terrestrial order in the hierarchy from city lords or city burgers. Rural aristocrats and the dynasties above them all have a vested interest in affirming a basic social order and being able to bring people into it and know that they have that ideological and identity investment in it authority is the word. I'm looking for infant baptism is an affirmation of the authority of the existing power structure which is still a a corporate thing so no mainstream reformer made the same critique of infant baptism that luther and calvin between them had made of all the other ones because if you did they would kill you in geneva. They literally drowned the anabaptists as like an ironic punishment. They drown him in the river because that was the line because protestantism is dissolving social bonds but only those that are allowed to be sundered. The lutheran lords allowed him to sever the connection between the church and their lands because it was in their interest. The cities allowed the further severance of connections to landed authority but nobody is going to cut their own throat like that and so anabaptism became a heresy that anywhere you went would get you killed if you went to the catholic lands which obviously but if you went to lutheran lands. If you went to a calvinist city you were going to get killed if you talked too much about how there's nothing about baptizing infants in the bible and you should get to choose to join a community of believers.

You should make your own decision as to what order you will obey nope that happens to you at birth and so the closest thing you see to temporal exercise of power by anabaptists. Those who take protestantism the protestant reformation to its logical conclusion of we are going to bring heaven on earth by living as christians. These institutions don't allow us to live as christians. Now you come to terms with those limits because you're either getting fed like luther or you're getting hanged like thomas munster and the german peasants carrot and stick keep you in line along some tension with a state that does not allow christian living the anabaptists by rejecting the entire social control technology of christianity were able to try to actually assert a christian livelihood on the earth in a major city which they took over. They were invested by the local archbishop starved and then eventually massacred and of course what happens aft when they are laid seized to is very predictably a descent into theocratic madness. Mass execution of heretics also mass sexual licentiousness polygamy public sects bashian nightmarish rebels because they have been they're being starved because the conditions to allow for the material persistence of that community are deprived of them and so of course. It descends and the fact that it descended was used by secular princes and religious ones across europe to say. This is why you don't do that this is why there's no anabaptism. This is why you don't get to pick that because you're going to end up mass marrying and fornicating and guaranteeing that you go to hell but of course it's only because they were suffocated by the existing powers that be just as communism was suffocated by its the encircling capital liberals secular successor to protestantism that by that point ruled the world just as christian sort of feudal capitalism ruled early modern europe because both of them sought to live as christians communism socialism. The dream of it is the dream of a christian republic. I'm sorry. It is. I don't know if that makes things I I don't but. I don't think that's a problem because the christian republic is in my mind. The same as a any sort of end state of social tranquility in any other cultural and religious context.

It's the same thing it comes out of a christian tradition because as I said we're locked into the social structures that the previous generations built history lays like a nightmare on the heads of the living but we're also building something new now. Marx's imagining of how this would go about that didn't require religion that said religion would go away imagine the situation where in the early 20th century capitalism is overthrown and humanity. The entirety of it can build socialism together now of course that's going to be a violent process. It's going to kill a lot of people. It's going to lead to starvation and misery. But it's going to also build something it's going to build people. It's going to build a new human experience. A huge human subjectivity a furthering of the process that we saw built explode all throughout the development of capitalism. A new human spirit that encompasses humanity that identifies humanity with god not the self with god as protestantism did because that is protestantism. The world can no longer really be god because I'm alienated from it too critically so I am god. The only two things I know are real the world as I perceive it and myself two things that are not separate but I imagine are separate and the only things I can believe in the process of building world. Communism would give birth to a new human subjectivity that turned god into humanity and then of course into the entire biosphere and it would be a process of building and that means that instead of the prolonged deprivation experienced by cut off attempts to build such a thing like the premature anabaptists of monster and the similarly premature bolsheviks of the soviet union. In those conditions. The social structures that emerge are going to be poisoned at the root because you can't build anything you are cannibalizing and that is what the soviet union was yes. The soviet union was a miracle of human endeavor. They built a modern country out of a feudal throwback within a few generations. But it was a cannibalistic effort. They ate their own peasant class. They chewed them up and spit them out and you can say that had to happen it did have to happen but communism shouldn't have done it.

Capitalism should have done it as it did it in europe as it was doing it across the world. Now if you'd had as marx and most and marx and lennon and trotsky imagine if you had a situation after world war one where capitalism was overthrown there's still so much bounty of the world. At that point there is so much unprocessed unused energy. There is so there's so much carbon left to be spewed into the atmosphere right that all the violence and all the conflict and all the misery that we would have gone through in the 20th century would have still happened but in a different way building different institutions. Different subjective experiences of those institutions gotten to a point where everybody is working towards this thing. Now maybe you'll never get there because you are living bound by history and by material conditions that might change in a way you can't anticipate. But my god you can move towards it and everybody within a social order can imagine that their worth as a person comes from being part of this project. What we got instead because of the failure of communism is this suicide. This death drive of the protestant ego in conditions of scarcity. We are now all in anabaptist monster. We are now all in the soviet union. We are now being suffocated and surrounded by a capitalism that is all-encompassing and it is no longer territorially based. It has been it has transcended spatial domination and become. God has become a living god surrounding us we no longer make history instead. All we do is as the anabaptists dated munster and as the soviets did try to build something through cannibalism but only destroying ourselves by cannibalizing but that process causes a breakdown of institutions. It accumulates contradictions that cannot be accommodated because as I said no one is working towards annihilation.

Everybody wants the world to keep going there is no. I don't really believe that there are any like comic book super villains who really want the world to end want to live in a bunker like they even the ones who imagine oh. I'm going to go to the moon or I'm going to go to mars. I'm going to go to the bunker. I don't think most of them want that and even the ones around mars well. I can go to mars even if the world doesn't end. They don't want the world to end they're working towards it.

[73:43](https://youtu.be/zaL8iH1nK38?t=73m43s)

We're all working towards it but we're not doing that consciously. What we're doing is working towards our self-interest. As we imagine it. We are worshiping god. We are worshiping ourselves as god and that practice of worship is to look out for number one in a material way that has the effect of hastening the apocalypse the unrevealing but not the unrevealing of our christian humanity. The unveiling of our damned nature not the not. The opening of the pearly gates in the heaven but of the crossing of the river sticks into hell. What that means is that the long-term viability of the social technologies that allow for capitalism to flourish are being undermined because we're not just destroying the world. We're also destroying the institutions we're part of in the same way with the same self-interest like members of the democratic party. The republican party too they're all digging their own graves. We're all digging around graves because we don't know what else to do. That's what every generation does. Every crisis empire that every empire that faces a usually climate-based crisis and collapses does so because everybody is going towards what they think god wants what that looks like is different in every culture. But what god wants is just a reflection of the collective self-interest of this unaggregated humanity that is separated by regimes of domination the fact that you have surplus creators and surplus enjoyers. You are creating a fractured human community that can only respond schizophrenically to crisis because somebody digs and somebody enjoys somebody somebody farms and somebody eats that creates different worlds. Different emotional worlds different emotional understandings of their self-interest. What the world is their understandings of god and so every civilization hastens its own destruction because worshiping that god that god is just the political and social and economic order you live under. That's the god you're actually animating with your actions and that social order was built under certain conditions material conditions and it doesn't know how to work any other way if you change the equation in the algorithm. If you change x to y in terms of inputs amount of calories. Basically it cannot function but nobody within.

It can recognize it because they're stuck by it. That is why marxist messiah marks the second coming marx's messiah. Because remember he was a jew and a christian both of which are premised on an apocalyptic revelation of a messiah for christians for jews. It is it is an unrealized ideal for christians. It's jesus for. Marx is the working class because what the working class can do by their self-interests coming into alignment against the system. In conscious conflict with it you can build a social order. A social mechanism that can take these crisis conditions that undermine the machine and build a new machine because it's no longer being oppressed effectively because everybody within these institutions is undermining them everybody working within every company. Every political party in the world right now is destroying their own system but they don't know they're doing that they don't know that their self-interest in conditions of declining material. Because this thing was built on our selfishness and when you have unlimited inputs the machine works. Everybody gets to the degree. They can make a demand of the material world. They can get paid off so a worker in the dominated colony gets. Nothing gets a gun to the head and enough food to keep going but a worker in the center of the corps gets at the height of this the lifestyle they see on tv what rich people live like material pleasure and abundance. The only thing I know to be worth seeking because it's the only thing I am given as a value for that and of course the higher up you get the more they get to demand the more demands. The demands are met as much they need to and then if they can't afford to be met. Those who resist are destroyed and because they are only resisting individually they can be isolated and annihilated. It's self-cleaning unit. It is an organism. It is a system of systems. It is immortal until that material condition changes under conditions of scarcity. Everybody acting in their own best interest in the short term means that all of that social faith that we have in these institutions that keeps us going and that informs our understanding of ourselves and what our self-interests are and how we align them with things like the country or capitalism or america. These abstractions that we had connected previously to our own best interest because they were aligned in the 20th century. The like this social and political order was built on the premise that the average american citizen would look at the world look at america defined. As its institutions its capitalist institutions and say we have the same interests and then act accordingly. But that's because their demands were met and the people whose demands were not met. They don't know those people they're divided by class by geography by race more than anything. I don't know them them now of course because they've been able to annihilate that disillusionment alienation that marx was premising his theory on and which did wrack the world in the early 20th century world war one world war. Ii was the second 30 years war where you replace protestantism with socialism and what emerged from that is this system where capitalism is going to be imposed on people you're going to take a deal around the world and everybody's going to get a deal and everyone is going to take the deal or they were going to not take the deal. If they didn't want to take the deal. They would sign up with communism represented by the soviet union. In one way or another maybe. They were anti but then you know then you have the fact that this is a thing that's fixed in a geographic area and bound by this cannibalistic scarcity. But even with that you could allow yourself with the soviet union or you could allow yourself with capitalism now of course. In america. There were plenty of socialists who really believed in socialism but rejected the soviet union because it was not democratic.

It didn't have all the bells and whistles of a civil society of virtue that I imagined myself living in and yeah. That's because it was in a crisis condition. It was being strangled by capitalism but over here in america where I'm probably doing okay. Even if I'm a worker. I'm getting more money than I used to get and if I'm an intellectual. I'm literally living in a more comfortable safe technologically convenient and interesting world than has ever been imagined by anybody. I can make this distinction and say the soviets aren't worth supporting. I can afford to but in the colonial world that was being incorporated into capitalism. After the the imperial. The last old imperial rule was replaced by this new dominion of a abstracted dollar empire of capitalism as the world system was round into final form. The same deal was being made the people who said I take that deal are your comprador classes who who take power on behalf of capital and those who say no ally with the soviet union and become rebels. Fight against capitalism are largely massacred or in a few cases are able to win guerilla wars and they don't care about the civil society. Ringer they don't get a corner office or paid vacations. They get a gun to the head and the reimposition of colonial regimes of domination unless you're a army officer who gets to hold the gun instead of had it pointed at them. That's a bad deal which is why you saw this huge rush to communism after world war ii in the colonial world. But it was defeated in most of places like africa and latin america because there were enough locals who stood to gain in the short term from capitalism to make a deal. That's why mom said revolution isn't a dinner party because and that's meaningful because for for americans and western europeans after world war. Ii revolution absolutely was a dinner party because of your relationship to capital from periphery or center and that's why I wonder if there was a situation where there was no soviet union to align everyone align to polarize workers in in in europe and the united states that maybe that class struggle would have gone differently because if you're fighting for socialism in the western europe and you're in the united states and the soviet union is what it is that is going to lead you with a question do I align with it or against it and that question is going to be answered by well how much do you care about niceties and dinner party stuff and the working class was divided on that question. It was not aligned the thing that was supposed to align. Its goals was the general the broad push towards socialism and the creation of the soviet union created a fixed understanding of what that meant which by definition shatters. The word psyche the collective psyche of the working class and separates it into two groups now maybe they all would have been defeated in turn without that material force of soviet communism to push against fascism emerging or the lack of division maintains the the focus and the collective effectiveness of these individual working class parties in the individual countries that they can push in the same direction even though they're not connected internationally not saying it could happen.

I'm just saying. I think that the world we're in is a world where a one of those inflection points happened and we failed to transition. We will not see heaven and in that condition then you have to look back and say well how could we have gone to heaven and the thing is at the end of the day. I believe we could have because if we collectively could have gone to heaven that means we all individually can be saved and I believe that we all individually can be saved. This is where my is where I the fusion of politics and philosophy and theology come to me is that I believe at the end more than anything. I believe and I think the thing that generates true religious a feeling as in religious feeling that expresses a truth as opposed to the mirror. The the dark mirrored truth that society reproduces the truth of human connectedness. The truth of harmony between humans and their environment and each other that is all premised on a fund. The fact that we can all be saved and so that means things could have been different which means I have to understand capitalism. A certain way. I have to understand that even if capitalism was inevitable once the roman empire fell because of europe's specific conditions. Its victory did not have to happen. I believe will I'll be saved fundamentally because I do not believe that there is a distinction. There is no the cartoons do the creation. Our cartesian duality is the fundamental filter of our individual experiences that it's the archon car descartes is is yelboa death.

If you want to think about it he was recognizing the fundamental fracture. We have that we have to repair and that is the work of life is to repair the breach and to deny that contradiction that is what working out in my mind. The dialectic is the fundamental dialectic is the non-existent distinction between self perception and the universe because we cannot live with that. We have we live living is recognizing it as a distinction recognizing it as a dialectic. It is delusion like that is what generates conscious life. That is the the spark. It's. It's. It's oh the the explosions of of like the cosmic furnaces. The creation of stars and nuclear bombs and every human action is that conflict. We are all as conscious beings powered by our push to resolve this contradiction and then the fact that every time we get to a resolution. We are repelled again. We are always repelled. We feel it we can sit with it but we cannot act with it. That is why the the idealized religious life is of solitary contemplation. Basically no acting at all whether you're talking about a monk in in a franciscan priory or a or or a monk on a hilltop. In tibet. It is not acting because acting on the world requires believing in that distinction believing in that separateness and then trying to resolve it trying to resolve the unresolvable fix an equation that can't be fixed because the remainder is not something that can be expressed in language or symbol. It is a pure feeling and so the task for all of us who are fallen who do not have what it is in us to pursue to subsist on the meager sensory pleasures of the monastic life who have to act on the world in order to get our treats. The task is to find a a vocabulary of symbols that can stand in for the serenity of actlessness the serenity of stabili of silence while we act and that is getting back to another cliche that I've talked about before and that I hate has been commodified but it has to be mindfulness. It is recognizing the contradiction as a contradiction. It is taking the premises only as thought experiments as much as possible and that requires detaching yourself emotionally from the pursuit of these things okay.

I went long ago. I hope some of this makes sense I'm sorry if I kept freezing because I as I said I'm stealing internet. But I feel like this was a good one. I feel like we got to some places. I'm once again just trying to like the act of me. Doing.

[92:48](https://youtu.be/zaL8iH1nK38?t=92m48s)

This is for me that spiritual act because I am a being at the end of history who has been totally alienated from my body and from the truths of my body. The feelings of my body I live in the in the abstracted realm of the the print culture and then broadcast moving image culture and then of course internet culture is done to me and so I am addicted to distraction and treats I am discontented by the by the void by the prospect of of really living with the ephemerality and non-existence of mice. My individuality. I I can only viscerally believe things if I can describe them symbolically and I would say that that is the essence of the abstracted modern psyche is that it cannot be moved to act not think act absent a a formal conscious belief and this is what protestantism began the process of taking religious belief from the realm of the sensory to the realm of the mental which is to turn it into a word puzzle and going over that word puzzle allows you to sit or act in any way from a knowledge of truth as opposed to ignoring it accepting the reality of the world around you and then acting in exact opposite of your self-interest your personal health your. Mental health which is of course the same thing you're a treatment of other people your your your conscious motivation and so like for me a lot of reasons that I did these streams. I did so. Many of them is that this was my substitution for that act of sitting talking something through so that I believe it and then having the associate good feelings of just sitting here not doing something unpleasant not feeling anything unpleasant because that's the thing that's why people keep living the human life in repose is one of more pleasure than pain human body.

In repose unless there is an active injury to it and even then you can ignore it which I do because my legs all hurt. All the time is one of more sensory pleasure than pain and we can make it even more pleasure by pursuing pleasure but pursuing pleasure hurts us hurts. Those around us makes us feel bad and then we have to sit with that bad. Feeling emotionally. Physically we feel bad and we have to sit with it and that makes us have to choose to do different things and motivates us to act differently to alleviate that but because we're only trying to get at the surface of why we feel bad. We go in the wrong direction so you have to be able to in the moment of crisis and pain and unpleasantness remember why you're doing it which is the greater truth that can be most deeply felt. When you are consciously connecting the sensual pleasures of life to this truth and the central pleasure of being in repose is the most pure sort of pleasure meditation prayer because it does not involve you imbibing anything in your own body that makes you feel a certain way. It doesn't involve you selfishly interacting with other people in a way that makes you feel guilty and that that guilt you then have to get away from and it is belief is the ability to pursue stillness while acting and the reason that we're and the dead.

The death spiral we're in is that the actual protestants who are left because obviously as I i hope. I will have made clear by now the premise of the what this all means is that we're all protestants. We're all inheritors of that tradition. We're all we have been bootstrapped by global capitalism into this matrix but it has evolved over time. Some people now are secular protestants. But there are still people who have the form of religion and they believe in god as a real abstract thing and they believe in heaven as a real place. They believe they'll go there but that belief is so abstracted from the life. They lead and the things they pursue that they cannot that they are actually connecting it to The opposite of the truth that those things are supposed to represent. Those things are supposed to represent the fact that we are all the same and that we are all in harmony and we can live that way. If you are a christian who believes in capitalism and the self which is basically all of them in the western world. Then you believe the opposite you act the opposite. We are not reconcilable and protestantism says this explicitly we are not reconcilable to god. We are not reconcilable to ourselves and each other and so we need intervening institutions of authority like the capital market the compulsion to eat or starve to make us act accordingly. That's why so many protestants love to say well if there wasn't If you didn't believe in god then what stops me from raping and killing people. It's like because for you god is a set of rules to follow to go to heaven and be rewarded because it is a selfish individual pursuit of salvation. There is no felt connection to the fellow human being. They are enemies to you you're as alienated as a randian. Only you have a a formal religious gloss and a supernatural imaginary to connect it to and so that means that you feel bad but your formal understanding of yourself as a christian makes you act in accordance with systems that benefit you in one way allow you to live a decadent lifestyle but bind you in another and that make your understanding of well.

What's heaven what is heaven I'm imagining heaven. What is it well. What is pleasure to me pleasure is earthly pleasure. Pleasure is the seafood buffet the cigar quarter trip to six flags well. Those things all on earth depend on surplus abstraction and exploitation. They're built into the package and you can enjoy them to the degree that you engage in this social contract. So your mind has literally reversed good and evil you're still pursuing good and you think it's good but it is actually evil and we're all pursuing evil to the degree that we are pursuing our self-interest. Now. I'm pursuing my self-interest too. I'm doing evil but I also try to be conscious of my understanding of religious truth to drive my actions and make me hopefully less evil than other people. If you are a self-conscious nurse like a self-conscious libertarian type. Like you are a which is a lot of people. You are a homo economicus. You are that last man or you are a protestant gloss on that and you believe in god and in the supernatural but you believe you will be rewarded in heaven with the pleasures of the flesh and not you reunion with god. Then you will do good in your mind and it will impact your decisions. But it won't stop you from doing the worst thing you could ever do in any situation because in your mind those things will be the same okay and of course.

This is why the only vital monotheistic religion is islam because it was not built modern islam. Modern understanding of islam communicated globally was not created by capitalism. It was dominated from without by capitalism. That's a meaningful distinction that means that it is a religious faith that is grounded and not abstracted the way that christianity is and that means it's vital in a way christianity can't be but it is still constrained by capitalism because people are might be operating off of this more vital religious belief but it is still in a capitalist context. But of course. The problem with islam is that as I said it there's nothing within it that really militates against this religious belief being incorporated into capitalism. Like islam defeating the west is not the victory for socialism or even like a religious theocratic. Communion of of believers it would be a reconstruction of domination because islam was born in domination and validates domination. It has to be transformed by the interaction with working class consciousness which is the class consciousness of the exploited. The self-consciously exploited people who understand themselves as the victims of a social order not the beneficiaries and that and that interaction happened within islam of course. But it was similarly defeated from without in that their case by the us government literally undermining secular arab nationalism that was embedded with it had embedded within its socialist. Concepts. Was of course not socialist always but like had socialist elements interacted with the working class and was defeated in favor of a wahhabism that emerged from the pre-capitalist pre-self-consciously subaltern ideology of islam when it was the ideology of slaver slave owners and and tribal chiefs and so you have this reactionary religious tradition now interacting with the modern world. That's why the hopeful synthesis for me is like some sort of islamic derived monotheism with a apocalyptic horizon wedded to the thoroughly secularized but still communally conscious chinese. There's your synthesis yeah actually never mind all that wokeness is a religion actually yeah of course the shia. We're we're tended to be more politically radical because they were a subaltern identity within islam and yeah.

That's why you have this war between the chinese state and islam in china happening right now. But of course the winner will not be one or the other that's not how it works something will be built from. It don't know what it'll be. But it's. It's we're moving in a direction and then inflection points occur and that direction changes in ways that we can't anticipate because we're bounded by this moment. That's my way of punting the football but yeah.

[106:14](https://youtu.be/zaL8iH1nK38?t=106m14s)

Like that is why I've said this before why wokeness is a religion is is such a slogan of a dullard because it me it says nothing it means nothing. Wokeness is a ritual a individual ritual of public virtue which is exactly what calvinist urbanized christian self-conscious self-conception of morality is d . Everyone is pursuing that that's just how it is pursued among a secularized educated urban downwardly. Mobile that's the key component lightly I guess you'd say relative to others. Exploited sector of the of the precariat unexploited but relatively lightly exploited in that you feel that the system benefits you enough to be invested in as opposed to people who are so alienated from the system. They drop out completely which is an increasing number of the actual working class in this country. As in the people who like feel like they're working like their day is I am laboring for someone else. The ones who feel that the most keenly have the least investment in our civic rituals care the least about any of this which is why they weren't reachable during the sanders campaign. That is why wokeness is such a fixed idea fix on the broad liberal left because it's all they have there. It's all we have because we are stuck in this machinery of exploitation and we are going to feel some combination of outrage and guilt about that and we have to express it somewhere and we can't express it. By acting we have to express it by thinking and then expressing those things thoughts and validating them by having them ritually reaffirmed and echoed back to us. We need to socially echolocate to find a niche a place where we can compare ourselves and our virtues to others and say okay I'm better than them and I'm worse than them. That means I'm still within the green line and I'm okay. That is how you conduct yourself as a political being absent agency. And that is why wokeness becomes the most dominant register because it's the only thing that unifies everyone on that side. Everyone who feels more guilt than rage like forget pmc any of this. The real dividing line we're talking about are people who feel more guilt than rage about their current conditions of life like their actual material conditions. Yes how they think the world is around them but that is only a reflection of their real feelings which are connected to their actual lives. The bad feelings they feel do. They feel more guilt or more rage that is the real dividing line. If you feel more guilt and rage you are on broadly the liberal left you could be a socialist well. You don't have to be a socialist you're but you are everyone on The broad left which is what the post leftists realized is oh. These people are all the same and it's like in the sense that they feel more guilt than rage. Yes. They are but as things get worse a lot of people who now are on the post left. They feel worse than they used to feel for a bunch of reasons that means they have to put that feeling somewhere they used to feel more guilt than rage. Now they feel more rage than guilt and if you want to know why there's the actual populist energy on this country is on the right like politically organized and not stochastic and relatively un coordinated and as a result. Less politically effective is on the right because these are people who feel a political rage to the united states. There are plenty of people who feel political rage to the united states that are not on the right. They have rejected both. They don't like democrats either they're the radical left they're the other side of the coin. The the people who fought the hardest during the george floyd protest and got the most violent reply but they're not part of the project. They're alienated from politics and then on top of them. You have the people who aren't alienated and this is what we're really talking about. The people who aren't alienated from politics broadly is in picking a side and rooting for it and then acting on my preference.

Those people are guilty. Those people are overwhelmingly people who feel guilty and that means that they cannot be now. Some of them feel a lot of misery and feel a lot of rage not as much guilt as guilt but they feel rage and they feel misery and their lives suck like actually suck is it not like oh. It's hell world like I write for a magazine and I have depression but my day-to-day life is one of ease and pleasure. Like actually my day-to-day life is like feeling physical pain as my body is taxed for somebody else's profit and I don't get to see it. I am alienated from my time on earth. I made to feel bad for no good end for someone else's end. I get to feel like a puppet plenty of people. Those are on the left but they are the least likely to vote because that rage alienates them from a system that they no longer feel beneficial. They can get benefits from and there are fewer of them in the tent of people who care about politics than there are people who have something to lose and know they have something to lose by the end of the system as they know it and so that means that while you all might agree in theory that class is more important than race or maybe you don't believe that because like I'm saying this is a coalition. This is liberals too because it's a cross-class coalition. You have no agreement on what like a class identity even is. It cannot be organized around because it is a point of rupture. What can be agreed upon by all is the unjust nature of american society vis-a-vis race intersectional identities that is the only unifying feature amongst everybody who is politically active towards a left goal. I.e a place that allows them to feel less misery and less rage or feel less guilt on behalf of those who suffer it that I know who suffer it that I know suffer from my benefit but that I don't feel myself which is most people on the political left. One way or the other.

They suffer less than they feel the beneficiary of suffering now some people talk. Some people say that's why you're going to see like you should be seeing collapsing voting participation and yet you're actually seeing people vote more and more than they used to like people more people voted last year than previously like there was a big jump across all um demographics and that was what made people so alarmed about trump because he gained in all these other demographic groups he lost among comfortable whites but he lost so much amongst the comfortable whites in strategic states that it wiped out those gains elsewhere. But those gains were among people who are still alienated from politics who don't filter things through a political lens who do not connect a political ideology to their sense of self be self-worth which is how I would define politically active people in this country. Like people when you're a member of the left broadly or you're the right. It's because you self-identify with a political tradition. A political goal people who are voting more and more now. I think are people who don't have that they have political views but they are not emotionally held. What they have emotionally held are views about identity views about who they are in a cultural context who they are in a demographic context and most importantly their aesthetic preferences in the culture war that they are observing and that we're all observing when you're watching the culture where you're watching the the psyche of middle america shadow box and you have the guilty against the pissed which is the republicans and the democrats and if you're watching it from outside and you have to pick a side which are deteriorating conditions and the increased politician of all culture makes you have to do like if you're a person who you used to be able to be a person in this country who you've done one if you didn't want to hear about politics. You could just decide not to there's other stuff to do there's other stuff to watch you could be a political you can do. It now too still but it's much harder. It's much more difficult because the people who make culture now are more hysterical about making it than they've ever been before because they feel more pissed and more guilty than they ever have before because things are worse than they ever have been. But they're still doing so good and they feel so weird about that they either feel mad about their suppressed guilt or their neurotic because of their recognized guilt and they get more and more. They want more politics in their culture. They want to be able to reinforce their political identity more by consuming more political content. If they make content they want it to reflect their political views. More it increases the volume of political discourse and it spreads its influence over other forms of entertainment. Other forms of spectacle so that you're basically thrusting back on people who have rejected politics already consciously or subconsciously politics back to them and forcing them to make a choice who you gonna root for and if you don't have a political commitment to one or the other you have an aesthetic commitment what do. I like what makes me feel good a bunch of weeping hamilton quoting dorks whipping themselves on one side or if you're not white condescending to you on one side or people just having a good time people. With those other people because somebody's feeling bad in both of these spectacular imaginaries but the spectacular imaginary of liberalism broadly you feel bad in the spectacular imaginarium of the right. They feel bad which makes you feel good by comparison you get to feel good by watching them feel bad. There's no choice. This is an easy choice if you've not been fully neuroticized by ritually reinscribing the behavior of a neurotic post-protestant. You would rather feel good than make yourself feel bad.

No they said light ringers aren't having fun either no correct nobody's having fun everyone's miserable. That's why it keeps getting worse but there is a spectacle you're involving yourself in that you lie to yourself about I'm having fun. I'm having fun watching this documentary the 15th documentary. This month I've watched about the tulsa race riot of 1921 or I'm owning the the chuds online or something. They're at some level you're doing it because it provides pleasure. But it is a short-term pleasure that is eventually not distinguishable from numbness. But all you can do is that more of it and double down on it so you feel miserable but you pursue a pleasure and in the conservative liberal imaginary. It is a pleasure of inflicting pain on another and in the liberal imaginarium. It's inflicting pain on oneself. What was the big streaming show. What was the big streaming phenomenon of the immediate post-trump era as soon as he gets in the handmaid's tail the handmaid's tale as they say in pittsburgh. It's the freaking handmaid's tale imagining myself martyred because that's what it is. It's martyrdom and which is the highest state of the believing christian in in your you are pleasurably seeking the inscribement of your own misery for for the for the entire trump presidency was the libido unleashed. I have fun. I have a good time and the fact that you're mad about. It makes it even better that's the real stuff that's the real juice like trump is the most miserable man on earth. He has never been happy for a second of his life. He has only had sex one of like the most intimate powerful physical pleasures you can have he has only had sex to procreate and because he thinks he has to do it to be a man. He's pursued pleasure his entire life and has never never found it. But his objective pleasure is himself. It's not somebody else. Somebody else is the object of pain because that's how we have pleasure. It's a comparison only in always. It's not a thing in itself. That's why so many conservatives go crazy about kaepernick because they only have x amount they want to care about politics and then they want to care about things like sports and they don't want to get political feelings about sports. They want to get the pure aesthetic pleasures of sports and of course that's built on a political scaffolding. But it's one that they are invisible to that's what makes it fun. It reinforces their political views without them having to think about it. It's great then you make them think about it and make them get riled up. They don't want to feel that it's still the same like pleasure seeking cycle but it they're now the aggrieved ones because they're of course always feeling aggrieved too and those can and those guilt-ridden literals. Liberals also feel aggrieved all the time as I said these are. These are the engines when I say there's two things you have to assume that they are within each other because it is trying to re. It's two. It's a huge group of people all of them trying to resolve the same contradiction and just popping up on one side or the other of an imagined divide and then pursuing their lives through that so everyone is aggrieved everyone is guilty. Everyone is trying to assuage one or the other by making themselves feel good and by making other people feel bad and the thing is is as the horizon of like actually materially ameliorative politics goes away. Liberals and leftists are increasingly going to have to find their pleasure in the pain of someone else or else. They're going to have to accept their final martyrdom which they do not want to do. They would love to be martyred symbolically on tv but they themselves would rather not thank you very much which is as I said the drive of the of the january. Sixth penitent is they're going to annihilate me and in my annihilation I will be declared an elect. I sacrificed for my beliefs or they imagine they will what they'll probably do is run towards pleasure and away from pain because that's the overdriving instinct. Everything else is a fantasy because we live spiritually impoverished times and in moments of crisis. We have nothing to follow back on but self-pleasure in the narrowest sense so that means all these liberals and leftists are going to accommodate the new order where oh yeah no formal democracy is dead Any hope of equitable resources is gone we're gonna have to choose people to live and people to die and most on the left liberal side will say okay well. Then if somebody has to die then make it the conservatives because they have it coming because they are bad of course. This is the same decision that the democrats the conservatives are making they're saying yes point this machine at them because they're bad because they made it happen and of course they're both looking in a mirror now.

This is happening the lower half of both of these coalitions. The people who are more exploited than expl then feel exploited or the more that the people who are more exploited than feel the beneficiaries of exploitation. The people who are more aggrieved like genuinely aggrieved than a pseudo pseudo-aggrieved they're falling away they are being cannibalized. The machine is cannibalizing them both while the mechanism the gimbal is being pushed by these two sides grabbing for the controls and I think the final reconciliation of this is a matthew mcconaughey techno genocidal empire where we work out all of our culture war. Kinks until all the really miserable people are dead or enslaved and the only ones left to care about. Politics are inside a relative comfortable bubble and a real have a real physical distance from the suffering that's being created by the system because it's been technologically erased. They're going to only have their spectacle again. All the politics will have been washed out everybody who's really suffering will be eliminated and no longer a political subject no longer even thought of as a political subject or a human being by those inside the circle of wire and then you can have people inside and all the politics. All those bygones will be bygones and all we'll have is our programs and our shows and our spectacle shorn of all the political content that is now overwhelming it and what represents that matthew makane pure aesthetic up. Beauty charisma hanging around with a friend and that friend can tell you look. It's all right all right all right. These people have to die these people have to be instrumentalized for our benefit. It's not ideal but it's the best we can hope for and we all need to accept how things are and respect one another one another being the people within the wire because hey what's the alternative here you're going to open the doors you're not opening. The doors get real not opening the doors and if that's the only option and this is where we get to the point where all of our denial can no longer be sustained by the material conditions. We can't have our fake little gunfight or little pseudo politics. We can no longer afford that so if the stakes really are get with the program or open the doors or fight and then be kicked out or eliminated. Let's let's all watch the president um let's watch president what's a beloved mcconaughey character who's not rust coal he.

I can't even think of any because he's him and all of them let our beloved um what the is his name in a time to kill oh yeah. Yes. There we go let our beloved palmer joss of contact tell us like cool facts about mars that our rover just discovered and then be like oh yeah and by the way um we just Nuclear scrubbed north africa and of course this is one path because these machines are eating themselves. The termites are are chewing from within these structures that are sustaining. This trajectory are being destroyed. They're buckling from within something else by necessity will emerge from all of us struggling in the wreckage and and what that is that's gonna be a role. The cosmic dice right. It's gonna be wild but we all have to make peace with the fact that we none of us will likely ever feel like that moment is happening. We will all only be stuck in our little tunnel trying to deal with the world as it is right in front of us and hopefully if enough of us are looking right in front of us and not back in our head not in our imagined little. Universe where we're god and then the world is separate if we can act from a more grounded pre-symbolic faith in our fundamental unity. Then we can take this wreckage and build something else out of it and begin that process of trying to build something once again will it be that actual post-scarcity world probably not but it'll be a thing to move towards it will be human life with meaning okay. I went really long today. I hope some of this made sense.
