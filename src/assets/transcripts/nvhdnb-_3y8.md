There we go hello I have exited hosts mode whatever that means hi everybody hey. There's some friendly little Matt smiling without the lights god. I see why people say I'm like save hide but they aren't. There are only a few like heads. You could have you know if they like a white male of a certain age. There's only so many heads you can have because you either get fatter with age or you get cadaverous and that affects whether or not you get a beard and that also affects whether or not your hair falls out. It's like you only get a couple of options and then whether or not your eyes go bad. You know you're a little trapped within structures and so there's only so many variations on the theme. I've only got the one red tracksuit. I look like a mad person. This person's British hello top of the mornin top of the barn India sure I would talk eh Lian's with you and we'll I don't know when you guys are recording. But if you want me on I'll do it now. I don't think I'm friends. I think I've reached a point of acceptance with everything if it goes it'll go because it's a distraction or something not because I need to make some sort of statement besides I like this little quaff thing that happens but the last dying embers of this drama. Tory like Klingon bird-of-prey of hair that's slowly being weathered by the blasts of the USS. Enterprise's photon torpedoes Star Trek reference for you guys.


You haven't sure if he's gonna do it have fun with it but like I said put more of that energy closer to your life don't put too much of it the presidency because it matters a lot less than it used to. Although we have to temper that knowledge with the fact that I've been thinking more about the Democratic Party and its structural integrity is incredibly weak. It is exemplified by Biden I mean in a certain looked at a certain way. Every presidential candidate ends up being like the avatar of the party that it represents depending on how you know who won in the battle to make it up and so like Trump is now the Republican Party. Yes he was as soon as he was nominated and now he's synonymous with it in all of its like electoral strengths and weaknesses and it's like political mind. It's it's it's it's its value system. It's abstraction level. It's all there that Bible is the same way and the proof of that is in the fact that the under the pressure of Bernie's threat to them. They weren't able to coalesce around a a agreed upon alternative that would because they always have the numbers within the Democratic coalition. But what they didn't have was hello Alana well. They did not have was a coherent cultural bloc that could express that preference like in a coordinated fashion like they liked who they liked because they were parts of like distinct demographic slices of the pie and that put them in conflict with other ones. So they were never gonna group around anybody and Biden was the worst of them you know in long-term sense because of how vulnerable he was how alien athma he was to the left how genuinely you know mentally degenerated.

He is and how many skeletons he's got his closet. But the thing is he was. He was the guy that the largest subgroup of Democratic voters had invested in because basically what had happened that the the electorate the Obama coalition shattered right after Obama was a horrible president and then all the component. Parts of the coalition started to like reassemble in different relationships to one another. As the party moved on in the aftermath of the you know the the the first the nervous breakdown of the of the Sanders Clinton battle and then fight and then they just stunning defeat of Hillary that just not everyone off of their Ken and their idea of what the world was and so the result of that shot both thus though the slow term material reality of Obama's recovery being a sham that mostly made people's lives worse if they weren't very wealthy and then the symbolic trauma that once at a moment symbolic trauma of all of it being pierced by Trump becoming president. It shattered the coalition and then it reassembled along certain accesses and the white segments basically who respond to different you know at symbolic level. A different Smollett level than like black voters due to these things because their emotional ties are lighter because like Republicans Democrats is literally life or death for black people because that is how in their lifetimes the parties have played out. It's not as life and death for white people so they can take or leave things which is why when it came down to it and because of this specific fact that you know Obama was the first black president when it came back to like reassemble this coalition to defeat Bernie. A big chunk of that had gone to Bernie and was now being assembled a pieces he already had and new pieces that could have overwhelmed them. They had to get everyone back on board but the only grouping that had not been fatally alienated from the Obama era Democratic Party and needed to be like massage back in were like black voters in the south. Older black voters in the south like the boomers the black boomers basically who had a different emotional connection a different level of adverse emotional the Democratic Party. Then the white electorate did and as a result they had to go to that level and I it's Biden or Bernie and everyone knew that Bernie wasn't an option and so that just displays they had to get think of how many levels of symbolic like moral justification for the Democratic Party as it exists did.

They jettison to pick by they've just incinerated their entire conception of themselves as a party of feminism and of the party of me - of the party of women who've been aggrieved by by men in the workplace and in a marketplace because of course you know what happens at home is not our purview because we've identified all the stuff only along the axis of its relationship to the market. Now they destroy that 40 years of work down the drain I mean - younger black voters who are more aware of Biden's actual record. They've alienated them - Latinos who connect Biden to the Obama era and the massive deportation. At least you know the Latinos who consider those salient issues they alienated from them - like when this this reassembling of the Democrats is going to be smaller and more fragile than any democratic electoral coalition since in terms of fragility.

Maybe like 1980 or something like I don't know 88 like before the final fracture of like the shattering of the solid south. It's an incredibly weak candidate but but the thing is is his candidacy shows that the party at a level of like identification with it as an institution is also incredibly weak and the right pressures could destroy it and so there might be an electoral path among other paths don't everyone shouldn't take it but people in a position to do good in it should take it that could genuinely see the Democratic Party shatter wig style in the relatively near future and and that like the proof of that in like one capsule form is their candidate. A strong party would not have that candidate because we know what degree of control. The Democratic Party has over the process from the DNC rulebook to the way they do the caucuses and elections to their control of a entire news networks line that is a degree of power that should have been enough and was enough to keep people off a Bernie side. But it was not enough to keep anyone signal idea of what the Democratic Party was alive in the minds of enough people of different demographic subgroups to to defeat Bernie. They had to discard all of it drop a bunch of levels of symbolic meaning which means that they have alienated the party like women are a lot of these liberals. I'm telling you people allow these liberals who are pretending to be mad about Ida now are being disingenuous sure because they want to make sure Bernie doesn't get back in there but they're not going to be happy to vote. I mean the ones who cash a check don't care either way but the ones who are like having to go vote. They're not happy about voting for Pike and the thing is.

It's like that process of alienation from the party has happened to everyone. It's just it happens at a different rate depending on your material conditions. If you start as a totally identified with the Democratic Party as like a left party or the party of decency or morality you will over time see that dedication reduced by their actual performance but the friction comes from their failure to perform and your material conditions. If you start off pretty high. You're relatively alienated if you start off low like most Millennials and young people do because they never even got any of this lucre that their parents or grandparents did then. It starts very low and it just gets lower and so that was the two battles. The battle between the demographic battle of the 2016 election was basically between two groups of people who had an instinctive identification as the Democrats. As the good guys the moral party. The one whose policies would lead to something better than the other party in a two-party system which is the one we have but their faith in that it like their faith and it's this institution is legitimate. Their their their emotional investment in turn is an institution.

Here's the Millennials and the younger here's the older and like a plan I'm sure black. One black black older voters is theirs is lower because their material conditions are generally lower. But it's still higher than black anger was so it was negotiating this gap that was always a problem for Bernie because they control those people are because these people they are invested enough in the Democrats that that investment in it goes to extend a good will to all democratic office holders including liars and also goodwill to a good faith to the entire network that Peretz the democratic party line. So this is not. This is already a system in under pressure internally and then also pressure from material conditions. Changing and material conditions are getting even worse. You know the drastic sense which means the pressure of legitimacy is only going to compound so like these liberals the ones who are up here right.


One of the reasons they're up here is because of stuff like the Democrats were the ones who were outraged about sexual assault during the Cavanaugh hearing well. Now they don't get to think of that that's not I mean they can reason about why it's okay. It's different this time Russia Russia Russia but they're just offloading their sense of something's wrong. There's just offloading their anxiety created by that cognitive dissonance. They're offloading it to Russia or Bernie Bros or Fox News or whatever. But it's still there that are not thinking about it consciously. It's there in the form of they're just slowed steady loss of faith and enchantment with the Democratic Party.

So now it's even lower and the pressure is gonna get greater and there's gonna that means that like this is a moment where fractures really a possibility but the problem is something has to fracture it and there isn't anything yet. But I think that this is meant getting me towards the idea that like what workers party might be something worth talking about in the more than just theoretical sense in the actual medium-term reality. Now beyond that I would have to get closer to the shores of like causality to the concept to feel confident right. Now I'm saying I'm thinking a lot like oh. This is just my process of thought and this is led me here. I'm gonna challenge that notion from other directions we'll see. But this is an emerging thesis that's coming out of my conversation with myself basically about the party and about Biden and about Biden's unique frailty and how it reflects a uniquely frail political party because it's not. It's.

It's a conflict isn't it the party's strong enough to drag this guy's corpse over the finish line. But the fact that he's a corpse means that at a deeper level they're weak and this gets to something that was the big the big Twitter owned of the day right that's the big thing that like every day obviously Twitter's a hornet's nest and every day somebody in the morning. She comes along and kicks it and then that starts the whole thing off today is Hornets. Kick was somebody saying that they missed George Bush and wish she was president and then some libs saying oh me too and then people calling you. Can you believe it he killed a million people and then the lips say excuse me but he cared about about rules and he was respectful and he was more competent and once again. This is because they're arguing an absolute position between two things that occupy different contexts. Remember I talked about even among liberals their faith in the Democratic Party has been slowly weakened as its ability to offset the accumulated effects of the neoliberal crisis. Moment keeps going down right well. Here.

It was during the Bush years right and by the way when I say they're their political investment the legitimacy of the Democratic Party. That of course is a in miniature version. A more deeply felt version of their greater faith in the legitimacy of all American political institutions so like if you have faith in political institutions unlike a symbolic level anytime your your guy loses. It causes cognitive dissonance. How can this country have produced this result. It's the country I love. It's doing something I don't agree with. Now you can say Russia and you can say like like the Trump voters or the McCain voters do. Republicans voter fraud but and you can think you mean that but that anxiety is still there and it has to go somewhere that anxiety about the state and it goes into hostility to the institution's. It goes into the hostility towards the institution's so they have so like as this is going down on their their faith of the Democratic Party. It's also going down on their faith in the entire institution of the American government so ignite that 2020 2020. The tooth election does a big big bit of damage to their cuz. Like first you have less legitimacy government cuz. You don't think Bush was elected legitimately and then you have less faith even if you won't admit it. You have less faith in the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party let it happen and then they also went along with the Iraq war which most people I think even liberals who said they were for. It had misgivings about so the numbers going down for group for both. These things Bush being in office he's stressful.


It's awful in the moment. He's the worst person in the universe. But here's the thing you're at this level of you know you're a liberal with this level of faith in America's institutions right up here. Now Trump's president your fate your faith level. Your your mana points in these institutions is way the  down here. So when you wish for Bush what you're really wishing for is to be in a moment in time when you had more faith that America's government was gonna do what it promised to do from turn make sure the lights go on to make sure you don't get dirty bombed to making sure if you're a liberal that homeless people have homes if you're a conservative that homeless people have cages whatever it is whatever your conception of the good is you have faith.

The government will carry it out and that goes down as the bad  happens and then it goes up in institutions that respond well to it or that you perceive is responding well to it. That's why the democratic party went from being kind of the party of crooks and like the the Democratic Party in the twenty is like the party of Ku Klux Klan members and like Irish ward healing criminals. Those are the only that was it was all a handout. There was no ideology behind it. The Great Depression made the Democratic Party synonymous with morality for a large chunk of people and then it went down over time as material conditions degraded because we never solved the capital as a problem that was making things bad. We only ameliorated it in the short term so that process is going down. Now they want more they want to go back to their their Bush era faith in these institutions. But if Bush was here because he'd be ruling in the same way he ruled badly then with the same interests in mind. He would rule as badly now as Trump. It wouldn't be as publicly disagreeing because now you're in a situation where because you have given up on you the democratic party or the government making justice happen in the world.

You've made it demand that it has it on the symbolic level and the symbolic level is a president who acts like a president having a president who is a debauched monster and insulting people especially during a crisis. That is uh you're you're reducing my institutional faith. Because that's not what a leader does in my mind now for conservatives. It's not entirely flipped. They have the same situation and that even though they're doing well they're not doing as well as they used to and they know it. Their neighbors aren't doing as well as they used to and their children are not doing as well as they expected them to and so that as that creates anxiety. But they like the Republicans much more the Democrats and like the Democrats they offload most of their anger on to the other party to excuse why this institution allowed this to happen but they're still sublimating a lot of anxiety and anger but because liberals are coming from an era where America's institutions were more liberal were considered more liberal like more aaron sorkin ii JFK style. Those cultural totems that liberals love because they give institutional legitimacy conservatives hate because they think that because they think that all that being politically correct business being like you're supposed to be is reified liberalism.

So when Bush is noxious and awful and insulting and unbecoming of the office they love it and it increases their faith in the Republican Party and in American institutions even as their conditions are getting worse and worse even as they're being locked in their homes for months at a time because of a botched response to a quarantine. But that's okay because they've offloaded all their anxiety about that on to their governor and the Chinese. But they still know deep down that there's a disk consonance between the world. They live in and what they what they think they want. How can Trump be president and this be happening and they need to put that they need to take that excess feeling that doubt. They need to turn that emotion of doubt into love and they turn that emotion to doubt into love into Donald Trump as a person and what he does liberals. They turn that doubt about the fact that they live in a country that has X values in their heart. But this Y is what's happening into hatred for his antics and awfulness because then they're able to direct it at that level of abstraction away from the level where they have not resolved the contradiction between what they think of their country and what your country does and so it's two groups of people who have unresolved who have not resolved if not confronted the basic cognitive dissonance of living in a country with certain institutions that they believe in that is not giving them. The results that those in that belief should be doing and then they deal with that anxiety by turning it into an expressed either love or hate for some scapegoat and so that is a real fight binary and there is no way to participate in and that will be productive.

You have it has to be interrupted. The process has to be interrupted orthogonal e or diagonally or acutely whatever you cannot keep building that anti dialectical parallel barrier you can't do it. You can't do it anything about Trump. Anything you do that's about Trump's appearance about what he says what he does that is about his personality reifies. It reifies it in either direction whether you're a chi khat going trump's owning. The libs or the lib going look at this awful post there's and there's no way to do anything even joke about be ironic about it that doesn't read it so as much as we love making fun of Trump because he is objectively a hilarious figure if you're trying to like I mean obviously. This doesn't apply when you're blowing off steam among friends but if you're trying to engage constructively in a dialogue on that level. The level of Trump will only reify this phantom spectacle where secretly disordered and questioning liberals and conservatives express their unresolved conflict.

So that's a thing don't talk about that I've decided the clapping is okay. Now. I'm not mad about the clapping anymore. I understand that it is like basically celebrating that the lights are still on I certainly understand that it's an attempt to offload anxiety about being useless. During this. Like this is a physical act you can do to stand in symbolically for what you're not doing which is you know working in a grocery store or being nurse or something. But you accept it on that level. Maybe it becomes a basis for something else if you're if you don't come at it angry if you don't come at it. Judgmentally doesn't necessarily but either way it's gonna be fine and you can deal with the results. Whether that clap or not it's how I respond to the condition of their being clapping.


But man there is some part of me that thinks that the Democratic Party is uniquely stressed and uniquely fragile the symbols. The symbolic order that under rides like investment in the Democrats is completely under stress in a way. I don't think I've ever seen it and oh man Jesse. Ventura's just seems like such a perfect synthesis of Trump and Bernie the head in the heart the understanding of like the spectacular level and value of politics and then the actual moral code to drive it. If it's turned into Bernie's moral code of course oh so frustrating to think that's a possibility and probably what happened but like I said it happens in some version of the world and that version of the world rules somebody asked was born apart good or bad for Europe relative to other likely outcomes of the revolution. No historical ah no historical trend is good or bad historical incident or trend either advances progress. In some it no I'm sorry all historical events advance historical progress because even if it's just a period of pure like flat non development you know like where you have a sort of a civilizational plateau or collapse.

That's still a that's still a that is still a that's still progress in that it is part of the process of using up the matter in the closed system. That is the world economy. So it's still progress like you're you're emptying the jug over it. So even if it's not getting can't caught in like a cup you know holder it's not getting caught and somewhere else to be directed into a use. It's just flowing out. You're still reducing the amount of water in the jug even if it's not getting caught. So I guess the question is when you look at you trying to judge a political or judge a historical incident that word has two connotations morale and the peer achill. I judge it based on its dimensions and size and qualities or base it on its morality and when you're talking about what anyone else does in the here-and-now in the future or in the past or not in the future. But in the year now and in the past then they everything is fully fixed and there's no room for a moral judgement. So when you're talking you ought to historic listen. She's talking about Bonaparte taking over control in Paris in France and you're saying as it could have bad well.

It was a little bit good like all of us you mean did it help get the jug of water you know the amount of the amount of mass in history in history into the other jug of like a a civilization that is self sustainable because of his. It is cooperatively utilized resources to create a technological infrastructure that's sophisticated enough to create like a steady state of energy inputs which is possible but requires a degree of technological advancement that can only be achieved through collaboration as a species so history is the process of that jug. The jug that starts off is just the matter of the earth thirteen million billion years ago and this other jug which is gonna be much much smaller where the where where the fully automated luxury space communism is where the end state of communism is. However you imagine that Kim Stanley Robinson's colony books whatever and you're pouring history is pouring the one chug into the other and what what what the active mind what with the activated like moral political soul does and then what the activated political class nation and people until the entirety of humanity does is try to direct the one receptacle into the other as it changes shape without getting as little of them without well catching as much as possible to keep the system as efficient as possible because whatever you can't get from energy you'd have to get from human power which means at some level suffering and exploitation which have to be equally shared to be to share like the brain power equally of everyone who can contribute so. Let's take nepoleon that all sounds like a that's all sounds like a begging. The question right. But no I just use that to address the question of was Napoleon good for Europe compared to other outcomes of the Revolution.

What that means is was Napoleon positive what was Napoleon. How much water did Napoleon get help keeping the jug compared to something else happening and we can say definitively that he is absolutely more progressive than most of the likely outcomes that would have happened if he hadn't intervened because you had in the directory and absolutely unviable and unstable government. That's ability to can to govern was entirely dependent on its ability to exact tribute in its new Imperial state which by the way it wouldn't even have been able to do without Napoleon Bonaparte singular military genius in the first place to help almost sink to single-handedly win. The first. The were the first coalition almost which gave them a huge amount of foreign currency and and capital to just take back to France so that was doomed their inputs were going down and they had no popular legitimacy because they were the they were the acknowledged cynical minority.

They were the cynical remnant of the people from the earlier battles that were originally ideological and stayed at the level of you know pure political science and then and virtue like the Shah. The jacobins and Girondins and whatnot and slowly over time resolved whittled down to this group around the guy. The engine of the motive of the revolution were all of the actual like morale in the moral sense of the sense of moral urgency entirely concentrated in a smaller and smaller group of people until it was basically just the community of the Committee of Public Safety. Everybody else was either being executed or being alienated from the project and when you're alienated from a project at a moral level you'd have to find a material justification. So the only people left after they killed Robespierre. With the Thermidor interaction were the ones who had accommodated themselves to the regime through basically being crooked being corrupt. The main reason they overthrew Robespierre is because they all thought they were gonna be the next worst person get guillotine for profiteering which they were all doing. Everybody who had any principles either lost to the jacobins and got their heads cut off or were the jacobins and then got their heads cut off. The only ones left because everyone was morality everyone who is driven by morality by the French Revolution. As it got bloodier. They had to keep making choices as to whether it was worth supporting and if you thought no it's worth supporting but it's going in the wrong direction. Then you had to oppose Robespierre that meant death if you think now.

It's worth supporting. But I'm gonna give up these principles. It's because you're getting other justification in the form of kickback. Some people were getting some combination of both like Danton was both morally opposed to the course of the revolution and getting his beak wet but I would say with Danton. He was more morally opposed because he if he had been more corrupt. He would have stayed in the back and just made money like the rest of those creeps who then killed Robespierre. So the directory is just this rump of disgusting self seekers with no morality. At all all the morality had been squeezed out of the revolution by the process of the terror. All you had were the office seekers in the crook which is by the way the same thing to happen in Stalinist Russia. The exact same promise process happened you either got turned away from the regime by what it was doing and exiled or executed or you accommodated yourself and became crooked and lost morality. It happens in every system like that it happens in every system where government's ability to extract surplus value is challenged by some sort of input disruption and it to the degree that it puts it that it agreed. A response to that crisis with authoritarian control of people is the degree to which you will alienate people from believing in it unless they are being material rewarded if they're the ones getting the bread. Then they believe in the regime more if they're having the bread taken from them they believe in it less and eventually they'll believe in it so little.


There you're gonna have to do something about it so what this meant was that the directory was doomed. The only people left were of the revolutionary generation totally useless guys like Paul bara bara was like the Ark. He was the ark. He was the one man embodiment of the thermidorian reaction and the directory because he was a man of no principle. He was an absolutely empty Bell who was able to survive the whole horror of the of those terror by staying hidden. Abby's is a guy who was too much of an incompetent oaf to be Vaughn to be even much enough of a enough of a like threat to power to even bother killing during the fight there.

During the reign of terror Cius got to sit the whole thing out because at that point he was so irrelevant to the process that even frickin Rob's Peter couldn't even remember - Kenneth cut his head off those were the people that was the triumvirate that Napoleon joint Napoleon. Not part of that generation young vigorous part of that group of young of ambitious minor Nobles for peripheral areas whose ability to engage with the world and their talents was blown up by the French Revolution. Now if they were no longer constrained by like a class system that would have made it harder for them to have their talents be expressed. Now oh my god they get - uh now guys like Napoleon gets you unleashed a full flower of their talents so they love the revolution from the outside because it's given in this and that means that they approach the question of continuing it with energy and vigor. Whereas the guys like Barack and as I say yes are are empty our.

Gutter doubt in fact you could argue that those three people literally the triumph roots themselves provide a miniaturized model for the synthesis that Napoleon's government takes takes planes. Government carries out so CS was one of the guys who got the revolution started in the first place by his pamphlet about the Third Estate. You know what is the Third Estate nothing what does it ask for everything that was the tree - core of the revolution but because of his particular blend of personality traits he lost influence very quickly he couldn't get in on it. Marat could get in on it get in on the ground floor but by the end of the process of revolution and recount a revolution and resolving towards synthesis and blood and justice the exhaustion. You had these two guys who had helped bring the revolution about and then helped send it in the direction. It went into at crucial moments both of whom are now for separate reasons completely extinguished a bias. I asked the guy who was the who had who is one of the founders of the revolution and that he gave it ideas.

He turned. It's it's in Kohei yearnings into a vocabulary people could understand like the spirit. The Geist of the revolution extinguished that he got bara not an intellectual not a guy who thought up these ideas but a guy who caught up in the wood in the spring of history grab. Some of them to use them to make action to become part of it and in the process is grounding this into into moral powder by the need to stay alive by his attachment to the material world. But he is also exhausted his abilities and his credibility more importantly and who comes now a man forged by both of them a man who only arose out of a revolution that they had made who understands it at a level. They never could because he approached it at a different point in his life and used it to different ends. He comes in.

It could really have been no other way nor should it have been and then you had another. Now it could have been that was like destined to happen. But the thing about history is things are destined to happen until something intervenes which is what history is. It is everything that happened in history. You can look at retrospectively and see a direct line of causation and argue that it could not have happened any other way. But the thing is there are thwarted versions of that littering history. There are mirrored realities that happen because some specific thing went the other way and one of them is saint napoleon dies at the at the at the pedal of toulouse gets the heat that that that bayonet that windows crotch goes a little harder.

Closer cuts is from oral artery bleeds out then the forces that breathe directory to bear certainly don't change the directory is probably less in doors less because Napoleon isn't there to win the first Italian war or the first. The first can tell you campaign in the War of the first coalition but even if it is it will probably be attempt before it collapses from below. There will be some attempt at the top levels of power to redirect it to their ends and whoever they called up whoever they decide to pull off the bench to be. The next guy would probably have been inferior to Napoleon would have had less resources to draw from and therefore would have been less successful militarily which means that maybe the revolution ends with the restoration a decade earlier that would have been bad in the sense that would have been inefficient because you have this engine of history making in this form of the Grand Army and the Napoleon behind it history and force back leading an army of history with guns and they marched through Europe and they swept funeral remnants aside the white. The blue coats of the French army in the early early 18th century France or an early empty century Europe were identical in their function to the blue coats of the Union Army marching into the South in the 1860s. It's signaled liberation liberation for peasants liberation for Jews and degrees of liberation for everyone from townsman to gild to to labourers to everybody and less power for lords and in hereditary rulers even with all the deaths that came from that. It's hard to imagine that death wouldn't have come in a reverse in some bloody counter-revolutionary series of battles between the the powers of Europe that were gonna try to carve up Frances corpse if it had failed. So either way you have thousands dead in in wars that engulf the continent one of them leaves models of Liberal governance and liberal relationships between subjects that could be built on through capitalism and then through communism.


All of them interdicting with each other that process is gonna happen if Napoleon isn't there but it'll happen more slowly more water is gonna fall out during the exchange so yes 51 it. Using the the everything is yes everything else yes or no question. But it's only yes or no to a percentage of a degree. That's the way that that's the way to stop being frozen by questions because nobody wants to say yes or no they want to justify it and the fact is that's true of every SNL question and you can make the call if you're just able to say yes because it's 51% one at least and 49% of the other that's the degree of specificity you need and then that allows you to make the statement and if somebody disagrees with you you can challenge the premise and if it turns out they're right guess what that was part of the 49% that you missed now your understanding of the principle that you were even arguing about is increased. I hope this is making sense now see that he says that Bavarian ancestors didn't take too kindly to the frogs marching across the islands. No they didn't forget. What happened is that the nationalism the liberalism inculcated in Napoleonic France was mirrored in every state that they beat because everyone had the thought of why couldn't we win.

Why did this regime beat ours and the question and the answer to that question is always. It was superior to the task you animal ask why anybody beat anybody in the war over the long term. It's because their particular arrangement of resources and skills was superior to the task and so the Germans and the Italians asked themselves among others. Hungarians the Czechs everywhere that army marched ask themselves. Why did they win and the answer is because they had they were more prepared for the times and so then they say well. What was the thing and the first like seeing it just as an army marching as an as an enemy is nationalism. It's a nation they've got a flag. They fly under it and they'll die for it. We don't have that I live in the  prince-bishopric of baden-baden you know. The Holy Roman Emperor is some syphilitic weirdo in Vienna. The only power I see is like my local syphilis riddled like barrister asking for a kickback to smuggle some cork into the harbor or whatever the. But if we hadn't flag to fight die under like the French do we could beat them and voila within a couple generations of Napoleon or within a generation of Napoleon's defeat you have fully blown nationalist movements all throughout Europe that within another generat with another generation unify polities that had gone on unified for millennia napoleon who single-handedly ended the thous 2,000 combined year-long reign of the holy roman emperor the Knights of st. John in Malta and the  doshas of the Republic of Venice that's right the serene Republic itself that is that is sweeping the deck and allowing for new growth that will be more productive. Even. If it's just as horrible because its history and all history is horrible as his defeat or non-existence because of happenstance would have been Napoleon wasn't.

Even their first choice you know the triumphs the guy they wanted was too high-minded. He wouldn't do it. He believed too much in the revolution because his ambition was not as overweening as Napoleon's was because his talent wasn't as high as Napoleon's was they both believed in the revolution. The reason I believe was harsh points that sees that question says no is because he still believes in the revolution to a higher degree that Napoleon does why because his talent level is lower simple as that because he could see less value to himself in not. He sees less value in him to himself in changing the situation. Napoleon's knowledge of his own talents was such that he was able to say yeah revolution good thing but I mean come on look at all. The blood death come on and also I know what I'm doing boom. That's why it was in. Now there's you go the guy they wanted that said no if he'd said yes if that guy had said yes they probably would have done worse because he wasn't as good as Napoleon would have come in conflict with Napoleon and then like either napoleon winning that conflict or losing it sets back the cause. You know the cause of progress and France either way. So it's not good but that guy had less talent than Napoleon. He was less focused on the task of military power which was the most important task at hand in France that moment because it was fighting for its survival and he wasn't as good and so you say but the thing is and here's the here's the fundamental paradox and this one might be a little crazy. You might not buy it tell me if it doesn't make sense. If he had said yes he would have done better because he would have been more talented so that is how you have a situation where that the historical question is totally up to one guy's mind. But the forces of history of elided so that it could not have gone any other way that is how you get radical subjectivity and radical freewill at the level of Geist and you have total clockwork determinism at the level of matter and space and observing reality around you and people around you. I'd like to go back on on his show now thinking about Napoleon. I mean the guy you know think about him with the Roman Empire I was just trying to get to him. Warners says the American Civil War army would crush the French and German armies oppression armies of austria-hungary yeah of course they would because they fought the  axe against then someone the one of the largest conflagrations in the Western world.

At that point. I mean it's very funny that the Taiping rebellion is happening in the Qing China at that time and killing 30 million people and very few of us even know about it. But in the West you don't get a bigger play pen for developing lethal skills. If the Grand Army of republic in 1865 had needed to and been able to summon the popular support to march like get in boats and march on Calais it would have been hard to Saba. I mean they would have kicked in the rotten door of of decadent Second Empire France. That's why one of the more intriguing counterfactuals in history once again.

Not something that could have happened in our world but with a few things go differently could have happened in a world like ours and what if I think led to progress faster we would be in temporal time right. Now 2020 we would be farther along progressively is if Napoleon instead of not recognizing Tucson Levitt or as the actual power the actual authority in Haiti if he'd recognize the reality of that instead of trying to put toothpaste back in the tube in a way that a man of history like himself should not have tried to do because if Napoleon was a little less egotistical he could have directed some of his brilliant insight to the fact that Toussaint Leavitt or was him. Joe Salvatore was the Napoleon of Haiti in that he was presiding over the same situation and demonstrating the same brilliance and carrying the same popular legitimacy because of that brilliance and so that means there's no way to overturn that coke bottle the Coke machine especially with the intervening reality. Yellow fever that was never. Gonna work if he'd recognize that reality and he couldn't partially because wife Josephine was from a family of planters on Santa Mon who wanted their plantations back and then like the racism that emanated from those economic relationships if he'd been able to recognize Tucson for who he was. He would have made him a  put guns in the hands of every man who wanted to in Haiti and he would have put him in boats and he would have sent him to French Camp French Louisiana and it would have marched him through the deep south. A military with that combination of motivation and leadership and basically never been seen in the American context since the European invasion like you literally could have had a like a a Franco F afro Frank Franco African like Caribbean hegemony.

There I mean obviously things have to fall right a million ways for that to happen but that is something that the Givens layout of materials situated. The material reality could have allowed that to happen so that's when we say. If a counterfactual like that will that's why cut people say counterfactual is history is tricky but it really isn't if you just remember one thing when you're doing it you're not asking could. This have happened to this world. You're asking could this array of things if everything had frozen like everybody's where they are Toussaint's in France. Artists onsen Haiti Napoleon's and France hit a stopwatch and you could basically incept into Napoleon. The idea hey give give Tucson some  GATS and then that's history start again would it have worked the answer. Is it could have you could pursue it anyway. Other things could have intervened and stopped it. A real. A bad counterfactual is one where there is no way that even if you did change people's individual minds basically the number of people's minds you would have to change for it to win would have to get bigger and bigger like that's. The degree to what you're counterfactual is valid one guy if something is possible if one guy's mind is changed or one woman's mind has changed then that is a very narrow hinge point on history if it requires like an entire civilization to have a different point of view on like a different value system related to the world around them and that's not a realistic or or for them to have you know a step where they actually have jungle that's not a real car factual. So basically counterfactual history is it's a fewest a number of people you would have to in cept if you had like a space-time freezing machine to make it happen because of course. Part of dialectical reasoning is understanding that when you say could this have happened you were implying and in fact insisting that somewhere at some time it did and will so that thing I just said that happened there is a history where that happened and then there are histories branching off of that where it succeeded or failed to different degrees.


I am reading cycles new book in fact titles new book. I've been the kind of like I mean. Now I think I'll be you get to a point where I can read better right. Now. I'm a little too distracted to read anything really for that long. I'm trying to get Moby Dick. So I can kind of like hit. The you know get some traction. But uh I was reading Nigel's book before this and I gotta say man I honestly think that if I had had that experience that preceded this whole like reorientation without being in the middle of that book I might not have had the moment I had because shadows theory of like of environmental determinism which is what it is no historian wants to be a determinist because then you discount free will. But of course we know that all historians are determinists if they understand their task under story who understands his task is they determinist if you don't it's because you're allowing a subjective realm to enter into your conception of history. Your biased so we know that all historians are historical. Whole history is deterministic and which title says is that the determining thing is because like the biggest broadest argument in in history is is something determined by environment or by the culture within the environment and of course. It's both it's the cycle. It's the its base superstructure. It's the it's the biomechanical fusion. It's the Dynamo of all life but one starts it one starts. The process. One material space confluence starts the process and Cheryl argues incredibly persuasively and escape from Roman. I'm only about halfway done with it that it's  environment like he basically posits that the reason that the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe is because of inner party competition between small skate States in the post Roman context and then you say well why did that happen and the answer is extracted. All the way down you could build a million levels of meaning on top of it but extracted to the bottom. It's that Europe was too far from the step to be constantly threatened by by nomadic warriors. The presence the closest Ament to two nomadic warriors makes a society more cohesive over a larger bond because it feels more threat.

So that's why huge empires like the the empires that have ruled China throughout 2,000 years of history in an area. That's like three times the size of Europe even under air even in their conditions of much lower technology than we would then then exist. Now. It's because there were always either though some variety of Mongol or a model of no man either Mongols or the Manchu. Later who would Harry you until you lost power and then they would take over until they lost power and then he kicked him out and and you would the cycles of decay would happen but they were all being. All of these dialects are being fired by the presence of steppe nomads no steppe nomads in Europe. The closest thing to a step is the Hungarian the Magyar plane or whatever where until the hundred foot hung around. But it's just not enough land to sustain the number of horses you would have to to wage that kind of war and be that kind of society and so that left Europe to become this petri dish of little microstates growing and shrinking in competition with each other and that led to a flowering of the need to compete technologically with one another. A stable Imperial model doesn't like technological innovation that it can't control and it can't control it if it's gonna do everything it could do. It has to be in the hands of as many people as possible to find as many uses for it. Meanwhile the Chinese emperors were banning ships with too many smashed because they might go too far and upset the balance of power in China.

Anyway that's his book and that to me is a greatly important observation that is like the base because like ideas are useful to the degree that you can explain that or ideas are useful and true to varying degrees and one axis of of truth is to which degree you can explain it. That's the degree to which you believe in it and that's either ineffable like people who are ecstatic religious believers. They're having nonverbal experiences and then there are people who reason their way to religion through written word. They're both getting there in the same. In the same way others are getting the same way in the same direction. Was I think oh that's so like you've got the dialect right and dialectical materialism is great but what set the conditions that's another recursion and I didn't really know. I hadn't done enough of the reading having read SH Nidal and seeing how persuasive this and getting it is like he'd the way he lays up level. He reasons dialectically is one of the reasons that book is so successful at convincing me because he starts at every level with like not saying that any ideas are in conflict with one another that they're true to greater less degrees and since that's the way he reasons through the book. He never leaves you hanging you're always with him. You're believing every level of the argument which means that I now have that it's like an intact base now and then I can put the dialectical historical materialism on that environmental base and the thing is is that the suggestion goes both ways of course a historically determined a series of events. It's gonna come from a base of literal matter of the actual environment where else is it going to come from it's the prime mover and and that really like help that's set another level of like symbolic meaning and understanding so that when I had my experience I didn't have to build that it was already there and that reminds me. This is something I thought of today. It's like an analogy about the difference between dialectical reasoning and the way that we are taught to think about things in schools and the way we teach each other to refer to each other over all interactions. Personal ideological political religious social you're doing out your film think of every conversation think of every conversation you remember every every conversation. You have is basically a translation between two people right you're translating some sentiment between one person to another and you're using symbols to do it. Simple sentiments require simple symbols how you do it fine like a guy acknowledge you. That's that's this many symbols as needs. But if you get more specific it requires more detailed translation and that can either be specific like description of something if you're talking about like helping somebody change a tire or fix a fixer radiator but it can become very complicated but it becomes complicated along an axis of like symbolic abstraction when you're talking about ideas so think of discussing trying to argue somebody like you have one question one you have one view on a question.

An issue somebody else has what seems to be a direct ly conflicting issue. Now you're gonna translate across that gap. My attempt make communicate to you is basically handing you a crossword puzzle that I made and the complexity of the crossword. Puzzle correlates to the complexity of the thought. I'm trying to get across to you and I'm the one who builds a thing so. I'm doing my best to make these questions gettable the way that they connect I'm not trying to be hard. That's bad faith. I'm trying to be legible. But if it takes a lot of spaces I'm gonna have to think of a lot of clues and I gotta try my best to make the clue easy as possible because I want you I should want you to get it if I don't want you to get it. That's bad faith interaction that's trying to make it harder. So you have to assume good faith for all this to work that's the first thing you have to do so you get the crossword puzzle for me. Now you try to your. Brain is now trying at like an instantaneous level. It's trying to work out. This crossword. Puzzle now say you're making it down the crossword puzzle and you got two spaces left that you can't figure out and you just look at them and you can't you start. Getting mad you start getting annoyed you start getting bored because this interaction no longer is revealing anything to you. You're no longer you're not understanding or explaining anything anymore you're just staring at two meaningless crossed circuit spaces. You have lost this all spirit that are purely interacting with mere matter. You have disenchanted the exchange. Now you can dispel that by reapplying yourself to the question now the first thought you know there's two ways to do that the way that we are taught is erase every answer on the board you didn't get the last two. So none of this is right start over and now you're starting over with a self-doubt so that even though these are all the same they were right the first time you have to say some are wrong. You end up writing some that are wrong even though you kind of suspect. They're they're wrong because what has to be different somewhere because it got me to the wrong thing and that means you're making your compounding mistakes over here and you're not even getting any Clark close to the thing that you did you were so closer in. Dialectical reasoning says once you reached that point a break where you can't get meaning like semantics and spiritual from this thing. Then you have to step back as close as possible. You've got all this right. What is the nearest thing that could be wrong. If you do that you're gonna get the question answered. You're gonna solve the puzzle much quicker that means you're gonna be less emotionally invested in it because you're gonna be feeling less bored and less anxious less annoyed less patronize to whatever whatever bundle of interactions you brought to the bundle of emotions. You brought to the interaction because of who you think you're talking to and that means that at every level of bad faith compounds the mistake in translation that initiated the disagreement okay I've been going for a while whatever we of that which we cannot speak. We must pass over in silence.

It's true and I think the reason people just sort of take that phrase for granted sometimes is because they think that just means well duh. I mean if I just don't say when I know things then. I'm gonna be dumb. So I bet I can never say anything. No it means both. You don't have to speak of things that you don't know. But it also means you don't have to speak of things that you do already know that you can whittle down your interactions to the most salient points and then grind those and that increases clarity increases. Your ability to interact with other people increases. The collective increase meant increase in our knowledge of each other and the world around us that we get from interacting all right so how's that does that make any sense once again. I don't really know ya know we can sign is right about that definitions are useful but not in motion and thought is in motion. The definitions are useful in a fixed state and you need them for that go pick up that hammer but when you're moving them around in your head. You should abolish them as to the greatest degree. You can that's a little tip alright okay. Someone says it's more grounded good. I think that I'm finding a way to talk about this stuff with specific examples which is the way people are gonna understand it. It's like kind of I blew up the top of my head and I'm just slowly over the course of this week trying to catch things in a bucket. Basically. It's just as it's all of these and that's another thing you have to understand is that all these processes are direct and exact mirrored copies of one another.

There is no remainders there are no remainders in the universe. Everything is part of an equation that is resolved completely. There is the remainder of the negations but those then get negated and then when that then when that final bit is resolved you have total oneness between space and time. Ie the end of the world. The end of the universe the end of your life and also the beginning alright guys bye bye. See you tomorrow.
