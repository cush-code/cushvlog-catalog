Do hello. I'm just laying down some fire tracks. I'm plugging in the phone to the laptop because I've heard that that makes the sound better especially on the youtube. So hopefully it does. Fingers crossed. I'm gonna do this from now on and if that works I'll be happy folks. I'm sorry facing we love to do. It. Don't we we love it.

I want to kiss you guys. I want to do this my face. But I kiss you all the boys the guys and the girls. Many many people told me that at that rally he just was doing my impression of him and god damn it. He they're right so many people have said that I do a bad impression of trump and I'm telling you. I do trump at his most concentrated and condensed which means once in a while. He's gonna like hit the top of the the meter. You know he's gonna. He's gonna um what's the term in in acoustics. When you blow out. He's gonna blow up the top of the of the of the key and then he's going to sound like me then he's going to go. I want to kiss the guys I'm going to cause him. I want to get on the big kiss because I'm immortal folks. I drank the mercury. I did it. I followed the golden path to the mercury concoction and now. I'm the immortal emperor folks. We love to see it. I've got an emperor and I've got an army. I've got a beautiful terracotta arby and guess what folks they're going to rule the world on my behalf because I'm the emperor the immortal one and I've got immortal terracotta warriors and guess what guys I'm gonna live forever yeah.

He literally thinks he's immune now even though we're not even sure that there's any long-term immunity provided by infection because we've already got because I know a number of months ago. There were a spate of reinfection cases in south caroli south korea that eventually turned out to be just failures to have like accurate testing essentially. Like they were. They tested it wasn't like it was a it was too false. It was like a positive and a false positive or something like that but um in this case it looks like we've got at least two confirmed recon re infections including one of a woman who died. I mean she was very old but still it's folks. It's not great that's not great. I do have the tightest in the five boroughs so instead of accepting that reality. He is instead concocted to reality where he is immortal now and immune and his blood could probably be synthesized and if we could make a truck people say how do you get the trump people to make it to take a trump vaccine or any vaccine. Just say that you made it with trump's blood. If trump says that his blood is going into a vaccine.

Everyone would take it and you know what it would probably give us what it would do is even if it was total placebo. It would essentially refr orient our way our understanding of disease and reality to such an extent that we would actually cure covid. But what by essentially redefining covet out of existence like over time like we would still have the deaths and we would solve the sicknesses but we would just break up the apparatus for even recognizing it which was always the basis for trump's covenant policy. Stop don't test don't test because you get tests you get positive results. So you don't want that and you could make that a reality by simply defining the the disease out of existence and if you say well that's going to lead to things like you know lots of people going to the hospital maybe the capacity won't be. There well. One thing is you do is you build. You you direct resources to building capacity to deal with these increased deaths but the increased deaths lose the urgency of corona they urge. They lose the the patina of exception and they re-establish a normal baseline where now we have x number more deaths a year from this infectious disease. But it is not coronavirus and that means everyone's back to work and everybody's back maskless and there's no social distancing and everybody just lives their lives with a slightly higher risk of dying or getting a long-term neurological disorder or long-term lung damage. It just becomes a new normal. The way cancer rates going up over the years is something. People accept hey you're getting older. The price of that is you might get cancer. You know you got older. The price of that is you might get this thing or whatever we're calling it and honestly.

[05:24](https://youtu.be/ptS9x5O-Ajg?t=05m24s)

That's the most realistic thing we could do. If we wanted to be pure realist about this moment like we're going to strip everything of morality. We're going to strip it even to like recognize even even evaluating from a political perspective. Like let's say. We're not even going to try to wring any political juice out of the failure of covet and say oh look you. Know covet is covert is capitalism's fault We don't want to let capitalism off the hook but if we recognize that there's nothing elucidating about this moment and that the covet moment has no revolutionary potential. We could just say okay fine.

We'll do this because then at least you could get back to like a functioning system and restart the economy in a meaningful way and deal with like because otherwise. This is an intractable problem having a system set up that has no capacity to do the things like live scale wide scale test and tracing capability and lockdown capability. Most importantly the kind of things that would be facilitated by a I don't know massive suspension of rent massive suspension of mortgage payments complete suspension of all debt collection of any kind. Mass infusion of direct cash payments to people to obviate the need to engage in the service economy and go outside of the home and allow for large-scale lockdowns. Around areas of infection that were tested rigorously that would be wonderful who's going to do that you think joe biden's going to do that you're talking about the realistic solution. To this. It's just redefining it out of existence and adding it to the perils of life. The way that we went from zero people getting killed every year in car accidents to 50 000 getting killed every year in car accidents that is a 500 that's a 50 000 increase I believe and not and it's not a thing that we think of as a crisis. It's a thing we manage and it'll be another thing we manage and of course that will disproportionately fall on the poorest. Among us. We will least access the health care least able to take off from work at least able to even be aware of this threat. At least basically people who are forced by the market to risk their lives more than they previously were yeah that's awful. The only thing that's going to prevent that from happening is an intervening political movement. Some sort of political organization that interrupts this process that puts the broomstick into the spokes of the machine that's the only thing that's going to stop us from sliding towards that outcome and of course maybe we get a vaccine. Maybe we get a vaccine and then everybody can just act like you know what guess what and here's the thing trump wins say. Let's say hilariously trump wins which not outside of the realm of possibility at all. I'm not gonna say in any way joe biden has this thing rocked up.

I think he'll probably win but my god. I'd certainly have more. I would be less much much less surprised. I'll admit I'll be way less surprised if trump wins than I was that he won the first time that was genuinely shocking. I'll admit. I was out to lunch like that on that one with a bunch more coastal elites. We weren't enough close enough to the ground and if you want to ever own me by saying you didn't see trump coming even though you could listen to us talking about that. He is the one of he's the man for this moment he's going to win this thing. He's the one who makes sense in this context everything about like if politics is a game show. If politics is a spectacle. Then he should win but no it's not that much of a spectacle yet there's still a grounding.

There's still a reality. There are still fence posts and now and then we found out nope no no no that firmament you thought there was totally rotted away. So. I call it fully admit that that it could happen again and I'll be way way. Less surprised if it does but man if trump wins and then like halfway through his term. After you know he like loses in big in this house and send it again and gets impeached again and get and ignores it again. Then we get a vaccine and then he like leaves office. He's like this decrepit ball. Like this. Somehow this like dehydrated but also wet sack of like ron popeil rotisserie meat bright orange just sliding allegiance out of the frets in the white house just go. I said it would go away magically. I said one day it would be gone and look. It is. It's gone look. It's gone now. I said it. I said it you heard me say it over and over again then. Eventually one day like magic you'd be gone and now it's gone because for trump. It is only the moment it is in past. Does not exist only as a vague memory that you have shaped into a into a who is barely aware of what's going on around you man. They see that apparently eli lilly was doing trials oh no johnson and johnson which I was surprised by.

I thought they made like soap and. I guess they're also a pharmaceutical company. They were doing a trial vaccine and they had to stop the trial because of an unexplained illness or an unexpected illness. Either way. You don't want to hear that word before illness and I just thought I am legend will smith. They create this vaccine that's going to immunize you from cancer and then cut six months later half the populations are these horrible cgi zombies vampires running around and of course. There's the question that I don't think anyone has ever answered to my satisfaction but I haven't asked that much element what about this possibility that kova just keeps evolving. It becomes like the flu where every year there's a new strain. There's a covent 20. There's a covenant 21. There's a boney 12 and two with all different lethalities that are like pegged around covet lethality and require a new vaccine before you've even created one for the original covet.

No. I'm sure that happens all the time but it was just the word unexpected illness that made me think oh god. We've created a new mutant that's going to take over. It's captain trips seasons don't fear the reaper the wind or the summer rain. It's so funny that they're doing the stand right before this hit and now they're gonna release it. Hey guys. I guess that's they're thinking that now that everyone has basically decided that it's over even though it's still happening and happening more and more really and that the trend lines are up and that you're reaching like early outbreak levels of daily infections and deaths now which like. I said it's just. We're all grinding down the emergency on our mind. So we can keep going because we're just sick of sitting here We're acting like yeah. It's basically gone and now we can look back and like oh wow we're lucky that didn't happen oh. Now things are great. I can do socially distanced drinks you know and at the bar at the in front of the bar downtown which it just feels so much like hanging out and you know it's like. This is not a shadow of my former enjoyment and my former social life. This is just the new version of that because we've normalized it into reality. We've manifested it into being okay so someone's saying that it's state more stable than the flu and less likely to do that that'd be good. That'd be good all right that's nice that means you could actually get a vaccine that could be that could stamp it out relatively quickly. That's good and then of course we would look back at that time and learn nothing of any meaning. All we will be is dumber from having lived through it dumber and deafer and more distracted and more agitated and more knee-jerk in our reactions and more. Either plugged out of politics to the point of nihilistic self-destruction or plugged into politics to the point of ner just cripplingly neurotic nearly erotic fixation on the ups and downs of the of the spectacle of politics either way not in any way better positioned to deal with the horrors of the world around us and the crisis. The continuing unfolding crises it's like harrison bergeron where you know the smart people are forced to just have like a a siren go off next to their head every 10 minutes so that they can't think too far ahead before getting disrupted. We're all in that and then we're going to be in worse worse situation.

[14:28](https://youtu.be/ptS9x5O-Ajg?t=14m28s)

Monopoly capital will be in a vastly better situation because monopoly capital has monopolized the taking the opportunity of this mark this corruption. This this this drop in the economic like the the ex because you know one of the things hurting there's a drive towards monopoly and capitalism. But there's also you know expanding wealth and and inflation through that which makes it harder for capital to you know subsume others because they're able to grow in relationship to them but in a situation like this when you have whole sectors cored out almost overnight monopoly. Capital can scoop those up and add them into the borg. So we're going to have a more monopolized capitalism than we've had since the robber baron days. If we don't already and it'll be it'll be 

Something a lot of mom and pop shops are going to get turned into like now. I was not even something like you know like mcdonald's or other things. Not even more like they'll still be run by individual families and stuff. But as sort of like an uber model like a gig economy for restaurant tours where like you get to be a you get to rent out the pre the place and get like a per month per hour salary with no benefits to like basically run a restaurant instead of actually getting the profits from the restaurant like that would be the new model franchises but where like you're not even the owner you know like they've already been doing that There's a very interesting article. A number of years ago now about 7-eleven owners and how 7-eleven has essentially proletarianized their ownership in large degree because most because there's these networks of like immigrant networks mostly in india that basically hook people who want to move to the united states from india up with franchises when they get there sort of as their stake like as dowries even and that puts them in like sort of a subservient position.

You know vis-a-vis this huge company that can manipulate you know schedule. Ice raids on their own. Franchisees if they're thinking of you know asking too many questions. But they like squeeze the owners to the point where many of them make like twenty thousand dollars a year even though they're specifically supposed to be the franchise owners and they'll just wholesale replace the entire you know business model of small restaurants. I'd say restaurants and bars number one because those are the ones have been hardest hit and then but anything subsidiary to that escape rooms. Shooting ranges anything anything that rook it is a service or entertainment recreational industry or food consumption or beverages anything any of that element of life that involves people operating out of like fixed brick-and-mortar.

 positions like fixed capital that's not going to be owned by individuals anymore and that class of petty bourgeois is going to be subsumed into the proletarian class which of course is what the engine of capitalism does. It's separate. You have a bunch of different classes embedded within capitalism. Like. I have said there's even pre-capitalist modes sticking again there. I as I have said am an artisan that is a pre-capitalist. Um class configuration doesn't exist in doesn't it. It is not being produced by capitalism like hegemonically now like it was. It was something that had to be subsumed within capitalism and broken up and largely it's gone. What what used to be artisans are 99 of the time. Their jobs are now proletarianized. I am a remaining artisan. I'm still in there but the process is there are fewer over time until you grind out and then you've got like things. Like the small bourgeois you know and the pmc whatever kind of pseudo-class you want to pull out of your ass they will over time be pulled apart. Some of the lucky ones will get pulled up into the ownership class. The the losers will get pushed down into the working class the proletariat and then you end up with just two and this is going to be furthering that process hugely. The question is whether it be whether that's actually helpful to the you know radicalization of the working class. The old idea was it would because it would create larger and larger concentrations of working-class people who shared working-class conditions shared exploitation shared an understanding of their alienation and the contributors.

[19:02](https://youtu.be/ptS9x5O-Ajg?t=19m02s)

To it and could organize that way create become a class for themselves with a with a counter-hegemonic political and and cultural like engine like they. Like that's what when the the battle of positions that gramsci talks about is between capitalist hegemonic cultural institutions cultural and civic institutions and an emergent generated a working class. Generated working-class generated counterculture of its own institutions and like post-war italy is the closest example in the world to that that concept because the communist party during the post-war period when it was the official opposition many of the time and was being suppressed by the gladio operation. Had its own civic institutions. Its own radio stations its own media apparatus its own political leaders. Mayors senators and and you know cooperative aid organizations civic organizations recreational organizations that's also true of the german social democratic party before world war before the nazi rise. That's what um that's what the concentration of the working class. The pulling of people more and more into the working class does is because there will always be more working-class people than there are capitalists which means over time as there are more and more capitalist workers relative to capitalist that counter hegemony becomes stronger the the self-organizational capacity of the working class as such gets greater and then eventually you're able to through force of arms and persuasion any element that comes along with being both most numerous and most organized. It can't be one or the other. If you're organized without numbers. You will be crushed if you have numbers but there is no sufficient organization along sufficient concept which comes from creating institutions counter hegemonic institutions. That's the durability that allows you to like point your movement in the right direction to find the crack and the fissure of capitalism and drive into it. That's you need that and then the problem is is that while we are we are seeing before our eyes that this process of stripping all class character down to just two defining categories is happening and accelerating.

There is no concomitant rise of working class self-conscious counter hegemonic institutions culture and that's because of the effect that the process of social atomization suburbanization racial polarization and nationalism have done to and then compounded and compounded and quadruple compounded and exp and compounded beyond words compounded into the brain of a supercomputer. The internet on top of all of that has led to a situation where even though more and more people are turning into working class. They're not thinking of themselves as working class. They're just thinking of themselves as someone fallen from a natural social position. That's the full phenomenon of like the pmc who don't actually make money right somebody who is not thriving in the accredited world where you learn from your middle class parents that you get a college education and that allows you a certain social standing self-conception and salary and you don't get the salary but you still think of yourself as you still think of yourself first and foremost as part of that class that cultural class of college-educated people who are urban and cosmopolitan and value. You know social inclusion as ends into themselves the refinements that come from accrediting oneself to the bourgeois morality that late capitalism demands even though they are now functionally more and more of them actually work in class in their relationship to capitalism.

They are nonetheless not imagining themselves that way and look at think of those trump supporting non-college educated white men who are his base who are his mujahideen. His his his feathery warriors his his his 300 spartans lot. Some of them are Some of them are of course you know just racist right. A lot of them are just like I like racism but a lot of the reason that they're racist is because in america race is only really examined critically if you're white through the crucible of that bourgeois accreditation into middle class morality. Like that is really the only interaction a white person in america gets socially forget the television and all the stuff you see on the globalist media in reality what really brings you towards these not not like lived values. I'm talking just things in your head things that cost nothing to feel like white guilt and white privilege and like the idea of white supremacy like it does and your need to fight it and things like that your sense of you know white responsibility for the position of of african americans in this country like that's the specific college.

So some of it is just race 8 but other of it is misdirected rage due to the fact that you're even relative to the work. The rest like you're in a working class even relative to your older generations before you or other people. You see around you in culture and on the television. Your life is getting worse and worse but you don't know how to define that you can't define it because no one is talking to you from the other level. Alt media is the people who went to college talking to each other and everyone else is just drowning and they're just sitting on top of this drowning barge going oh. It's so sad they can't they can't free themselves and they're yelling into the in across this chasm. But it's all it's all loaded with contempt and it's all loaded with like the alienness like you're essentially talking to people who you don't understand. You're condescending even with the best of intentions and you combine that with the fact that there's no lived reality of class in this country people don't live class especially in the gig economy world where people aren't working in those conditions of like a factory line.

I mean even like I'd say our best hope for mass organization. In this country are the few places where people do work together like big box retailers or amazon fulfillment centers so and there are still factories in this country. God damn it too and also people like postal workers and teachers like that's that's hopeful because it's It's where people work together but most people don't work together. They're hustling because they've all turned us into lumping proletarians. Even though we have jobs and the thing is like so. I think people argue over these questions and it's like at every point you can see how the category confusion is happening and how they're basically don't really even disagree. They just have decided that arguing over this constitutes some sort of meaningful engagement for them or recreation or a combination of the two but man it's just if you pull this apart. There's just there's no resolving it either way. Like this is a real This is a real conflict oh and also I forgot. There's another section of the non-college trump. Supporters who are the boat beautiful boat people because yes there are a lot of upper like and what those people are are. I'm saying. It's like the class is getting pulled like the velcro is getting pulled well. Some get pulled down. Some get pulled up and they're getting pulled up and that's and that's and the reason they're voting for trump is because that's the class interest for them.

All the cultural stuff is just gravy and the reason they both feel that way is because we are culturally segregated. Our culture does not we and we live it through much more through the prism of race than through class and as I've said a million times. The only hope we have is that the conditions as they evolve will provide opportunities for us to grab in front of us. The possibility of reversing these trends and grabbing people together and having them pull in the same direction to interdict with the slide we having towards total monopoly domination and I don't think it's lost. I don't think we're doomed. I just think that we have to accept that we're at a more basic level fighting at a more basic level than a lot of us want to be. Because the implication of that is that man we have so far to go but you know acceptance is the first step towards moving forward and I feel like a lot of us are just fighting through this kubler-ross cycle like we stay in the discourse and fight it because we're fighting that eventual inevitable realization that these fights are for no good reason and then we will you know when human voices wake us till human voices wake us. I did not hear the miss rebel thing from john brown.

[28:56](https://youtu.be/ptS9x5O-Ajg?t=28m56s)

I was watching it. I had the titles on. She said if those rebels find out about that you'll get hanged. She was talking to missouri red shirts. Ruffians who were essentially almost all of them deputized into various militias that were part of the united states. Governments recognized territorial legislature in kansas how they were they rebels who were they rebelling against. I've not read under the volcano. I've heard. It's good though the chat is full of artisans. I'm sure no they were not called rebels why would they have been called rebels. They were called border ruffians generally that was what they were called and in like the press and stuff. There there was also like a political movement that was like called the party of law and order but nobody called them rebels. They weren't rebelling against anyone they were enforcing.

They were enforcing what was the closest thing to a legitimate monopoly of violence in the kansas territory according to uncle sam and the reason that matters is because to mistake that is to mistake the position that brown found himself in and the need to transgress to need to break out of the strategic. Stalemate that had arisen where neither side was willing to take the next step which over time benefited the the over the the larger political momentum behind the the slave state coalition. There the missouri the missouri faction. The ones who ended up writing the compton constitution even though their election was invalidated and they were not a recognized government. They still passed and demanded that gov. That's that congress approve a constitution that accepted slavery as the law of the land of the new kansas state and it was whether or not the democratic party would support that constitution that led to the southern democrats walking out at the convention in baltimore in 1860 which led to the northern democrats nominating the remaining northern democrats. Nominating stephen douglas. The southern democrats nominating for themselves. John breckenridge some some radical centrists around in the clay tradition. Put a guy named john bell as the compromise can't we all get along candidate the cuck. It was all over the lecompton constitution because that was the bridge that was too far even for the doe faces because stephen douglas was by any respect. He was the next logical guy in line after frank david pierce and buchanan. He was the most prominent congressional doe face. The guy who fought lincoln in the famous lincoln. Douglas debates over the issue primarily of slavery and his vehement defensiveness in defense of the planter prerogative and even foreign policy. But the thing is is that around stephen douglas northern sentiment changed. It was no longer possible in the north to say just give it to him like it used to be because even northern democrats the guys who mostly said leave slavery alone. I care about the banks. I care about the dang banks. I care about the revenuers and I don't give a these these quaker weirdos in boston. These these these homos say about slavery what's it got to do with me. Do you want these those black people up in here. I don't you know whatever. But they saw slavery as a threat to the more. They saw slavery as a competing threat to them a competitive economic system that could realistically put them in a position to lose their market power either as a farmer or as a laborer of any kind because they've been competing with literal free free labor. They said nope this is a bridge too far because the lecompton constitution was if they accept this then. Kansas is a slave state in the union with two new senators breaking the balance in the senate and meeting with a democratic president because democrats had a lock on the trial college at that point especially with the whigs imploding and the dem republicans.

This brand new party that had just emerged that it only had one presidential candidate up to its net to its credit. The the adventurist self-promoter john c fremont they had to go with a celebrity just to get people's attention the boom second time they have this it's still not. It still would have fallen to a unified republican party or a unified democratic party and that unified democratic party would then be voting to mean to put slavery in every state and once it's in every state that surrounds the north how long before it has to be introduced there to keep moving to keep to keep pushing forward to keep allowing a new area for slavers to import slaves and and create a new market that creates demand for old older slaves. Older lines of slaves by the by 1860 most northern virginia. The virginia slave trade was mostly about breeding and selling slaves down to the plant. The big cotton plantations in the south because that teeth that tidewater had been sort of already farmed out by the over aggressive farming of cash crops like tobacco. But you had this huge human capital stock that had to go somewhere and if you foreclose that that if you draw the the the if you end that process of expansion that's the end of the system over time and they understood that which is why they push forward but northern whites understood it too and they didn't want to be competing and so even douglas had to draw a line at lecompton and that helped lead to lincoln winning and that then guaranteed the civil war and so it was the kansas war more than anything that sharpened the sectional crisis to the to the breaking point which needed to happen for slavery to end and what did it. It was kansas and then harper's ferret. I'm just saying that that means if that strategic context where you go from a situation where it looks like slavery is about to get ready to just chomp on and get its jaws around the neck of free labor in the north to the hinge reversing and then the final confrontation which leads inevitably thanks to the superior industrial capacity and population and organizational abilities of the north to northern victory and to the end of slavery as it had to be and the funny thing is is that you could really argue that the civil war is essentially a the final. It's the war between the federalists and the jeffersonians in its final form like if you if you if you wanted like if you look at it as an ideological conflict like forgetting the fact that this is all just a term a cultural description for a material process which is the development of parallel economic systems plantation based agriculture in the south slavery-based agriculture in the south and free labor and small holding in the north or free manufacturing labor and small holding yeoman farmery.

In the north. They produce completely competing in different cultures. The fact that the majority of the peasantry of northern of the northern states was um made up of smallholders who lived on their own land and farmed their own land right. It meant that they created pro They also were able to produce produ um surplus produce they would be able to most of them. If they were successful. There was a lot of the northern land wasn't rich enough to do big plantation agriculture especially in new england. But there was enough land that individual smallholders could farm enough food to sustain their families and then surplus to sell and what would they do. They would essentially exchange surplus crops for finished mechanical and material items like pieces of clothing manufactured items. Things for the farm industrial the basis of an industrial economy basically and that transmission belt created a civic society around it now in the south. The the the proletariat largely was enslaved labor who produced only enough food for themselves like plantations had Like all slaves had to essentially they were their own yeoman and that they they farmed and they contributed to the farming of the food that fed themselves. But otherwise they spent all of their time working for the plantation owner meaning that there is no surplus for them to exchange in the cities for finished products. So the demand that created like the industrial economy and this and the urban life of the north was impossible in the south and so because of that you essentially had a federalist country and a jeffersonian country. Like those two competing philosophies of government that emerged from the reality of the end of the american revolution was now reduced to a real proposition because of the fate of geography because of the fact that there was so much rich soil that allowed for the creation of these vast profitable in agricultural operations that could create huge surplus amounts of um of cash crops that could provide the material basis for also for formulating industrial capitalism in northern united states and also great britain. You know it provides the fuel for the capitalist machine. They had like all those linen mills in manchester were spinning for a lot of the part of it slave linen slave slave cotton and that because the jefferson like the jeffersonian idea of american liberty that we live with is essentially the idea of living as a. Farmer now jefferson thought he meant small yeoman farmers but in reality that's not That's not possible without creating cities like you can't have yeoman farmery the way they hit in the north without creating the urban culture and urban infrastructure of things like banking and finance and like like abstracted. You know essentially intensified capitalist productive relationships. Those things are united you can only have continuing agricultural life if there is no no excess no surplus built up and the way to do that is who's slavery because he is imagining agrarian life through the lens of a slave owner. Not a yeoman he was a slave owner not a yeoman. So when he he idolized urban life. He was idolizing his experience now because the fact people like him were the people who made up the political aristocracy the leadership of the new country.

In the south. Over time their institutions became the institutions of jeffersonian democracy meanwhile in the north the absence of large tracts of rich land that could accommodate slave agriculture. The fact that the relatively rocky soil of the north was more conducive to to small holding peasantry. Also the new territories of the north even if they were richer in land were also more deeply filled with native americans who had to be contended with and much more You know would require much more investment to just clear for large. Any kind of large-scale agriculture at all was largely wilderness. So those two modes come into conflict in the civil war. Finally they cannot be resolved and then instead of recognizing and then when the problem is is. That of course that victory by northern capitalism would eventually result in a synthesis between the two. It's not going to be just the destruction of the one that's impossible the problem is is that the new thing we created because of the results of reconstruction. Specifically was misshapen essentially its historical form bent that jeffersonian model of endless expansionary freedom maintained and now sits on happily in in in conjunction. With like this attempt to build something like a rationalized you know social democratic capitalist edifice It's it's a bummer man. It's a real bummer but the whole point is that those those crisis moments are they're fluid and we had bad. We had a bad run of things like lincoln getting shot was very bad you know. I don't know how much better things would be if he hadn't died but man I've got i. I'm willing to say they would have been in some way better which at this point a little bit could go a long way the way things ricochet you know the way things amplify over time and space It's a bummer though but yes like the entire american conception of freedom was jefferson's idea of limitless farming ex like the idea that you don't have to have all that icky complicated stuff that's socially that stuff that requires you to subsume yourself into a social collective. You know even if it's like we could say that it's it's this isn't we're not talking about socialism. We're talking about capitalist market exchange yes but capitalist market exchange remember is more progressive than what is. Jefferson's essentially feudal world view and so he gets this feudalized capitalism because you know it was a part of capitalism. Slave agriculture was part of capitalism. All those stock they were integrated into every level of the of the world. The burgeoning world capitalist economy but they had this struck this this feudal remnant structure based around these jeffersonian ideas and we did not crush enough that idea of american liberty when the north won the civil war. That was the main failing not crushing it enough and I think like.

I said it wouldn't have been fully crushed because you don't do that there was always going to be a some level of accommodation that leads to a synthetic thing not not just the dominance of one that's a dialectical. That's that's that's basic you can't argue otherwise but you certainly would be could be in a different position vis-a-vis that idea and really I think the real. The the dagger in the heart to the to our progress has been that the constitution itself was not destroyed because the constitution was what got us into that. Mess in the first place and the same way that the articles of confederation reached a point where they were no longer sustainable and we started over from scratch. The civil war should have been the thing that had a start over from scratch on a governing document which would have put us on yes still capitalist but on a track towards an actual industrial capitalism that had a like a social relationship at its base that accepted liberal subjectivity which is equal subjectivity which would have removed racism as a bat as a mystifying and socially atomizing and um and counter revolutionary force in american life and so the fact that we're still dealing with the constitution that's still this noose on our neck. It really is the thing that moment stands out as as the thing that warped our behavior. We're like a bound foot from a manchu you know bed maiden.

It's It's a bummer. It wouldn't have made miracles happen my god. I'm just saying we would be in a better position. Now than we are that's all I'm saying how much better. I don't know. I'm just saying we'd be in a better position. We would not have trump as president. We would not be in this specific dilemma. I think we would have been more durable and and vibrant working-class institutions. In this country we would have a more left-wing government even if things had gotten worse after the seven even if like even if you have the same like basic structure of a post-war boom followed by a collapse of the world order and then reorientation around like global finance capitalism that led to the end of american industrial dominance and its replacement in the supply chain with cheaper labor in the emerging east and the america becoming instead the buyer of last resort.

The the surplus absorber within the capitalist system to you know maintain its its military might overseas and to provide like the mouth at the center of it to absorb all surplus production to to regulate exchange. Even if that had happened we would be in a better position we probably have universal healthcare. Let me just say that we would probably have it and we would not be in this situation where we are essentially biting our brains out of our head as a culture and driving ourselves insane because of our civic belief in freedom coming from this freakish perverted bewigged aristocrat sex criminal epstein-ass. Jefferson like the fact is is that when we reach back to all right like most cherished american ideas of freedom they don't belong to like medieval peasants us in europe anyway when when people think of freedom obviously more and more they're thinking in terms of you know atomized american freedom freedom to consume you know for the freedom of the freedom of the market sure but at the base of that they also have a folk understanding of freedom that flows from the peasant solidarity that came before capitalism because these things don't go away. They echo the the nightmares of all dead generations lay on the brain of the living we on the other hand when we think of freedom.

Even I think on the left we end up at jeffersonian freedom to expand freedom because that's the thing about jeffers the jeffersonian idea and the reason that it foundered finally on its inability to expand itself because it cannot be stabilized within a system it demands always. It can only compensate with more because you're not giving people a social structure. The hostility the hostility to the state at the center of jeffersonianism is the hostility to being integrated into a social situation. You're saying the fact that I unlike my peasant or aristocratic european f for founders who were bound by superstition and and and sultifying social conventions in europe and and and the vile hand of like roman papistry or whatever the. Now here we can breathe free in the open spaces but only but but that means that we have to do it by ourselves because to participate into to allow ourselves to be brought into a social relationship is to undermine our freedom of movement and freedom of movement. Here is defined as the only freedom that matters as opposed to a deeper understanding of freedom is the freedom to freedom from fear really and pain that comes with a social awareness and and social reciprocal um reciprocal obligation that there is a meaning there and a a richness to life that compensates for any narrow app reduction of the aperture of like indulgence because and that what that means is that the only answer to social friction in those situations has to be expansion.

There can be no resolution because there aren't institutions that people agree upon that can arbitrate distinctions and so it leads all questions have to be entered by expansion and so at what's what really healed the civil war breach between the north and south. The the whites of the north and the whites of the south. After we decided that we were going to solve the problem the emergent social problem of emancipation by just re-inscribing slavery as much as we could in social form if not in like technically economic relationship. We invaded philippines and the spanish-american war. We consecrated that with expansion into becoming a world power and then there was some battle within about that.

But by the end of world war ii we had the whole world and then space and we always had this this reach and it was not until the iraq war. I think really that the the curtain closed and now we're turning inward and we're taking this jeffersonian notion of freedom and individuality and liberty and what it means to be an american and how and how that relates to you know a morality how amer being american is part of a moral framework that involves christianity certainly and as a protestantism. All that it all flows but that requires expansion requires somebody getting. Some of this pie at every point because there's no other fun way to reduce social friction and now how are we going to reduce it when that is the presiding ideology of government and we have this kubler-ross cycle realizing that our social body must die. If it cannot continue to expand you guys know about you know why some of these answers are are purple highlight. I don't know why that is. I gotta say as much as. I'm sure.

I'll hate hamilton and as much as I hate the concept of the whole thing. I do think if you want to talk hero and villain if you're talking hamilton and jefferson. Jefferson is the bad guy. I'm sorry and the thing is is that there will always be moments in american history where the jeffersonian tradition has very worthy. Exponents who are doing good things to check the rise of horriby monopoly capitalism unchecked capitalism. I'm just saying that it was an insufficient antithesis to the thesis of hamiltonian developmentalism. You know what I mean or maybe it's because it was the thesis it when we never broke through. We never broke over it because there was always free real estate always free real estate free real estate made us in every critical moment able to vent off instead of confront within because in europe those kettles started popping because there was nowhere for the pressure to go. In america. There was always somewhere for the pressure to go and to me. That's the answer to every question about why america is exceptional why it didn't have a labor party. It all boils down. However you want to talk about the functions you want to talk about the thermodynamics so if it's like if you want to broadly go a progressive regressive figure.

[54:12](https://youtu.be/ptS9x5O-Ajg?t=54m12s)

The progressive figure is hamilton. The regressive figure is jefferson and I would say that just on a personal level even though hamilton was a creep and an arrest and kind of an obviously an arch-capitalist psycho who feared had nothing but fear and disgust for the idea of a common man. Was still better than that hypocritical snot-nosed ugh. Just he's the guy boswell talked about when he said why do we hear the m that lar. The why why must we hear the loudest bleeding for freedom from the drivers of negroes. That's who he was talking about. Jefferson and the guy immediately. Even though he had said that that there should be no you know real formal power for the president and and and the legend and the executive because oh we gotta love that legislature gets in there louisiana purchase immediately oh. What's that your.

Principles don't compare with this thing anymore and the thing that really mattered was expansion because it's the economic engine of the kind of warped capitalized like an agrarian economy that you've created here inevitably out of your idea you. We do love john quincy adams folks one of our. I mean you want to talk best presidents. He is in the conversation and when share pass like lincoln and fdr spare spare moment for jqa also one of the better men to be president and a man who recognized the moral written. He recognized that every oath in the constitution and the declaration of independence was going to be worth nothing over time if we made territorial expansion the undergirding mechanism of our economy he at the moment he's like. This is going to lead us to abandoning everything and it did and it has and look where we are and everything that everybody wants to talk about america and all the good stuff is this schizophrenic. Frankenstein creation of of the of the of the like echo dominations of a greater horror and a greater mis series of crimes and exploitations and thefts and their corporations. We didn't we weren't never made to behave the way that the european states were made to behave.

They spent a thousand years smashing against each other to grab grab grab but god damn it. At some point you realize that there are other forces outside of you and we never hit that because the native americans who resisted our exploration of the continent never were able to cohere into a meaningful state resistance because they started from such a lower level of like surplus economy that they were not able to you know because you can't do it overnight. It has to be staged and there was no time especially after you have the initial massive die off from like the essentially un intentional biological warfare campaign that happened before there was even settling in north america that had a huge impact and then over time you know native populations rather absorbed into the greater system or were pushed out of it. But you know disinherited of any land and also a residue of you know social formation or I mean institutional formation that you could turn into an actual organized resistance against another state. It was not all intentional the first farm the fir the first big.

I believe it was the first big smallpox plague in the mid-atlantic. The one that happened right before the john smith showed up the one that allowed them to even like set up. There was because some basque fishermen or something like blew on to long island and had an interaction with like a local tribe and then left and that led to something like 80 percent die off of the population within within a very short period of time and so of course. Later on. You have intentional like lord jeffrey amherst and his smallpox blankets. What I'm saying is that they didn't even have to try was how lethal they were. They were like radioactive.

Berserkers who else are someone asked who are their most american because john brown is one of our most american americans p.t. Barnum another one of our most american americans first name that comes to mind anyway. I'll think of some more that's a good question. I was going to like make a book of a a gal. A rogue's gallery of like our most condensed americans along certain axis like representations of certain you know fundamental american expressions of culture. Henry ford is another good one. Yes mark twain also very good very good for sure donald trump 100 joseph smith yes yeah. No you guys are all 100 though that's fire andrew jackson absolutely and of course abraham lincoln l ron hubbard. We got to get some women in here. I feel like we're we're doing it oh martin luther king pamela. Anderson's canadian thank you very much phyllis schlafly. Yes oh hillary clinton for sure gel. Maxwell also british. It seems like I'm realizing that yeah when you talk in these terms you're always going to end up being very heterosys male normative just because so much of you know our received my received anyway. You know narrative of america is this is this public-facing you know battle of ideas and a public spare that has been largely largely banned largely the domain of man in white when's it that amber frost definitely all right.
