It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday and the manager gives me a smile because he knows that it's me. They've been coming to see to forget about life. For a while down. At the bar is a friend of mine gets me. My drinks for free says you know. I could be a movie star hold up. It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday and the manager gives me a smile cause. He knows that it's me they've been coming to see to forget about life for a while. John is a real estate novelist. He never had time for a wife and he's talking to davey who's still in the navy and probably will be for life and the piano sounds like a carnival and the microphone smells like a beer. They sit at the bar and bread in my jar and say man what are you doing here sing us a song tonight. We're all in the mood for a melody and you've got us feeling all right hello folks. So we're all at the end here wrapping it up bow on it boop beep. This is the end of our very long at this point because I had to take a break for tour breakdown of dawn of everything by grab grow rip. We'll talk. I'm think next week um. I might do a stream. It will be earlier in the week because I'm going to be out of town later. But I'm probably just hanging out not going to do a book. I will probably announce the book that we're gonna do next week and then maybe give a couple weeks before we start it right now. I'm leaning towards leo panitch's book.

But we'll see the making of global capitalism because I feel like there's something sort of nice about tying the bows together if we're gonna start with a book. That's like okay how did like regimes of power emerge to now end on okay. How is how do we get to the point where regimes of power are alienated completely out of human hands which is what capitalism is as first a tool of a ruling class but eventually a self-aware structure of power and will frankly that overalls all human will and subordinates it to its purpose. That's what I think capitalism is at the end of the day at the end of the day folks. That's what it is this. It is the technological alienation of the drive to dominate that animates class society focal point pivoted away from human will and intention and into a fully alienated algorithm of profit extraction and so we start with how it started. Now we got we'll we'll it would make sense to now talk about how that got out of our hands because if what grab grower describing here or trying to is the conditions that lead to the emergence of regimes of power that are human-based that have technology in them that are technological but are still determined by human will. That is the beginning of a process that inevitably I would argue once it starts somewhere once the first tumor pops into existence. It will inevitably over all the entire world and one and as it does so as regimes of power dominate the world the destruction of the environment.

The district don't even not necessarily destruction but disruption of the ecological balance that allowed that power regime of power to come into being creates. A destabilizing effect that over time destroys these structures. But because there is no challenge to the ruling class it just reconstitutes itself with new new cultural language new technology to reassert its authority. But it gets more challenging over time because the exploited become more capable of resistance because at first they don't resist. They escape like they talk in this book a lot about how human freedom was sustained by the ability. The freedom first of all to leave and that freedom made it meant it took a long time for power to assert itself over every citizen and make leaving impossible and requiring then resistance and the worse. It gets the more resistance. There is and the ecological conditions that sustain power are always deteriorating and destabilizing over time. So new technologies have to be forged to make that power more efficiently distributed. Laminate the coercive and consensus seeking or um the carrot and stick of society into one machine that can be operated at the push of a button.

Because the thing that undermines class rule at the end of the day is yes you have a class interest but it is not pursued by everyone within the class in the same way it is pursued individually by members of a ruling class which means that they might drop push the thing in one direction over time. But they can't. They don't have fine motor control in times of crisis. So they end up fumbling the bag they end up getting diluted and destroying themselves. This is what happens to your your kings and your landed aristocrats. The the aristocracy of the sword as the as the emergent bourgeois who are closer to the new technologies of state and control are able to exercise them more efficiently and take power away from the old landed elites. They get bought off but their power is taken from them and now the bourgeois power has been taken not by the working class as marx imagined it would but by the very machines that they used to take power and to me.

This is why well there's a lot of great stuff in this book and it's really really useful in my mind to understand like human capacity human social capacity as an abstract concept. It's a failure at trying to convince me that there's anything in those old ways of being that tells me how to avoid total annihilation of humanity by the machines. It's created because it does not have anything to say about those machines. It has nothing to say about the the role. The technology and ecology play in pushing us into narrowing narrower and narrower shoots where we are forced to destroy one another in greater and greater displays of violence in order to maintain alienated class structures because they want to make us believe that once these machines get in place once sovereignty is wedded to charismatic politics and is wedded to administration through the application of technologies such as agriculture that they obliterate that world and they make a new one that we have all been living in ever since and now we're at the end state of it and it's not an end because there's necessarily going to be an apocalypse and end of humanity.

That's what we dream of and seek and hope because it means we don't miss anything. We don't miss some sort of you know efflorescence of humanity. All we miss is like more misery oh great fantastic. I'll get raptured up now thank you please but just a case where our rulers change to the machines and that there is no more subject. There is no more human subject that there used to be because as it was destroyed as it was redefined by the emergent state structures. It is now being redefined by this stateless globalized universal architecture of symbols delivered electronically that have turned us into different beings again.

Now that doesn't mean that from these beings we can't build something else but it will be in the rubble. It will be outside of this teleology of humanity because it is a teleology and that's the big thing that's wrong with what grade grower. They repel at the notion of teleology. But there is a civilizational teleology as soon as you establish the regimes that these guys find icky and want to talk around and want to imagine alternatives too that could have existed at one time yes. That's not necessarily teleological and they do a good job undermining the notion that it is but in the cone of civilization that extends until it includes everybody. There is an embedded teleology and we're living in it baby. So the the end of this. The conclusion of this book is honestly pretty. It's a pretty damp squib because the one thing they've been talking around the whole book is well. How do we get stuck with civilization. If there is all this possibility if we always have this and we lived for so long in possibility.

How the hell did we let this happen and they finally get to gesture towards it and I gotta say it is very unpersuasive. It's very uninteresting. They basically say well regimes of domination emerged out of regimes of care because eventually the function of caring for those who are vulnerable which they say early social orders socialized literally the the care of those who couldn't be cared for by their own families under the under the auspices of the monarch usually or like the chief or whatever and that that was originally bringing someone into a family. But over time it became essentially a role of slavery and domination and it's like dude psychologically. That's probably very true like that. That is that is the story of the intimate social transformation. This psychic transformation that turns someone who at one time saw everybody under their umbrella of of of of social life in their this definition of like humanity full humanity that I could imagine someone beneath me and the way they say it the way they imagine.

It is you know if runaways and and the disabled and the catastrophically widowed are thrown out of the the small nodes of self-sufficient and self-sustaining and mobile. This is key social order that I used to be a part of I can still find sucker under the auspices of you know. The the ritually affirmed embodiment of the community which is what you know your headman your chief whatever is but that relationship can move from one of intimate you know family to under. I would argue conditions of scarcity and trauma into one of domination where I don't see you anymore as a family member. I see you now as a burden and it's like once that's a great description dude but guess what you're forgetting what you're what you're intentionally avoiding. What what would have caused that change is an environmental shift.

The conditions for life would have changed. They just imagine it changing over time just like a vibe shift as if everything doesn't have a cause. I would say that the better more expansive way to to explain this and the thing that would have honestly made this book really compelling and fully developed but they couldn't go with because it would have gone against their their allergy to determinism and materialism more broadly which is that hey they. Had this breach in their understanding of care because the conditions that sustained life in an equilibrium were no longer available and they had to change them and that means that eventually civilization will emerge just like a modern subject eventually will get cancer if it lives long enough. Not neces you can't say oh you're inevitably going to get cancer you know when you're 24 or yeah on a day that an a tumor is going to emerge but you could say on a long on a given. The fact that you have a basically endless timeline here because you have a relative equilibrium between humanity and the biome something is going to pop up. A tumor is going to pop up because of trauma because of social carcinogens accumulating and that's I think a full telling that then we can use to understand where we are now but their their ideological priors. Their anarchism makes them incapable of seeing it. They're literally incapable of seeing what's right in front of them and it's because they are existentially repelled by the by the by the by the implications of that and here are the real implications.

It is well. I'm not. I'm not. I am not not actually a liberal subject. I'm not an ego. I am not me like that's why. It's. It's. It's the socially like perfected concept of liberalism. But it is motivated by the liberal fantasy that we are eternal subjects not socially embedded not determined by our conditions and we and I'm sorry. That's what we are and that is why change if it happens will not be initiated by some sort of collective act of will. It will be changing conditions changing our responses to those conditions and marx's conception was is that because of the common experience of exploitation by capitalism you would get this new fusion of liberal subjects into a new type of relationship. That is more like what they're imagining an expansive social type of of existence but you can't just port the liberal self into that you have to assume that you will literally have a change in the subjective experience of life definitions of words. What symbols mean like what the self is and that's going to change your relationship to everybody else around you your notion of obligation your notion of social social ritually pledging yourself to something other than you alienating some degree of autonomy to a collective to act collectively. It has failed to occur that is a true point but anarchism has failed even worse. It has not even been able to assert power anywhere that has not popped like a soap bubble much like those wonderful north american woodland societies that they jack off to in the last chapter.

So that's my beef with the book even though I highly recommend everybody read it for the details read it for the putting on its head a lot of your embed. Like here's. It does challenge a lot of sort of un thinking cliches that a lot of us have including myself instead of like really fleshed out narratives of things like the deep past which are hard to get your head around a lot of ways. So you sort of let cliche fill in the holes. This does a great job of breaking up your cliches and challenging them and making you look at them again.

But it does not do what they wanted to do which is turn. People into anarchists at least not this guy and one of the things that really helped me sharpen my critique of this what's wrong with my audio. Why do these people do this to me okay um one of the things that'll be sharp in a lot of my thoughts about this and really like hone in on what was bugging me the whole time. I was reading it because like. I said it's a fun read. It's a lot of cool detail and there's nice conjectures things that like slap you in the face but the whole time. I'm thinking like. I got a pebble in my shoe and I've got like a two big wallet. I'm just not centered. And it's because there's so. Much of this book that while you're reading it feels very convincing because of the language views that if you look back on it it's really just conjecture filling in huge gaps and they they kind of win you over by winging you and saying yeah.

We know we're doing this but just like you just take our word for it. So we can keep going the problem is that's the whole book. It gets entirely marbled that way. It doesn't it doesn't pay back the the faith the good faith of accepting their reasoning with some big revolt resolute resolution to the argument that like rests on firmer footing and so you're like okay yeah. It was a little shaky getting here but now that you're here you can't deny this if it had gotten there. I would have given would have forgiven a lot more but it just doesn't. The whole thing is that it's just all shaky foundations the whole way around and then basically just saying yeah. But it wouldn't be pretty to think so. That's it's persuade that's the final pitch and anyway the thing that I read that helped me really pinpoint a lot of things that were bugging me reading. It is a review of the book by my main man walter scheidel. Anybody who's been a long-term follower of the pod. Knows that I'm a big scheidel head.

I think that he's a great one of the great living non-marxist materialist historians like he is absolutely not a marxist. He is one of those guys who sees the teleology of capitalism and says good the machine should be in charge and it's like okay cool. But because he does have that like he understands that this is a process of this emergent system and a marxist would say this is the opposite of humanity guys like schedule even if they don't know it are really thinking no. This is the apotheosis of humanity that makes them able to see clearly a lot of stuff that grab growth because they're romantic liberals who think that their liberal subjectivity is eternal and not historically contingent and that it was different and it will be different in other contexts and in the future. It's not some fixed identity point. I'm sorry with rights that is like somehow transcendent of time and space.

 so scheidel one of the anyway. But his book I've recommended before escape from rome great great leveler really good. I think he's working on a new one that I'm very excited to read. But he wrote a review of this book which is like a perfect match because he is in many sense the absolute opposite of these guys because he's also a liberal but whereas the grab girl liberals are repelled by the machine. Scheidel is a fan and what in the when their job is I mean if your job is mounting a barricade and fighting a war we know who we'd rather be fighting with grab grow. Obviously we know who decide in like a battle or actual battle. We would be on but in the question of determining like what the what is happening in the world around us. Scheidel's demonic submission to the machine makes him a superior historian so scheidel reviews this book and I read the schedule review and schedules schedule. Also like. I says that the book is worth reading fun to read does challenges a lot of orthodoxies meaningfully and for a lay person especially is a great way to break up.

You know stuff that might be like old in an accumulated muck in our popular you know pop science understanding of the past but like their actual you know argument is just absolutely founded on a lot of either stuff that has been around for a long time that is not mind-blowing that the that all of the relevant fields have accumul have totally assimilated into their understanding and therefore not mind-blowing or it's just conjecture. Based on that like a good example of that is they say that in a lot of these societies that eventually become basically it they say everywhere that there is no fixed correlating relationship between You know things like agriculture and urbanization and and regimes of hierarchy because people moved around within them and there were seasonal cycles where people would come together live communally under like control of a monarch and then they would disperse and for grab growth. The fact that that might that existed that that pattern existed means that those things getting together into a group don't cause hierarchy but another way to look at. This is that on a lot once again on a long enough time scale. Those that phenomenon of people coming together in those formations is what prepares them to become permanent like if they stayed out in us in like you know forager groups that never came together. How would they ever have just how would they ever have created a hierarchy like what he's at what they're actually describing. With this cyclical thing is the the building of the preconditions for the hierarchy. People aren't going to submit to a permanent hierarchy before they have had the temporary one and like that is to me an even more persuasive description of that evidence.

But the only difference but um and there's absolutely no like his the evidentiary. Distinction between that interpretation and grab grows grab grows where it's just yeah. They were all chilling and that means that they're never gonna turn into you know concentrations of power even though they did everywhere else and how did they everywhere else by first having those cyclical seasonal relations. What they want to say is that because this didn't happen instantaneously because there's no correlation between like you have agriculture boom you have civilization you have urbanization boom. You have hierarchy because they're saying there's no like moment of like big bang explosion and correlated between like material relationships. Then they're not materially determined but what if it's a gradual process what if it's a thing that happens over a long time and it accumulates and reaches an inflection. Point and nobody at the time realizes that's happening like. They always want to say on this thing that this doesn't mean that these things being together here means that they were not on the cusp of developing some sort of hierarchical relationship.

But what about the places where there was agriculture that came after foraging because you're saying because foraging existed at one point before the agriculture that there was no cusp situation but then there's never a cusp anywhere. Nobody is ever on the cusp you've you've gotten rid of the concept of the cusp and that's fine because it doesn't tell us anything about the determinative relationship. Like if things like agriculture and urbanization do not cause hierarchy to emerge. They provide an accelerant and a catalyst for them to be developed once the things that do which they have still not even gotten to maybe. It's care regimes say okay your care regime changes like they imagine your care regime is now one of domination now how does that go from something that breaks up cyclically to something that concentrates and becomes a self-perpetuating state based on class domination. It is provided the accelerant and catalyst of access to say cereals access to say horses and draft animals. The things that you're saying didn't cause it guarantee that it will emerge if the thing that did cause it happens and the thing that did cause it to happen happened and would have to have happened and inevitably would have happened and how do we know because say it with me.

It happened if it happened one place in the human biome human the guy a ball we live on it hap. It would happen somewhere it was going to happen somewhere and why it happened someplace and not others is not well here. I guess they were like better at facilitating one another and they were more chill dudes or something. They had better vibes that's basically what it boils down oh yeah. In north america. They just had better vibes okay great but in the place where they have bad vibes. They also have serial agriculture and horses so it doesn't matter whose vibes are what they could have had great vibes over in the other place. Too the exact same good vibes but if they have good vibes and agriculture and horses maybe they get bad vibes maybe the vibe changes. There is a vibe shift and it has nothing to do with human choice. It has to do with ecological conditions resources access to resources and the environment like for example less stable relationship to food because what is where all these places where people had good vibes and nothing changed also had super abundance of food where did it where did civilization emerge in places where abundance fluctuated and all of a sudden. These good vibe people have the same vibes as north americans do all of a sudden. The vibe shifted because more more trauma associated with seeking limited resources. Messes up you know the the the vibe in the community but then maybe in north america. The same thing happens but then the the stable relationship with the ecology smooths it out but maybe somewhere else because you have a more unstable relationship with the environment.

It persists oh and also access to things like horses and cereals because one thing that they point out here that is kind of honestly. A dagger in the heart of the argument is that they say yeah globally. You had this 5 000 year period before there's any kind of like dominant social structures and why don't we talk more about that than the 5000 where we have them and one of the reasons is because it was first which means it's a foreign country in a way that the the 5 000 years that came after and that rebuild society. Every day psychically and materially along those lines fixed it froze. It is more meaningful but forget all that worldwide we. See that there is about a 7 000 year long period between the adoption of agriculture in an area and the creation of these settled conglomerations. Like one of the things they want to point out that grab girl want to use to point out that there's no like determined relationship is in the emergence of the holocene that seven thousand years that that period. When this the gun goes off basically the stabilization of the environment. After the retreat of the of the glaciers.

All these areas and that some of them didn't get any development of hierarchy and domination and others did. But the thing is that every place that developed hierarchy that developed the state had was one of those early areas and the ones that didn't like for example north america and and the polynesia did not have sufficient cereal in their environment to create the sort of storable durable taxable surplus that allows the state to flourish. So you got a 7 000 year period. So it's 7 000 years from the from the emergence of life in the fertile crescent and in this valley and china and everything until you get the states but because humans settled east to they moved east to west right and the new world is literally the new world not because it was discovered by europeans. But because the people got there last so the people those those aggregate took longer for agriculture to emerge and in north america where grabro make their like resting argument about the possibility of humanity to avoid domination. They didn't get maize which is the only real cereal in north and north in the americas at that time and which is an inferior for the purposes of taxation and storage and all that inferior to other cereals like grain and rice. So it's one of the least useful cereals and it showed up even later so guess what by the time the europeans are knocking on the door of north america. It has been about 7 000 years so all you're really arguing. Here is that there you get about 7 000 years and then one way or another.

It's coming it's knocking on your door because of that relationship between human social structures and their environment their environment and like their big thing is they they picks on. They insist that if if something is not the proximate cause of something else then it did not determine it and I'm sorry proximate causes are fun to understand and useful to especially when you're talking about like the recent past and applying it to the life you have now but when you're talking about like real like defining answers to questions like what caused something they're meaningless. It's like a building once once like the the the um. Once the controlled demolition of a building begins. It's going to fall down you know there's going to be specific things that are going to cause the exp. The thing like struts to fail and you can describe those but that's not the thing that did it. The the general trends are what answer general questions and what these guys try to do is answer. General questions with these proximate causes but a general trend cannot be answered by finding the proximate causes for it.

You need a general influence and it's the environment and like some of the stuff they use for example to talk about cities and how urban life did not equal. A hierarchy involves just like making stuff up. Like the first cities were not in mesoamerica. They were in the fertile crest in china in this valley. That is where the first cities were like. They're literally just fudging the fudging numbers there and and also their big example of tatuachuan. The place that had like monumental architecture and apparently when it was built did almost immediately have hierarchy like th tichuan started off by by grab raw's own admission as this cathedral of executions and ball sports and aristocratic violence that marked the inca and and the aztecs and the olmecs before them and then they was overthrown and you had this temporary like 200 year period where instead of building temples and monuments and executing people. They built public housing and it is a very interesting story. It's one of the most interesting parts of the book something. I had no idea. No idea had ever it existed but also it's literally the only one you can find so like if it's an outlier you haven't proven anything but gradual basically take this and say this is the model of early states.

Also that the the fertile crescent societies had all that stuff about assemblies that's all just wish casting. It's like here's public forums. They must have been where people came together to talk about political issues. It's like maybe maybe and once again if this if if if filling that gap in with conjecture led to a greater more salient truth. It would be worth picking but but as just one of another bits of speculation it just falls apart and and other stuff.

They just allied like when they compare the cyclical social arrangement of the mega sites of ukraine to basque villages. That still to this day use this like circular social structure to to do non-hierarchical civic life and he compared them and said that the evidence that the boss still exists proves that like these social models worked the basque villages are not built out of circles. There's no circular relationship. It is. It is a a clan relationship that is extended over distance. Like these are farm houses spread out throughout the countryside so it is literally taking two different types of cyclicality and equating them because they're the same shape.

Even though one of them is is physical and the other one is hypoth. It is like conceptual and their whole argument that the state never emerges that you never have. A state is essentially that because you don't have things that correspond to the the 19th century. German definition of state that was built by like the era of great eur great power nationalism in europe like the the entire discipline of history as we understand it as a social science was was founded in wilhelmine germany in the late 19th century guys like leopold von ranka and they defined a lot of the the they define the terms that we use for a lot of historical. Concepts one of them being the state and graduate take this definition and say that because that didn't exist back then and you can't recognize it. In these things. Then there is no such thing as a state. The state isn't a concept and it's again because they disembodied things from their social relations and then they make them eternal concept concepts and there is no such thing but there is one one bit of really sneaky.

Here that stood out to me because I people who have been watching these that I have noted are I noted already I i put like I generally read this thing credulously like okay. I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt while I'm reading this because I wanna you know. I wanna engage with it in good faith and the story they were telling was very compelling so. I I wanted to give them that benefit because I wanted to hear the next thing in you know a a an open framework so that I can you know absorb it But this one I put a little asterisk next to and said what are we actually saying here. And that was when he's describing the the mesoamerican tribe that or the mess of american civilization community whatever you want to say that allied with cortez against the aztecs.

When the when the spanish showed up and he describes their their power structure there as this like democracy as essentially as a occupy wall street style general assembly. Everybody comes together and debates the questions of the day and then comes to a consensus decision and then acts on it and of course. I pointed out at the time it's very funny that like this this the one actual example of like real democracy being enacted in that they actually talk about like a specific moment is these people saying hey let's let's ally with these literal demons in human skin. These continent and people at the assemblies were saying these people are a curse and they said you know what it we're going for it but anyway so like that's separate from the greater question that I also raised which is what is the social what is the political economy in here because she's saying everybody together is getting is deliberating but is this like a bunch of yeoman farmers who all work their own land or is there some relationship of dependence here of domination as it were socially like class power forgetting oh everybody gets to assemble in the in the great hallway to deliberate yay.

This is democracy okay but what is the social structure and I didn't know and so I said what is it but this is fascinating Scheidel is able to basically answer my question here by completing a quote that grabro shorten intentionally to try to make their point so when trying to argue that this group was democratic. They quote cortes in his letters back to spain where he says quote it is that the the their government the talaqa palaco government. Is quote almost like that of venice or genoa or pisa because there is no one supreme leader or the I'm sorry venice or genoa or pisa because there is no one supreme ruler and that's that's where grab grow ended. But the at the full quote is. There are many lords all living in this city and people who are tillers of the soil are their vassals. Though each one has lands to himself some more than others in taking an undertaking war. They all gather together and thus assemble they decide and plan them.

Now you might say oh okay. They all decide so even the vassals decide. But it's like the vassals decide now are you calling this a debate. But in reality this was a hereditary aristocracy where about a hundred people got together the roman senate basically so the exact things that ruled in the old world where regimes of domination had risen up like a monster and destroyed. Humanity are also existing here well congratulations. Now you might say oh he was just He was just assuming he was because he was you know he was from europe. He couldn't recognize any other freedom well. Okay. Then his thing about them being a democracy doesn't mean anything either either either he had an insider he didn't if he couldn't see anything into in front of his face because he was too blinded by the ideology he grew up with well.

Then it's a meaningless piece of evidence either way so yeah that that's that's that's scheidel's review he says a bunch of other stuff. It's all very cutting You can tell that he's pretty kind of annoyed by how much they like run down their colleagues in in agric anthropology and archaeology. The social sciences how much they want to on them because they're a bunch of brainwashed rubes who have ignored all this evidence and schedule's like look. They all all this evidence has not been ignored. It's all been absorbed and a lot of the people are a lot of people have said a lot of the same stuff you're saying they just have not decided to create a flight of fancy to support a political project. But there's a quote here at the end. I want to read just the last paragraph of the of scheidel's review. Somebody asked where it's published. I think it's I think it's in a it's probably in a paywall journalistic or a scholarly document and of course you know. This is the problem we have with trying to square the circle of 

You know pop scholarly pursuit as political activism versus pursuit of the truth. Because these guys are trying to do a political thing and schedule is trying to make a a academic you know refined point and so they're doing different things. But I would say that I would say that on the the narrower question of like okay grab row you're doing this politically and god bless. You people should do this stuff. I think I do this stuff. I really do feel like stuff like hell of presidents and the thing I'm going to do about the the crisis of the 17th century. I really feel like. I'm trying to do the same thing grab grow is but because he's an anarchist because they're anarchists they're wrong.

Basically it boils down to that you know. It's like you're not wrong. You're just incorrect and that means I have to when reading it. Try to understand that so anyway this is scheidel's last paragraph where he after just like winding up by saying their big failure is that they reject material explanations. They delete they they reject technological. I mean they don't just they don't even reject them. They fail to integrate them into their analysis. Technology and and environment technology and ecology are invisible. They're not even engaged with.

They're. They're hand waved away and these are like the things that I'm sorry this. This is you can agree or disagree. Like this is where it's it. You can't merely make any kind of empirical argument. It is down to gut feeling these things either determine us in a significant way and something political flows from that like. It's not just an isolated fact that we can skip over. It is determining of our conditions and therefore determining our choices so we have to engage with it or. It's a big gross boogeyman that makes us all Basically their their idea is that the idea of determinism and materialism are what prevent us from doing effective activism. If we believed harder we would fix things like they literally think if you consider technology if you consider ecology you are submitting to the matrix and once again that is that is a question of like deep epistemology that cannot be resolved never will be resolved and can't you can just circle around them forever and that is what this has all been.

It's been me circling around my our like conflicting world views circling around each other like a little like a little atomic particle and then throwing off light in the form of these posts that you then absorb and then you can take from all of this whatever and apply it to your life aesthetically emotionally intellectually and hopefully practically. But anyway. This is the quote at the end of the end of the review that I thought really sums it up after saying like look you're just you're too idealism. You're doing too much idealism. It's not. It's not to somebody who needs to know it is not either persuasive and if it is persuasive it leads them in the wrong direction. Like that's where it boils down to like to somebody who has a different like as essential position. It's not gonna make me It's not gonna change my mind but for somebody who doesn't have that is just sort of unmoored intellectually but wants to do the right thing. It'll push you in the wrong direction.

So that's why it's a failure in both respects. Even though it's a very good books that people should read that is there you go. That is this is the contradiction at the heart of everything the fuels and powers everything. So this is scheidel's last paragraph. Their idealist purism traps graber and rain grow in a cage of their own making acknowledgment of materialist perspectives would have helped them draw more meaningful connections between past and present if it was their mobile lifestyle and hybrid mode of subsistence that made it easier for holocene foragers to step in and out of different forms of cooperation than it was for full-blown farmers who found themselves tied to their lands and crops. How do we compare do service economies. Digital tools and globalization hold out the promise of a new dawn materialism is not the enemy of historical understanding. It is essential to it nor is it the enemy of social activism. It might even be its best friend and even though he's coming from a different like political perspective than I i think scheidel and I have a very share a belief that you cannot act effectively off of faulty foundations if you're being motivated intellectually. Here's the thing like this is where we talk about how like the coalition of humanity is always a intraclass coalition. It's also a coalition of different types of minds.

There are people who need to be motivated intellectually to do something to act and you need to give them a an intellectual motivation and that's what this stuff is good for. But there are also people who don't need that who have an emotional connection to the good and want to push it and they just need to be told maybe where to go and the way they do that is talking it out with other people who have same combination of intellectual and emotional connections to the course of action of humans against the machine and for people who don't need to be intellectually convinced who don't who aren't operating. I should say differently they need to be intellectually convinced but their conviction doesn't rest on intellectual belief. It rests on a deeper foundation of emotional connection. Then this is just going to be like oh if I'm just a if. I'm a pixie. If I if I believe hard enough.

I can just imagine a way all of the chains of technology and ecology that have rendered me a fundamentally different subject than the people he's talking about. I do not have the. I don't have the the capacity to flee into the unknown to remake in wilderness that allowed all of the liberty that he describes in this book to accumulate and I will say though that if if graber was still alive and he read that schedule review he would probably challenge the guy to a duel because he was a prickly. When debt came out he basically went ham on anyone who said that it wasn't like perfectly accurate and I remember I read a crooked timber symposium on debt when it came out and all the articles were very respectful and all most of them said the book had a lot of real benefits and that it helped reframe a lot of their thinking on deep issues but that specifically there was a lot of alighting and there was a lot of sort of fudging and then they you know and some people and they had a lively debate like well. Does that really matter are we just talking semantics and it was a pretty good back and forth and the last the last blog post was going to be graber sort of responding and like they'd had these symposiums on crooked crooked timber as I webs is a blog in the old blog days. But I'm too.

I'm a million years old. But before twitter there were blogs and people would get together on blogs to talk about things and I got to say one of the things that has accelerated. Human insanity is that we got rid of the forums and blog culture that allowed people to self-segregate and now have been dumped on mass on the internet and we we don't have rules for it and it's driving us insane um and the last when they had these symposiums. The last culminating post would be by the author who would then respond to everybody and then they would have a debate or not a debate they would have you know a good faith. Discussion and grabber went on there and he just said. For I mean obviously not literally but in academic language like in in the incredibly cozy language of of academia which all those people who were writing were part of he just went like ham on them.

He went beast mode and it's It's very funny that to imagine him responding to that review because he would not take it kindly um but I feel like that's a very similar thing you've got a lot of great detail in that book um. I think in that book the the fudging is different and better because his cumulative argument is. I think more persuasive about you know america wielding debt as you know the basic framework for domination of the economy of of of global capitalism but of course you know it. It doesn't have the greater framework is wrong but anyway. It's a that's another interesting book that is once again like spackled over with a lot of fancy. But there is a fundamental problem with arguing like a debt jubilee would bring back bring human you know autonomy back because again if we can't farm for ourselves. If we can't fend for ourselves. We are constrained in a way that other people you're imagining wouldn't be.

 somebody else asked about guns germs and steel and I feel like that's. Another book in this. This kind of bucket where it's like worth reading and I think worth reading to break up what I said earlier the sort of off-handed unthought through cliches about history that you still carry around in your head because there's tons of straw mans in everything everywhere all the time the dawn of everything um the straw men are everywhere but like they could argue well okay. Sure academics know all this stuff but the general public doesn't and it's like yeah. But I mean the the general public doesn't have doesn't know much you know. The general public is is pretty. There's not a lot in their head. There's not a lot of space in their head devoted to you know understanding early humanity. There's just a few big cliches and because you know this stuff accrues over time and is communicated like first in academia then into the greater culture. Then into just sort of folk understanding. Like that is a long-term process so yeah like a lot of the a lot of the notions that people who even do have concepts about the deep past which isn't that many people a lot of people don't have anything there.

It's completely empty. The shelf is empty those who do have outdated ones so you're breaking up concentrate like mental kidney stones and I'd say that guns germs and steel because it thinks in terms of deep causes that it rips human life away from the narrative of autonomy that that animates the liberal understanding of the self and of history. That's good because I would say that that is the big. Those are the biggest kidney stones and the ones that nestle like enough russian doll all the other misconceptions about like human civilization who we are how we got here the value of human life. What we should be doing with. It are around a narrativized understanding of human life that centralizes autonomy and will because that's how you get the the vast majority of people in the western world totally fine with a horrifyingly unequal social regime that sees people starving in the billions amidst un conceivable plenty.

It's because they have it coming it's because they are morally calpable and if your understanding of history is a narrativized collection of individual decisions by people and groups. Then you have a narrative that makes it their fault if you understand it though. In these terms then the the the judgment disappears the moral distinction disappears and you just have people all of whom deserve exactly what all the other of them do at the exact same amount and honestly. These guys are too fully committed to anarchist moralism and liberal moralism to to make the connection but if you accept this another thing you can take from it is well I guess the the native americans were pretty good. You know they were able to vibe but humans just let this happen to them and at the end of the day it's the fault of those who will who refuse to change their minds okay. So that was the book we'll have a little chat next week. I'll I'll tease it now. I think we're going to go with leo panitch's making of global. Capitalism got to get a copy of that don't own one. But I like I like to get the i. I have I've done audio books. But I've gotten to the point. I know. I've done kindle. It's so convenient but there's something about having a physical copy. That's more um reassuring but anyway but maybe not. I will confirm it next week like. I said probably wednesday so take it sleazy.
