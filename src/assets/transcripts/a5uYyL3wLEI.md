I do not want to start listening. I should know how to get things out of here that shark bites with his teeth bait that keeps some pearly white just a jackknife as old mac heather and I keep sit out of sight you know where that shot bites with his teeth babe. Scarlet billows start to spread fancy gloves though as old mac heath bay so there's never never a trace of red just using life eat and now my heat spends just like a sailor. Is it me our boys done something rash diver hey. Ho. It's such a tordry oh miss laura linda and oh lucy brown yes. They're blind forms on the right babe now that mackie's mack the knife by as performed by bobby darren but originally kurt vile song based on berto breck lyrics from the three penny opera who doesn't love weimar culture h . Someone says that they are coming back to the streams after checking out for a while should.

I how should you go back and look at anything else. I would say the last four or so. I feel like. I'm kind of getting somewhere and that a lot of the stuff that I've said in the last couple of days. I'm hoping to work together to be part of the book that I'm in the process of putting together. So. I would. I would recommend those but I figured today. I'm just going to chill because I've been running a little hot. I want to cool off the the old motors but I still wanted to you know check in because I won't be able to stream tomorrow. So and maybe talk things out maybe by talking to you. People decide what book to do next so we can get ready get to reading it but no real agenda beyond just saying hi.

This is of course why I am wearing the hawaiian shirt to indicate this is sort of a changes of attitude changes in latitude style episode We're gonna have a cheeseburger in paradise. We're going to waste away again in in matthew christmanville searching for our last vial of dmt. Some people say that it's low low way but I don't but it's my own damn fault. I don't know if I've ever said this on stream before but. I went to the um the jimmy buffett's margaritaville restaurant on the las vegas strip. A few years ago was not where I would have wanted to have dinner that's for sure. It was just got in late and it was inconvenient to eat anywhere else and so. I figured all right I'll order the cheeseburger at margaritaville. The cheeseburger in paradise is over and I got it and my god a more mediocre burger. I could not conceive of sort of almost platonically mediocre and I'm sorry but you're. It's the cheeseburger in paradise come on man come on man how about we get some action on that joe biden.

Since we're not going to get anything else. We're literally. I hope everyone is ready for this. I hope everybody is prepared to get nothing else from these. administration going oh my god it might maybe. They are fdr all over again because they just cut a check that by that trump would have cut. I think I i honestly feel like everyone has been sort of negligent including myself in pointing out during that whole. Argument about like how radical this was how much of a departure from neoliberalism or obama. It was that those checks would have gotten cut by trump if he'd want they're the same checks that trump already cut before the checks that would have been bigger. If the democrats had not interfered with them now. I don't know if anybody remembers this because it's time to move you know the news moves at the speed of of light now but nancy. Pelosi sandbagged a deal that would have delivered checks and relief. Before the 2020 election. This needs to be stressed. She admitted it and the logic was very simple a big check before the election guarantees that trump will win and the thing is she might have been. Right and so everybody who is rooting against trump and that includes leftists who hate democrats have to ask themselves. was doing that on behalf of a biden presidency was that worth the extra suffering that happened the deaths. Let's not put too fine a point on it. People died because those checks were late.

I don't does anyone deny that could anybody deny that because the idea that austerity and lapses in like redistribution of income to where to where it's needed as opposed to where it's accumulated like that active redistribution of income saves lives and that the loss of it loses it like how many thousands of people has have has the labor party accurately or at least the corbonite labor party accurately. How many people were estimated to have died because of the brutal austerity that britain did after after the um after the economic collapse much more austere than america. I mean obviously obama didn't do a lot and obama codified you know the mass theft of homes through through the dispossession of the people who were the victims not the perpetrators of the financial crime in order to pay back the criminals. But in terms of just redistribution. There was stimulus the brits did no stimulus because they had a bigger welfare state to start with. They just started cutting it and hundreds of thousands of people are claimed and were claimed by the labor by the corbyn's labor to have been killed by austerity and I think that logic holds. People are on a knife's edge in countries like this where you are disciplined with poverty with not just like deprivation but inability to support your own life.

Because you can't go out into the woods you can't sustain yourself. You don't have the skills you don't have the access to land to subsist you're at the mercy of the market. If the market doesn't have something for you to do that it wants to enumerate you with money. For that. You have no alternative but to actually fall towards being kicked out of the system being turned into a post-apocalyptic subject like we talked about about how the apocalypse is here like you could have been kicked out of early early capitalist systems and fallen out of urban environments in in like the medieval era. But the possibility of subsistence existed like skills existed. It would have been dangerous and you probably would have died but there would have been at least a idea of viability of a lifestyle to be kicked out of the market now with no skills no access to land no social networks. This is to be a post-apocalyptic subject. This is to be somebody living in the aftermath of the climate collapse. We're all terrified of or the nuclear war that the that the cold war was supposed to result. In any of those apocalypses. The survivors are live. They the lives that you fear happening to your kids or to yourself when you're older are happening right now to people who have fallen out of the market relationship and that means that the things that sustain you immediately go away like access to medical care access to basic nutrition. access to housing and the inherent stability provided by that so people are on a knife's edge at all times. In this country. More money means people are more stable less likely to be pushed overboard into an overdose into some sort of reckless act that causes injury or death into not being able to deal with a medical condition or getting one imposed on you by your exposure to the elements without being able to sustain yourself.

So we have to say that happened to people because of the tactical decision of pelosi and the democrats not to make a deal. Now you have to ask yourself when you try to condemn that because I saw a lot of lefting left-wing people condemning pelosi for doing that before the election. But these were the same left-wing people who had said either to themselves or publicly that as bad as the democrats are. It was important. That trump loses that they were hoping but biden won that they voted for biden that they were invested in a biden victory if that's the case then. I'm sorry nancy. Pelosi did the right thing she sacrificed those people to get the democrats in now.

If the bill that the republicans passed in the face of that resistance and only after they lost. The election would probably would have would have definitely passed before the election without the democrats and would probably have passed in a similar form to the way it passed after the election now maybe not as big because you know now they don't have to get reelected but the momentum and trump's position on that and investment in it. I think would have gotten something done and also just let's not forget the need to provide some sort of keynesian stimulus at the demand level just to keep the wheels moving like they blew through they blow in the pinwheel as much as they think they need to keep it going and that would have been necessitated there. At the bottom of that point. It might not have been as big but it would have been similar. I think and so we got a trump size. A late trump size recovery bailout for the people we got money into the system at the point of of paychecks and if we don't get anything else. Then what was the point of all that suffering that was caused which by the way also does long-term damage to the brand of the democrats and the ability of the democrats to actually be a vessel for positive change which is the implicit under assumption that under gerd's support for the democratic party right.

But that does it's not blame anybody for wanting biden to win. I wanted biden to win because I was sick of the whole tenor relative to the material conditions which meant that it wasn't going to snap towards some sort of popular revolt. It was going to snap towards some sort of just to further ratcheting up into oblivion. I mean if it the snap might come like later but in the near term is just hearing this persistent din just and as a guy who's doing a show. I just was sick of talking about the concept of him being president. It was it had reached to for me. It's it's comedic potential and I honestly do believe especially and I said this before the election. I predict. I will say. I'm not a very good at predicting things and I've owned that now finally but one thing. I do say that I predicted accurately is when I said before the election that if biden won it's it was going to be because people just wanted to turn the volume down on the tv. A little bit that only that not a smaller percentage of people were interested in some sort of political ragnarok.

Some sort of genuine confrontation. They weren't ready for it because things were too good for them and when you look at what won the election for biden who voted for him. It's clear that that's what happened. We are of course in a situation where people are more precarious than ever in america. We are seeing a political breakdown caused by the nervous breakdown of the the white yeoman. The white or not or of the middle class american like yeoman who had been bought off since the first expropriation of native lands to now and now the buying off is going away and so precarity is being felt. But the people who are feeling that least in the electorate white suburban college educated people are the ones who shifted in the largest numbers to biden. Trump saw his percentage and share and raw number of votes. Among more about people who did not make did not go to college go up significantly and is and he did gain in working class. latino households. He gained big time along the rio grande which is a heavily latino area he even made small inroads in in in the black vote because for the people for whom this is aesthetic for whom they don't really want to see anything really change in the system. There is no appetite for this sort of political confrontation that trump's persistence in office would have necessitated the same way that the persistence of sectoria sectoral political emotion is what tipped the balance towards civil war in the 1860s because the civil war in it was not.

 was not the product of an economic crisis that needs to be remembered. It preceded a fundamental crisis between the two modes of production. At that point there was still a a relatively smooth machinery connecting southern plantain plantation slavery to northern finance and and foreign export. Like the The looms of manchester were kept moving with southern cotton that was moved through northern finance comp financiers that that that that got the the cotton to new york and then got it to manchester it worked but there were contradictions within it that were going to reach a critical point at a critical material point at the point when the accumulation of entropy in the system exceeds. the technological and social advances that that ameliorate that um that entropy but we hadn't reached that point. Yet it was a political conflict and right. Now the thing militating against all language of civil conflict and collapse is the remaining cargo that we're all fighting over right now because america still is in terms of its standard of consumption and living comfortable. They have achieved to a greater degree than almost anybody in human in the in the human family. Right.

Now the dream that the collective dream that we are all imprisoned. By now. Now the capitalism is a world system. There can now only be one view of heaven. There can only be one view of the world as it should be sought. There can be only one understanding of the cosmos one vision of happiness vision of heaven vision of peace and that is where one in which all all difficulty is amused by convenience. All difficulty in life is ameliorated by a access to convenience and of course convenience is bought at the cost of massive exploitation of all living resources humans of course but even as technology. replaces human inputs into the system that exacerbates the the exploitation and oppression of the biome that is carried out by capitalism and sheer waste. Of course you people saw the video of them smashing new laptops and phones in a in a british amazon. warehouse imagine the human misery that goes into the production of one of those machines. One of those laptops you guys probably are aware of this if you're on here if you're on here trying to exercise the political ghost from your body. If you're if you're watching this stream you know what goes into your small your smartphones and your laptops in terms of what physically goes into them. Sure there's they're manufactured in the end state in factories in asia which are you know essentially. Modern sweatshops sure but far more horrifying than that is that there are precious metals within these machines that that can only be accessed in regions of the world that are the the the end point of colonial plunder.

The the end extraction point the the civil the the contours of the cold war. I would say the the the whole wars of the 20th century. The the conflict between capital and humanity that defined the 20th century and was won by capital the civil. The second the the second world war and then cold war eras was a as a civil war amongst humanity over who was going to be eating. For the next hundred years what way the human centipede of progress was going to be pointed and the winner was the people who weaponize capitalism into a into a national and then civilizational weapon a tool of domination of other systems of economic life other systems of social life. it was the it was as nile saver ferguson called it in one of his dumb books the killer app like the stuff that created modern capitalism the soil the capitalism was built in which was a medium state con medium state conflict in a context of technological innovation and restrained in christ and a restraint of resources and and dis and flows of like trade and stuff.

The ferment of early modern europe and renaissance europe especially after the black death which had come along to wipe away all of the contradictions that had been accumulated by feudalism because feudalism had reached. I think. I don't think not enough of is made of this is that the point that um the black death hit europe feudalism had reached its terminal and its terminal point of of contra of internal contradiction. It had become completely frozen. It could not respond to conditions you had in pre-plague europe. You had this malthusiasm malthusian pressure. of of population growth you had deflation of the currency you had a a breakdown of trade networks. You had a a liquidity crisis. Essentially there was no way to facilitate trade and that's because the social forums were un not amenable to what capitalism necessitated which was the introduction of relationships of estrangement of social estrangement that were not conceivable by the feudal world because the feudal world necessitated these social bonds. The thing that kept so feudalism together was not authoritarianism from the top. There was not enough technologically exertable power at the top of feudalism to do that nobody had enough power to assert their will. Individually. It was a bunch of people with swords with sticks what they had was social technology that is the bonds of family clan religion that gave people a investment in the outcome of the social project even if they were getting. By it even if they were serfs the thing that kept them from rebelling and of course some of them would and when conditions got worse in parts of europe. Some of them would rebel and you'd have a peasants revolt.

You'd have a bunch of people massacred but it those are the punctuations that move you forward to resolve your to resolve the political problems inherent in your mode of production but by by the the eve of the black death europe was completely stagnated. Feudalism had reached its terminal crisis and that's when malthus intervened in the form of the black death. Now the flip side of this and the reason that malthus is not an a complete description of reality and why it is almost always pointless to bring up. Malthus is that malthus did not take into account that technological response to crisis that a civilization as opposed to just a bunch of wild animals can come up with things like the green revolution things like antibiotics for a while. I mean eventually they'd all work but you know in a near term. They do get. They they fix some of these malthusian questions. But there was no sufficient technology that had been you know brought to bear at least in europe by the developments of slave society and then feudalism that. Had happened up until that point to accommodate this crisis so it was solved by malthus and in the form of the black death 50 of the population gone social.

Bonds were literally uprooted by the hand of god and the people who were left were in a condition where land was much more bountiful. Labor was much scarcer which meant that the deal that the peasants could strike for their labor became destabilizing to the author to the rule. Peasants who could have access to land independent of your ability to coerce them which existed after the black death necessitated a change in social relationships. It necessitated a new the ability to coerce outside of social bonds outside of like a religious understanding something estranged to a market mechanism that transcends all human relationships and that be replaces god and so that system wasn't going to sustain itself if it had persisted. What would have happened is that the the ruling class would have been explorated by the peasantry because the numbers game would have kicked in and eventually they would have said what the do we need you for our self-organizing. Like urban and rural communes are using the mutual aid networks that were implicit and inherent and unspoken in a bonded social order that feudalism represented we can just imagine manage this. fancy frilly outfits and your castles oh. It's because so you guys can all fight it out over control. We never have any say in it so what happened is that the ruling class the ruling. The ruling feudal elite to protect their near-term interests destroyed their long-term interests. Because short-termism is the endemic vocabulary of of of a crisis. There is no long-term so you only think short-term and that's what the feudal lords did and they they they sustained and they allowed for the creation of this merchant culture. In the cities.

Protestantism was like gasoline on the fire of that they let this happen because they were in a contest for power with other powers and by that point you had stable states a stable state system especially after west failure at the end of the 30 years war that creates a situation where all right you have fixed environments now you're going to compete over resources. There is no superseding authority god cannot help you. This is pure might and the only way to win that fight is to be more efficient and the only way to be more efficient is to replace the the the the local and the temporally fixed social life and imagination and culture and economy of the feudal order and replace it with a de-personalized alienated fish rep symbolic economy. You take the rule that was that persisted in the in the symbols of religion. The cross the and replace it with the symbol of currency of exchange of the market and that is the transition you kill god and replace it with the market because the market becomes the thing we all actually worship. It's the only thing that actually motivates us and it is unlike god totally alienated from man as it has to be to facilitate this level of exploitation.

The level of exploitation that would allow you to say to get back to the laptops they destroyed in england that the horrifying spear point exploitation that is no different than primitive accumulation under in the iron age of putting guns to people's neck and making them dig metal out of the ground. The same way that slaves did in italy 2000 year tradition technology and culture and refinement and all the better angels that steve pinker talks about none of them exists. There. There's been no progress because that point of maximal exploitation has never been alleviated. The buddha's never come off the neck but that that happens so abstracted from us the levels of responsibility are so far from us our sense of responsibility as beneficiaries within a system that pulls that out of the ground in africa through the accumulated hyper-exploited slave misery of people that pain goes into that work that labor the labor that has to be slave labor because you there is not enough money you could pay someone to have them do it and they have to do it that way to make it profitable to do. Otherwise you have to use technology and technology costs money as long as you can buy human labor at the work at the price of somebody holding a gun and not somebody actually doing the work because you can pay somebody a hell of a lot less to stand around with a gun.

Then you would have to pay somebody to go into a hole and dig out the computer that was produced by that kind of lit horror if they felt it all responsible for it and at no point of the system that allows for that thing to be made and then smashed has anyone had had to interact with it. If they were in the pit with the person if they were watching they would have to come to terms with it. They would either become the guy with the gun or they would fight on behalf of the person being forced. You would have to do one or the other if you sat there. Next to that long enough you would have to do one or the other but the reason that this thing is going to kill the earth is because every scream is going unheard the scream of the earth. The scream of the thing are all unheard because there is no one who is there in the room to hear them the person in the room hearing that the guy holding the gun in that room he's got bigger. Problems man his choices are being at this end or being at the other end and when you have that choice of course that's the one you're gonna make but you comfortable beneficiary of this product. You you don't have that relationship to that moment you've been civilized your distance from violence and exploitation your distance from power and it's and the exercise of power has made it so that you get to enjoy the benefits of these things without considering the cost and the system continues producing these outcomes the carrying capacity of earth through mass through microwaving of the atmosphere.

None of those are being counted. No one is thinking about them when they make a decision because that is on somebody else because like I said when you're in the room with the most powerful people in the world. There's one person in the room like elijah sitting at the edge of the table who isn't actually there and that is capital and what that means is that you abdicate within capitalism. All responsibility to capitalism which means capital is responsible for all of it which means hey if I benefit from my relationship to this system and I get to sup at the at its teeth. I get to live life where I don't have to dig for my existence where I don't have to provide alienating painful labor or I don't have to spend time in my body. Uncomfortably. I can do that but then I don't but I don't have to extract it directly from somebody else oh my god who wouldn't take that deal because it's their. It's the fault of the the of the market. The market's making us do this and that's what libertarians mean when they say that that's what liberty means because they are spiritually dead. But they've been they have been spiritually lobotomized by capitalism. They recognize a situation where because capitalism does at the end of the day enforce itself on people people do not exert their force on it. Therefore freedom cannot be possible under capitalism. libertarians basically say yes but you can create a system where some people we're all you can create a situation where culturally all of the people who are benefiting from us thanks to technology all of the people who are benefiting from the dividing of earth into two spheres exploiters and exploited where the misery of the one becomes more and more and the luxury and decadence.

The other becomes more and more you can make a situation where the political concept of a human person only applies to people who benefit from the system and that is a situation where yes you're pursuing maximal liberty because the people who will be ground into disgusting the people are going to be ground into dog food by the system by the division of people into the exploiter in the exploited class they don't count they're not really supposed to be. Here they have failed in the meritocratic contest of the market and really that is what all strains of liberalism broadly defined meaning conservativism meaning fascism yes meeting fascism meaning um meaning left liberalism as we understand it like the the the vocabulary of the left online and in culture of social liberalism girded to capitalism. All of them have the same logic which is that you're going to in the future create a situation where there is maximal hyper exploitation in your face on the very other side of maximal decadence and it's going to be enforced by a regime of technology and market relationships and that that is going to be it and you don't have to actually do the exploiting but you have to watch the machines will do the exploiting you have to watch and if you're okay with it if you feel okay with it and you've created a situation where everybody feels okay with it. Then you have created a system of maximal personal liberty.

The anarchist dream the anarchist dream the libertarian dream. The dream of fully luxurated fully automated luxury whatever you want to call it communism heaven on earth. Everyone free everyone free from market coercion everybody able to exercise their own desires in life free of any friction why because friction has been taken up by everybody outside the bubble but you have to be okay with it and that's what libertarianism strives to do create a system where the people who count as people don't care. They think it's good. They think it's the world working itself out as it should be the left alternative to this and it's the only one the bar. It's the socialism to that barbarism is the competing argument that we can get to that point. We can get to that point where we're all free in a way that everybody living in the system would understand themselves to be free free to live free to explore ourselves in our time and life. Free of the friction of the coercion.

Because of the provision of of a bounty now is that possible in the near term hell no not even the medium term but as like a long term like the way kim stanley. Robinson imagines it or even longer. It's certainly possible but it would have its basis in a political movement that overthrows this notion and replaces it with a bedrock human solidarity as like a religious as in believed in with the power of religion to counteract the belief that is the to the power of metaphysical in money that currently rules a counter-hegemonic value system. Because it's spiritual we talk about how it's it. capitalism is has killed god. It has replaced god it is spiritual people fight for capitalism with the with their spirit as much as right. Now. They don't have to do much but kind of watch everything because the system is running technologically and technocratically but that's going to change with time as conditions deteriorate and the the violence is going to get more on our face. It's going to be harder to look away from and we're going to have to decide whether to be participants and which side we're going to be participants on and what's going to motivate people to pick the side of capital even though they think it's race or they think it's They think that it's religion because they're all evangelical christians.

 they think it's rational. They think that it's logical. It's all it's a holy war. It's a holy war on behalf of capital where where there is no human community. Humanity doesn't exist. I am the only thing that exists. We are all competing gods without any ability to humble oneself in front of the other for fear of being destroyed because the social the the metaphysical connection does not transcend our separateness. That's the underlying assumption and it is a religious one because it's not scientific. It's not rational. It is religious it was created by capitalism. It is forged from capitalism relations social relations and it will be not defeated from within like all like.

I say this is why we have to disengage emotionally. If we can't otherwise from the meaning behind our current culture war. There is no way to fight this war and be on a side helpfully you can try to convince yourself. Yes. These specific issues are are a distraction but you have used to have to use the opportunity to like critically like popular front critically support and I'm not saying. It's like gonna hurt anything to do it that it's just gonna make you. It's harder for you to do anything that matters because what you are doing is by feeding this thing on any side of it and that means if you're doing like critical support for you know we need to talk we need to support critical race theory right now because it's under attack from these anti-democratic white supremacists. We have to talk about this stuff all the time or if you're saying we need to fight them we need to we need to purge we need to expose the fake corporate global homo left and their adherence to this cynical culture war so that they can so that we can reassert class politics you're not reasserting class politics. You're reaffirming the general brand of petty bourgeois reaction national capitalism. That's all that you're doing those are the two sides and you're just providing. you're providing the the actual content that makes up this spectacle to replace the actual energy being displaced within the political system itself um oh man. This was supposed to be a chill one. I was supposed to be chill today. How about join an anti-imperialist anti-racist organization go for it. I don't. I would never begrudge anybody any active thing that they want to do because I'm not in their position. I don't know I have nothing. I have no actual advice that I would feel comfortable giving on any question of what someone should do in their life to contribute to their political identity because it's not my life. I've I thought about this today.

I was I was thinking about how one of the real problems one of the real difficulties in trying to create a a cultural force around like explicit left social critique left politics is that because we have replaced our individual social lives with this sort of transcendent public space that includes like the entire country in some respect some percentage or another even though it's of course wildly distorted to be urban and like young and professional like that's that's the that's the demographic of the people who are doing most of this tweeting the people who make up the culture of it. That's and that's because that's who makes that's who generates the bulk of consumption of all culture is that what more well off one way or the other and the younger of the two like if you want to break down demographics as those two axes younger and wealthier. That is who is traditionally the The audience for entertainment now that entertainment used to be largely the product of a centralized professional process. Hollywood movies television networks then then cable that kind of stuff books published by authors. Things that people watched read engaged with newspapers magazines now thanks to changes in technology thanks to change in social relationships.

We live in a time when that when a big chunk of that media space that entertainment space has been replaced by us watching each other us using technology social media specifically to watch each other and the thing about that is that that isn't much cheaper for capital investment because you don't have to actually produce anything you just have to perform you just have to create the platform so for like silicon valley. This is perfect like they don't have to worry about creating an infrastructure that's old-fashioned that's the forest economy we can't afford that anymore lol we cannot afford the forest model we cannot afford labor peace. We have to maximally exploit labor we have to minimize costs because the background all of this rate of profit is declining so they're going to. And so we're going to spend more time and we also of course all of us because we're getting more self-absorbed because there's nobody else to care about because we spend all our time alone. Of course we only want to see ourselves. We don't know anybody else. We can't feel confident and comfortable around anybody else. Everybody else is becomes a less real in a fundamental way. They become less real to us. We take over that reality. We take over that place that used to be for other people people that you spent time with and that's where there are like our political. is that that's what this is That's what all politics media is. It's part of this new form of entertainment. It is a genre of entertainment. It is not any kind of countercultural object outside of capitalism that can challenge it meaningfully but as I said there is no replacing for most people. Realistically the day-to-day experience of depending on this infrastructure because it has replaced vital parts of us. We are now cyborgs so we do not.

We can't say thing for that's the dvd that that um david foster wallace predicted and he was just a little too old to get it to get it right because he didn't have the imagination for it because the internet hadn't emerged. Yet it was you did that in the mid 90s people thought the internet was going to be virtual reality for sake in infinite. Jest if anyone's read it there is this dvd basically that if you watch it it's so entertaining you'll die you will not do anything else. You will just waste away watching it and it's used as a terror weapon by these quebec separatists and we've created that it's just. It's the internet. We have created a way to amuse ourselves to death. It's the internet but one of the consequences of we get us getting to a point where something like the entertainment is. Possible means that we have given over a significant percentage of our souls in that parts of ourselves that form our identity from the internet because we spend so much time there and even if we all decide tomorrow to stop we have spent so much time there.

That time spent there doesn't just go off you're not just wasting it you are reinforcing emotional relationships you are reinforcing. You are having memories that are suffused with emotional connections to certain phenomena. Certain things you saw certain things you liked or didn't like things you said things you read. Experiences are being had. They're simulacrum of experiences but they have real emotional effects that linger physically that form your understanding of the world and there and that they're accumulating in a thin gruel. It is like it's. It's very nutrient light but that's why we get. Sick we're spiritually malnourished by this but it still is feeding us and we cannot get rid of it completely because we have nothing to replace it with. So we have to wean ourselves not necessarily ever hoping to be totally broken free because then that creates the anxiety around. I'm ever going to actually get there. I think if you accept that you're always going to be somewhat connected to online just because of the necessities of the fact that we live in a world created by and for people who are that far from each other you need it how you deal use. It is the question and so everybody who has a role within this system there. If there is a responsibility to be had as in a thing that will make them feel better about doing it not a thing that's being imposed from without a thing that's being imposed from within like. If you do it it'll make you feel better. If you don't do it.

You will feel worse you might try to convince yourself that it's something else. That's the problem you might try to convince yourself actually. No the reason I'm not happy is because I haven't achieved x yet then. I will. This is not dissatisfaction from the fact that I'm doing something that isn't helpful. This is instead just the discontent of not getting a full filament of my final perfect state such as being totally taken away or totally detached from the internet. a totalizing state an eschaton you can try but you need to be replacing as you wean and that means you have to search yourself as you break free if you're not feeling satisfied where does the dissatisfaction really come from realizing that if any anything is formulated around the internet any emotional connections. There any any level where that is providing you with an excuse for why you don't feel good. Then you can examine and sort of detach and look under a microscope at where that's coming from and then hopefully neutralize the the thing that's pulling you away from your instincts about what you should be doing like.

That's the thing. The hope of socialism is the hope that through the creation through the the breaking of the wheel of history and the reef the resettling of it and then like a new blueprint working from that. Over time you will create a situation where social relationships are such that the vast majority of people who are born and when I say people I mean human. national polity. Every person within that system is self-policed to a large extent by a commitment to that system because it benefits them they feel the benefit. Now the faith of capital is that that's not possible that that kind of that that sort of social relationship is unattainable because of the metaphysical reality of human separation that you can't create a social order that runs on belief in itself. Now we have for a fact we know for a fact that's not true though from human civilization. We know that there are bonds that can be that can transcend the self sufficient to police a group of people and sometimes a significant number of them. But it's conflict with other people that generates the disruption of that only. Once you get past the point of there. Being other people can you get back to that point but it's possible and it's not imposed by pain and oppression and and propaganda. It is seeing in your life the benefits of the social arrangement having good experiences that you ascribe to the social arrangement and therefore when you think should. I do this thing or that thing the thing making that decision is a sense of self that is encompassing outside of the self.

So we know it's possible for people to live that way and then we just have to get to a point where our understanding of human is all-encompassing and our degree of technological and our of our degree of technological advancement. Both social and physical material the material reality of like labor-saving technology and like algorithmic replacing of like economic functions to increase efficiency because capitalism is defined by this massive inefficiency that's going to be the thing that destroys us it. It it creates efficiency but does not create alienation and that was the problem with actually existing socialism in the 20th century is that it created alienation because people were still being alienated from their labor. They were still employees who did not control the end product of their labor because that was being defined as a consumption and they didn't have anything to consume. They were in competition with the west. They had to tighten their belts and then. Khrushchev tried to compete with the united states on the question of consumption and failed. We talked about this a couple days ago you have to create a situation where the social benefits of the social order. Not just that it keeps a roof over your head that it gives you a sense of life that is unalienated that gives you a sense of control of your choices without there being a the din of like a like the tyranny of capitalist choice where every choice is the wrong one because you're gonna get things are only gonna get worse and you're going to be and you're just going to miss you're going to feel bad about the choice. You didn't make you're going to be able to make free choices and a system like that people would provide their own policemen but in the in the fucoian sense but not on behalf of capital or of a ruling class on behalf of everybody.

So we know that's possible the question is can we push through it progressively through capitalism into socialism and the most important thing though the thing that really makes it that really makes the choice between these clear and why nobody of any kind of clear heart or mind can pick. capitalism is that if you assume that capitalism is correct in that belief and it is a belief because you're talking about a metaphysical question that cannot be defined that you're just deciding at a certain point. You're going to give up asking the questions and decide that that's reality and that's what rationalism that's what enlightenment that's what liberalism is going to create a total alienation of the spirit from life and the replacement with belief in self. Even if if that is the only way humans can live and therefore you should support capitalism and hope you get lucky enough to end up on the right side of the of the dam and that you stay in the middle and if you're an american hey and if you're listening to this you might actually have a good chance at that. Not most of you won't of course and that's the whole thing the vast majority will fall into the mouth of the mon the lion but it won't matter as long as some make it through as long as some make it through that's going to keep a lot of people believing in it. Even if you end up. There you end up you end up in elysium. You end up living in your little fully automated luxury space space jam on the other side of the glass watching remember being at that point has alienated you from who you are like all of these liberals.

All these all these woke liberals who want to use meritocracy shorn of racial guilt as the metric for who win lives and who dies. That's they want meritocracy as much as um as the right does. The only difference is what they think merit means do. They think that merit comes from the do. They think that merit comes from the earth in the form of bloodlines like that's the right way these are both. These are just this is just a split within liberalism remember. This is just a split in the enlightenment the right. The whole right says that the the the line here this the the define the thing that divides humanity into the into the winners and losers the the mr th those who are made miserable and those who feast upon their misery is the land. It's it's the blood. It is nature's distribution. The cat that god's hand being cast whoever rules should rule the liberal argument that splits off from this and that has become the non-socialist left too is no no we make this choice we as humans get to decide well. How do you decide if we're making the decision. If god the world. The actual settled conditions don't make it who makes it well. Then we make it how do we make it there's no metric that works. There's no metric that a person who is making that decision is going to choose to be on the other side. No one will and remember the people making the drawing the line are by definition.

The people who are being benefiting this is what a capitalist superstructure is. It is a culture made by the people who benefit from exploitation. Yes. They are exploited too many of them but they feel like they benefit they feel connected to it. They feel power they're empowered if they didn't have the power to write the documents and to create the laws and to enforce them. They wouldn't be able to and that power comes from feeling like they're benefiting from a social arrangement. So they're always going to draw themselves on the line of the angels and that line the only one that you can draw. Is you have the right opinions you have the right spirit. You have the right soul. You are good good and bad. It's the only way good and bad boil down to it. Good and bad how do you determine who is good and bad there's two axes.

There's the axis of who do we need to be able to actually staff this government who are we going to need to be able to provide the human element of labor that is necessary to keep this thing going and also um who has done good or bad things in life and so one axis of that is just the the the vocabulary of of desert theory that undergirds liberalism. We have capitalism and if you do well you are rewarded you do poorly. You are punished of course that's actually just nature grinding through the world. That's not any kind of that's not anyone's fault. No one deserves to be punished for this. It's gonna determine whether or not you can us live and and on the moral side of this question of good. It's because it's are you.

A good person in two ways are you useful. That's where the meritocracy part comes in get. Those. let's make sure that the sat isn't racially biased we still need the s.a.t. We still need a system of higher education to identify the most abstractly gifted students who can then perform the knowledge work at the headquarters of capitalism like we need to um. We still need these people and we need to have a way to find them. So that's why we need things like higher education. We need things like standardized tests but we don't want to feel bad about it. We want it to be purely dispassionate. We want it to be the market. We don't want it to be us so that means we have to make them non-racist sats non-racist tests of course that's still determining people based on the luck of the abilities they have and if you don't luck into those abilities you're. Now what la racial liberalism does is. It says no no a lot of those people at the bottom are only there because darn it of the racism of these bad white people. So therefore I get to stay on the good side because now I deserve to be there because of my abilities and also I would sacrifice some portion of other white people on this side of the of the line to bring in more unjustly persecuted and objectively oppressed black people and then we will all together thrive but of course. Once you draw the line right once you've created the schmitty. An exception in law which is where we're headed one way or the other whichever of these two wins unless something else breaks the conflict when that draw lawn gets drawn. The people who are gonna.

Mis get immiserated are going to be a combination of people for whom it's just sad they're the legacy of racism and it's top. It's not fair that they're there. But there's nothing to be done about it and the people who are being punished righteously for making that happen it's your fault. This is your fault white people and you get to feel like a good white for condemning the whites well just shrugging at the economic necessity of condemning the non-whites and so that is why if there is no if that is the end point if if we have gone past the point when socialism metaphysically understood can can cut have have actually coherently break into that conflict and destabilize it turn it from a two-way war into a three-way war. If that doesn't happen at the level of politics the the the the final war will just be about who suffers will it be those who have been decreed by the by history to suffer those who suffer now or will there be an attempt to reorientate the laser beam. The death ray to take in others of course. The main thing that is up need to be stressed here is that the admiseration is total no matter what everybody the vast majority of people are going to get ground into jerky but because we'll be consuming this through the lens of culture. What we're going to see is either one triumphing or the other but neither one will be triumphing because everyone will be mutually being dissolved. It will be cannibals all until there's only the little b band of rulers who will then drive each other insane and themselves insane with their captivity and emptiness because what will they have had to be what will they have had to do to themselves to be in a position to watch that happen and be okay with it.

The movie that gets this better than anything I hate to no. I love to to draw a pop culture comparison because watch this movie after listening to this and you will get what I'm saying conceptually zardoz The h.g. Wells is time machine but but with the emphasis that the eloy do not live in heaven. The eloy's heaven is destroyed by the neuroses of those who are within it the people who are going to survive this coming. Culling at the rights on the right end of the glass are going to be unable to sit with themselves. For even a second. They will be so wracked with neuroses and horror and self-observed obsession. They will be so infused with their own isolation. They will be so lonely they will be so convinced of their own metaphysical solipsism and they will be so unable to reconcile the concept of their own death. More than anything they will be unable to reconcile death because they will not be able to imagine anything existing outside of their consciousness because they have made their consciousness in every sense. The only reality a social life. One of the things it does is. It allows us to live in a world beyond our own minds. Parts of our minds are in the minds of others and we know that like we have mutual experiences we fuse at the level of emotional connection and that means that our minds expand beyond ourselves well.

Whatever is going to get you to the end of The zardoz world whatever spiritual mutilation you do to yourself or you've been acculturated to just by where you grew up is going to consume you internally because you will have to because you there is no god is everything which means he's nothing right. It is there becomes a point when you have experienced every possible experience and differentiation and distinction becomes impossible. That's why we can't conceive of heaven that's why we can't conceive of eternity of any kind. We can't really imagine going to hell either because people always think wouldn't you get used to it and it's like yeah. You would eventually distinction breaks down because novelty is exhausted and that is that's eternity and that's what happens when you die is that it bleeds out into all. It's all and nothing so you have to create another even if you are god and you're spending all of your time in your time crystal cube by yourself and maybe there are other people there. But they are they're they're not people. Like you. They are lesser beings you don't feel you have no spiritual connection to them. When you look them in the eye. You don't see another person. You don't even see an animal. You see a thing so you are alone you have to create another that means you have to as love has been replaced by hate as the only people you see are people that you are exploiting and therefore have to hate to make it their fault that they're suffering. Means you have to put that hate somewhere and when there's no one else to do it to you got to do it to yourself.

You have to turn the death beam inward when there's no one else to hate and so just imagine torturing yourself in hell for eternity in the singularity. That's where these people will end up if you give them a long enough time. That's where they'll end up if they win and win and win and defeat entropy over and over again if they're able to defeat entropy at every point by just a little more technology a little more exploitation. They're able to stay ahead of the reaper if they do that and they get their singularity. It will be hell literal. They will burn forever until everything is the last pain. They felt as differentiation becomes impossible again which will be extinguishment. So there you go hell for everybody everybody alive. Every conscious mind will be in hell for eternity or every conscious mind will be in heaven because everybody will die in total harmony with themselves. They will know it's coming. They will have lived their whole life without accumulating the clenched fist of anxious animal fear that is irrational and that can be tamed by the mind because they live a life that allows them to do that instead of run for themselves instead of run from pain and trauma that is inflicted on them in a moment and it defines them. We're all defend defined by our traumas as traumas decrease our ability to differentiate decreases that's why tolstoy said every unhappy. Every happy family is happy that the same way and every unhappy family is different so you reach at any either point of this.

The isolated mind in the jar eating itself or universal human harmonic relations with their environment. What will it be in the mind of the person who dies in that world when it finally winks out when somebody unplugs the machine or when their natural body naturally changes state. As is soul through the body it's ego death. Eventually it is eventually the point where all distinctions ceases to matter. It is reunion and it is probably if it's if you're alive if you're around for it. It is probably felt one way or another like a.

Rising up of orchestral lights like a a a light turning on rather than the existential fear of the black enclosure because the difference between white and black is that white is all colors and black is no colors so like we don't really fear hell like the idea of being poked in the ass by the devil. We don't really fear that most of us what we fear is the sopranos ending now of course. It's irrational to fear the sopranos empty for a very obvious reason. You should be able to explain this and some people are able to convince themselves of this and they don't like they have transcended it. Those people work well in the system because they can more easily convince themselves and live with the reality of being separated totally from the world because hey if it happens like that it doesn't hurt. I'm not scared. It's fine that's perfect but for most people. It's just the thought of what's on the other side of that black screen that freaks them out all the stuff. They're gonna miss all the experiences all the things that they are connected that they have spent their life attaching themselves to that means that your brain is spindling around this inner. Axle of this black no colors that's scary all colors. No colors is no nothing no knowledge. It is having gone through all of the world in pain and suffering and then just had it be for nothing because you didn't learn anything white is all lights. White is all knowledge. Light is as the body drains of energy as that dmt burst kicks in as all of those little things in your brain. Those little scepters spin at a rate that they never could in your normal life. For even a second you are aware of things you know more the more you learn the less pain and fear can really hold you. The less you can be afraid because fear is just ignorance. This is dumb like yoda is banal. You have to have to fill it though like the challenge we all have is to fill banal truths with meaning in a way that is convincing and that means building different structures and different new symbolic orders around them. But the central principles are the same so the more you know the less you're afraid and so that light turning on is not anything to be afraid of and so you can live your life with that lightness with that light as the spindle and that is what people think of when they think of a belief in god. Now. I think for um for convinced christians. I think that the metaphors around christianity and the symbols of christ. They represent all that good feeling all the stuff that accumulates from a life luckily well lived in a position to love like. It's. It's as great or as little as your experience of love and and it gets wrapped around symbols of christianity but depending on where you live depending on where you experience these symbols what that's going to adhere to very much differs like I would say most of the people who consider themselves believing christians white ones.

Anyway in this country are if you were going to like cut their motives in half on the side of capital in the sense that they are on the side of the liberal side of dividing humanity into two with a big sword and letting half burn. They're in favor of it and they have a a theological belief that undergirds it but that is not their religious belief. If it was a religious belief. It would be around love that is around fear they're terrified. They're terrified of being on the other side because they're right next to those who are suffering the most. So their chances of success of winning are much lower so they can't have faith in the system. They have to have the faith in the supernatural. They have to believe that if they die of a heart attack at a water park that they will go to heaven not that um not that like they're gonna make the themselves feel good about the life. They live now through ease of consumption and ease of fear that come from being nestled in the bosom of a gentrifying neighborhood where you get to consume like a aristocrat but without any of the guilt of it where you get to live the life of of someone in in london at the height of the of the british empire. Someone enjoying of a a t on the veranda of a slave plantation. But that's only possible if you think you're gonna. make it materially and those are our knowledge workers and also are very rich people like landowners and stuff but like people on the edge. They're gonna they're powered by their fear because their life has been one of fear they have been traumatized they've been traumatized by the economy or they've been traumatized by other people in their lives that has made them bad in that they have bad political goals which is all. We can to use in the in the culture context on the screen to determine good and bad but they're not. It's not their paul. Any more than somebody who is commits crime because of racism. It's their fault. Now people have different degrees of like responsibility to to the moment and political responsibility that has to be weighed out abortion to their relationship but that's not about morality that's about their class position that's about where they are in the machinery of exploitation and that's because their motivation is a is a deeply felt religion a religious belief that at its base is powered by this this faint sense of love for others. That's been battered around by reality one way or the other and then this big massive. Black hole of hatred at the middle that has to be the fear of fear around that darkness that they fear because we've all been robbed really of heaven by modernity and we're trying to accommodate that oh man.

I remember why I was even saying this. I'm gonna wrap it up now finally so the whole reason. I said that all of that was to get to the idea that because we are trapped in a cultural conversation dominated by two ends of this liberal spectrum because these are the people who consume politics and make it now make it both in the people who do fun film and television. But then the vastly larger number of people who make up the social media conversation. They're all liberals of one stripe or another right wing or left. They are liberals. They want to divide us in half and kill one half do. They want to do it by by the will of god or or of the will of man marriage meritocracy or genealogy that's the fight and that's the fight they're having on media that's the fight we're all consuming and because of that. Even though the places in our lives where our political engagement in like electoral politics are would would be best used are at the local level by definition because that's where you have actual local information. That's where you have information that comes from experience not from this hot house but people's argumentation and the issues people fixate on and the and the dynamics that people respond to are the dynamics of national politics that are carried out in this new entertainment realm where they're getting their political identity because they're not getting it from their life. We're not getting it from this machinery the spectacle because we cannot re. We're not. We don't have enough social life to have those conversations and to have those experiences of shared exploitation and then conversation and and organizing around those questions. Instead. Those questions are all asked into the machine into the spectacle into the matrix and so all of it is in the terms of national politics and the dynamics that play at national politics are not the same as the one at local politics and that means that people who then try to apply themselves to local conditions end up being in many ways stopped from being effective by what they're bringing to the question from their political observations of the internet their culture warren fixations on the left and right so yes.

The only politics is to politics or resentment because if if no one's because the promise of socialism is everybody flourishes everybody as as al slovik said in caddyshack everybody gets laid. Either everything is play or as judge holden said everything is war. Those are the the two sides they're they're they're the same social end through the looking glass. One is is post scarcity democratically distributed. The other is scarcity violently disputed. Over those are the two things that you're you're looking at and the political debate that we're all engaged in is being conducted by and for people who either consciously or unconsciously have decided that the answer is war and even if you don't want that even if you consciously want to push towards peace you can't because you're taking to the place where your efforts could be useful a vocabulary a value system that has been generated by this poisoned reflection this funhouse mirror and of course that sounds like hopeless and nihilistic. But it isn't because if it's like the broncos bacillus thing if you've heard this and you are convinced by it. Then you still have to act that's the thing about all of this is that if everything I say is true at the end of it when you get to okay. That's true now. What your answer can only be found outside of that text and if you have to look elsewhere. I would suggest you look to the place of the world around you you should look to the things that occupy your vision and your sight and your smell and your voice because those things are the only experiences that will tune you towards the resonant of like the it will the only ones that can turn you to the resonant frequency of humanity because if you know this if you believe this is true and you still just do online stuff you're not going to feel good you're going to feel bad you're going to feel tense because you're reinforcing separation you're reinforcing your commitment to something that your heart doesn't want you to do your heart knows is wrong because now you know you don't even have a selfish reason to pursue this because that's just the irrational short-termism of capitalism reproducing itself culturally the wise decision is to be genuinely altruistic because then even if you fail even if your efforts are not rewarded by people responding because they're too selfish and they've been made too selfish. You still feel love you don't feel fear and resentment if you depend if your happiness depends on your personal pleasure. Then you're gonna be on that you're gonna always be on the tender hooks of what am I doing to deserve this pleasure because this pleasure is. It's someone else's expense because you know that you can't not know it you can't unknow it. You can't talk yourself out of it so when you get to that end point when you've confronted your anxiety at its deepest route and you can no longer find another explanation. You can no longer put it off on an erotic of a flight of fancy because you can identify those then you actually have to confront what you're doing with your time. But the answer can only come from within. It is a response to the passions.

It is not reasoned from because you're reasoning with the vocabulary of your enemies. You're using the tools in the real sense because like I think in material sense like in terms of structures of power and stuff you absolutely use you. The master's tools are you kidding me. Those are there to be used. They're great they're tools but when it comes to making decisions about those tools you can't be operating from market logic. You can't be operating from the pessimistic assessment that all humans are fundamentally alienated and cannot be brought back together. If you believe that you cannot persist in effective socialist activism or self-conception and of course you can keep can you can try to. But your efforts are going to involve more and more intensive outlays of investment in distraction and distraction is harder to come by over time because novelty reduces Another thing is that literally like you're drops your ability to engage in pleasures is reduced. Your vim and vigo go down which means your ability to find pleasure physically goes down and so you have to find it elsewhere where else is pleasure to be found in the hedonic calculus. There's no room for love. There's no room for feeling because it can't be priced. It's priced out of the equation. The only pleasure left is resentment seeing your enemies in pain that is it so for the liberal the conservative as it gets harder as they get older and as they get less money and are therefore able to indulge they can afford to indulge themselves. Less are less stable or less able to enjoy comfort. Both of those things are going to increase their misery and their need to accommodate for it by rescaling or rearranging the scale on the the hedonic calculus like rebalancing it towards pleasure so that they have a reason to keep getting up every running faster and that means they need more and more indulgences and that means that their resentments need to become more are need to become more a part of their lives. They need to be able not just to see someone owned on the internet but to see somebody to spoil physically in front of them. Maybe carry out violence against somebody becomes the only way to gain pleasure gain experience of pleasure and not alienation and fear and misery and physical pain that is accumulating that only comes by seeing others despoiled seeing others in pain and the war that's coming the political war that's happening right now the the political meltdown of the the meltdown of the brain that this gets the final schizophrenic break of the middle class. American brain is between those who want the other to suffer in the form of a defined like a racial ratio. Just another they want to destroy the other and then there are the ones who want to destroy themselves at the among the whites.

Anyway. The whites want to destroy whiteness they really do and then the minorities on that side also want to destroy whiteness for very good reason because they see whiteness as being responsible for their misery and light whiteness as in the actions of white. People absolutely are the actions of white people are absolutely the result of black people's low relatively high level of social alienation and misery. That's not a it's there's no question if you strip it of moralism and you just say white people doing things for one reason or another. Then the answer is yes it's not difficult. So of course they want to extinguish whiteness and of course guilty. White people would want to extinguish whiteness and then on the other hand you have largely but not entirely a desire to extinguish another that is partially racially defined but not entirely racially defined. All the other elements are permeable to a point of distinction and that distinction runs. I would say nationally so you have the phenomenon of the racially integrated proud boys. You have the exceptions that literally do prove the rule and then that becomes the group. So you destroy the other you destroy yourself. And that is the that is what that is the fight going on in the culture and then we're all participating in it. One level or ever. We are either engaging in it on one side or another or we are watching it from a scar afar and we are if we're alienated from it. We are commenting on it but by doing so still contributing to it to some extent. I will say that but maybe it's worth it. You are contributing if you're not ignoring it and even if you're part of the the general firmament of entertainment. You're filling out your role. Really. You're part of that argument and you can't disengage from it. It's it's what we all have. It's what we have instead of identities is is our role in this spectacle because that's where we're a cyborg. That's where we've offloaded our brains. That's the ghost acreage of our minds our conscious minds and that now defines us and of course. That is why the only way to resolve that is to create a orthogonal political movement based around class based around a universal understanding of solidarity that instead of wanting to destroy the other or wanting to destroy the self seeks to abolish both through their through their synthesis. This is the synthesis at the heart of the dialectic at the psychological level is to bring together as a social reality a new understanding of the self because when we say self we're not saying like at the end of this we're not we're not recognizably human. No we're as able to recognize ourselves as we ever are because remember. We're all different people. All the time it is it is our brain that's creating a narrative of continuity and that continuity is created by the brain. It's not imposed up from the outside of it. It is us and that is it's generated by our social conditions and so the self is destroyed. The other is destroyed and what comes from them is a synthetic self where the other has been incorporated into the self in a way that would not be recognizable to the person on the other side of that interaction which is why the white nationalists are right to say that whiteness is under threat because yes the notion of whiteness as it currently exists as a category of identity that we carry with us that will be abolished. If socialism is triumphant. Over time. It's not going to happen overnight overnight and it's not going to happen before a change in social relationships but it could be overtime generated by a change in social relationships. So there it is those are our options. That's what's beside us that is the three legged stool. These are the of of this is the roundabout how about that there's the three exits you can take and when I say that I mean in your heart you can operate from the one you bring with you when you go out into the world and when you bring with you when you log onto the internet and the one that you filter everything through. It's going to contain all of them. But it's going to be directed from one perspective consciously as you mindfully engage with the world whoo that was a long one. I thought that was going to be chill anyway. I hope these are making sense because you know. I'm going a lot far afield. I'm hoping to what I'm hoping is that with the last number of these I will be able to pull them together and then pull them apart and like build a chain of argumentation that connects these you know what I mean because. I feel like they're not they're in the order of like a stream of consciousness and I need to array them better. But I feel like once. I have them like sort of chained up in the right order. I think it could be good. They aren't making sense odd darn it bye.
