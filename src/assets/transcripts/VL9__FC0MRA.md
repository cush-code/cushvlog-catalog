Office we're doing a test stream here don't freak out. It's not my backyard. I understand I'll be back. I'll be back to my backyard but right now. We're testing out our capacity here at the at the at the chapel offices for future use and later to we might do some more. Some more stuff interactive but right. Now. We're just seeing how it works. I've got a pile of gulf war trading cards here for us to enjoy and an amazing post from an amazing quote rather from joe biden. Today they asked him about q anon and his response was quote. I'm a supporter of mental health and I urge them to take advantage of the things in the affordable care act while it's still there and of course that's being used as evidence that he is that he is slaying and that he is dragging fools but honestly. I can't think of a more wildly violently psychotic anti-social thing to say the guy is really running on pure elder rage. Just as much as trump is at this point just contempt for any question anybody questioning him and his position. I mean take advantage of the america affordable care act to get mental health care well. It's still there even though I'm planning on becoming president within the next six months god damn. He's a real sicko that guy. I'm gonna look through some of these gulf war trading cards that we've got here. I haven't been able to look at them since kind of the pandemic started. I'm gonna look at some of these fun things that happened during the last war.

We won the war in iraq so they have these cards for different countries and ours is right here the united states and it's mount rushmore that emblematic part of america's geography. A charter member of the united nations. The usa is a permanent member of the security council. The usa was designated to coordinate the liberation of kuwait by the united nations that was nice of them that was nice of them to let us do that for operation desert storm. The usa supplied more than 500 000 troops. 2700 air units 4 200 armored vehicles and 100 warships damn that's something that's impressive but then we got the other country. The other main protagonist of the war iraq founded by khalif umar. The first in 638. Basra is the second largest city in iraq in literature. Basra is the home of sinbad in a thousand and one nights. In 1914 a harbor was created at basra during the iraq iraq ocean access giving iraq ocean access during the round iraq war. In 1988. Basra was the scene of fierce fighting during operation desert storm. It was repeatedly bombed to prevent assistance to the iraqi forces in kuwait.

I love learning I love learning things including that one of the military skills you can learn in. The military is survival which honestly seems like it'd be number. One number one skill to learn in the military is survival. Many situations in combat may leave soldiers seamen or pilots cut off for the main group with no supplies. Survival training and equipment will help them keep going until talp arrives or they can return to friendly territory on their own. The most important aspect in survival according to instructions in a u.s military survival kit is quote keep your head. Native tribes live for generations in the open air taking their living from nature. You can do the same best of luck and remember that courage alone has won many a battle that's nice your ass is on your own. I like that one of these cards is middle eastern greeting customs and the canadian system of government which I can't think of a more meaningful context for this than the iraq war. The canadian government is divided into three autonomous but linked branches parliament. The legislative branch is bicameral that is divided into two parts. The senate and the house of commons. The executive branch is headed by the prime minister who is advised by a cabinet. The judicial branch interprets the laws and oversees the entire court system. The ceremonial head of government is the english monarch currently elizabeth ii.

It's still her how the hell is that lady still alive how much adrenochrome can one person eat that lady needs to share something with the rest of us. I mean maybe. I would like to see the clockwork elves in like the mirror blood dimension where the hell creatures live. Do. We got anything what are they talking about hi. I'm here I'm also here let me turn on my camera. Let's see we've we've got a a lot of people who are confused. Irritated disoriented by the different setup. I figured um but you know. I think that they're working through that together um. I'm looking at the chat right. Now so if anybody has any questions comments things that they would like to. It's okay. I understand you can see my legs and I know that that's upsetting. I'm not happy about it either. We'll fix the blocking in future episodes. Do you want me to do you want me to post up the camera. No it's fine. They'll have to get used to it um so yeah. Tell tell me what your. What do. We want matt to talk about today yeah I would I would love to do a chapo asmr episode. My idea for an asmr episode is simply reading the wikipedia page for the 30 years war. Come on let's get. Some some okay. I I mean. I don't want to belabor this. But I was almost gonna ask you about this earlier. Matt did you see that maddie g had some responses to our chapa reading series today. I only saw the one did he have more than one. I think the only one I saw was the thing about relitigating five-year-old twitter beefs but which is hilarious coming from him which is absolutely has gone to anger management over tweets so once again as with all internet contact all internet conversation. It's just projection. Everyone's projecting he he's he's living in his own little hall of resentment mirrors um in lieu of anything more substantial right off the bat.

 somebody asked for some lodge 49 talk. I just started watching lodge 49. I'm about halfway through the first season and it's as good as you thought it was. I thought it was going to be much darker. I didn't know it was going to be such a I wouldn't call it good vibes but it is kind of a blue sky show with darker under underpinnings. It's a chill vibe. I think that it's general attitude is one. It's positive because it's it's open-hearted and it's it's confident that there is like there is something redeemable in human life and in human in human social interaction that we're not all just doomed to bounce off of one another in cosmic nightmare horror until it's eternity which is the main theme of most prestige tv shows the thing that struck out of me like it's kind of superficial. But I thought it was very well. Done is the very compassionate depiction of how you know you can be living a nice normal life in like two bad twists of faith like a snake bite and your dad having an untimely death like totally spiral you into oblivion yeah. I thought that that was that was nice yeah. I know it's it. The show is very grounded and it's it talks.

It's very specific in the way that it addresses how we are absolutely at the whim of the market and how that has left us with this terror in our hearts because we can't have any faith that anything we have today is going to even be there tomorrow. But it's not totally nihilistic or dark because it recognizes the potential for people to cross those chasms of fear and come together in a secret lodge dedicated to turning lead into gold as we should all be dedicated to. I think that we could do would you matt would you consider the the long-term endeavor of transforming lead into gold a a suitable grill pill. Pursuit you know what yeah go for it. I just want to say one more thing about the about the about the iglesias deal because iglesias is responding to somebody else who listened to the episode and then just says these guys are being reactionary. They're being pro-sprawl anti-natalist and no we just said that iglesias stupid like a la carte technocratic approach is and unworkable and that any of the problems that he talks about have to be addressed by people like overthrowing the domination of their lives and and finding some actual autonomy from the market not to just submit to it fully in the name of beating the chinese. But with these people like they are the blackest pill of all because they they don't think that there is any alternative truly to that to a world of of of market enslavement that that we can never transcend separateness to the extent that we can have a collaborative political project we will only be masked. We will only be able to mediate our desires in the market and the best we can hope for is to fool enough rubes with with some clever nationalist jiu jitsu to get him to go along with positive policies and they're so fixed on that that if you say that they're that their technocratic fixes are insufficient or that they create problems that their the political structure they assume to be. Immutable can't absorb that you are actually on the other side and you actually think no no one should have kids and no we should sprawl out into oblivion. No no I there is no reason if anyone listened to that episode to think that you could only think that if you are so wedded to this format this format of human political engagement that any alternative to it is just a non-starter and that if you aren't on board with their blueprint you are kicking out the idea of making anything better for anybody even though their model for change is impossible. I mean has he noticed that obama had eight years to basically do exactly what these guys want to try to to try to nudge us remember cass sunstein and the nudge that was how we were going to get to a equitable society. Just subtle little nudges were going to push us into being decent human beings to one another how did that do it and they didn't get close and everything that they could even point to in the near term. I mean my god biden said take advantage of the aca while it's still there like just assuming that this thing that was supposed to be a big. Breeze does you guys are the real nihilist man and you guys are the ones who have decided that just as long as you have a smug answer for something. You're do you're contributing you're contributing to the world um how about this matt to switch gears into historical counterfactuals cause we were just talking about them based on the atlantic article would it have been better if the germans had won world war one well.

[13:20](https://youtu.be/VL9__FC0MRA?t=13m20s)

I mean the first thing you gotta. Ask is could they have because if they couldn't have it's sort of an inoperative point because the world would have to be so different for them to have won that it's like well. Now. We're not even talking about a world. We recognize um and I don't know if the germans could have won world war one if we'd stayed out of it maybe. But like there's I there are people who've made a strong point that the germans were actually broken before we even showed up and that their position in the middle was untenable especially given their allies I guess the only way they could have won a war is a shorter war but where they were able to like get a definitive outcome before it turned into a war of attrition because germany they love starting fights but they can't finish them because they they don't have the the the material base to fight everyone which is what they seem to want to do all the time or it did anyway. Although now they just they just took over everybody but from with this central bank which was very clever of them. So I don't know. I mean if they won the war. I don't know how that could have been possible but you probably still have a great depression and you still have like the crisis of fascism. I mean harold turtle in harry turtledove's books. Germany wins world war one in europe but then england and france become fascist and you could argue that france was really the most fertile soil for fascism in europe. Certainly the most like politically where political anti-semitism was the most advanced and that a defeated france could have been absolutely ground zero for fascism but who knows I just want to shout out the person in the chat who I think correctly states that german victory could only have been achieved if pointy or helmet technology had been available. At the time yeah. Those pickle hubs needed to be much sharper for them to have any hands chance um. Let's see well the real. The real counterfactual germany is what if the german revolution of 1918 had succeeded that's a real one yeah that I mean that was my take when we were just talking a moment ago about the the losers in the world war one cemetery. They they were only losers and suckers because they didn't join with the internationalist movement right after the war.

All right I i do like that that the I am a fan I am loving the trump thing because the trump thing with the troops I mean obviously for one thing. This is all exculpatory from guys like john kelly who just want to be. They they hate trump but they still served him and they need to have that litigated in public so that they can have their sense of guilt assuaged in which case boo. Who is your own fault. And I gotta say there's. I can't think of greater ownage than kelly's standing there because his son died in iraq. I believe and trump being like what were they doing what a bunch of losers why would you fight why would he get killed and that shows a fundamental friction point between different elements of like the ruling class because the military does require an ethic some sort of ethic of sacrifice right. Some sort of ethic of a higher good or else you wouldn't join the military but all of that higher good is in practice just doing the will of people like donald trump. But the social contract is predicated on people like donald trump.

Not saying that out loud they say thank you for your service. They they give you the the the pathetic tributes to make up for the fact that your death was in vain and he just doesn't have the wherewithal or like emotional intellectual continence to not just say you're a sucker for fighting and dying for guys like me and john. Kelly just has to take it he just has to stand there and take it and then he leaks to the atlantic so that they can publish it a year later and he thinks he's doing something But it does make you wonder about like the the I've talked before about how the military is going to really be. The deciding piece in any kind of crisis prolonged political crisis in this country and they're like they are the least they're sort of the most ideologically obscured element of the ruling class you know by day by definition by nature and it's and as a result it's harder to predict where they would go and how they would respond and that's why the military often in periods of crisis in different countries in different periods of time ends up just subsuming all politics within itself. But not on one not on like the cultural terms of one side or the other trying to transcend them which of course is silly and eventually doomed but they don't know that because they actually believed this. If they didn't they wouldn't be in the army they'd be making real money doing something else um did you see that that thing that was going around last week that poll that had the majority of the of military supporting biden yeah and apparently officers more than enlisted men which some people were baffled by but for me. That's pretty simple most officers in the military went to college.

Yeah isn't that just college versus non-college. It's college versus non-college that's the real battle like the like. It's a civil war here between white people based on who went to college and and how that structures their alienation how that structures their like resentment and their anger and their frustration at being part of a system that is like dehumanizing them on a daily basis which we all feel to some extent or another you. If we don't feel it personally. We see it done to others around us and we fear it happening to ourselves and how we how we deal with that how we find the source for it is largely dependent on the cultural. The cultural baggage that we've accumulated either from our communities which tends to make people sort of like culturally reactionary or from the suite of opinions you get from the college process the the process of being acculturated into bourgeois norms.

 mr cringe 69 420. I can tell you right now the audio cushvlog feed exists. As of this moment it is up. I have I have levellated every kush vlog or mastered every klush vlog into mp3 form um and I'm in the process of publishing him. Only. I've only had time to put 10 up on the feed so far. I I still need to submit it to the itunes music store to get it populated in all the the catchers but hopefully. Over the next few days. I will upload every I think there are 71 or 72. This will be the 72nd kush vlog so hopefully by um by monday or so. We'll have all those up and going and you'll be able to listen to these not only as live video broadcasts but also as a podcast in the next day or two afterwards after whenever I get them going so. That is it's. It's the progress moves forward um a guy in the chat mat asks for a shout out because they finished capital volume one last night. They request an atta boy attaboy who what's their handle flank ocean flank ocean flank like you know like frankfurt and baby talk flank flank ocean well congrats on finishing capital. It's bear by the way one of these cards.

It says intelligence file judaism jews believed god jesus believed god is above all and created everything accepting the ten commandments at sinai for the covenant or pact with god by observing god's laws. They gain their protections. Synagogues are the place and the saturday the day of rested worship. The three main branches are orthodox conservative and reform so there we go now you have read the intelligence file on judaism. I would like to. I would. I wonder what in like. The cia archives if there is just a file labeled judaism and what is contained within it. I would like to know as well um all right. Here's maybe a curveball.

[22:05](https://youtu.be/VL9__FC0MRA?t=22m05s)

I don't know if this is a good question or a bad question. Is there an argument to be made. That trump is actually the harm reduction choice. Given the the possibility of stochatic like qnon based violence I I've thought about this and I think that there's the thing is is that there's the reason harm reduction is a silly cat way to go. About all this stuff is that you don't know like you just said they said stochastic. We don't know I think the q a on violence is inevitable. I think human on violence is gonna happen whether trump wins or loses But I i do think at this point it'll still be relatively disorganized. It'll be you know the the least the most disturbed and the least coherent and the most sort of like violently attached members of the of the movement expressing themselves personally through violence. And I think that's inevitable and that's going to get bigger. But I don't think it's going to become like a a public health crisis. You know on par with a coronavirus or something like I was sick I i. I honestly don't know how you can look at this situation and look at this political consensus and say that you're gonna be able to pick who's going to make things less terrible and the good news is.

You don't really have to spend that much time on it because as I keep saying voting your individual choice to vote for anyone is not really meaningful. So don't sweat it too hard do what you want if it feels like you if you feel like you should vote for biden. Don't feel like you have to like spend 40 days on top of a mountain to purge yourself of that feeling or if you feel like you don't want to vote at all or you want to vote for the party or you want to vote. Trump is an ironic bit don't spend too much time on like the the the moral question of it. Because all you end up doing is is is building up the act of voting into this mythic self-defining act which is what they want you to think like the reason that we're able that we're one of the big reasons we are where we are is because people have ceded to voting a huge chunk of their sense of autonomy in life and their control over their future. Like the fact that we vote is supposed to be this thing that defines us as people and defines our destiny. But it's really just what 100 million people just shuffling into a place independently and just pressing a button. There's no coordination. There's no pressure there's no meaningful organizing within like the voting public at large. It's an individual choice and and it's you should probably only think about it as long as it takes to wait in line and then press the button and then that hole that used to be filled with asking these questions of yourself can be filled by asking questions that are more relevant to your life.

Um okay going off of the The kunan thing a few people are asking and this kind of I guess. I guess. This would frame in in something you were talking about maybe last week. Maybe the week before the the kind of everything is an op framework. Yes do you have any thoughts about the portland shooter being killed yesterday. I'm seeing a lot of stuff that he was released from custody after like driving 110 miles on the highway with a kid in the car and guns and stuff and and that he had like a totally apolitical instagram until like a couple months ago and a fresh blm tattoo and it's all very eyebrow raising certainly but but I guess.

I asked a question. I have is for people who are like freaking out about. This is okay now what like what what is how does this how does if he's an op. If he's a cop. What does it mean you know if the cops are out there doing provocateur. Like and if they think shooting a a patriot prayer. Guy is a good use of their time well then what does that tell you about like the efficacy of this movement in general like I i I if you're if you think that the if the that the cops have an interest in seeing tensions raised and stakes raised along violence. I mean then doesn't that mean it's your responsibility to the degree that you can to not take them up on. It doesn't that make sense or is it always the cops are going to do what they do. And then we just use it as excuse to do whatever we wanted to do anyway and we never stop for a second to question okay like how does any of this fit into a broader like dynamic. But I don't know I have no idea if he was like an op or anything everything seems. I mean i. I certainly believe that in all these specific locations the cops are doing all kinds of that we have no idea about but my if I had to guess. I'd say it's probably local initiative. I mean maybe it's like start part of some some cia gladio c operation. But 

I mean if that's real if that if you really think that then I think it would the the next step would be reasso re evaluating like your entire orientation towards the current moment instead of just doubling down on everything. But I don't know more questions yeah all right. I saw somebody asking this a little earlier and I almost want to bring it up just because it was something. I was thinking about or getting irritated about the other day um which is I was listening to I was on a run listening to pod safe america as I do still still. I mean it look it makes me run faster because when I get done with the run I can stop listening to it But they were doing their trip. Their now normal thing of um you know 

[28:40](https://youtu.be/VL9__FC0MRA?t=28m40s)

Now the work is to get the only goal. The only thing is to get trump out of office and then we can start the hard really hard necessary work to fixing all of the structural things that got trump into office in the first place and somebody in the chat was asking what happens to the democrats after trump because their seemingly their only organizing principle right now is not trump and this is the thing that I was like hitting myself in the head with a hammer listening to these guys to talk about because there is no principle beyond this like what is the work of the democrats after trump. I don't know. I would just want to wha what are you saying restoring dignity to the office getting the cheeto dust out of the drapes in the oval office just just vacuuming for four years getting all the damn cheeto dust out of the place. I would say that that if there is an argument for biden it's that biden and his party presiding over the current crisis the insufficiency of that response is going to be pretty clear and pretty dramatic and there will be none of the obama patina that protected him from a serious like left response during his presidency. People's people are beyond that the problem is the question is whether or not like that alienation from the democrats will be organized and turned into anything coherent or if it will just result in a further disaffection from politics in general in which case the electorate shrinks even further and to the advantage of the q lunatics who will become the only active base of engaged political citizens in this country because no one else will have any reason to believe that their vote will ever matter in any meaningful way yeah or the things that like you know the to the extent that the democratic vote is is mobilized right. Now it is in this um you know. I don't think for most normal people. It's you know. I want to say hysterical just in the tone of it but I don't think that the actual response of a trump presidency is is totally hysterical but socially certainly tonally but you know.

I guess. The worry is that it becomes the people do just get to go back to brunch right and then without an organizing principle. After that what happens to that version of the electorate we've proven that nothing at least the democrats have proven that that they are committed to not investing in changing anything so what is the organizing principle to motivate an electorate after that and it appears to be nothing so. I mean this you know just recapping what you're saying about. The only people. Motivated are the people who are convinced that they need to oust the satanic sub-government from yes from from the actual government yes and I mean if there's any hope. It's that there's not going to be as many places to go to brunch anyway. My brunch will be cancelled. I keep on rolling back and forth in my head that this election is the beautiful boaters versus the beautiful brunchers oh.

It's true though it's very true um. Let's see what else somebody was posting about zachary taylor in here. But I think it got removed by the auto mod somebody's trying to suppress zachary taylor truth. Yes there is a conspiracy theory about zachary taylor It's that he was poisoned by pro-confederate forces because of his resistance to The the southern demands for the territory seized from mexico being open to slavery which was headed towards a a irresolvable crisis when he just dropped dead and so there was a theory for many years that it was. There was some slave power conspiracy to poison him and he was actually exhumed a few years ago yes. I remember this they clipped his hair because they thought it might have been arsenic because an arsenic will linger in the hair samples for hundreds of years after death but they didn't find any apparently he just drank the doodoo water. He drank the dude water although the time they said it was because he took he went for a ride in the sun and he was all sweaty and then he just housed a bunch of cherries and milk and it killed him which is which is the way people used to die because no one knew what was happening so they would just say the last thing they ate. Like there was a an english king. I forget who's like stomach was supposedly exploded because he ate too many eels. It's too many. I remember yeah. I know the eels guy yeah yeah so so was just like. I don't know man. He just ate all those that was a few hundred yards behind the white house. During that entire period.

 let's see what else somebody's asking me who your favorite fictional president is. I feel like you've talked about fictional presence. A lot on on this stream specifically have I you. I think you did a whole segment about fictional presidents once who's the best fictional president um. I like jack nicholson in mars attacks because he's completely ineffectual has no idea what's going on and just gets owned after giving a fancy speech that's supposed to solve everything He has the right level of smarminess for a true president earth and mars um all right in lieu of anything better. Somebody keeps asking if you could choose a historical war and make it go the other way which would you do oh boy ah. While you're thinking I will say no. I do not have five gamer chairs in my room. You're looking at two different angles of the same fabled chapo office yeah. That's not chris's place. He does not have five gamer chairs and these aren't even gamer chairs. They're just office chairs. People are weirdos. This doesn't have to have the name of like a of an energy drink on it to be to be a gamer chair speaking of gaming if anybody in the chat. Has ever encountered a problem with the geforce rtx. Ti graphics card not accepting drivers on windows and um not recognizing dual monitor setups the geforce rtx. Ti slide into dms because I could use some tech help because this office computer is not responding to me um anyway give us an office tour.

Here check this. Yeah we got a lot of t-shirts here anyway fictional war oh no real war right real war real war. You want to go fictionally yeah I mean the tanky answer is obviously the the soviet polish war and that's that's interesting but honestly. I think at that point it probably wouldn't have mattered. I don't think that they were gonna roll over anybody because at that point germany was was solidifying behind reaction. I don't know. It's always hard to find like a war that that is like contingent enough that the the the that the outcome could have been different and there but also significant enough that that would have had like long lasting repercussions maybe the taiping rebellion. The the the there's no question that the that the king the king the man shoes had absolutely lost the mandate of heaven and them holding on for another 50 years was was pretty perverse. I blame I blame the british as always basically any modern war. The british won other than for them to lose anything anything else good in the 

In the the cards some good cards the ticonderoga class cruiser. That's a good one. The persian gulf we love it very important where all of our oil comes from and the big dog. Here the m1a1 abrams tank that's our guy right there powered by a revolutionary gas turbine engine. The m1a1 is a heavy main battle tank with a speed and agility of a light armored vehicle. We got to pick up a few of these chris. These sound great they can't be. They can't be too much on the on the resale market at this point right. Now there's got to be a ton of them with 1500 horsepower. The abrams can traverse flat terrain at 45 miles. An hour rugged terrain poses no problem for its unique hydro-pneumatic suspension system. The abrams was the stalwart of the operation desert storm ground attack. It fired so many depleted uranium rounds um matt did you happen to read president.

[38:30](https://youtu.be/VL9__FC0MRA?t=38m30s)

Xi's recent article on marx's political economy in contemporary china. No but that sounds interesting. I would like I i am kind of interested. I would like to know more about like how the hell the chinese like party members square all this. Like they have to know that they're not doing communism right now but do they think do. They have a plan for doing communism or are. They just kind of kicking the can down. The road like our guys are where you have like a vague understanding that you have principles that you adhere to but for the most part they are sacrificed eternally on the altar of expedience or are they like really pushing towards something. I have no idea and I don't know enough one way or the other. It's I'm certainly a little skeptical frankly of of the of the project. But that's because I have no idea but yeah. I'd like to read that yeah I obviously know nothing about contemporary chinese china. But I'm always curious as to who the audience is for an article like that or like you know actual. I think it's it's members. I mean remember there's millions of people in the chinese communist party you know and they have varying levels of commitment to the ideology of it and and that's his whole like his whole. Marxist revival is clearly aimed at that grassroots. I just don't know how like effective it is or or how meaningful it even is if even if anybody at any level of power.

Anymore is operating off of anything other than the most emergency sense of like of of managing crisis in the moment with no long-term goals beyond survival. It certainly feels that way everywhere um someone keeps asking if we'll do an episode on this. I don't know if we'd ever do an episode on this but do you have any takes on the zodiac killer and he's not talking bruce I do think it's funny. The two separate guys have written books saying their dad was a zodiac killer. I think that's pretty funny. A lot of people working out family issues through the lens of unsolved murder cases I don't know. I have no idea. I i. I don't even have a theory as to who did it. I don't really think that the zodiac movie theory the grace smith theory is really true but I don't have any alternative one that I think is more plausible. It's honestly not even that interesting a case when you strip it of the of the media angle which of course explains why it's so enduringly popular anybody who writes to the media especially in the in the in that era. When newspapers were the defining like architecture of like civic engagement those guys are always gonna live forever like berkowitz. Same thing nobody remembers gary ridgway because he didn't write any letters to the editor. Let's see all right you've been talking about this a little bit.

I don't even know really what this question means. But it'd be a good time to just make some compare generalized comparisons. You've been reading the The reagan land book yeah. I just finished it. You're you know about the invisible bridge yeah. Do you think our current time resembles the 1970s there's a case to be made that we're in a similar crisis but the thing about the 70s was is that is that the new deal consensus. The new deal great society. Consensus was was buckling but there was emerging an alternative and and it was coming. It was being created along ideological axis and political axis by figures like milton friedman and ronald reagan and the mount perlin society you know. There was. There was this free market supply-side political ideology that was waiting in the wings and that was being formed out of the crisis of the collapse of the new neoconsensus to replace it.

I think we're in a similar crisis point for that reaganite consensus that we've been living with for 40 years. But there is no emergent alternative that that's what distinguishes this time from that and that's what's so terrifying about the moment because like the the the reagan revolution was the sort of the final the final domination of politics by markets like the final the final seeding of any even illusion of political autonomy on the part of the political class to finance and but once that final transfer has been made there's no one else to hand it off to there's no one else to take power because you have obliterated the political spirit. You've turned it into a pure spectacle. You've turned it into a. Pure zone of disengaged resentment which means that when the wheels start falling off there is no formation to resist it and and of course the reason. The reason that we ended up with the reagan realignment is because there was this capital intensive effort to create an alternative but now there is there's nothing else.

There's no viable alternative to just stripping the wiring out to taking out all the copper pipes yeah and this kind of goes back to the thing that I was asking about like you know what is the project of the democrats post-trump. It's I think it's telling about that lack of alternatives that the last two major political movements have been very held up in creating popular opposition to the person of somebody yeah. The tea party and the popular right-wing revulsion that at least in its broadest considerations were a revulsion at the person of barack obama barf sacko crumble yeah and then the that resulting in plus other factors resulting in trump and then at this point two months out from the The 2020 election that the popular formulation of the democrats is mostly a revulsion to the person of donald trump yes yeah that there there is no force to be considered at least in the broad minds of the populace. It's just these these guys that we gotta get out of there we gotta get this guy out of here we gotta get him out of here and then it'll be okay and then it'll be okay. I think what the republicans found out is that is that once your guy is out of there things don't get any better but man it's fun watching the libs get pissed and that then becomes its own its own mana its own ambrosia its own opiate and I don't think the libs got anywhere near that kind of satisfaction from watching the conservatives freak out about obama especially after the midterms in 2010 and and it's hard to imagine them getting any real satisfaction out of watching biden be president.

Especially since it's really some people have said that like biden might actually be able to deliver on his promise of de-escalating the cultural conflict just because he himself is such a bland empty vessel that he he doesn't contain any of like the red flags that enrage. I mean. There's a reason that trump constantly says that biden's not actually in charge of the democratic party that it's the squad and that it's antifa because the person of biden can't sustain that anxiety and that terror the way that the person of barack hussein obama could and I don't know if that's true. I suspect it isn't certainly if you know they carry out the the the austerity. Depression response that they're likely to pursue but at the same time obama just biden does seem to be such a symbolically empty figure on both sides that it makes me feel that we're we're probably not going to see some sort of ratcheting down just because conditions are going to keep getting worse. But the the thing people fight about is probably not going to be the person of the president it could be but it just seems hard to sustain unless kamala harris becomes president and then all bets are off.

Let's see what else here's something. I'm kind of interested in this is a real grab bag because I'm just like going going with whatever pieces. Let's do it. My interest. Let's be popping scat do you think there's anything to the seeming popularity of the true crime in podcasts and media why over the last like really in the trump first trump administration. There's been this explosion of true crime media. I mean obviously there's some kind of pathology that we're working out there that we're we're excising yeah absolutely. I think it's it's we want to feel. We want to feel the danger that we know is there. But we can't see we need to. We want to psychically enact violence and trauma that is absolutely suffusing our lives but is for most of us the ones of us who listen to podcasts largely out of view and there's something agonizing about that. There's something agonizing psychically about living in a milieu that feels savage that feels like it's fraying like a social fabric that is dissolving but crime isn't really up you know like people aren't experiencing more violent crime. We've had a spike in the last few months which I said was gonna happen when people started dropping like flies and the economy collapsed. It's. It's absolutely predictable but you know. This obviously predates that significantly and predates kovid We want some sort of way to psychically imagine and enact this sense of danger that is permeating everything but is unspoken otherwise.

That's my suspicion anyway yeah and then I think it's putting on my podcast producer hat. It's that and then it's just like an endlessly rich source of text that you can just like pull up a wikipedia article and have a podcast episode ready to go well. That's the other big thing is that it is. It is public domain information yes that can be easily and cheaply mulled over for an audience which considering the the nature of podcasting and its specific like low overhead for you know production costs and content It's it's sort of like an improv thing like okay give me give me a give me a give me a fast food restaurant and a murder weapon and then we'll just do an episode. Okay somebody got beaten to death with a milkshake machine at a dairy queen go and then you can talk about that for an hour um. I don't want to blow up their spot too much but chapo recently got dethroned by another podcast. Called true crime obsessed there's two people who used to do a broadway theater news podcast expect one of the hosts. I believe was the host of the official disney on broadway podcast doing a true crime broadcast that is very yas queenie about murder victims. I think they only review like 48 hours documentaries about murders and stuff wait a minute. They just watch a tv show and talk about it so they're not even doing the research of reading the wikipedia article yes wow so you can imagine how innervated. I got when I discovered that this thing exists and I encourage you all to look it up and just google true crime obsessed and and and check out their web presence and see just imagine how irritated. I became when I discovered this show you know what though at the same time like politics is another thing like that it's another thing you can respond. It's. It's public domain information that every it's a baseline thing you can talk about without having to have any kind of expertise which is really what people are looking for when they're looking for things to to to provide shape for their podcast attempt yeah and and honestly no shade on anybody. I don't even care that they're number one on patreon everybody should get it. We're doing fine on patreon. It's it's independent podcasting is is I i truly believe in it as a the value of independent media but yes as the person pointed out. They are literally soy facing in their landing page photo to their true crime true cri gary ridgway ah um gary ridgeway. You're so small ah you're small oh my god. You're. You're your truck. But your truck bed is so nice yeah. Let's see what else what else is going on on here. Politics is true crime. You know what that's true. It's true. They are. It's the same thing yeah. It's the same thing. It's like.

It's just it's about the level of abstraction. Like for some people. It's too abstract to talk about politics when you could be talking about a person getting chopped up by ginsu knives and put into a series of of mailboxes. Like that is more that's more they connect more to that. They can visualize it much more easily than they can visualize political process. But it's also it's. It's either way. You're you're you're graphically describing trauma and horror. It's it's almost only about the the scale of time that things are enacted. You know yeah yeah exactly yeah and the intensity of like the personal experience Let's see. Let's see what else well. I add the pete buda judge podcast to my rotation. I don't think so though I have considered doing a um the new york review of podcasts. I kind of want to just listen to the top five non-daily politics. Podcasts which right now include um on any given week like the the pete potted cast is one ben. Shapiro is always up there. The den dan cranshaw and dan bongino bongo gino oh god. Podcasts are always in the top five pot news and crenshaw has a podcast yeah. I kind of want to just listen to all five no takes. It's like he's so boring He's just yeah. I kind of want to just listen to all like one week of all five of the top five news and politics episodes and then do an episode like a solo episode reviewing them. I would be interested in that. I would. I would want you to do it because I don't want to listen to that. Maybe maybe some week where I have a kind of down week of producing. I'll I'll do that and and let all of you know what dan bogono bonobo does on his On his hottest podcast.

They have a card here for every country that provided any assets to the war in iraq. The persian the gulf war so there's one here for sierra leone who sent 200 troops. There's one here for finland who provided economic assistance and support of the international red cross military hospital wow thanks guys yeah totally cool um all right. We're coming up on an hour here Let's try to get maybe one more question of of substance and then yeah and then a silly one yes that sounds good So other than just misspellings of dan vaginas um oh my god. So this is nigeria right listen to this. A former french colony nigeria gained its independence in 1958. Its geography is strongly influenced by the sahara arab land constituting three percent. Supports peanuts cotton and millet. Uranium is a principal export yeah remember the yellow cake that they didn't get from oh yeah. The yellow cake trading partners include france nigeria and japan. In recent years drought and famine have plagued the country. Nigeria is a member of the united nations and the coalition forces can't even list. The contribution like their name is on like a document saying go for it yeah. Sure The it is not a nato deck of cards. It is golf war one playing cards um trading cards. They're trading cards yeah um all right.

I'm looking for something with a little more substance. I think the best thing. I have is a somebody keeps asking if police privatization is in our near future I mean. I guess. The question is near. It's inevitable like privatization of everything. I mean there will be no in the in the medium term if things aren't if the if the arc isn't bent you know. If if we don't change the relationship between citizens and capital everything will be privatized because there will be no public sphere. There will be no public space. There will be no public agreed. Upon reality. It will be completely replaced by technocratic technological coercion and market coercion and that's when you're talking about like if anyone's read oryx and crake. I've always thought that that book has one of the most chillingly realistic depictions of like america's near future. Especially since it's just the current existence in many parts of the world that already exist which is you have limited areas of of control by certain economic actors who are able to create networks of security and resources for people who provide services for them in the form of employment but and then outside of that.

It's just everybody for themselves in sort of a makeshift like return to the hobbsian state of nature but with with tick tock all right. This is one of the cards here swear to guard is government canadian national anthem. I don't know why they're sucking off the canadians so much here. Since 1980. The national canadian national anthem has been oh canada before then the official anthem had been god save. The king or queen o canada was written by calexia lavalier in 1880 for a contest held by a french canadian organization to select a national anthem. The words in french were written later by sir edelf but did not gain wide acceptance until 1908 when they were translated into english by s r s weir so keep that in mind when you watch the footage of the highway of death um.

[58:45](https://youtu.be/VL9__FC0MRA?t=58m45s)

Let's do one more yeah one more question um wither hollywood matt what happens with all these this after this year of zero movies. Is there any more is this the end of the current formulation of the hollywood system. Um. I mean it does it seems inevitable to me. I don't know how hollywood comes back from this. I mean maybe we get a vaccine and people go back and there's like this mania for return. But but like in other areas of the economy the hollywood was these movies were losing money. You know comparatively like the profit was going down. I mean yeah like avengers can make a zillion dollars but but they had to concentrate movies like adventures yeah exactly like they're concentrating into ridiculous profit margins. We're in fewer profit making movies that require larger and larger investments to even break even and er. There's. There's just been a steady erosion of of box office income over the years like profitability of particular films so that was before covet so.

I think we're probably going to see a move towards just streaming everything's going to be streaming everything's going to be low budget forever streaming. You're looking at the future of content people yeah and then cloud atlas is great. I love the cloud. I love cloud atlas too and then there might be a few movies a year that go to like. I don't even know if they would be theaters. I don't even know like maybe. It's like gonna be. There's gonna be like a big screen that comes down at dave and buster's to watch the new avengers movie. I think movie theaters will forever be around us maybe even as a boutique experience. Because going to the movies rocks. I love going to the movies. But there's there is a it's going to be like you said it'll be a boutique experience. It'll be like revival houses like apparently that's how a lot a number of theaters have have been showing old movies during covet and I could see that as being viable but there's only going to be a few movies a year. I think that are going to get theatrical releases or are going to be expected to make their money through theatrical release.

Most of the money is going to be made through streaming. I do love going to the movies. I love it too. I can't wait. I would love to go back to out to the movies. I'm not going to go see tenet though yeah it. I do think that they absolutely must actually do an oscars this year yeah. So this controlled world tour can win everything yeah so that trolls two wins beck's best picture and cats You know best direction and stuff like that um. I I think they have to do it just because it would be funny um like scene tenet in the chat. I thought 10 was it impossible to see not you could see it elsewhere and I think there's there are like now bootlegs available. But it's been released in other countries. It's just not released here and apparently it is going to be released. This week in theaters that are like allow them to be to be viewed. So you will be able to hypothetically see it in. The united states all right if you're willing to take your life in your hands. I'm going to pay 4 000 dollars to get one of six seats available in an imax theater to stay distanced um all right well.

This has been a kind of low low low key just yeah. This is this is basically a test of capacity. Here yeah we're I guess just some programming notes you know we can't really say much about it but matt and I were have been at the office this week because we have a fun new project in the pipeline yes. So um you know we we might be broadcasting from here a few more times then usual just because we're coming in here to do some work um as always the old style of of matt streams. The the the kush vlog classic will never disappear never even if we move to this in a kind of full-time way we will we will try to always or in regular fashion do a big chunk of matt going off solo at the beginning and then maybe do some questions and eventually if I fix that graphics card we can play some games in here. That is the dream I wanna I wanna play some games but again if you know anything about how to fix the geforce. Rtx. 280 ti code 43 not recognized by windows. Hit me up and thank you to the person who already messaged oh perfect. We're already getting info thank god also um I am running home to go do a music video happy hour stream on my channel with molly for and introducing our music podcast. That'll start around seven seven ish on twitch.

Tv slash the chris wade if you want to watch some music videos and have a few drinks friday evening come watch. Us it's doing it beyonce power hour. I believe beyonce power hour. Yes. It's her birthday molly put together a power hour for her and oh. I thought it was so funny that that forbes list came out and they put beyonce on the 40 under 40. This year like what why does beyonce need to be on a 40 under 40 list because she's going places. She. I keep an eye out for this beyonce girl um what else oh as.
