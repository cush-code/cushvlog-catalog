Foreign I see trouble on the way I see earthquakes and lightning. I see a bad time today. Well don't go around tonight. It's about to take your life. There's a bad moon on the rise overflowing. I know the end is coming soon choir. International weather wanna careful around put some whiskey in your water sugar in your tea. What's all these crazy questions you're asking me. This is the best body that could ever be turn on the lights because I don't want to see Mama Told Me Not to Come Mama Told Me Not to Come that ain't the way to have fun open up. This window put some air into this room. I think I'm almost choking. I'm so sail from here wow that cigarette you're smoking scared me after death open up the window sucker let me catch my breath. It's Randy Newman wrote that song definitely one of our best guys to write songs. Gotta love them don't we folks so today.

I wanted to talk as about broadly very broadly about like what it means to seek meaning from politics in the current moment and how that manifests itself in Mass. Politics not not Niche politics but like centered around significant numbers of Americans all identifying with the same constellation of symbols and ideas with the same leadership that is able to exercise like actual influence. So we're not talking about anything on the left. We're really only talking about liberal and conservative the two parties and specifically wanted to start talking about what it is to get meaning from politics. If you are a republican that is to say if you're a trump fan. Black Jacobins is next week so there's this article this in the post. Today Washington Post to Trump's hardcore supporters his rallies weren't politics. They were life and it is an embedding. A reporter did with a bunch of people who were essentially deadheads for Trump rallies. These are people who would follow Trump's public addresses across the country.

They would fly and they would stay in each other's houses. They formed a little community of like the hardcore like these would be or the closest thing you would have to like the altar comforters and street fighters of the of the Nazi party if you were going to try to make the facile fascism argument but whereas those people were traumatized World War One veterans in Germany. Their equivalent here are all pre-diabetic senior citizens because for the young politics is as dead as it was before it was born that doesn't move people. The symbols have been exhausted so they've tuned out by and large people are still invested. In this are people who still have an investment in this system because it's don't serve them well enough. Their whole life and now their politics is this spectacle of of nihilistic excess and and it's fandom.

It is fandom and if you wanna explain if you want to understand January 6th it's not a coup. It's not a it was not an insurrection it was barely not even honestly a riot. It was well. It was a riot like when the Lakers won the the championship or like when Vancouver lost to Boston in the Stanley Cup. It is an excess of emotional feeling associated with a spectacle of mass expectation of mass into a it's like you're. It's the sense of being subsumed into a greater Consciousness that comes from Mass participation ritual Mass participation. The kind of things that make people's lives up when they're struggling for survival and for power over their lives. The political struggle that defined Humanity for most of its time but that has been superseded in America because we got bought out. Everybody got bought out all autonomy all ability to to have a mass. Consciousness like work on behalf of something Beyond Capital beyond the algorithm beyond the the inhuman imperative under undergirding everything all of that all that ability has been stripped of us depoliticized whether we live or die whether the oceans rise or fall. Whether we are able to keep our house or we have to sell it whether we have to go in the Pod and eat the bugs.

All of these decisions have been taken out of the realm of politics they're not considered by us so we can't struggle for them and there's no social order to back with like your material struggles. Beyond you know criminality or or something like that because if you want to express antisocial Behavior because all violence has been monopolized by the techno-capitalist state so you cannot struggle on your own behalf but in exchange you don't feel the need to struggle because you are otherwise compensated in the form of the dream of the hope of not the actual fulfillment of material. consumption homes consumer products conveniences and this is not anyone's fault because this change happens because the structure of capitalism accelerates accelerates proletarianization over time but not evenly and and the the role of the post-war. Specifically the American post-war government was to direct as much as possible. the misery of the building of capitalism World capitalism away from Americans.

At least the Americans who mattered that that was what government did existed to do to keep the people in the center happy enough to keep the machine going and that meant that doing most of the real exploitation out in the periphery in the colonies where there is nothing but a pure miseration and pure exploitation. But that is just abstracted away from the real lived experience of people. In the center. They get to benefit just from the excess and not feel the exploitation that's inherent in making that making these trade routes and creating these Supply chains and the difference between now and what we think of American government like the expectation that was created by the New Deal and everything is that the hose is broken and it's just it's hitting everybody. Now it was all the tank was filling but now there's nowhere else for it to go. Total immiseration is coming for people who were at the center and that is the all the entirety of our our political crisis is that reality is that emergence and what that means is that people are getting more and more anxious and they're needing their politics which is where they have subsumed away their their sense of any control over their lives because since the 70s there has been a general more generalized commiseration slowly but surely the ones who lasted the longest were the ones who got the homeowner deal. The ones who in 1980 were said look if you got a house by now congratulations. We're going to create a a bubble around this house that is going to make it turn it into a guaranteed investment a by a a a Solid Gold Bond that will always appreciate in value because it is supported by the entire structure of the United States government and economy. It becomes a load-bearing member foreign and so they got low property taxes. They got a reduced um income taxes a deregulated market for them to invest in. They got stuff out of it but their kids aren't getting that deal the people around them who weren't as lucky didn't get the deal and so they're feeling. The heat turn up but nobody signed off on any of this because the whole time this was happening.

Actual politics was turned into a pure spectacle of fandom where you go to seek the reason that the that soccer hooliganism exploded in England. After World War II is that you had the British of people who had been the most martial humans on Earth. People who had galloped through history at the at the drum beat of of a world destroying Empire where um where military service and and Military sacrifice was a defining feature of masculinity and just told no no. They don't. We don't do that anymore we don't do that anymore. Those animal energies got to go somewhere and if they're deferred from politics they go to some other public place public ritual that can allow people to feel communal for a minute feel like one one force feel like one mind even if it's around a spectacle an enjoyment a game a circus. It is a venting of that energy that cannot otherwise be satisfied. Because the rest of your life is determined by the patterns of the market and of exchange and you have no real autonomy. You cannot choose to do anything and that drains you and and alienates and it has to be emotionally grappled with and that's where it goes and it was traditionally sports but now it's become politics because politics has been totally removed from a question of accountability.

The reason these guys can do this stuff and care and to treat our institution so so cavalierly is because they know at heart more than the liberals do that none of them matter that might makes right. That that is it that the that all these niceties are a charade and so politics is this. It's a it's an Indulgence. It's an emotional Indulgence. It's a time to feel like you're in a room with other people who are also you and you get to see. Yourself reflected and validated in a way that you can't in a world where you are alienated against from yourself and so that means that politics becomes part of the spectacle of fandom and the ritual of fandom and that's what the Trump rallies were in. Our is a ritual of fandom transferred to politics which is why I think the best way to understand January 6th is as a sports riot and the thing that makes that meaningful is that this is all individuated. This is not a political act. They're not actually coming together as political actors. They're not imagining themselves capable of actually changing anything they can only express their libidos. They can only indulge and that means not cooperating that means not wasting any time. They could be selfieing themselves in front of Nancy Pelosi's office. They will not sacrifice anything from their pleasure. Their pleasure is why they are fighting this fight in the first place to protect their pleasure so why the hell would.

They give that up when they don't think it's possible when they have discounted because they have not lived it the viability of human connection that can supersede the algorithm of capitalism. No that is inexorable so what did they do. They wanted to overthrow the government how they were going to Mill around until somebody else did it and that is the key is that the American political subject is not political because he is always imagining that somebody else somebody has in the sense of some organization. Some abstracted mechanism that he is not part of will do it. But that's impossible we all it has to be us. We have to feel like it's us or else you're not going to move the goddamn wheel because otherwise everyone's going to hang back and do the least and do the most self-indulgent thing which is what all politics is.

Now everyone is mesmerized by the pleasure. Principle because it's all we think is real and Trump is like the Leading Edge of hysterical Boomers who are heading towards a death that they cannot comprehend trying to grasp meaning and and emotion and and and a sense of of genuine mystical like communal experience. In the short time they have left because everything else has been burned out. They're all Stephen paddocks. They're all husks. Nothing can get them off anymore because they're old and they're they're wasted up and the the and this is a new thing this feeling this pseudo-politics of of fandom. But it's purely motivated by selfish. Indulgence which means no one will actually do the work of politics. They will just Mill around and then the people who are paychecks are being signed by capitalism and which is has as its core objective maintaining.

The the schematic of American democracy quote unquote in order to maintain a minimal consent to fill in the gap of that it cannot be technologically imposed. Foreign. Yeah I mean these literally are people who thought the Rapture was going to happen and then Trump showed up and like it just became. They can't imagine Heaven anymore because it's coming too close they have to feel it in the world. They have to immunotize the eschatant they have to feel god well alive because they have no faith that there will be an afterlife because they are totally alienated because they've never had significant communal experiences that have bonded them to others that have given them definitions of words that are more spiritually invested than the ones that we just carry around in our conversation and so they're grasping for it. They're going to do it now but the only way they can do. It is just to in do it the way that you watch the other team the team the fan the celebrity. The the the the high priest basically like Trump is and it represents a force. Beyond you that you cannot impose upon. You're recreating a mythology in the in the Here and Now to make up for the one that you can no longer sustain in that thereafter because it feels too real and part of that I think is that these people have death drives. I mean it gets over. It's like oh Republicans are death. Cult. I mean sure capitalism is a death cult. I mean that doesn't really tell you anything about what to do about it.

It's just it's just a bumper sticker but um but in a very specific sense. I think that some of these people who are really committed to Trump are seeking an oblivion that involves him that are that are that want to die like in a way that a viking wants to die in the field of bat battle so that he can go sup with the Gods in Valhalla. These people think that if they die like in the orbit of trump in the trajectory of trump they will be absorbed into his light. In some way they will be lifted up and made they because they see him as them like it really is the thing they love about. Trump is the thing that is they were they recognize about themselves and so so they want to be validated by him. They want some validation from this other and to be subsumed in it and the only way to do that is to pursue life with purpose. But that purpose can only be rotating around the thing and feeling the Rays of it because you cannot imagine political subjectivity because it's been crowned out of you because we really are the stripped threads of society.

Here like we have bro for all. The reasons at the front for school and everybody's sense is described in the postmodernists and everything we have busted off the conveyor belt of class Consciousness and class formation because we've gotten to the terminal endpoint of capitalism. Whereas it's no longer it has fulfilled its historic role and it's still around. The only explanation for that is that it's superstructural. Powers have overwhelmed the machinery like the actual Machinery of human interaction and that so yeah they we are in.

We are through the Looking Glass in a real sense and our the the the task before us then is to live in that reality. How do we confront the truth of this and like cut through all of the wishful thinking that undergirds our libido politics and this is what happens these people. In this article are the op are the people who either cannot imagine or refuse to do that and therefore seek Oblivion like I think these people want to die in Trump's honor in some way. This this is one of my this sentence. This paragraph is one of my absolute favorite first of all among these group of people. one of the one of them dies is one of the first people to die of coronavirus in the country and it immediately shocks them and horrifies them but that they end up turning it into a motivate a story in their head about how it's actually Christie whitner's fault and they start. They keep traveling to these rallies even in like in empty planes because they're that devoted to it. They they refuse to believe the dangers there. They're like seeking to be around the virus but listen to this. This is my favorite paragraph when Randall psalm a 60 year old ex-marine with a long gray.

Mustache fell severely ill with a high fever and debilitating congestion. He refused to go to the hospital. He was a heavy smoker who was significantly overweight and knew he faced an increased risk of severe effects from covet 19. Still he refused to take a coronavirus test and potentially increase the caseload. On Trump's watch quote I'm not going to add to the numbers he told me. Tom survived the scare but died months later in a car accident while returning home to Minnesota from a trump boat parade in Florida. Now to me. This is a person who is seeking Valhalla in and where where all the gods are Trump and it's just Trump as a mirror telling him how great he is and how wonderful he is and how he's tremendous and how he's so special and how we love him and how we love him. Like these are War boys for Trump but what does that mean does that mean following someone's political directions.

Hey you know sees that building hey execute those prison prisoners hey show up for this meeting. So we all know what we're doing no no no no no. They watch the team on the field and then they get. They get their sense of pleasure and identity from a mutual experience of um um spectacleized Indulgence just a pure a sin if you want to get metaphysical about it like it's building. This entire device of of capitalism that is destroying the Earth and rendering to rendering it to the purpose of giving me. Everything I ever wanted even though none of it has ever made me happy put it in my mouth. Let me eat it num num num. Let me just have it I I need it.

I I cannot handle any less pleasure than I'm having right now and in fact even the thought that I might have less pleasure in the future than I have right now makes my current pleasure miserable but we still need to direct the entirety of the world economy. Around this thing we still have to have that goal the miserable Pursuit and consumption of of the of the limited resources of the Earth where all of the misery of capitalism is externalized in the form of art drive to consume which once it became the engine of the world global system. In the 19th century. You could argue that was the end of humankind and maybe we can fight it back but I mean for real that was very very bad because once that happens we will consume until it's exhausted because all social conflict is resolved through consumption.

Yes. There are Wars yes there's class conflict and there's political struggle but fundamentally the some aggregate of the Governmental policies of capitalist governments is to repress to the extent that you can and then increase consumption to the extent that you have to that is. The that is the the algorithm that is the decision Matrix repress until it becomes unsustainable because it undermines consensus government. It undermines the adherence the basic like Epi the basic like emotional adherence to the system of your subjects and so those people get benefits and you cut it along. Geographic racial lines you create bright lines that can be seen in the skin or an engender and then you at the top of the hierarchy that trickling down by off everybody. So the wealthiest get the most of course indulgent lives but then there are those below who get a little better and a little better and and the post-war Keynesian bubble was it filtering down for the first time to the working class and that meant that when the crisis of capitalism came in the 70s everyone was a consumer. They were not workers even if they lived worked working class lives. They were fundamentally estranged from politics by the experience of living that lifestyle where all of your anxieties all of your Social conflicts.

All of your alienation is can only be soothed. Can only be directly and and in the present sense extinguished through consumption through Indulgence you give up control of your life. You give up the ability to direct that animal energies and your bodies into anything Collective the reason that we send our young people to kill each other and Wars so they can vent off that sense of life that sense of wanting to actually assert control of their environment that capitalism denies them that has to be fented elsewhere ritually first in violence and then once you've got people comfortable enough in Leisure until they go insane and start up killing themselves which is what we're doing the West. The death of the West is that Suffocation by by Pleasure by consumption drowning in Honey awake in a dream from a great Clem's side song. The Secret rulers of the world secret rulers of the world. They have stolen my girl. They drifted away on a black limousine and that was the last time I'd ever seen. It's a good song. It really gets the whole Arc of modern politics.

It's like it's essentially like all every all of pension like just crushed into one's idea because we're we're all at the mercy of the lizards. All the mercy of the lizards that is the abstract the profit mode of expressed socially which is consumption. That is the the profit motive. The price signal expressed in Social reality is people maximizing their their personal pleasure as the homo economicus model says and what that creates is a system where decisions the degree to which a decision matters to the direction of the system is totally proportionate to how close they the people there are to the benefits of the system. The closer you are to the real gears when the thing formed and then the the more insulated you are and our political cultures. Are all just built around certain formations that show up at certain points in time and then responses to them like the binary between our early Yankee New England political economy and the later Southern agrarian Plantation slave one that has defined our politics ever since and that is distinguished by place in space-time not by anything else. Liberalism broadly defined was born in the county houses of New England. liberal conservativism broadly defined was born in the in the slave markets of of the South and those are places separated geographically and over time so that their political cultures emerge differently.

The the The plantation culture is the real tip of the Spear of capitalism and therefore it cannot afford itself the illusions of capitalism back in Boston but as done instead is that if you're on the top into Charleston Society you are presiding over slavery. The thing that makes it acceptable to you is the almost infinite amount of treats that you get out of it because one of the reasons that it's such a relatively inefficient system. Relative to capitalism in the north is that um is that there's no reinvestment really. Once you have a plantation. You just consume the the profits and that's why they lived so disgustingly. Lavishly the New England Puritans didn't have to live that way. They accumulated money and then they had a little house and they went to a little clapboard.

Shack maybe they had a bigger house as they got more successful but at no point did they need to could organize the round their life around those Pleasures they had sublimated and weigh a lot of that into their religious convictions into at that point their their Puritan calvinist beliefs but over time that translates into secular liberalism. But it's from the same associate some of the same Arrangement people doing Merchant capitalism which is clothed in rituals of consent and has certain understandings about what things like Liberty and freedom mean what these words mean are defined in that time and place the Rival was developed in the south. It grew in tandem with the north but at a slower Pace but was where the super prophets were to be found so it had disproportionate influence in the early days and later because it's where the prophets were even if there wasn't a political organization around it and so it was able to Stage a last-minute fight for its own Survival the way that the old regime always will because remember this is an attempt to re-establish or to resist capitalism. The imperatives capitalism through slavery. It was a rear guard action by the old aristocracy. The old land-based ruling party that was being overthrown over the course of the rise of modernity from the 7th 16th to the 19th century is what you're seeing that so it's all about access to treats.

Politics has become our politics shorn of class basis which we briefly had in this country from about the from the 30s until like the 60s you had a little brief period where there was an actual organized working-class access of Demands of political representation that had its own superstructure and its own its own counter hegemony. even though it was within capitalism but it was never strong enough to with to withstand the corrosive power of the consumer model to dissolve the capital the the Socialist movement from outside from by dispersing its membership into suburbs and making them into homeowners which makes them into Petty Bourgeois in a meaningful way to some extent. They're no longer simply workers and they live distance from one another and the time that they used to spend socially. Interacting is now created by. is now 10 now spent interacting with a pseudo. Community created in the media Space by capitalism foreign and now at the very end of this process we are a population who is to one degree or another fully alienated from politics. The younger people by and large have given up on anything happening anything changing through Collective action. Because they've never seen it work they have never seen an example of it. They've only heard descriptions of ideas that don't correspond to the life that they as they understand it and then you have older people who remember a time when there was a more coherent social Bond and that there was that there was some sort of social responsibility.

Beyond individual consumption but it's been so damn long that now their understanding of those Concepts is wrapped up in a bunch of other Concepts about identity about racial hierarchy and gender hierarchy. All these things that are wired in to living in a capitalist system are also there and it just becomes one part of a mosaic of Desire of things that is always going to be there but in years in in previous generations was was always undermined by the fact that you could vote as a worker in America and expect your interests to be actually represented in terms of trade policy and taxes and things like that and that handle broke in the 70s and so no one really thinks that that's possible anymore that you could get anything out of it. So what else are you going to vote for you're mostly still going to vote. Some of you aren't going to stop some of you are going to still vote and then who do you vote for foreign and then Trump comes along and he just represents this package of 

He is just the sum total of the culture that made him he is this sock puppet just filled with the tides of History. He is like a Napoleon in that he has embodied the moment but whereas Napoleon embodied the dynamic moment of capitalism in its birth liberal capitalism and its real birth on the continent. He was like there at the explosion of the the Big Bang Trump is sort of like Napoleon at the end of that and that he is here at after the energy has been totally dispersed and the thing is collapsing in on itself because all of the um the modernizing forces that Napoleon Unleashed on the on the world. The the modernization of legal codes the abolition of of feudal land tenure Jewish Toleration which sets the tone for like Cosmopolitan values associated with liberalism and capitalism. Foreign this Dynamo upon Europe and all the things that are created out of that unified nation state with a A a unified Nation say with a federal distribution of power strong and authoritative Central governments that that essentially coordinate National capitalist formations that maintain like a state competitive framework with one another and then within those the the systems of technology that connect these things into one holistic being and that they're and that create one citizenry like the the revolution in the Napoleonic wars were one of the big ratchets in making France into a thing because there are relatively few people in what is now France. Spoke even spoke French until the late 19th century that process that wrenching process happens all through the 19th century and it's brought in the beginning by the Napoleonic convulsion and it's a rationalizing process. But what it creates over time is what we have which is a system where the liberal imperative having overwhelmed Class. Consciousness is now totally Unshackled from any real technological constraints and can Now operate as a global hive mind of consumption and if Napoleon emerges from in one moment to take the reins of power and you know show the muscular power of liberalism.

Trump represents liberalism law exhaustion of all power to do anything because Trump is just the sock puppet that filled up Trump had no real politics. Trump had no real desire to be president. He had no organization. He had no ideology he had never planned to be president. He ran as a fit of peak and as a publicity stunt and he was able to win because all of the forces of global of of of American capitalism had come together to create a population of people who were fully atomized. Foley metabolized the conception of themselves as consumers their identity based around consumption identities that include a bunch of ideas about hierarchies and differentiations among age gender race but that are fundamentally individual and then interlaced with our class position but not as anything that can be determined like as the not that anything that's self-conscious just as the thing that sets the shape that people take oh.

 and that they are going to involve themselves in a politics that is entirely spectacle based where they have lost all belief that politics matters that politicians tell the truth that we what you vote for matters. Everybody absorbed the last 40 years from Watergate. To the the liberals have fantasies to try to deny that conservatives accept it that's the only difference once again that's because one of them loves doing rules and rituals to a better. Their Consciousness about being in capitalism and others just want to wield the ax and and so people are driven purely by their resentments their loathing of another their desire to see Politics as a conflict with the other where they're in existential threat and where they are at all points. Imagining the in some way the discomfort and pleasure of their enemy which is not a class enemy but is just this social Gorgon conjured up by are conjured up by our fantasies of These identities that we're protecting in the face of a collapse that we did not sign up for so everybody is one way or another disillusioned with the actual functions of democracy so that means that we can lose we can indulge ourselves and one of the big things that undermined me getting Trump right in that I was I failed to at every Point.

 assume he would win as soon as he showed up is that I thought more people had faith in the system enough to not want to see these structures defamed because Trump being running for president is degrading to the institution. It is degrading to politics in a real way and I assume that there are enough people especially people who voted who cared enough about these structures to want to see them preserved and it turns out no at the end of this thing at the at the old scared white end of this thing where culture where where precarity is purely a matter of an aesthetic revulsion at changing standards and threats to hierarchy that really doesn't have anything to do with your material conditions except at the bottom where it's less least organized at the top where it's most organized. It's just Petty Bourgeois grievance and if you combine Petty Bourgeois grievance with a system of telling you that actually it's very.

These things these institutions are all very respectable. They don't they're not filled with Liars. you should trust the media and you should trust political parties and you should trust science and they say yeah. This is all. If we if we get hamburger grease on the Constitution we don't have the Illusions about the system that you do because we don't require to live in denial because our political our political conception. Our toolhouse of our reality tunnel that we're boring through the world is determined by our class position and our cultural position and so Trump just shows up and he's like hey. I'm you I'm a famous cool guy who is as Petty and Vain and Persnickety and Miserable as you which means that he has the same things he doesn't like that. They don't like that means that he has the same things that he likes the same symbols. The same lazy symbols that they like like he loves the flag because he thinks America is him.

It's like these people love Jesus because they think it's America because they think it's them. It's pure narcissism which is all that a capitalist consumer economy can create as narcissists because that's where the price signal is generated by narcissism foreign who traveled the country and all they're ever going to do is go to rallies. All they're ever going to do is go to rallies and then if one if somebody says hey let's go to the Capitol. They'll go they'll storm. In then they'll wander around and take pictures just like you would do. If your team won the championship you go downtown. You maybe throw a police car over maybe you make love in the middle of the street. Then you go home because it's just a venting of energy. It is not a political Act.

They are venting off their native creative impulse. That is that as in creating the World by imposing your will on it which necessitates Collective action right now real expression of of of the of the will to human Liberty Power Freedom identity whatever you want to call it. It requires coordination and cooperation because right now we're all being ruled by the algorithm. Just that we are seeking the treats even as they run out and even as we recognize that they run out we are seeking the treats so that we can be the one to go last. If that's all we can hope from the future and it is. It does come down to your conviction your belief that there's another way that people can be that really is what it boils down to do you believe that humans can at a certain level and then that you have like a a you don't have everybody that's ridiculous at first or even in the very near term.

But you have a nuclear nucleolus of people who are able to generate a political cultural economic inflection point that pushes through the human population. The same way that individual Consciousness did the same way that the liberal identity was emerged from your just burst out of Europe in the in the 17 and 1800s that swept over the world. It doesn't have everybody now but it has it now has for a long time now hit an inflection point. I would say the inflection point is probably like 1989 where this is now the animating metaphysics of the global economy. The people who are actually around the machines that move the stuff around even though we have reached a point where we could program them differently. We would have to do it not any group within us. We have not had that transformation yet if you think that that transformation is possible that you get to a point where enough people motivated by a felt connection to others that allow them to transcend the Pleasure Principle.

The consumption principle enough to see that the problems in front of them to act spot together with the other people to create institutions of organization and then political power and that if that were even in the context of collapse and Humanity fracturing and the global supply chain breaking down still within this. The possibility that formations could survive that could eventually form the the nucleus of a revolutionized human subject. A situation where you have a global population that has the instinctive um emotional sense of obligation to every con theoretical person in their world as they do the people around them. If not at the same intensity. Then much closer than we have now which is zero where all human considerations are always sacrificed to personal consumption you got to ask yourself and if you don't if you don't think it's possible. If you think that that we were we are too alienated from each other that that this is sort of like the Christian case against socialism is you know when you.

Somebody bit the Apple you know there is no what you're asking for is something that would be in practice the coming of the millennium that would be having a that would be the the the the apocalypse like the good one and there can be no heaven on Earth. Not it's not for us. Here. It's for us in the Everlasting. That's what Christians would say. I think that heaven can exist on Earth at all points and it does exist on Earth in places where people have allowed it to exist. Little wormholes to Heaven and that the task of humanity is to unify them into one. one giant portal that allows us to step truly into another Dimension into another another Earth where we're all the same but different and I can understand if you don't think that's possible like I said it 

It is millenniary you know in a way that that the jaundiced late capitalist subject has a hard time believing it so and I certainly didn't for a very long time if pressed. I would say no no no no no because you're only seeing things from the outside. But I now know that experiences is what generates real knowledge not any kind of rational syllogism real knowledge comes from experience which is then translated into language that we use to convince ourselves that that experience was real and to Anchor it. And if that's true and I think it is if that's how we learn. If that's the real if that's the truth of epistemology. Then then every moment is absolutely pregnant with possibility no matter what the overbearing structures are because you still have to live and then you have to live with that. You have to live with that as the motivator so that you can be self-motivated to short-circuit the Pleasure Principle. You have to have a structure that can withstand the moments when you're not feeling so good and that has to be an architecture of of ideas and and proofs. But it's built out of the experience. It's a lot. It's it expresses itself as a result of the experience love. All objects in your perception right on right on peace and chicken grease guys. So yeah I mean I don't think I'm anywhere there near there. Personally I I believe but you know whether that belief still is enough to generate.

Action is intermittent at best. I must say but I have to also have faith that that'll change and that's what keeps me going. That's what keeps me hanging on funny thing is. Fukuyama was correct. It's so funny that people say he was owned. Fukuyama was right. It's just that what that meant what end of History meant is not what people were imagining because I think because of the normative assumptions that we have where you know if you're a guy like fukuyama who was a conservative and you're arguing that this is the end of History because of capitalism's Victory. You would sort of assume that that meant there and that's a good thing and that that's going to be good for us and we're going to thrive in that situation and that's the part that and that things are going to be peaceful and that's the part that got roasted by events in the 20th century. But if you remove that assumption that this mean that he's means and therefore that's going to be good for people. The argument complete is completely persuasive because since 1989 there has been no existing global Center for opposition to capitalism and therefore since there is no Center of opposition since it's since capitalism is one in every place except in you know like the naxalites are and like farc territory capitalism rules everywhere and that means that history has ended because that battle between classes has ended. The the ruling class has won and that means we get the common ruin that comes after but in the sense that in the sense the history did end and that the struggle for history in Cuba I would say is the best thank you for reminding me of Cuba. Actually.

I would say that Cuba really is if you want to have like a a a word to use for like that little flickering light in your heart that you've got to keep stoked that tells you you know that there is a new there is a different way to be. There is a different way to relate to the world that can allow us to act differently and not be overwhelmingly enslaved by the algorithm pulled by like iron filings by the algorithm and and it's hard to believe that practically. I mean you have to have like. That's why it has to be spiritual. But you know you also need examples in the here and now to claim to to draw Solace from if nothing else and Cuba has got to be it Cuba has got to be the name of the fire because like my God 60 tents and they did it and the thing is there's no way they could have done it. If it was a dictatorship. I'm sorry they couldn't have done it.

The math is pretty clear when you have a brittle dictatorship on top of that degree of social con social crisis they collapse. It is an X and Y problem especially being pushed over by the United States. On the outside. At the same time are you kidding me that is a textbook example of everyone. Every time you have that situation the regime collapses but it didn't you cannot say because it's dictatorship. No no dictatorships fall under much much less dire economic circumstances there's Democratic There is a broadly felt Democratic participation in government. They feel like they're actually in part of the thing that they're not passive Spectators to the thing they feel like they're part of it. You can argue with it as much as they are but they feel it and that means that in a crisis they will pull together a little bit and not push outward against the perceived cause of the problems. Of course I'm sure there's repression too but how could there not be. There isn't every.

Fidel died and everyone assumed that when Fidel died that it would just be instantaneously there'd be McDonald's on the Castro family. It's yeah. It's got to be you got to protect it. You got to protect the flame and that means of course every critical thing to protect Cuba which sadly for most of us isn't much. We can post about it but who knows something might occur. There's International. So we need more solidarity that's for damn sure but keep an eye out. I don't have any ideas though all right bye-bye.
