It's five o'clock on saturday regular crowd shuffles. In it's a pretty big crowd for a saturday and the manager gives me a smile because they know that it's me they've been coming to see. They forget about life for a while now. John is a real estate novelist never had time for a wife talking to davey who's still in the navy and probably will be for life. The waitress are practicing politics while the businessmen slowly get stoned they're sharing a drink. They call loneliness but it's better than drinking alone that's a terrible song billy. Joel people say he's bad. The songs are undeniably catchy which means that in a certain base way he's good like he's a good songwriter and that the songs are pleasing in some way to listen to at least a good chunk of them at least to the point that your brain wants to hear them you know but lyrically he is a very insipid uh musician. The one thing that's very interesting about his songs is how he is always the protagonist the voice of the song.

His perspective in the song is always yelling at people uh making demands of people criticizing people uh and is above them like he's either. If he's a character. Like in piano man. He's literally too good for the people around him. They put they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar and say man what are you doing here you're literally too good for us and then like so like moving out my god just like a bratty teen talking about how everybody else is working for the man but not me don't go changing to try to please me just finger wagging and uh and superiority and then if you and if there's a song that like the character is being criticized it's always from outside like angry young man that's him saying get a load of this guy you may be right. I may be crazy but I just may be the lunatic you're looking for or he's doing some very pretentious attempt to do a novelistic like character study like allentown or goodnight saigon.

But you know the songs are fun and honestly the chutzpah to write and then release um. We didn't start the fire once again all-encompassing narcissism. It's glorious but the interesting thing about joel is that joel hit his limit of talent and then tried to exceed it which is pretty rare because musicians tend to flame out early there's few there are fewer like long-term success. Stories or who are who get to a point where the pop format is no longer. Uh is no longer worth it. Like they've they've exhausted all the their uh all the possibilities of it from their point of view and so then they have to try something else if they're still you know challenging themselves. If they haven't checked out like mick jagger who's happy to sing satisfaction 400 times a year he tried to do uh classical music. He tried to release uh uh like I think it was like actual classical music like for or for an orchestra. You know no one liked it. That's like oh yeah.

There's that's actually the limit of your ability billy and I honestly think that might be why he keeps trying to kill himself with alcohol because he has not given up his fantasy of himself as a great artist that like justifies his torpor and said look. I'm a great artist look look at all the stuff. I've done but then you know he he ran out of stuff to do in pop and he tried to do some stuff in a more challenging more complex larger format art form and he was mediocre and so what's he going to do stop being a celebrity stop being resistant. No just going to dial it in at uh at madison square garden and should keep wrapping your bentley around trees in long island. Another guy who did that uh garth brooks by going to chris gaines thing uh and and honestly garth. Brooks's uh status is like the most well adjusted uh musical genius of american history.

His predict is proven by the fact that he got to the edge of his talent. His ambition met his ability and he just said oh okay and then he retired when when went to oklahoma and hung out with trisha yearwood. Then he did like a comeback a few years later a few years ago because you know he missed the big crowds but like he didn't feel like he had to be an artist anymore unlike billy joel who's cannot get over it. So he keeps divorcing younger and younger women and drinking more and more because if you're not going to come to terms with who you are after a certain point of hedonic pursuit. It's going to destroy you you're either going to turn into a piece of jerky uh like the siberic rolling stones or you're going to just be a big weepy drunk like uh billy joel uh or you're gonna keep pushing yourself uh until if you're good enough. You know you don't you you you find yourself uh finding satisfaction in the pursuit of a deeper art like the reason kirk gave cobain killed himself is because he knew he didn't have it in him. I just like emotionally to carry on the hard work of being an artist to what would be necessary to overcome the torpor of being a  rock star and so cashed his own check.

What are they going to do. I mean. The answer is for these people who are that pot successful and huge uh just do something else or don't do anything. But you have to have a certain degree of ability to just be with yourself to uh to ex to handle that and you know people like we explode out like our consciousness explodes out like big bang style and especially if you know as we find ourselves as like a total alienation at the end of history uh and our and what we're doing is we're fleeing from quiet. We're feeling from emptiness because emptiness is the true. The one true reality is the is the fundamental emptiness of the universe which when confron if you confront that fact and you like really live with it.


It makes uh living much easier. It makes you need a lot less but if you're escaping if you're fleeing from that emptiness if you're always trying to not be in a room alone with your thoughts. If you're always trying to have a earthly um pursuit to invest emotionally in a career a skill a hobby an ability that you can pursue artistic athletic business you could pursue and then on top of that personal pleasures you can pursue you know consumer uh the the things you can only get from from buying a giant house and having a  yacht and having a helicopter that goes on top of the yacht and if you're a musician and you are living by that relationship. At some point you have to mature you have to let go enough to not need to distract yourself so much but you're not getting that reinforced anywhere. If you're a success you just keep pushing and nothing and it all gives there's no resistance and so you press until you find resistance either by indulging yourself to the point of physical annihilation or pressing yourself uh demanding something of yourself artistically until you hit a barrier and of course none of this is to blame anybody like if somebody has adhd and they say excuse me. I can't sit with my thoughts it's literally impossible. That's because that's how we have been acculturated.

We live in a world where you can't do it where we have been so stripped from our bodies. We have been so disembodied by engagement with a pseudo-reality of mediated uh identity that we cannot be in our bodies. There's there's a constant panic because we live in a material world where we are finite beings but our brains are separate and eternal. How are you supposed to live trying to reconcile that every moment of your life. Your brain is the world. The universe all of time and space you are god because remember it is a soul consciousness that has no connection to any other consciousness but our bodies are the same material as everything else the same flesh as everything else governed by the same laws of thermodynamics as everything else in the universe and it is trending to death. It is trending to decay physical pleasure is trending towards uh redundancy and so we indulge the fantasy of immortality which requires distracting ourselves from our actual bodies. Our actual lives our meshed physicality that means we have to press the  pedal to the metal on making our encounters with our body purely pleasurable like when our body is going to be noticed.

It's going to be new notice doing something fun in tasting something feeling a a way uh having a urge satisfied feeling a sensory experience hedonic pleasure otherwise we don't want to hear from it and that means like you either take command of the world's resources and try to destroy it to the extent that you can in the world of business in in the in the struggle for control of the machinery or if you're born lucky but you don't have the stomach for that. You pursue the arts. I will be meshed in the system. I will benefit from it but I will not directly contribute to to the the carnage of it and the thing is that's reasonable why would anybody give up comforts that are all they have and then they compensate for the fact that they're doing all this indulgence by the fact that but I am also doing this artistic project. I'm I'm making people happy. I am you know there is a social affirmation of it and there is a combination of that artistic integrity and then the hedonic poll and there's this push and pull between them and the people who make it to old age and in rock and roll.

For example have been just turned into pleasure lizards where their humanity has been just totally vestigial but that means that they you know have to keep have to keep pursuing. This hit. This lifestyle that killed everybody else in their cohort that they just survived so yeah being a pleasure lizard is the best you can hope for because if you're here for a finite amount of time life is only going to get worse over time because you're losing time on earth and your brain can't handle it and you're being panicked about that emptiness that you cannot absorb and you cannot metabolize and the pleasures that you seek only become commonplace and become banal so that you're not even getting the pleasure out of it. The only pleasure you're getting is the pursuit of of a fantasy pleasure and the sadistic thrill of seeing others deny the pleasures that you have that's the best case scenario turning into donald trump. That's the best case scenario you're miserable but you're comfortable and miserable physically comfortable and miserable. Even if it doesn't give you any joy pleasure uh any comfort at all even that you're just screaming rat in a cage brain. Uh none of this has been to your benefit. None of it has actually contributed to to your happiness.

This is why the libertarian idea of the self of people motivated by self-interest creating a good society or just society is insane because that self-interest is not our self-interest. It is our self-destruction and if we and our society is destroying itself precisely because everyone is pursuing that the market only responds to people's death drive which is to say give me momentary pleasure in the here and now in exchange for uh oppression admiseration uh uh carbon emission misery dealt somewhere else to someone else and that the that that is the we imagine capitalism as transactions right freely arrived at transactions. They're not freely arrived at and the thing that makes them not freely arrived. At the coercion is the violence done to the biome and to people that is not calculated into the cost of the transaction and that is a negative feedback loop that undermines our ability to uh sustain ourselves meanwhile pursuing pleasure denying like your body denying your connection to anything outside of yourself pursuing. Just hedonic pleasure makes you miserable the more you get it. Rich people are not happy.

This is the important thing if anyone is watching the white lotus on hbo. It's very good. This is what it's about basically rich people are not happy. They are comfortable. They have these things that we connect to some degree with a basic you know quality of life maslow stuff. Like food shelter security.


They have those things but their subjective subjective experience of it is of discomfort anxiety misery which they could have had if they were poor and we wouldn't have to have a world that is choking on their  consumption. The excess of their of their pursuit of something that they can't have and all and the algorithm of capital is is psychologically wrapped around that impulse and that means create a machinery of of of surplus value creation that can be monopolized by people who need greater and greater con indulgence to soothe their alienation from their bodies and from the world around them so to get to black jacobins. This perfectly describes the situation in haiti and it describes slave uh slave social orders ever in the new world. Everywhere more of these people were able to just sit around and enjoy luxuries with people literally being whipped within earshot. The more luxuries they needed the difference between capitalism the difference between if uh slavery and the more efficient labor uh regime. The capitalism developed and refined out of contact with slavery.

Uh is that profits under northern capitalism as as as it was devised in the cities of england and then in new england. Uh reinvests profit certain percentages kept for for for the capitalists but beyond. A certain amount profit is reinvested in the company. That is where the growth comes from. That's the engine of the whole thing under the slave regime and this is why slavery is a less efficient system and why once it comes into conflict political conflict with uh labor capitalism. It's gonna lose as the north law as the south lost it's because that profit gets privately consumed nobody you don't need to reinvest beyond a certain amount. There's only so much land you can realistically hold. There are only so many slaves you realistically need to hold it and if it's cotton you have very little capital investment rice. The same thing the diff sugar is different and sugar helped create sort of a uh. The closest thing that the slave agri economy had to a proletariat because it was relatively capitally in capital intensive. You had like little miniature manufactures on plantations in order to take the sugar cane and turn it into the paste that could be stably shipped. You had to do that on site. It couldn't just be shipped to another processing place. The way that cotton could but even then there's a limit to how much you have to invest once you've recap once you've made that capital you just have to maintain it because there's only so much sugar.

There's only so many place things you need what you do with the rest of it. Is you consume it you sit in the you you either uh go to paris so you can have more fun in the in the temperate regions or use. If you don't have that much enough money to do that yet you spend it all sitting sweating in your  brought to justice by the people that you're exploiting to make this happen and as our global ruling class begins to have the same relationship to us emotionally that those french planters did to their slaves you're going to see and you are seeing. This insane. Explosion of consumption billionaires now aren't at the top unless they can go to space. They have to bid up experiences among the rich because thanks to our global village that we live in. They are as aware intellectually of the exploitation that goes into their consumption as a haitian slave owner was to his fortune you had. Bezos say in this stupid cowboy hat thank you to all the amazon customers and employees who paid for this. Those stakes are only made possible by the amount of money involved by the amount of misery caused by that money and the amount of misery that these rich freaks feel themselves and can only extinguish through consumption and that's why we're at the end of this thing. We're now because this is not anyone's individual choice because these decisions are made below the level of choice by the by the profit extraction mechanism that is carries out through the technological structure and you know when I say technological. I just don't mean computers and the internet and  uh container ships and factories.

I mean governments languages. The entire human apparatus of extension of human will wrapped around one human will the abstract human desire abstract human hedonic desire. All of technology wrapped around that spoke and it's pulling the skin off of the earth and so these rich people at the top who are basically along for the ride and have to spend all this money and and and create all these fantasies of eternal power to make up for the fact that they all know at a certain level that they're not actually in charge. They have been disabused. The 20th century was one big psychic break as every class everywhere came in contact with capitalism in its final form and reckoned with what it would mean for their identities and they fought back one way or another and then they were accommodated into the system. One way or another and now we have a ruling class that used to have a a basis of power in land that was only constrained by other humans and god which just meant their conscience that was power that was power through human history but in the european struggle for dominance. These earthly powers unearthed the demon they dug too greedily and too deep and brought forward.

This machine that they wielded in battle with the other european powers to preserve their position but then over time saw their position overturned saw their power evacuated democratized into a bourgeois state structure that would carry out the will of no individual person but also not the people as early liberals thought they were going to do who didn't understand what technology would do to it. Marx understood what technology was going to do to this relationship. It was going to not be on behalf of the people human beings. It was going to be on behalf of the id of the middle class and that has been what has driven politically the structures of liberal uh uh order ever since and there was strike against that there was a fight against that everybody fought against that the old ruling elite fought against it from the  english civil war to the french revolution they fought against it. In 1848. They fought against it the workers or or the former peasants being pulled into industrial relationships pulled into a proletarian either pulled from an artisan class or two uh to a from the artisan class or from the peasant class turned into a new urban proletariat who could only sell their own labor. They fought back too from the peasants wars to uh their sides within all these conflicts because you know they they often supported the immersion bourgeois because they were the most coordinated and organized and motivated. They were the progressive historical force.

They took power. They seized controlled the state mechanisms on behalf of a notion of democracy that had that was theoretically in in their minds at that point encompassing of some group that was beyond themselves some group that was composed socially but it was never the case. It was always the individual id of the unorganized lump and middle class operating as independent beings without a coordination. The way that the working class was able to create coordinated mechanisms of asserting power through labor unions and political parties and through the soviet union the china the and all the uh post-colonial uh nationalist and communist movements. All of them failed wars. Emerged. Millions died in the fight between these three forces and what emerged was this new social order governed by no human consciousness. No human will and you can call it technology or you can call it capitalism. It's the same thing in the end because if it's just a machine it is a machine that is programmed by people and those people operate through structures of political and economic and legal power that are created by this machine or by this social uh formation. There's rich people but they're essentially along for the ride. They're there to move money around. They're not there to actually enact a will. The closest thing we have to a will is the is the uh outcome of the democratic process in the form of the collective desires of the middle class which in america thanks to our free real estate and the fact that we could create a.


Subject cast that was outside of the realm of pure of full uh political subjectivity that middle class included a lot of the workers included a lot of people who were workers and had a relationship to the means of production that under marxist orthodoxy should have pulled them towards class consciousness. But the creation of that the fortis compromise shattered the the uh conveyor belt that led working experience to working-class consciousness because instead of living in tenements in the packed streets of europe the way that marx imagined uh working-class people and that american working class had been like. In the early 20th century. They were pulled out of those relationships and put into the gentry life of a low landowner. They were given the yeoman dream minus subsistence which is the important part. They have lost the subsistence that yeoman had that gave them freedom and independence from having to sell their labor. Now they have to sell their labor but in exchange they get land and they get an investment instrument that gives them the same material interests in the uh up in the continued health of the capitalist economy that the ruling class do and so when the crisis of the 70s happens. By this point the working class can no longer express itself as the working class in the political realm. All you have instead are a bunch of working-class people voting subjectively as their along allegiances to a fake pseudo class of middle of of yo of homeowners that had the trappings of class because hey honey I am a little bit of a capitalist. I have a capital asset if I have a home so like. I'm not the same. I'm a still worker but now. I also am a little bit of a capitalist so that means that that's part of my understanding of myself and my interests that I put alongside my working class identity but as long as there is a political structure that allows me to express my class interests. My working-class interests I will vote for that but aft.

But by the 60s the two parties had headed off the threat of populist revolt from below broken the back of the working-class political uh power through taft-hartley uh and so and and suburbanization the carrot and stick of the red scare and taft hartley plus high wages and levitt towns. So that because the democratic party essentially strangles its own connection to the work or strangles. The working class within its coalition replaces it with this new consumer identity where the working-class people are now. They are still part of the coalition of democratic voters but where they were a coherent working-class project within the democratic party. They are now just more voters along with the urban professionals who vote for democrat democrats uh and the southern rural types who vote for democrats. At that point. They're all just part of a coalition of individual voters who perceive themselves as capitalists. Because that's what's on the agenda now taxes and social policy. They've given up hope of control of actual production which is the end goal of union organizing and the working-class movement. The teleology and all movements needed teleology uh of uh the teleology of the socialist movement the working class movement. The labor movement is control of production not extracting higher wages not getting a house in the suburbs control of production but taft-hartley. The red scare had broken. The back of the labor movement made it so that it couldn't grow as large grow at the same speed and wouldn't have the same active. Uh ideologically committed leadership that was destroyed by the red scare.

So since the democratic party is a bourgeois party controlled by the bourgeois always was even during the great the new deal. It reassert that that the uh the bourgeois interests reassert themselves completely. They no longer have to contend with the working class within the democratic party and so politics becomes a question of responding to social ferment that is created by uh structures that have been deemed beyond politics and so when the crisis of the 70s comes to answers that the working class should have been demanding like okay. This is the point when capitalism has reached its full. It has exhausted its social role its progressive historical role but where is the working class it's gone. It's been turned into people in the middle class people in the uh who are responding to politics through a cultural screen and caring about things along the lines of their cultural uh conception because now they are middle class which means they are consumers because you're either the the the the dividing of the old socialist division of the world between makers and takers is correct. There's those at the top who eat on from the sweat of the brow of those on the bottom that's always been and always is the case.

The difference is that this subjective experience of being in that relationship differs depending on what your job is. There are a lot of people who technically are exploited in that their surplus value is taken by their employer but who don't really feel that way. Because the job they do is pleasant the job they do gives them meaning the job. They do provides a sense it is not alienated from them the time they spend doing. It isn't fully alienated the way the time that a 19th century laborers time at the line was fully alienated. No brain no choices to make no will to assert just carrying out a mechanistic. Uh act mind numbing time on life time on earth that you'll never get back alienated stripped from you being at the center of the  post-war empire. This thing made of technology that requires all these super structures within it to function this this architecture. This cultural civic architecture gives a lot of jobs that can provide meaning because they don't involve a lot of physical exertion unless it's met with uh independent ability to decide what to do with their time on the job. So you need some combination of that and that is affordable under the fortis compromise because all the real exploitation is being done at the end of the supply chain under the auspices of local local bourgeois powers that are essentially clients of the united states and even those factory jobs that the the guys that the the relatively alienating factory jobs uh that the early these new home owning working-class people had they were. It was.

It was uh you know. The alienation of it was undermined by the fact that they did have access to a home. They did have access to conveniences. Of course it topped out and there was a lot of alienation very quickly building up because hey everybody everybody else gets to hang around in cities drinking coffee and writing reports and and and they get to have the same lifestyle as I do. But I still got a whole. I got to still  press this button and the levittown or uh the lordstown strike uh which was part of the big labor crack up of the 70s. Uh was a strike that expressed that reality uh young guys who were brought to this new state-of-the-art facility and given good paying benefits and houses struck because the work sucked if you create a society around people sitting around having leisure people whose work is not is alienating are uh. Their enjoyment of that life is made less by seeing other people have better and so they get resentful.

Everybody gets resentful that's the middle class existence is precarity being stuck between isolated with no class. No solidarity stuck as a pure subject of capitalism and that is why the middle class in control of politics leads to annihilation because it is miser. It's this social misery that doesn't have the ease of wealth or the solidarity of poverty that wields the machinery towards annihilative ends because it's just a machine of resentment from everybody feeling resentment. All the time and the thing is is that on the other side of that divide the people who do get to sit around on their ass. They are feeling misery because they're seeing all the people who don't get to do what they're doing and they're feeling guilty about it and they feel responsible for it and then they have to build up castles in their minds to understand uh why it's okay that they're in this and that involves them being better than other people. It involves them being better than the retrograde better than the the spoiled factory workers who are still racist so is either guilt or resentment in the middle class when I say middle class. I mean not an actual class homeowners precarious homeowners. Let's put it that way precarious homeowners not in the sense that they are either at risk of losing their home or they know. They have uh kids who aren't going to be able to have homes and who's and and that their home that they if they sell it is not going to provide for their kids or they see their family line declining the thing.


That's wrong with the pmc. Discourse is because it's supposed to describe just these people and I think that the the the professionality of it is beside the point. What matters is what is motivating their politics and the answer is it is. It is a expression of their alienation from within a system where they perceive themselves as receiving the benefits of capitalism but are still miserable and that means the pmc would make is the same thing as mega. It is people in the middle section who do not have the comforts of solidarity uh or full security and therefore power their politics through a lens of resentment and self-exculpation like everyone talks about how you know people pointed out like the republicans have more fun because they get to transcend norms and they get to trigger the libs. But the problem with that is that it means that they have to like get genuinely upset when colin kaepernick kneels that's not fun like these guys talk about how like they hate football. Now. It's like of course none of them. They all said we're going to boycott it. They still watch football but they like it less they have less fun watching it. But they have to to sustain their identity as as as republicans as as good people in their understanding of it means pissing off liberals and that means being pissed off at what liberals do. It's resentment politics across the board. It doesn't matter if you're in the cities uh working as a graphic designer or you're a  uh uh adjunct professor or you're a teacher or you're a nurse. None of these like oh are you a working class or none of this. None of these fine grade cheese whether you're some sort of urban whitish worker or you are a landlord in in lubbock. If you're a  uh beautiful boater somewhere in the hinterland. Your politics are not motivated by attachment to material interest. They are motivated at base and at at the level below consciousness of a desire to punish your enemy. Politics cannot change material conditions you believe that if you're a  homeowner you have benefited enough from the system over the your life that you are committed to it ideologically as in below consciousness. So you're not looking to rock the boat you're not looking to change capitalism you're looking to make the system more amenable to you and that means sure in your in your conscious mind. I'm gonna. If you're if you're a pmc liberal we want to raise up the poor benighted minorities but in practice you know they're not going to rise up because of the racist whites so what you can do what you can root for above. Anything is the racist whites to suffer same thing goes for the boat owners petty bourgeois whatever streamers anybody who is at the capitol whatever they are motivated by a desire yes to defend america and to be able to consume all they want and drink all the beer. They want and eat all the the burgers.

They want and not wear masks and trigger the libs but once again their ability to make that decision is going to be uh squeezed by forces that aren't political what they can do is. They can root for the suffering of the libs. It's a pure resentment politics that is driving the system towards uh collapse because you are talking about a situation where there is a fundamental uh dissolution of the social uh basis of of the fiction of the united states of america. The only question is it will there be enough uh uh material uh intervention in people's treats to break their balance because right now they're happy to just post. They're happy to vote for politicians and observe this thing through the lens of of uh of uh. The pure removed spectacle but if actual privation enters the period if they don't don't they go from actually being afraid of losing uh like basic stuff not freedoms abstractly but actual pleasures and and and then actually losing them. They're gonna need to enact their politics more and more but again that requires a larger economic crisis that I don't. I'm not smart enough to be able to predict but like you that's how it would happen. If america cracked up. It wouldn't be a civil war. I don't think it wouldn't be divided along those kind of lines because it really is an urban suburban rural conflict. It is fixed. It is the small. It is the centers of of localized power in the the interior of the united states versus the concentrations of finance capital in the cities and the cultures that those two capital formations generate and like this creates competing realities people seem to be very.

I'm kind of baffled by how much inc has been spilled talking about um the  vaccine and why people won't take it and what to do about that and how to get them to take it first of all. A lot of people aren't taking the vaccine because they don't trust they. They have no trust in the system and it's a non-ideological non-branded distrust of the system uh and that is absolutely understandable because if you have not gotten a good deal out of this thing like you didn't get a  house in the suburbs out of this thing. Then maybe you don't want to hear what they have to say and like people who just don't believe. It's free or believe that's not safe but then you've got. People who are as part of their identity. As part of their brand have decided that they cannot uh they cannot be themselves if they get the vaccine. Their rejection of of the system is very selective like the basic premise of capitalism. The basic premise of the united states and its structures the constitution they absolutely absorb. That's what they contribute to their their uh happiness. That's such that they have it and their comfort and security. But it is the use of those structures by others that renders them corrupt. What that means is that as things get worse as their property increases as their sense of control over their life drains as their even ability to get all their treats under kova gets compromised uh their distrust and hatred and alienation from this system. Uh intensifies and by now to them what that miss system means is the cultural expression of the system because what else could it be. That's all we have. What do. We see through the looking glass and what the alienated conservative sees what the alienated landed homeowner and people in those in the cultural jetty created by those structures what they believe uh what they see rather through. Culture is this culturally alienating display of values that have nothing really to do with economics. No matter how much they talk about. Communism goes down to identity because this is all about individuals trying to see themselves affirmed through the cultural lens. They see an other. They see someone of a different race. They see somewhat of a weird gender and they see that affirmed as above them in the zero-sum game winner take all hellscape of america.

They say no thank you what that means is is that whatever they get from that apparatus things like and and when I uh things like analysis of a vaccine awareness of or or uh. The the media the government specifically agencies like the cdc bureaucracies when they come together and say something is happening and assign values to things. They reflexively reverse them. They reflexively reverse it so when science and the media and facts come together to say there's a virus that's very dangerous they hear either. There isn't a virus at all or if they can't accept if they can't uh believe that anymore the virus is not dangerous because it's being said by their enemies so it cannot be true. The virus therefore cannot be dangerous and then when they say hey here's a vaccine for that uh virus by the way it's safe that means the vaccine is dangerous. There's nothing it's nothing more complex than that what is said by all the things the reason it's baffling to people is because they see these institutions the cdc. The media government facts science. They see these things as the expression of an independent structure that is not political that has an objective ability to differentiate itself from interests and then tell people the truth which is the liberal fantasy and this is the end fantasy of liberals. The liberals are committed to the illusion that there is such a thing as a non-political uh structure. The conservatives have lost that illusion they don't believe that if they ever did liberals believe that these institutions are transcended of politics in a way so they are baffled. This is a why do you think that a um a dangerous virus isn't is safe and why do you think that a safe vaccine is dangerous and the answer is because they think that those institutions are on your side and that you are in charge of them and these largely write about that when it comes to the aesthetic showdown over culture. The people who make up these institutions are disproportionately liberals so you there's no strategy you can coordinate from within these institutions that will reach them because they are reversing the meaning as they receive it and you wonder why are the liberals still believing in institutions why are they because of course.

There is a the critique of of that argument is not reactionary. It's a heart of the socialist critique of capitalism that there is no such thing as a non-ideological non-uh partisan institution within a within a government government is the standing committee of the bourgeois that carries out the bourgeois will through its organs so that means all of its structures are organized around that bourgeois will and so socialists have disabused themselves of these fantasies at least a lot of them. Some of them still hold on conservatives. Reactionaries have fully given up the idea that there's a non-political institution why are liberals holding on well amongst politicians amongst in within the political class. They're holding on because the fiction of independence of institutions is central to the democrats argument for themselves as a party. They say we can work through these institutions to achieve these ends because our will can be shift. Our will could be expressed your will can be expressed through us and then through these institutions. But of course it can't be their will is disconnected from the machine. The machine operates by the will of capital because now there is no working class to pressure from below. There's just a bunch of working-class people who think of themselves as either homeowners or republicans or democrats who are think of themselves as consumers. But they don't know that they think their class interests.

A lot of them think their class interests are still being represented but they're not. They can't know that though so they have to be validated in the idea they have to continue to validate the idea that there is a independent structure because if there's not then the democratic party shouldn't exist. The democratic party is a rent seeker in the political structure because it literally says I will help you fill out these forms. If people knew that it doesn't matter what the forums say that there's no reason to have the  democrats there to fill out the goddamn forms but for the liberal voter uh in large the generalized liberal voter someone who thinks of themselves as with it with the people someone who's someone who thinks of themselves as vaguely progressive in some sense why do they believe in these the independence of these institutions. It's because they can afford to because they amongst the people who actually make up the party and make up its media representation and make up its uh party apparatus that actually coordinates how it's gonna run. Not according elections are beside the point the parties decide who is going to fill them specifically the democrats. They have to believe that these institutions work because it's they're participating in them that makes it work that makes them worthy of being. Rich makes them worthy of of benefiting from exploitation. Now there are plenty of working-class people specifically working-class people of. Color who vote for democrats genuinely out of a desire to see their interest fulfilled their material interests fulfilled but that's because the republican party by definition cannot allow them to see their benefit their their because they because a lot because black people have the closest thing to class consciousness. We have in this country because of the of their relationship to the fact that they never got the deal they never got the post-war deal. They never got bought into the system uh by and large of course except I'm talking about like the center of gravity. That's the that's that's the real generator of racial disparity into the 21st century is that they were not brought into full rights after the war. But they keep voting democrat because they think there's some reason there's some institutional validity within these structures and that and that by voting for them I i am protecting myself in some way. But the people who are better off who actually staff the the party provide the majority of the money for the party write about it and our media members are well off are comfortable and therefore are able to devote a lot of their time and energy to soothing their neurotic guilt of their wealth. Because remember the distinction between democrats and republicans liberals and conservatives is geographical. It is how close are you to capitalism. The republican worldview has been generated by landed power in this country either in the form of uh plantation agriculture or the financialized uh fully capitalized capital portfolios of the people who followed in their footsteps. The beautiful voters the franchisors.


The extraction industry members was based on intimate association with the rituals of capitalist exploitation uh northern finance capital was conceived and uh executed by people sitting far removed from capitalism carrying out ritualized exchanges in abstract symbols that kept the reality of capitalism at bay and that's the very thing that allowed them to treat uh industrial workers. So terribly I've talked about george fitzhugh before george fitzhugh was a uh southern theorist of slave power. A slavery apologist from before the civil war was the only really intellectually coherent uh and and thoughtful person to ever argue in favor of slavery uh because he did not distinguish in his prescriptions between races. He said slavery is not only good in the south. It's not only good in relations between africans and the europeans. It is good in all relations between men because the abstraction of capitalism allows capitalists to let the market do the violence to their workers and then not have to not feel guilty about it and therefore not have to build politics around absolving their guilt. Around it. It wasn't just that that uh owners had a stake a literal investment in the health of their slaves. It was that they had a proximity to them and that would in his mind create obligation bonds of obligation and what capitalism would do does is. It dissolves bonds of obligation.

You are no longer obligated because it isn't you doing anything. Nobody is doing anything supply and demand are doing the work so urban laborers can live in monstrous conditions of filth all through the 20th. To the 19th century you saw a stunning uh trajectory as as america's wealth exploded after the civil war. Americans average americans uh life expectancy. Uh average size general health number of teeth in their  head went down how could that happen in a nation of free people because it wasn't the act of a tyrant. It wasn't the act of overlord.

It was lines on a goddamn chart and we're living at the end of that now where our politics is completely dominated completely dominated by this because these are the actors the politicians are the actors. The companies are the actors. Everyone else just gets to react which means we don't get to create meaningful counter culture. We can't do detour mod. We can't do  fraud because there is a genuine belief that because the democrats are are are squatting on this tradition of being the party of the people that they no longer hold. Therefore we can try to make the republican party the party of the people because one of them has to be the party of the people. Like no there hasn't been a party of the people for you could argue 50  years and there barely was one when there when we did have it so the idea that one has to be part of the people that was a historical anomaly created by the great depression. We now live in the in the aftermath of that where the working class has to reconstitute itself through struggle. Somebody says if the dems lose that's bad yeah it is but what does that have to do with any of us. We cannot coordinate our votes enough to matter.

We are all  podcast. We are remainders of the political equation so me caring about who gets in doesn't matter. Obviously there are butterfly effects that affect every decision but at the level of who's president. I think 2020 should have proven that this whole thing is beside the point. It is a busy box for the anxious downwardly mobile children of this home owning class who aren't going to get the home and are freaking out about it yeah. I do keep saying the same thing over and over again. I've come to terms with that what I appreciate is that I i feel like I am refining my conception of it so that I can communicate it more easily now of course that doesn't mean everybody my god. Now. The whole point is that we're dealing with populations demographic tranches and within a demographic trench. It's a big venn diagram. Some people feel some part of it. Some people feel other part of it but they overlap to create a demographic tranche and that demographic tranche is culturally enacted to them.

The republican party the project of like national ravanchism that they represent the middle class revolt. The petty bourgeois revolt that they represent is culturally anathema and it's not going to not be. Some people are going to trickle over but it's just it can't because like these are deeper like. I said these are deeper than your knowledge. These are deeper than your conscious thought of who you are and what you care about. They structure your desire so by and large. They are anathema to the republicans. So it's not like they can go over there like everybody moving to new hampshire and becoming a libertarian.


That's the principle is the same either way. It can't work because the thing that defines these demographic tranches is that they are just a exposed facto description of a group of people there is no coordination between them. They participate in culture together but they do not meaningfully coordinate action. They just expressed the same preferences through voting because of their general demographic trend trunks. Yeah you go you won't get that trunks oh you won't get one damn tron. You getting one of them trunches oh yeah. You gonna have a good time. I'll guarantee so they can't do anything with do. What they do which is respond to things. Vote don't vote. But the the decisions are being made by voters groups of voters. Demographic groups of voters whose commitments are completely different who's whose understanding of all the words that we use to describe politics are different have different connotative meanings. It means that they see politics differently. They respond to events differently and it means that they are stuck in this uh hollowed oh what do you call it a holodeck. Middle class politics is a holodeck bunch of people worrying about losing their homes worrying about their kid.

Not leaving the house worried about me about their mortgage but fully committed to capitalism. Fully aware that the system as it exists benefits them and see change to it as a threat to their security and they're the ones having this argument between the democrats and republicans that's playing out in policy and it's playing out in culture. We can only respond to it until we build something orthogonal to it and that is the hope that is the hope that lies at the end. Everyone has to take the black pill it's like getting chickenpox. You have to accept that there is no hope because it shouldn't be about your long-term interest in the future that you're going to be investing in you have to sever that connection you have to make your moral decisions in the present.

So you gotta take the you take the black pill. You still gotta get up in the morning and everybody just decided to be a doomer that's  miserable they're miserable. That is the ultimate rejoinder is that these people are not having fun so you reinvest you recreate meaning out of in my mind the contingency of history and also the duty to leave a mark that others can follow to leave a trail to leave a trace in any way and I don't just mean by posting or doing what I do I mean organizing making decisions in your day-to-day life putting out more good than you take from it and so you metabolize oh okay. This isn't real politics oh that died 40 years ago oh. We are just rearranging deck chairs truly on a titanic where the the the uh the captain has lashed the wheel to this to make the the lash of the wheel to the side. Uh has nailed has nailed the door shut and shot himself but you know we're still here and if counter hegemony is the only thing that can challenge capitalism it can be built. The rudiments of it can be picked up later by other people even if you aren't able to build it. It's liberating exactly there's two things you can be.

If you really want to stay on the treadmill. You could be a pleasure lizard or a pain pig and the pleasure lizards are the beautiful boaters are the are the are the villages. People are the resentful petty bourgeois. White suburbanites and the pain pigs are the urban professional class homeowners and if you stay in the in the on the holodeck you're gonna you're gonna destroy yourself trying to conform to their politics so yeah. I had for I talked about how is that don't be an  party. Those aren't very catchy slogans and also as people pointed out. It's vaguely derivative of uh south park uh I'm sorry of uh team america. Although I would contend it's different because that idea the the tribe the the uh the team america thing by creating  part of the triumph uh of the triad there uh is is that's the the same thing as the uh as the sheepdog in the american sniper cosmology. It's made up. It's not a thing. It's a fantasy.

It's the reactionary fantasy that goes with the institutional fantasy that the liberals have but anyway for those reasons get rid of don't be an  party are the pleasure lizards but they're all miserable. None of them are happy for a minute even though they get to do whatever they want for the most part buy. Whatever they want for the most part have whatever fun they want to have for the most part but it is that most part that drives them insane. They're denied everything they ever wanted and even if that's unrealistic and impossible they're going to keep pursuing it forever and then as their misery increases their desire to see their enemies punished will eclipse all other considerations in politics purity versus superego with the poor ego the poor the poor people themselves being destroyed being strangled being broken away until all we have are these these monsters who have lost their humanity.

The human part will have been broken off when the walls go up and we get the little compounds based around these identities that we are going to call governments and they're going to have their little techno feudal uh armature of a coercion. Everybody inside that circle is going to be a monster because the real human thing that kept them connected to to a a full. Human consciousness was the people who are on the other side of that  wall who've been dissolved and the real fear I think that a lot of people have not everybody but a lot of people who really invest in online politics have and the thing that fed it. They and the reason that they are terrified of global warming and its consequences in the future is not because there's going to be a climate collapse that kills them or makes them have to live in a mad max world. I think they say that I think that is actually their pleasurable fantasy. The thing they're really afraid of is ending up inside the circle and having to live as a monster in order to preserve their comfort and I would say that I am one of those people I am way more afraid of that than I had of the system breaking down and me having to fend for myself free of the of the shackles of of precarious indulgence so once again. I did not really talk about uh black jackets which is fine because I didn't really finish reading it and I said it would so either friday or next week.


We will talk about the rest of blackjack events but we'll see catholicism is catholicism. I think has its virtues because it does it emerged from a a social context that involved human relationships you know where there was actual power in human hands and therefore responsibility in human hands. Technology has wiped that all out so that's why capita and one of those technologies that wiped it out was protestantism which was a spiritual solvent that dissolved the bonds that had kept up the feudal order and allowed the market logic of capitalism. To arise what that means is we can't go back to catholicism that is undialectical. It's got to be something else something that is as universal as our imagined understanding of humanity is the benefit of technological. Uh intimacy is that we do know that we're one p one species. Now we really do know that we're one species now and so that means that our religious conceptions should be emerged from that awareness. Instead of out of the parochial fixedness of our previous pre-capitalist religious formations. We need a new one. We need a new religion we need blockchain. We need a new religion. We need a lot of stuff so the challenge of the moment is letting go in a time of terror because comfort I talked about how comfort breeds neuroses. But a certain degree of comfort is necessary to prevent the emergence of deep neuroses around the fear of genuine harm and danger. Like I don't think buddhism works.

Either buddhism is just as geographically and temporally fixed as any of these other religions. None of them are going to feel natural to people outside of certain frameworks. They're going to feel alien that's true of all of them. It's going to have to be a a a religious vocabulary that encompasses everybody and that's not true of any of the conditions. The existent religions because they're all forged in fixed pre-capitalist social relationships that persisted through time and space and that means that they cut that they were instrumentalized by the ruling power of the time and have been instrumentalized by capitalism. There's a reason that the ideal spiritual life is one cap is one where you don't really encounter anybody. It's either a hermit in a cave or a part of a monastic order where you have self-sufficiency and stability and no responsibilities or minimal minimal exchanges with strangers with non-intimates with people who might bring heat might clash with you and that's not realistic for us and I think every religion understands. Most people are going to have to live with a portable version of religion. They cannot be sustained in uh in the frictionless ether it has to be rugged. I think somebody says zen priesthood zen seems like a whole different deal because like zen seems to be part of that. Uh tradition that says you don't actually have to withdraw you don't have to deny yourself. These emotions you just have to process them as they occur and extinguish uh like their clouding of your of your consciousness instantaneously. It's just it's a very high. It requires a lot of mental dexterity to do and it requires a lot of practice. It's in many senses easier to withhold if you can to withhold yourself yeah.

The new religion must have thrown consumerism. It must reassert an emotional value around the social at its base which we do not have no matter what our religion we carry around with us every day our calculus. Our our sense of uh our motivator is wired towards a very narrow aperture of hedonic pursuits because our vocabulary has been impoverished because it's all been run through the machinery of capitalism and been drained of sacredness. It's been drained of meaning. All these forms are dead in our mouths. All these words like religion. The reason people fear theocracy is because the idea that it would be um. It would be authoritarian because they imagined themselves being compelled by the state to do things. The vision of a theocracy is that you wouldn't need that because everybody would do things because they believed in them and they had a similar understanding of what the good was that they would act towards that would be a a perfect theocracy. It also describes the condition of the state having withered away. We need new terms and new religions because when you say christianity to people who aren't christian it is understood as one more identity that is an expression of a consumer preference just like all the others and so rule by people thinking that they're that is going to be rule of the consumer preference of those people. So of course it will be authoritarian and people who aren't of that and don't like those words are going to resist it so it becomes an obstacle. It has to emerge organically because to have a free society in in a free technological society. People have to have an internal governor of how much is too much people have to say no more and that means throughout the entire structure.

Political leaders business leaders whatever you have this is the virtue that rob spear was trying to impose. This is the virtue that the mcdonald brothers had that ray kroc didn't the thing about capitalism though is that ray kroc will always beat the mcdonald brothers. Over time. He will always win so that means that he will take over the system which means you cannot have structures that can allow that to happen but that means people acceding to a limitation on their consumer ability. Hey you don't get to buy everything you want you don't get to hypothetically have any experience you want in order for us to redistribute things more equitably if you perceive that only as a domination of your freedom and identity you will resist it and you will have to be fought and destroyed unless you accept it unless you understand oh yes. There is a greater value than me. There is therefore enough but people are only going to get there if systems don't exist that allow them to have that power and that is why the early stages of revolution by any definition would be authoritarian because you have to keep people who want to consume from grabbing the reins of  uh government and they're not going to listen to you because they believe deeply that their freedom that goodness depends on them getting whatever they want. They have to be physically disabused of that notion but over time as distribution is equalized.

As people see that there's a benefit. There's a actual benefit to participating socially to abusing social relations with meaning that there is something that you get in exchange for that lack of consumer choice oh my god. I'm not just giving up consumer choice. I'm getting all these other things holy. Then you create a system of true consensual rule and what's going to get people to live that every day is going to be some spiritual. Understanding of vocabulary symbols rituals that they wrap those beliefs those those behaviors around and that make them that inform their choices as they move through the day that currently don't exist.

But the thing about that revolutionary element of that moment of authoritarianism is that you you would not have this being carried out by some fragment you would be having this carried out by the organs of the actual working class so there would be a social underpinning guiding the actions of everybody within this structure and because of that they would give up the power of course. This is where people say this is ludicrous. This is a happy talk. This is fantasy never has happened and that's true because every revolution is tipped over to the point of uh has tipped away from the point of real permanent revolution and so the regime went into self-defense mode and was no longer able to cooperate. But there's nothing else to believe in so you might as well come to terms with it all right next next time. I promise we'll talk about black jackets.
