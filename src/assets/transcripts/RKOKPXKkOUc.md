This is the ground control of the major town. I'm standing through the door mars ain't the kind of place to raise a kiss in fact. It's cold as hell and there'd be no place to raise them if you did and I think it's gonna be a long long time out there alone and I think it's gonna be a long long time. I think it's gonna be a long long time. I think it's gonna be a long long time mars ain't the kind of place to raise a kid. In fact it's cold as hell and there'd be no place to raise them if you did it's pretty dumb that's pretty dumb lyrics him credit for just willing to go for it. You don't suck the future. This future sucks you that is of course a reference to a line that appears in two different entertainments filmed entertainments in the 70s and then again in the arts. That line is first said in I believe it's saturday night fever by tony's dad when travolta says. You and then of course repeat it again by commissioner. Yari played with supercilious transcendence by stephen tavaloski replies to I believe. It's racist steve yelling about the the land commission you and certainly that has been the case and I would say the lifetime of everybody listening to this so sorry about last week. Should have been on last wednesday but you guys probably know that will and felix were in town. We were doing stuff.

We were doing business deals. Got a little busy sorry about that and I'm going to be going to new york tomorrow to do the frequency fest which I should really do my part to try to promote frequency. Fest is going to be a lot of fun. We're going to do something that we wrote for the thing we're not just going to be. No their material. Their prepared material always sucks but some of you like it and we'll have some prepared material not too prepared though they'll be riffing and it will not be available in any other format. They're not going to be releasing it later on hopefully. Though we can do a lot real live show soon because annoyingly we're not going to be able to have an audience for this. Even though new york is all opened up. They didn't change that too bad there but I just got a thing and it completely threw me off anyway. It's going to be fine. We're going to do a good job and if you want to see it it's the only way you'll be able to so check it out. I'm really. I'm hoping. It's good because chris has done so much work for this. Chris is of course the king of the chapos our lord and master. We are all his his children in a way like he he is our true dad and he put this thing together. I'm pretty much by hand and with dan beckner and I want to see him.

I want to see it succeed and I'm excited about it. I think it'll be good there'll be a lot of good stuff. If you like e1. They're gonna be there there's I hate movies which people like and then there's bands that. I don't know what they are because. I don't follow music. I'm sure they're all great and I'm sure that people will enjoy them. So this is probably gonna be the only stream. I do this week because I'm gonna be in new york starting tomorrow. But then I'm hoping to get back to trying to do at least at least one a week. Maybe two trying to get to two. But it's gonna be a little touch and go right now so bear patience. So today we were gonna talk or yes last wednesday. I guess we were going to talk about ministry of the future by kim stanley robinson and I said read that I was going to read the first 50 pages but I really obviously you know partially because of the time difference but also because it was just. It's very easy to read. I just blew through the thing and so I'm halfway through already so I'm not really just going to talk about the first 50 pages sorry about that. But I'm also not going to talk about anything too specific to granular. I'm really just kind of using it as a as a starting point to talk about some stuff and so if you want to read along or read now having listened to this to sort of see the context go for it. It's I i will say. It's a it's a cracking read.

He's got the dan brown thing of He has longer character based chapters but he also has those short chippy chappies. Those the short chapters pioneered by melville in moby dick but brought the greatest commercial success by dan brown in the the in the robert langdon books so you just keep going and I really enjoy too that the diffused narrative voice. You've got point of view characters. You've got um. You've got paranoid characters that are individuals that like go through time you've got characters that are just there for one chapter. You've got collective voices like wheeze and then those that we being a different group of people. That's all cool and it makes the narrative which takes a lot that covers a lot of time. It covers decades easier to contain in your head because otherwise it might be hard to conceptualize. But there's leaps ahead that that all end up making sense. It does mean that a lot of the dialogue or a lot of the dialogue and the the narrative are kind of expository. But the expository voice is varied enough to keep it interesting. So it's a fun book to read the die. I mean the characters are obviously not terribly dynamic or interesting but that's not they're not the point.

It's really just sort of supposed to be a a broad survey of like the human pageant of trying to correct the the monstrous damage of climate change. Before it truly does destroy civilization. It is com. I gotta say though there's obviously that feels very scary. It feels very intimidating and unfun. This is why I have avoided basically any climate change related content. I haven't read any of the big climate change books or seen any of the movies. It always feels to me just like kind of a masochistic display and I'm not a masochist. Not in that way. Anyway I like my treats so and that includes artistic and cinematic. So this is really the first time I've grappled in books in book form with with climate change and its real implications and I think part of that is because it's fiction and also because and because it's speculative fiction so that I always like that like the visions of of of a dystopian of a dystopia that you logically extend from the one we currently live in. I like that kind of stuff like the oryx and craig books. I'm a big fan of those so that helps and also the fact that the context here is not just what's going to happen but also the response the human response that it's going to trigger because I think a lot of the despair that I know.

I feel that I think of others do about climate change is the thought that we have responded so blasely to things until this point that we can just sort of accept axiomatically that as things get worse our public response to them. Our commitment to resisting them isn't going to get any better and I can understand that assumption but I think history proves that it's not likely. I mean the question of whether it's going to be a sufficient enough shift to win the contest is a separate question but you have to get to that question and that means recognizing that deteriorating conditions and horror will will disrupt not just our existing systems. But it's the existing systems mechanisms of consent manufacture and that this book really is about like as the consent manufacturer breaks down. Even in like the heart of of of fossil fuel capitalism. There becomes a a concerted um response and so the premise he starts with is that in the very near future like 2023 there is a week-long catastrophic heat wave in northern india that kills 20 million people and everything that comes after that the the creation of the of the ministry for the future and all of the civic. Legal and illegal movements that emerge to try to really push power in the direction of sustainability.

The context is 20 million. People dying and the fundamental artistic license that robinson takes is that if that happened it would create a it would be the thing that pushed us not towards collective you know realization or or radicalization but just pushes us off of the paralyzed spot. We're currently on that that that the deer in the headlights freeze that we're in would be broken by that now. I don't know if that's true that is a lot of people we have to remember and he emphasizes that over and over again. It's more people than died in battle in world war ii. It's it's twice the holocaust over twice. The almost three times the size of the holocaust in a week and of course that does put into kind of comic relief. The the notion that this book is some sort of happy fundamentally optimistic take on climate change. It presumes as a baseline even if we avoid total social collapse and species extinction. It will be at the cost of deaths that we cannot conceive of and the fear.

I think we all share. I know. I have is that we imagine the lives we live now and we imagine the catas. The rolling catastrophes that we live in and normalize now and we project forward. And we say why would that be any different and I'd say that the answer to that is not anything that can be expressed. Rationally it is in it's in the ineffable realm of of the spirit where we have to assume. Just to You know satisfy our baseline understanding of ourselves as conscious beings that there is something beyond sheer mechanism in our lived actions like there is something compelling us beyond the pool table physics of cause and effect. There has to be and the book's assumption is that that that level exists that that that that point of inflection exists on the question of climate change and I would say that that's a reasonable assumption if only because it exists everywhere else yeah. I'm patting him.

I'm petting him don't worry okay yeah. He feels better now he's all right okay so everybody can relax now that I've petted the dog. I'm sorry that I was causing anxiety so the book begins with this concept 20 million. People die in a week and part of the I'd say kind of ironic twist of this is that the way that we experience that as the reader is through the point of view of a single western aid worker who survives in a city that is completely suffocated by heat and you know that's on one level. That's like this is why you have to avoid very one-dimensional literary analysis categories because you could look at that and say oh look white saviorism. Literally the only person to survive is the white man but that's also that also serves the artistic purpose of pointing out the real fundamental like bio power that europeans and americans hold over the rest of the world.

The north holds over the global south especially in this time of significant climate shifts. The people around the equator are literally more vulnerable than us than us here like not just where they live. But like that their lives have been lived more roughly without the benefit of nutrition without the benefit of of vigor because we've sucked the surplus of the earth. We've we have literally vamp we have vampirically sucked we've sucked off the world. Yes the second rate victorian holocaust exactly the same in the same phenomenon at play the north inflicting ecological catastrophe on india in order to enjoy the spoils of a global capitalist resource exchange network that funnels pleasure north and payne south which is the relationship between capitalists and labor or between capital and labor and between metropole and colonial ex colonial point so what happens what does the world decide to do at this horror.

This thing that actually causes the inflection point to reach and that's this this is where you can look at it and go oh. This is ridiculous and feel nothing but despair but remember this is happening in a psychological world that you are not in you are going through a looking glass the same way and you have to therefore suspend disbelief. The same way you would going through the looking glass into a another into a historical period in a book or in the far future of science fiction. You have to accept that this is not your world in a fundamental way even though it looks exactly like your world and the thing that separates you from that is time and event. The catastrophe of the of the heat wave and living in a world filled with all the other things that are also happening and have accumulated and caused misery and dis displacement around the world. Also so time and place mean you can't live there so assume to start with that it happens what happens well.

Of course. They create the un and the paris agreement. People create a bureaucracy that for one is very plausible and I think that that is robinson's fundamental insight which is of course packed with problems and contradictions which is that if we're going to see any meaningful coordinated reduction in climate outputs it is going to have to start at least in some respect with a transnational institutional framework and of course that's very difficult and that's one of the key contradictions at the heart of the the left how do you deal how do you deal with the fact that there is a there are these imperatives towards international cooperation but then also the reality that that national like social formations are the only ones that have any coherence and can only and they're the only places where realistically politics can be coordinated. That's a real problem and I think a lot of people who scorn international institutions in the name of like national bourgeois like because national brazil is the only thing that can resist international capital right now while that may be true. It also means that your efforts run the risk of fracturing international cooperation where it needs to be increased and of course. The other problem exists too if you ignore the reality of the nation as an organizing principle as a social reality. Then you will end up just putting a green sticker and a rainbow on the venusified hell world that we're gonna inherit and so what is assumed here is that instead of some global revolution.

What we get is capitalism being challenged from within by a growing coordinated articulated political machine that does not seek to overthrow capitalism but to seeks to transition it into a harmony with the world by taking the externalities of capitalism and pricing them into the system and thereby leveraging the future that is going away and its economic value to create money create wealth create the basically boils down to social will to act differently to pull carbon out of the air instead of putting it in it. That's it. That's what they're trying to do and of course. That's not communism. But I would argue that communism as a coherent challenge to capitalism is not a it's not a going concern at the moment. Now it will come into some sort of root reality in the fight because the contradictions of capitalism cannot be contained like the ultimate thing about. This is that even this if it were to work and I don't know how it ends. Spoiler alerts no spoilers.

I don't know how it ends they're halfway through. I've read enough about it to know that they get to averting the venusification of earth which is the best case scenario right now because if we do that we can do a lot of other things and by doing that we will have created a social base that is so much more progressive than the one we do socially and I can and technologically not in terms of like raw technological output but like the technological power that individual people are going to be effectively able to to utilize that is it's dizzying to think about the future that could be made out of that and communism would eventually emerge in that context and it would be emerge amongst a re a a aware social class. A class for itself made out of the international losers the losers within the the the imperial core and the losers without a a An alliance between the two that would have to be facilitated at some point by international organizations like this ministry for the future and so this ministry of the future comes into existence and a bunch of other things are also happening.

India sees a massive political realignment where the bjp is wiped out. Hindutva as a movement is discredited and the old congress party is equally implicated and and india becomes governed by a new. Presumably socialist. Anti-caste political party and that that party then orients it orients india towards being the foremost country in climate mitigation so you have that as like the social base a billion people making socialism and why not. It's where the actual violence was felt not where it's felt as guilt where it's felt as grief where it's felt as anger again. This is if would this happen you don't know let's just assume. And the coolest part that comes out of india is that you get a terrorist movement dedicated to wiping out high high price tag corporate polluters and and climate criminals which I mean robinson is clearly not very comfortable with the idea of political violence.

But I respect that he acknowledges that there has to be a vis whatever fantasy of of of salvation. We all are gonna have to believe in because we're gonna have to believe in something folks. You're gonna have to believe in something he acknowledges it'll probably involve some sort of violence. Although honestly and the problem with that is that the type of people who want to do climate-based justice aren't the type of people who are going to want to kill people but again we have the problem they're solved by.

These are people who saw their families wiped out in a consumption by fire. I think somebody says robinson's books have gotten less and less revolutionary probably as time has gone on and things have gotten worse and the the prospect of salvaging anything becomes a more realistic goal to fight for than changing anything fundamental about the human condition in in our conceivable lifetimes. Although I wonder there's one thing that halfway through the book in cataloging all the different resistance mechanisms that come into being one of my favorites is space pirates or is echo pirates who who hijack and sink fishing trawlers and liberate the slave the slave crews of some of the ones and just to prevent fishing that that's that's cool seems like you could do it. The high seas are pretty wide open but obviously there's going to be a huge. Political cost to that and there's going to be a huge ratcheting up of state violence which is going to have its own knock-on effects that have to be considered one thing that he doesn't talk about. Though in all of these resistances is something that has come up now in the last couple weeks twice which is cyber attacks and ransomware.

So first you had some russians who just wanted to get paid cyber jack. The the software of a pipeline in somewhere in the eastern united states. It's why people were filling Target bags with gasoline and now one of the a fifth of the u.s beef supply is now frozen because of a ransomware attack. At some food conglomerate. They're asking for money but what if somebody said no you don't do this anymore what are you going to do obviously you can get around it but enough of those attacks will have an effect unless of course. It's all false flagship to get us to give over any of our cyber security individual privacy so that's possible too who the knows but for me. I'd have to say if we don't get if somebody doesn't do something about bitcoin. I'm really going to it's going to take a lot for me to restore my faith in human cooperation at this point in human history because come on man how are we. This is such an old goal own goal that we're still letting this monstrous so there's one of the funniest segments is when there is a group that hijacks davos and instead of just panicking everybody. They make them watch a bunch of movies about how mean they're being to everybody It's essentially they just show them like an adam curtis film for a week and I mean.

I don't think that people I've seen people in reviews say that that's sort of like a indictment of robinson. But that seems to me to be pretty clearly indicated to be a dumb idea that is done by the type of trihard goody two shoes who would man a un agency on climate change. I mean I'm not surprised that they haven't. I'm surprised. They haven't done that yet as an activity at davos. I'm surprised they have not staged that yet as part of the fun so really what he's doing is saying what people would do some of it would work some of it would not work some of it would be based. Some of it would be cringe and I do think it's interesting that another sacred cow climate change that he has to sacrifice along with mega death is the notion that we can get away without geoengineering and I think a a as terrifying as it is. A recognition of of the of the stakes indicates that we might have to actually consider that and I think the resistance of these kind of things comes from a resistance to trusting the ins the institutions that would carry it out and that's totally real realistic but part of the part of the math.

Here though is that the ruling elite of these countries is getting going to get to a point where the maintenance of their power really is in a fundamental conflict by in their perception in their day-to-day working life and this new climate reality. Like they're they're losing their ability to to sustain a control and that changes the incentives they don't block out the sun but what the indians do is. They see the clouds to essentially block the sun and and bill gates has talked about blocking out the sun and of course anything that guy says is just a counter indicator do whatever the opposite of what bill gates wants because he is a demon. He is moloch that this guy who's telling you that oh it'll be okay if we collect everybody's foreskins and make you drink. Water and eat crickets is also stepping on the gas is the thing that's going to cause all of that. It's a pretty clear indication of what all of corporate and transnational institutional and governmental action on climate change is which is a faint.

It is a puppet hand that is meant to keep you from recognizing the looting that is happening the final stripping of assets to be consolidated into private hands and unaccountable corporate hands. Unaccountable technologically supreme hands that will then control everything so while we have this ministry of the future plot going. We also have the technological resistance now as I said nothing about ransomware although I do wonder about ransomware. I wonder how how vulnerable are these things are these institutions are these frameworks and infrastructures too like a significant interdiction because you know if labor power is the power to cease production then in a global system.

A wallenstinian world system then stopping the flow is just as good and if we could do that technologically that would fill in for some of the lack of of working class self mobilization question. There of course is accountability to the people doing it who would be behind the computer and those are questions that can be only announced by only be answered by the time and place. The context that gives rise to these resistances hypothetical future resistances but one thing and I have thought of this myself before reading. This book one thing that robinson argues could change the equation on security in a way that could actually make the ruling class worried. About resistance is drone. Technology is it as drones get smaller and cheaper becomes easier to use them in a way that is essentially unguardable against and there is a spectacular act of echo terrorism that occurs in this book off-screen.

Because all the really nasty stuff is is is off-screen because he's not he he knows. It's necessary but it shouldn't be celebrated and frankly. I don't know if that's not the right attitude because I have talked about how oh chat and blew my mind. It always blows my mind when I see these guys but drone technology is something that could even the playing field. A little bit could allow you to get under the radar and I feel that's true you know 3d technology and printing. And drones are really the only things that are emerging and like software and algorithms and are the only things that seem like they can be produced outside of capital in a way that can be. That could be that can resist capital on its own terms so I guess that means people need to learn to code and how to make drones but again the the will to do this doesn't exist.

Like that's the fundamental thing we have to acknowledge is that we don't live in this world where we can expect anything like that to emerge because this question is too disused. People's responses to it are too diffused they are too paralyzed by indecision and they are too struck dumb by addiction to the stimulus response nexus of existence within the system and that goes for me and everybody and so the people who really care about this stuff mostly just get sad or channel their energy into embarrassing emotional catharsis like extinction rebellion or whatever the talking to you people. I'm going to keep talking to you guys not forever probably but for right now and that's all I can really do. I can just sort of make myself in some way at peace with my situation and then if I can't if. I find that. I am unable to then addressing that which is preventing me from doing so and I'm. I'm trying to do that I'm in the process where it will lead. I don't know but I'm. I'm in a I mean. I'm on a journey man like everybody is so in enumerating the responses robinson.

Also highlights the fundamental places where things have to change really quickly and he acknowledges one of them having to be the internet as it's. It currently exists that it can no longer be the the corporate matrix that it is now well incentivized as it is now and that that would have to go that's like yep absolutely. It's a pretty ingenious method that they go about doing it whereby they create a They create a fully secure social media space where your data is owned by you and you can sell it which that you do feel like oh you know going to the market. But once again the idea here is to wean a market off of its worst social and ecological side effects. And I mean we can also. I think we can agree that social media even though you know it's only a component of a matrix is one is a debilitating millstone around the neck of human civilization and has to be addressed. Also crucial the need for the incentive structure of the market to be changed by the introduction of a way to invest in the world in the future a way to invest in the future and that's where they talk about this currency. It's essentially a bitcoin that helps the or where the world instead of destroys it that is created by sinking carbon instead of creating carbon and I thought that was really cool and not something. I'd really thought about but you know it's like.

It does help with one of the big problems which is there's all this money to be made by all the stuff that's in the ground people are going to get it out of the ground unless there is an incentive not to and that's either You know some sort of techno global enforcement regime that prevents people from putting up oil derricks or You know you've dismantled the system of capitalism or you make it in their interest. Not to do it. You make it in their entry. You make it worth money not to pump oil and that is going to have to happen unless you once again destroy the infrastructure for oil or replace it with something. There has to be an economic incentive to keep it in the in the ground and then the third part the third big part they haven't really gotten to it. Yet. I'm only halfway through. But as soon as I read it you know. I started nodding. It's when they say oh yeah. Their people are gonna have to have to actually believe in something. People are going to have to actually care about and have an emotional terrain that recognizes the the existence of others and the persistence of a human community oh. That's religion.

We need another one of those I they only mentioned it. I'll see what happens in the second half. I'm looking forward to how you figure that out because to me this is one of like. I am closest to that question because I have no because that's where the people who don't have any technical affinity go like. I don't have the expertise to help on any of the the technological questions or on any of the big questions of policy even to which the degree to which those are important I am a jackass who just talks about things. I give little speeches. That's that's for that's for the humanities grads and what are the humanities but not an ex attempt to dissect into pieces the reality of the human soul like that that is what the the soft sciences are. It's the human soul splayed out on a cork board and its organs cataloged and of course that's worthy work but absent a social practice that enlivens that knowledge with the the mystical emotional connection provided by communal existence cooperation. It's dead so. I'm very interested to see how robinson goes about nudging along because obviously it's going to happen anyway. People are hitting the dead end. People are hitting the dead end of materialism. They're finding that it only can keep you going for so long before the the contradiction between objectivity and subjectivity between being the universe and being um and having a sell-by date 

It becomes overwhelming. There's no degree of indulgence or neurotic self obsession that can keep you from it forever and now we're getting this new generation of children who have hit the barrier by age 18 19 years old. I mean a lot of them are trying to kill themselves. Apparently. The teens are very despairing but not all of them are going to kill themselves not the majority. The rest are going to keep going on and something is going to have to move them to move to continue. Something is going to have to be believed in what it's going to be. It doesn't have to be good signs point to it being very bad in fact but that doesn't mean that that absolves us of the responsibility to try to participate in the good version yeah. It's probably going to be some some tick-tock faith and it's sobering because there is going to be a religious revival but a lot of it is going to be cult-based and a lot of it is going to be so defined by its social reactionary nature. It's gonna say this world is scary and and big and I am a little adamant where can I find meaning and their answer isn't going to be inhumanity as an abstract concept. It's going to be the people who are closest to them the people who are the most similar to them the people who comfort them by reflecting them which is what we seek in a in a public world full of strangers. The only truly soothing image is a mirror and so that's what we seek. That's what our entertainment has become. We're seeking a reflection of our own values. Our reflection of our own sense of self. We want to live inside a disco ball because that's the only way to be soothed. Strangers are scary that's why everyone's on the internet where they can see people as a projection of themselves not as real people because they're not dealing with the the intervening viscerality of a human encounter and so it's probably going to be based there's going to be a lot of mystical communing with racial groups and with national categories and that's gonna be bad news. But a lot of us have been brainwashed by the hollywood sicko globalist machine and thank god and maybe enough of us can reach across the the divide of the other because succumbing to that is a worse for our sense of self and for our super. It our super egos restraint against that behavior because so many of us have become um so many of us have become neo-puritan basically who don't believe in god anymore but still believe in eternal judgment and the need to be among the elect. And that is you know the residual motive to be a social liberal and there are a lot of people who have those things deeply embedded. I know what I do and like succumbing to the nationalist racial. Religious mania would be too great a violation of our sense of self so between those people and people for whom that is not an option because they are the excluded.

I think you could maybe put together a team that could maybe compete for a title. If we could all become mormon. By now we probably would have fixed everything. But it's too late one of the like in the archipelago of existing like fully luxury fully automated luxury space communist bubbles that will exist in the future earth like an earth that's basically water world except for a few little outcroppings that stick out and those will have on them little bubble cities where you will have fully automated luxury space communism. You will have the dream of of a material splendor for all and those people being all the people who made it into the bunkers and then were able to use their technology to build themselves a little a little bubble amongst them. One of them will be mormons. One of them will have will be will be cyber utah no question about that because they work together to make it happen the rest will be you know essentially hikimori domes of freaks cyber sex dolls. But of course the reality is is that if we do get the worst most catastrophic outcome of climate change that won't happen either because the faith in that the faith in mars the faith in new zealand is part of the greater faith in the self that these people are clinging to these people who are the most religiously infused the most mystic people on earth. The hyper wealthy because they've cocooned themselves in something that they believe as deeply as a medieval martyr at a burning at the stake which is that technology exists to sustain them and that it its power is essentially infinite relative to the him and that it can be utilized to their full control meaning that they will be able to use it to um to dominate any physical reality. Though the seas rise. I'll put up a bubble. The workers rebel. I'll replace them with robots. At every point.

There is an answer and then of course at the end of the question well what about life and death. What about dying you're gonna now have to die having cut yourself and severed yourself completely from all of humanity. How are you supposed to deal with that. How is it not going to drive you insane. I was not going to send you to hell the answer is I will live in the machine. All of those beliefs are believed as deeply as fundamentally as people believed in medieval christianity and are as illusory. God didn't make the world in six days and you can't escape the second law of thermodynamics. They will destroy everything in the pursuit of this fully luxury automated space communist utopia for their grandchildren and them of course because they're never going to die or if they do think they're going to die if they don't if they're if they haven't been convinced by that science. Then they think they're going to create a lineage and a legacy because that's what you have in to focus on if death is too. If death feels too real to you you have to have either a legacy or a fantasy of eternal life and both of those things are are sustained by the wealthy by delusion by religious mania.

Because these people do not believe in science they don't believe in technology. They have encountered science and technology through a personal experience that has seen it open its hands to them and revealed the jewels of the universe to put them in a position of power that no humans had ever exist had ever held in human history not through the use of arms not through violence. Not even through physical effort through fear mental exertion. At least that's what they think that's how they experienced technology so of course to them. Because it is their lived lives. It is imbued and infused with belief and a disbelief in not just the self but of the supremacy of their specific selves. The rest of us are just reifying our egos but in the absence of absolute power. Those egos are being destroyed by the inability to recognize a world where you are both the center of the universe and its only consciousness and also subordinated to others subordinated and disempowered and not able to do what you want how the hell do you deal with that and it is the neurotic attempt to square that circle that I think generates basically all bourgeois politics now of course though super wealthy are transcend bourgeois morality. Transcend mushua politics give a about any of that stuff because they have total belief in the self and also physical evidence of their self's power and centrality. They think they're gods and the world proves that they are as opposed to the rest of us who think we're god. At the end of the day. We think we're god but are but live as as as peasants. How can that make sense and we try to make sense of it with politics with religion with culture. But in both cases this neurotic drive towards distraction and and resentment and guilt assuagement that happens in the middle drives. The actual machine of capital towards annihilating ends.

So next week I'm not done but just wanted to make sure I'm done talking about. I think the book we'll talk some more. I'll talk more about the rest of it and when I'm done with the whole thing. I'll probably like look back at other stuff that maybe. I missed talking about this time so I'll have it all done. By the next time we hang out which I don't know if it's gonna be. It's not gonna be this week. But we'll do the second half of kim stanley. Robinson's ministry for the future not of the future ministry for the future next week hopefully or the week after if not and just to comment on the title of the book. One of the other key components here the understanding is is leveraging the future rights of humans not yet born against the current calculus of economic value but again with all these things you're essentially creating ideological justifications for what at the end of the day are material considerations and that's where the coercion comes in because all of the stuff about hey we'll have a we'll have a crypto coin. Hey. We're going to sue you in court on behalf of future generations.

That's just to give them an out short of final conflict and annihilation when they're when they feel that they've lost the battle. This is being pushed on all fronts including physical fronts using physical coercion and intimidation. But I don't want to talk about that too much because it's nothing that currently makes sense tactically. It's nothing I certainly nothing. I want to get in trouble for. I'm a. I will admit it. I don't want to get in trouble because what would be the point no amount of echo terrorism in the current conditions absent any kind of movement absent any kind of catalyzing political um event or organization. It's just more grist for the mill more strategy of tension fodder more stuff to keep us on the road to total techno dominion techno domino atera now I hate being under that techno dominion I hate being under that techno dominion oh child lord of mercy oh yeah. You know you get that dude yeah there'll be no more gumbo if that river keeps rising if that gold mexico keep coming in. There you go not gonna have no gumbo no. I'm not some sort of categorical pacifist. But I do think that we are so awash and spectacle and violence. Right now that anything short of a a destabilizing degree of physical resistance isn't going to do anything other than provide more trending topics for people to bat around shhh oh somebody asked about ariel pink.

I know him because he got in trouble for going to the capitol on january 6th which is very funny. All the celebs who went there like jay johnston it's like at the end of the day. All these viruses operate on everybody. All these mind viruses that we're spreading on the internet. No one is immune from them. Somebody keeps asking about the bo burnham thing. I don't know what that is is. He a musical comedian is he one of those guys who uses guitars while he's like doing. Punch. Lines never really been a fan of that like that seems to be you're trying to do like a mitch. Hedberg stephen wright one-liner thing but you don't have the confidence just leave. It leave the dead air for a little bit in between jokes. I don't know apparently bo. Burnham did some sort of like epic communism and someone on twitter pointed out very accurately that if if you're gonna have people changing their minds on on like the viability of the system. Even if it's just you know not necessarily it's gonna be good. It could just be performative but it's gonna. It's gonna mean cringe like that. It's gonna mean people doing that that's gonna happen. It's no one's no one's gonna have perfect takes But I don't think I'm gonna watch it. I'll say that okay I'll leave on the the veiled prophet thing but first of all shout out to corpse in orbit. Michael s judge host of death is just around the corner a great podcast about american america's. He's essentially a Michael is a basically an architect critic where he's describing the the structure and map of the black iron cage of american capitalism but in 2017 because he's from st louis and he kind of knows those people. He apparently knows holly josh hawley that he knew about the veil prophet which is a a debutant ball type thing for the upper cross of st louis that they started to celebrate the victory over the the strikers during the st louis general strike of 19 1877. Part of the great railroad strike. It was an end zone dance for the rulers of the city over the the rest of workers and in 2017 he said that ellie kemper from the office and kimmy schmidt had been one of the one of the guests of honor. So shout out to him for having this way before anybody else But obviously the big reason that it moved is the way it was framed. It was framed as it's the clan. These are the clan look they're wearing wet white hats. It's a clan party well. These guys were the clan now of course that's not true in any literal sense. It's in said the fact that yeah. This is part of the upper crust of a near south city that was dedicated to maintaining racial and class hierarchy in st louis and they had a party to celebrate it but turning it into the kkk thing it.

Just that's what made it sing and that's what made it sizzle but the thing is all. This really proves is that ellie kemper like most actors now is a work that is everybody. It used to be obviously a big chunk of celebrities and of actors and and artists of all kinds. But now it has become almost exclusively that because it is too hard to risk it it's too dangerous. The the the cost benefit analysis doesn't hold up no matter how much you want it no matter how much talent you might have that calculus can only be made by people who have a safety net and so what a shock child of rich people is. The fame is a famous actor. The all of the real dungeon about it the stuff about it being the clan or whatever is just more.

Liberal posturing because once again we have an example. Here is somebody who came from the bad kind of rich people the local elites of smaller cities in the hinterland the beautiful boaters. This is local capital. These are the bad guys so we could do this meanwhile how many hedge fund managers white shoe law firms that doesn't get talked about because that is invisible capital and it's this trick goes the other way too of course. Like those veiled profit people they pitch themselves and think of themselves. As the salt of the earth. They think of themselves we're not cap with capitalism. We're working together. We're all part of one community against against antifa and the global world order. They're the bad ones and it's not capitalism. Actually. Capitalism is good and we do that both ways it is.

It's a cultural projection of a a battle between local concentrated capital and transnational capital. A battle across time. Essentially. It's it's a temporal war between capital at its most accelerated point and at its most its most accelerated financialized endpoint and it's more localized fixed extractive midsection and then it's thought as a culture war where the role of capital is completely hidden and shielded and veiled in both cases so the real. It's always been super creepy in the 70s. Some like left-wing activists stormed the thing and pulled off the bomb. It's it's real true detective hours.

Enterprise rent-a-car and monsanto are huge donors for what they use at the vp. Fair not exactly pumpkin pump country pumpkin smallholders of course. Not because the money is all flowing in from outside. These are not disconnected capitalisms. The culture stares across the time frame the actual money is flowing between the two like they're not. These people are still super rich and powerful. It's just that they identify with a local formation of power and a local hierarchy.

Because remember that we're dealing with an era of lumpen class non-consciousness across the board. We have a lump in middle class. We have a lump and proletariat and we have a lump and ruling class. They do not have a sense of themselves as part of any project. They operate out of total self-interest and they are like you've got guys like the ricketts family who are billionaires who believe fox news forwards that are meant for the dumbasses who vote for their candidates. They believe it now because spectacle and media has replaced life for everyone no matter how many how much money they have and then the and the hope of climate change is that it is a shift and a shock to this system sufficient to reorient people towards their lives and away from that spectrum whether that's true or not will be seen but the conflict isn't is inevitable. It's not that we are enchanted by their stories.

It's that it's their stories have replaced our social existence. There's nothing that we are choosing them in favor of they're filling a hole that is why we can't unplug that's why we can't really log off. Because we are now cyborgs. We have offloaded a huge percentage of our mental world and our emotional world into this cyber realm. It cannot be just cut off so it's not they're. It's not anyone's fault for being enchanted. They are dealing with reality as it was presented to them where that the that the euro the television howard beale said where your own lives are unreal because how could your life that which is spent not observing this stuff not engaging with it. How could it compare considering how much time you spend on one versus the other and how lonely the time you spend by yourself outside of it is and that lonely time is still spent in the cyber realm. Basically it's the ghost acreage of your soul acreage is is is a concept that explains how imperial cores are able to sustain themselves by accessing a bunch of land that is not actually part of their polity. So england was able to way over produce their malthusian lemon on population because they were able to access massive amounts of ghost acreage. Our minds have ghost acreage online and this is the the conflict we're all stuck with and this is the the horn of the dilemma is that we need more than ever to rebuild our spiritual connection to each other our spiritual connection to the world so that it can orient us towards good action that can only be determined through analysis of that world. But at the same time we are constrained by our our disposition. Our material dispositions which are beyond our control to have to live in a a a a hybrid cyber realm a a cyborg realm. How do we balance. Those how do we how do we direct the flow. The emotional flow the the spiritual flow between the one state and the other to to push us towards right action. That's the challenge and I don't know the answer that's why I keep talking that's why I keep talking around because I don't know the answer because I am alone not really. I have people in my life. But I am not part of a project beyond the artistic project the the intellectual project but I'm hoping that that will change and I'm trying to make myself ready for the moment and yes this is 

This is an original adam friedland. I'm very proud of this yeah. He painted He painted a great paparazzi shot of paul giamatti on the subway and that is it's wonderful reminds. Me of new york okay somebody says they should be beppy grillo yeah. The hit that one really hit the nail on the head with that guy with that one guys all right talk to you chickens later peace and cush grease.
