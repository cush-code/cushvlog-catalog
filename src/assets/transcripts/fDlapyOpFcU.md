It's time folks it's time it's time for born too AM. Radio. Man I really could do this real but I certainly do enjoy just talking my ass off extemporaneously for a long time. It's a lot of fun soothing. How are you guys doing how's the guys doing out there. Just last time somebody asked me at the end about everyone like boycotting the election and I thought about it and as much as I liked it. I don't see any way to make that work like make it a thing without it just becoming a meme and boy not really high on memes right now. But I certainly don't pooh-pooh anybody who wants to do anything right now because Who am I to say. It's not the right move because goddammit nothing feels right right about. Now everything feels very questionable so how're you guys doing out there in in the lands with the peoples. How are you guys up. How are you what are you guys up to jump. I'm not talking about Joe Biden. Tonight. Guys remember that's a YP and it doesn't have to be your problem leave it to Neera. Nearest problem is getting that gets worse and worse.

I mean we saw the collapse of the petro dollar today didn't expect to see that just month oil literally. Worthless you would have to pay someone to take oil off of your hands. White gold Texas tea is now no better than over produce beanie babies so you gotta like pay. The store can you think of Ken but can you believe that I don't know what nick has been saying about kovat. But I'm assuming he's saying it's not real which I think the thing people really need the process. Is you don't know and more importantly what difference does it make you feel. You was true like what if you found out tomorrow that what if what if you found out confirmation tomorrow yeah it's all made up. It's all a conspiracy to get you I don't know what the hell. The point of this is supposed to be why you would destroy I guess to consolidate capital or like Institute. A police state that they already had already basically fixed that that's thing I don't get it's like they don't need an excuse to do to do a police state. They do police station anyway people just to see to anything because the ones who are most likely to get newer ones that are most paying attention. I already have guns so they feel mollified by having guns so what difference does it make. They still run your and tell you what to do and we don't have any mechanism to stop them. So how about we talk about that how will we talking with the powerlessness. It seems to be more vital my point right now than whether or not. It's happened since there's no way to know and you're just guessing.

But I don't know what he's saying like I said I haven't been listening. I don't know what anyone's saying all I know is oil is now free. So go grab all the oil you want if you've ever wanted. Some oil go get some I would love to get some oil if you guys just go go to town on big big old batch oil. They can give us money for the oil and then we just put the oil and I don't know like maybe a big bathtub swimming pool. I only put the put it in the swimming pool yeah. So I don't know what this means I've never really been very knowledgeable. What I like that petrol petrol economy. Shale oil on the ground. That's good but cheap oil does have a bad impact on renewables because it makes dirty energy the cheapest option and with the economy collapsing as it is cheapest options. Gonna look pretty good so who knows how long this lasts. The the contracts for June are decent. I mean it's still very low but it's not. It's not nothing so there's some sort of assumption going on in some levels of the market that things are gonna get back to normal and basically they want to like hold on the o the glut of oil through May so they could sell it later I don't know and so they're basically paying people the way you would pay yeah like somebody who had a a one of those places that a store storage locker for the after mentioned beanie babies.

But it is so funny. I mean I remember being a kid and thinking about peak oil was where the apocalypse was gonna come. They're like we're running out of oil and it's gonna be this bad scramble for it Syriana. It's running out and most what's left is in the Middle East a great movie but in retrospect hilarious. If you'd asked me in 2002 I was a kid and I was getting into this. Hey what do you think what do you think oil is gonna cost.

[06:10](https://youtu.be/fDlapyOpFcU?t=06m10s)

In 2020 I would have said 50 dollars a gallon I don't know. It's like some new horrible world where like the majority of cost this is oil and everything else people are living in trailers. I don't know $20 a gallon ten. It wouldn't I thought I would have assumed it was more expensive. That's for would never assumed it was cheaper than it would have been even in real dollars. At that time.

Why did it happen another thing I thought that caught that knowledgeable about I know that Russia and Saudi Arabia have been in a pissing contest. The kind of thing that OPEC is actually designed to stop but this is geopolitical and these guys really want to go down on each other and Saudis are basically one of the things that cost a big drop. Last month is the Saudis refused to cut production even with the glut because they want to with Russia which is a huge oil exporter and which needs oil to have a certain value but the thing is Saudi Arabia. It's not like they have anything else going on. They need to be able to sell oil soo. So I would expect at this point that's gonna force the hands and there's gonna be a huge cutback in production. I mean mine and they're stopped. They stopped at the oil patch. I hope would be that they would just you know like they're talking the. Kenny is talking about some bailout package for Canadian oil companies and it's like yeah. There's a lot of employers and there's an economy in the West the Canada that is based on oil but how about you just pay people to not off for the workers and stuff like a workers bailout and then you just take that money and you don't create in world-ending. Fossil fuels that now don't even make money but who knows I don't know. I don't know is this the end of the petrodollar.

It is the man the US military really is our last thing. It's like everything else is basically like the they sell in the front of the bodega that's really all about like dealing weed. Like that's just subdue ste. Cold cuts the real shit's behind the counter in the form of you know a world-spanning military empire with more more money and equipment. In the next 12 countries combined the I've heard that out Kim jong-un is apparently in critical al Sue's to know if that's true or not could be propaganda Big Ups to the boy one way or the other. The big large boy who is a big who is a big boy that we all love people keep asking about out the 90s like paranoia episode I talked a little bit about the conspiracy theories episode.

I did but it might be fun to delve in it more specifically. I don't know I've got a number of things I've got a number of solo shows coming up hopefully in the next month or so but I'll put that one on the pile of ideas yeah I mean like the oil dollar is the undercurrent of like that's why we get to do what we want really. That's why we get to do all. The deficit spending in the world is because everybody's buying the thing that keeps the lights off get our money but the thing is. It's still gonna take the lights on right now no matter how much it costs so who knows who knows yeah. I was thinking of doing a reading from that sink Upton Sinclair book since I'm researching the an episode about epic and the 34 campaign and he wrote the book without oil that ended up coming there would be blood well. I mean this is a good time for less - just like nationalize. The entire energy sector I mean this this is really kind of frustrating man like we're in a situation where this could all be had for pennies on the dollar or we could just nationalize it. But there's nobody in the room and making these decisions who's a human being they're all lizards.

[10:54](https://youtu.be/fDlapyOpFcU?t=10m54s)

They're lizards okay folks they're lizard people. You only be one of those rooms are goblins well. All they care about is maintaining profit. A big butt a goblin Bobbitt touching goblins kissing goblins. The bed will got one. That's it. That's the only people in the room in Bear Valhalla I don't know I'm still them yeah. I love those guys protesting because like if people don't want to go out. You can't make them you know that's just like there's always so much you could do against hegemonic media like as much as people. Don't trust the media they still believe in general what they get told and they think there's a virus out. There. They're not gonna go out and hang out. They're not going to come and hang out.

What was I saying I had a robber. We'll buy have have you heard of the mortal error theory of the Kennedy assassination in which he got shot in the head by the ar-15 of a hungover Secret Service agent in the seat behind in the car behind Kennedy which some people claim fits. The the scenario fits the forensics better than any of the other ones to be there the solo shooter or the grassy knoll. And you know what in combination with the Don DeLillo sort of like false flag shooting theory that kind of works doesn't it like if the whole thing was faked if it was an attempted assassination to make Kennedy like take the Cuban threat more seriously and double down on like Zr rifle and Mongoose or do another invasion by like setting up this Kenneth. This Castro kid this Castro fan kid is that as the Patsy and they're they've like oh it works except one guy stood up a dumb acid leap and his finger on the trigger and situation I mean it's It would certainly be as someone said the Coen brothers solution and there's something to now ever wanting to rule out the most absurd outcome because I mean at the end of the day. Kennedy I just don't buy him as I've often said as the danger that these guys thought would have had to have thought he was to authorize an assassination and but I do think that like there are a lot of very sinister actors intersecting there in the 1960s in such a way that it seems kind of unrealistic to think that they weren't involved so how especially considering all the weird surrounding the assassination itself. So I think the way this resolved that my mind is you know no. They don't think this guy's going to dismantle the Cold War and like turn you know create a era of universal brotherhood. That's gonna sink defense stocks. They're like this. Dumbass doesn't get what we're dealing with here maybe maybe show up. Maybe have some guy some kid that who loves Castro put a bullet next to your ear.

I don't know like I said I'm agnostic on a lot of stuff because I don't know there's no way to know so I kind of just pick whichever one is more artistically and intellectually satisfying. Like for example I know a lot of people who are very into the paddock conspiracy like our friends on true and on who I respect very much aren't very much. They know a lot of stuff about paddock and his weird life and the odd things that happened on that day and and then the fact that yeah. The matter that you have this like millionaire real estate guy in his 60s. It just decides to shoot everyone on earth and there's questions are like whether he could have got all those shots off with the guns. He had it you know when he killed himself and there's stuff about timeline and there's a Saudi royal family of course and there's the fact that paddock was claiming that he was being controlled and that his mind was not his own but the fact is any version that's the conspiracy is something that fits into some like greater scheme puzzle in a way that that is pretty cut-and-dried like oh you know. It's like either a part of a the whole thing to get people to do gun control although that none of them have worked so it seems like a waste of time to do gun control false-flag. Since nobody is moving on any subject. No matter what I'm gonna waste a time or it's something with like the Saudis and there was like a gun deal that went wrong. I don't know why you'd have to shoot everybody whatever it is to my mind. None of that is as interesting none of those explanations are interesting as the official story.

A wealthy Western boy made good who turned like a who turned life is like a middle-class driver into millions through 90s real-estate speculation in Vegas which is a common thing I mean that was the gold rush after they started rebuilding those casinos. It's like and then he just becomes this rich totally besotted dude. Like this guy. He's got millions of dollars and it's just boring he can get. Sushi comped he's got like huge. He's got the girls on speed dial for any number of high-end call girls. Here yes he can do whatever he wants and it's just. It means nothing and then just like how every one of his pursuits and all of his life. It's like whittling him down to this like just raw nerve of narcissism. Like this one individual review and it just took and that money and especially in Vegas. Every other person becomes someone who is abstracted away from humanity because your only relation with them relationship with them is transactional. You only have transactional relationships and pretty. Soon people would just turn into you know numbers on the slot machine just can I get the biggest number you know like hitting the jackpot like can I shoot. Like oh that gay Muslim guy killed 50 people could I hit more can I get the top scorer of all time could. I ring get all the bells ringing in all the casinos and then can I get all the coins and then just doing it just doing it. That's like just a vulgar almost ritualistic kind of a ritualistic confirmation and like consecration of one's salep system of like the idea that what they're the oh you're.

The only person on earth which is what capitalism and American capitalism and an American culture teaches that you are the only consciousness that matters that you are an individual omona and the end result of that is Steven panic. And I think that's what I'm more interesting than any conspiracy theory and I honestly do like. I have a long-term ambition to make a movie about the panic brothers him and the child molesting guy and the coked up cokehead. Although I'm hearing a reports that the child molestation charges paddocks brother had been fleeing for years before the shooting. He was arrested like a month after the shooting and someone said those charges have been dropped which I did not know I would need to look more into it. But the panic is really more interesting to me just if it really happened the way they said. So I just choose to believe it because there's no way. I'm gonna know on either way. No I don't know he look the main thing to remember about Stephen.

Panic is that he was cool he could get. Sushi comped I'm sorry that not everybody works in a Taco Bell. We're very successful. I know it was a little tall but to be Giamatti but man I don't really think Giamatti could have done a good job of panic maybe like some force perspective or something to make him taller. I don't know he was cool ah. This is an interesting question.

It's Chacko spoken on the connection between the CIA and modern art. In the 50s and 60s. I don't think we've ever spoken about it directly on the show. But it is true a lot of the stuff that we the critical stew that like educated Americans women in terms of like what is expected to be quality literature quality art like what are the qualities of art that we value. A lot of that was created by modern art schools in both painting and literature were funded by the CIA with the express purpose of providing a aesthetic focused alternative to the social realism of the Eastern Bloc which was all about pointing out material conditions and you know inspiring the masses towards revolution and recognition of their class situation well. They don't want people thinking about the class situation in their art.

No thank you better to think about I think you know oh the the wistful travails and pains of a like impotent ad executive in a suburban Connecticut backyard. You know small domestic dramas that don't intersect with politics in any meaningful way and then in art abstraction. You know don't show me degradation don't show me like a Diego Rivera. On the wall it could be anything and then you thought you tell me what it is so. That is true like the Iowa Writers Workshop was CIA funded. Partisan review a Paris review. A lot of the organs of like middle and higher brow culture were funded by the CIA and there were funds and grants for artists like Pollock Jackson Pollock for the express purpose of creating a political vocabulary for artistic birth and the thing is we still live with that we still live with that and it really is challenging to sometimes think do I really value these elements of art because I think that they have that there is some objective or even even to me subjective morality do it or am I just bowing to essentially deep state. Propaganda created to keep me from thinking critically and keeping me from thinking class in a class conscious way.

It's a very good question. Now that's why I like you can say like what people say oh you know modern art postmodern. Whatever this these things were created by the CIA. See that's different that's a different claim and it's incorrect. These movements existed already. These movements would have existed. These movements were products of the of the reality. They were products of the material conditions I mean you're talking about post-war America. It's a land of plenty. It's a land of all we honestly of a culture of is that all there is because we've reached the top of Maslow's hierarchy. We've reached the top of the pyramid at least most of us in consumed culture in any kind of way. In America. The middle class post-war era of course. We're gonna make art that's self interested in narcissistic and there's a care about politics of course. We're going to make that kind of art. It's just as the CIA encouraged intentionally and raised up the profile two places. Maybe it wouldn't have gotten so they reached a level of hegemonic understanding as rightness. In the Academy.

It might not have got otherwise so it helped her over the line but it didn't create it of course. I'm the same same time the CIA was doing that the CIA was also doing operation Mockingbird which was gaining a literal influence over America's America's newspapers. America's media direct provision like through blackmail and through bribery and some more nation to turn reporters into agents of the state putting out CIA propaganda for domestic consumption like literal manufacturing consent like not even through a propaganda model there through just literally writing checks and presumably doing blackmail like a lot of the top political consultants and stuff back then and guys were black highly black available. There was a guy I think his name was Drew Pearson who was like the Dean of the DC press corps who was also gay and was heavily rumored to have been photographed either by the KGB or the CIA or both in flagrante delicto and as a result you know he was basically captured by intelligence.

Same thing happened with other guys and also. Others they paid and then at the same time is that they were doing MKULTRA which is so you've got. These pursuits meant to create a mollified public perception like a massage and controlled perception for the public both aesthetic in the in the in the Pollux in the in the in the modernism stuff like factual like like epistemological with the news media and now literally psychologically with MKULTRA. Like they want to control. It was really a full-spectrum attempt in the heady post-war days to control the human mind in every respect control what it the the world had encountered conceptually and controlled the actual chemical processes going on within it and the degree to which they were successful is honestly one that we'll never know because think of it this way alright so we have a narrative that yeah.

All this stuff happened but we found out about it the 70s the Church Committee and all that and then you know there was some flare-ups in the year since like iran-contra and stuff. But for the most part the CIA is like power is diminished. They're sort of like the Mafia which is very similar very fitting since they do the same function of somavia and they cooperate with the Mafia a lot of stuff including the Kennedy assassination but like they're on a decline. Their influence is waning like now there's just a bunch of Schmucks who can't stop 9/11 and or predict that the Berlin Wall is gonna fall but isn't that what we would think of it. If all those things have been successful if all those experiments have been successful and they really were able to create some sort of a broad spectrum propaganda model that combines airwaves and literal chemical brain conditioning to to essentially massage the human mind besides the will of the people towards tractable ends. Keep guardrails basically wouldn't we remember that as being like oh yeah and then then they just went away instead of oh yeah. They took over everything no we wouldn't know that that would defeat the whole purpose if they needed to do that if they if they didn't have to do this stuff to our brain. Then they would live in a world where they could just be out and say hey we control you. But they can't do that so they have to do what would they would do is. They would make us think that they went away well actually controlling everything I'm not saying that's true in fact. I think it probably isn't but the disturbing thing for me is it seems like the world we live in and the degree of manipulation that it's just carried out in full view of everyone. Never changing anything makes me feel like there is some mechanisms that actually worked some combination of persuasion and and perception massage massaging and and chemical rearrangement.

[29:22](https://youtu.be/fDlapyOpFcU?t=29m22s)

I don't know this is some 420. This is a very 424a stream I'm gonna put this one on YouTube. I'm not gonna put all these on YouTube. I'm only gonna put the ones I think they're decent but yeah. This is definitely feeling very 4:20. I'm feeling very paranoid I mean the everything is true like the writ like the post Epstein moment when I was like yeah give me every conspiracy.

I believe it on just because someone like we live in a world where it's essentially a quantum realm. If something could be imagined. It happened so if there's a conspiracy then there it's real yeah yeah man this wild. It's a wild life we got here that's a WoW and of course I say. This is someone who has been accused multiple times of being a CIA operative. Either knowing or unknowing. I had been accused of taking money I'm being handled by the CIA. It's part of an a propaganda operation and the funny thing is is that there's evidence to that. At least not about me is about my co-workers that would be acceptable in certain circumstances if you really are already motivated to believe it so it's like how many things do I believe that are just as wrong as other people thinking that I'm in the CIA is so that makes me think maybe none of it's true. Maybe all of us are projecting onto it because that's the danger of conspiracy thinking is that you have to project into the holes and if you do that how much of it is you and how much of it is real yeah.

It's very hard to tell and like quantify that so I don't know man. I don't know anything everything will be true. Nothing is true or more likely a mixture but I don't know the percentage like it's like is it like a is that like ground beef like it's like ninety. Ten. I don't know is it well-marbled is the well and richly marbled reality. I don't know I don't know guys. I do not know how do you know I'm not CIA. Exactly. You don't I know I'm not like I'm deep unless unless that MKULTRA works even better than they say and like there's hours of the day that are blacked out. And I'm actually doing their bidding when I hear my trigger word unless that's the case. I'm no I'm not. But nobody else can say that with since it means everyone dies while I was gonna suspect everyone else oh boy. That's the other thing brace is a guy. His biography raises eyebrows. So I see why people have a real belief that he is. But I know he's not but that doesn't go farther than me that doesn't convince anybody who's not my life. So how are we supposed to make sense of this knowing that knowing that there are people who have perfectly decent reasons to suspect my CIA connections I am NOT.

But that doesn't change the fact that people have to make sense of the world and they have to choose what to believe and the fact is. I really don't know where the hook you can put the hooks I don't know where you can like what is load-bearing. In this I like to think that madera dialectical materialism is I really do think that I mean like I believe that the dialectic I think I really think that that is the wheel of history like I think that's how it works you know in a deep level. Like that is the thing I'm confident of but how how much am I understanding the actual world like to what degree am I held captive to the Demiurge. You know the the Demiurge of like the techno society where I'm only getting this. Like these. These these crafted bits of information sent to me in in the overwhelming geyser that I could never be able to sift through for a moment. How are we supposed. I mean regimes of the past. It was difficult to resist them because people didn't run able to get enough information even know it was going on. Now. There's too much information to make sense of any of it. You need a heuristic and every eristic is tainted. Every years tick is tainted because it where does it come from it comes from rationality but there has to be an empirical basis. There has to be an empirical basis and how can we trust any of our empirical inputs. How could we trust any of our Imperial inputs. I know yes people say pin Shawn.

Yeah Spencer would be perfect but like that is you know what give me a minute. I know what I'm gonna read. I'll be right back. It'll be a minute. Hi guys hello so what I'm gonna read is a section from the very early part of Thomas Pynchon's against the day which is his book about Findus cycle America the early modern the birth of like the modern America basically and there's a thing here that is one of the most skillful beautiful. Here it is.

It's a description of the Chicago stockyards and it's from the point of view of a crew of like sort of Jules Verne II adventurers on a hot on a hot-air balloon going to the World's Fair Columbian Exposition in Chicago as they came in low over the stockyards. The smell found them the smell and the uproar flesh learning its mortality like the dark conjugate of some day lit fiction that they had flown here as appeared increasingly likely to help promote somewhere down. There was the White City promised in the Columbian Exposition brochures somewhere among the tall smokestacks unceasingly vomiting black grease smoke the effluvia of Boucherie unremitting into which the buildings of the league's of City lying downwind retreated like children into sleep which brightest not reprieve from the day with bringeth. Not reprieve from the day in the stockyards. Workers coming off shift overwhelmingly of the Roman faith able to detach from earth and blood for a few precious seconds looked up at the airship and wonder imagining a detachment of not necessarily helpful angels beneath the rubbernecking chums of chance wheeled streets and alleyways in a Cartesian grid seppia mile on mile. The great bovine city of the world breed lindsay in wanzer indeed the backs of cattle far outnumber. The tops of human hats from this height. It was as if the chums who as who out on adventures past had often witnessed the vast herds of cattle adrift in ever-changing cloud like patterns across the western plains. Here saw that unshaped freedom being rationalized into movement only in straight lines and at right angles and a progressive reduction of choices until the final terms of the final gate that led to the killing floor.

Hello is that's how I stuck with me doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Wow somebody really wants me to do a ruby ridge. Waco and Wendy braided past what's your fav Twitter moment I mean I don't think I have different ones than most people who didn't love the wife email. One of the best wifey I was so funny angel and strawberry was really funny. There was also a day when we did. A bunch of Simpsons memes about a tweet from someone where they said sucking dick well. My man's plays. 2k oh. You thought I said my man's dick faux and we did a bunch of Simpsons things about that that was really funny ted. Cruz porn was good the take. The faves you could put your hat into water and fill up with fee just anything you reference any reference just blew up. People were nuts and you could take any old meme and slap that in there and you'd give you just a yeah so well do.

We is our minds our own a question that has been asked often and I don't think has ever been answered our minds our own. I don't know I mean they aren't in any real sense but are they I guess is. There some connective tissue between the self and that social understanding or is it severed and replaced by the ideology that is now dominated our brains. There's no way of knowing. It's got to throw your hands up in the air and go like the guy. The shrugging gentleman from our favorite things on the internet emojis we love. Emojis don't we folks ah does anyone have a movie recommendation for tonight like to watch a movie.

[41:29](https://youtu.be/fDlapyOpFcU?t=41m29s)

I don't know if Kim Oh Sheldon is dead. I don't have his phone number. I can't get him down the beeper. I don't know why you think I would have that information but that's flattering I guess to think that you believe me to have connections in the North Korean inner circles. I do not I am in your fellow-traveller with the Juche AI deal. Honestly. I feel like everybody should get on the good side of Josh a because I kind of feel like it might be the dominant ideology in the human history that like when if humans existed like propagating through the galaxy and become like a dune dune like Empire of systems and systems and trillions and trillions of people it'll be under an underlying Juche a ideology because as far as I could see and this was true before the before the virus came that North Korea was well situated to survive more well intact than other social-political polities. In the occasion of a genuine crisis caused by global warming I guess. It's up there. It's in the North. You know it's not gonna get too hot all of a sudden. It's gonna be able to sustain a local ecology and they're also gonna have more social cohesion than most of the surrounding places. So what if there have relatively defensible borders what if they hold out and great and become like the only coherent body politic in like the post collapse world and everything else is you know reverted to reverted to you know the Peloponnese.

Before the rise of the city-states you know prehistory. Jiuxiang will have an advantage and the flag of GA will ride over the world and recently refound civilization along juicy ideals and then it is jus che that harness is the atom to its full power and the carpets the galaxies in a in a human panspermia Oh. With the idea that the Kim's RA fine like God Emperor type thing like when it was. By the time I guess the space it would essentially be like doing or Warhammer where the god Emperor would be the Kim's. Like the lizard. The the sensed the sand snake or the sand worm headed. God Emperor is is the Kim like passed down through all like the same. The consciousness passed from every generation starting with Kim Jong or kim il-song so that'd be cool what if that happens that'd be funny so get on the right side of Juche a folks.

It might end up being the winner in the history books. Dune isn't really very good as a book. I finally I only read it recently. I rate it as a kid the way that well and Felix had but it's brutally put badly written. The guy is a bad writer and it's all the only thing that people like about it is. It's truly interesting world building. I mean people talk about the the actual I do but that's really kind of just a ripoff of like Lawrence of Arabia. It's just classic Orientalism with some space voodoo thrown. On there. The interesting thing is like the idea of a human of a space human society which thousands of years ago have seen an ideological rejection of like computers and so you have space travel and. But it's all due to the human brain being essentially harnessed for like unnatural uses. That's cool but Larry and jihad that's cool the spice melange it must flow.

The spice must flow what Nightcrawler with Jake Gyllenhaal that's a great movie I love that movie also very poorly paced too. Like the end of that book has Paul Atreides army nuking the paddy shower empire or whatever and then it just it all happens on like three paragraphs like oh and then they did the nukes and then they I guess you're trying to convey like. It's inevitable at that point. But man it's very. It doesn't feel very entertaining and I'm sure that the fill-in wave movie will be very fun to watch and I will see it. I will see it because I didn't see Blade Runner because I don't give a about Blade Runner and all. I don't like the war. I don't care about the world. I don't care about the movie. I don't care about the replicants they can all suck me. So I didn't care I am interested because having read dune and thinking it's a cool concept. I do have interest in seeing it depicted by villain laughs.

Ubi can you hear guys can you hear me. Now all right can you hear me okay ubi yes inevitable. We're gonna get inevitable. EB I saw that the other day. It's just. It's gonna be on the terms of the bosses and it's just gonna be a way to keep you from like totally dying in the streets.

This is it's just a just to maintain minimal social cohesion to allow for markets to continue their magic. How's everybody doing 420 blaze of guys 420 blaze it. I am a Minnesota hot dish. I'm in Wisconsin hot dish. I never really had hot dish thank God we weren't we didn't. We weren't Scandinavians so I didn't have to endure the hot dish because that looked like real. Oh should Quebec secede sure why not everyone should secede. I know I was saying the other day that we need international institutions but in the absence of that break all of them into such small units that they're not economically viable and maybe that will like slow down the world economy enough to give us some time to deal with climate change so sure. Let's just break up all the. T1000 after it gets shot when it's covered in liquid nitrogen in t2. How about that I don't know if we're gonna polka dies we'll see I don't know if we're gonna balkanize or if we're gonna vulcanize. I hope we do vulcanize honestly. The US could do city-states considering how radical the cultural and economic schisms are between suburban and urban air and I'm sorry rural and urban areas.

We're like actually now. It's fine we'll close like they didn't even need it. They didn't even just they were so instinctively deferential to them. So it's like. They'd still be a charge.

You need a place where you don't have like entrenched powerful elites and that's really it's hard to think of places like maybe in the big square areas. I don't know maybe in the deep south where they're very little in the way of like functional infrastructure. Anyway who knows maybe you could get actual cooperative farming or something out of that. I don't know get some hammer and hoe action going all I know is I hope that I will be allowed to be the court jester for some warlord. Somewhere just please. I don't know if I'll be very useful as a warrior or even as a honestly as a peasant. I've got a I've got a legitimate disability. I don't know if I have the spoons to to labor and your vineyards so if you could just keep me on as a jester who could maybe like make fun of and perhaps gently roast some in your entourage as a form of amusement or rile up your troops to send them off to fight and claim the lands of another warlord something like that just you know keep just please just keep. My resumes on file guys. Yeah I could be Bob Hope I could do like I could do performances for the troops before they go on like a hunter-killer raid of the nearby territories.
