A hungry feeling came Army stealing and the mice were dreaming in my prison cell and The Old Triangle went jingle Jango all along the banks of the Royal Canal male prison. There's 75 women and all among them. I wish I could dwell and The Old Triangle wood jinglewood Jango all along the banks of the Royal Canal all along the banks all the Royal Canal Howdy Folks. How's it going so if anybody might remember this a while ago back when we had the office in New York. I had somebody sent us this set of Desert Storm trading cards and we just emptied out the office and we mailed everything out here and I got them I was actually thinking like a week ago how fun and delightful the Desert Storm trading card set is and how much I wish I could open it because there's a ton of these barely open any of them and boom. Now I have them I have them I have like a whole thing of these. It's awesome and it's such a wonderful 

It's a wonderful Time Capsule of like the end of History like when when American hegemony was first solidifying into like a enduring cultural reality that persisted until I would say what date would I put it on. When did we give up on American hegemony. Maybe you know Bungalow got elected 2008 crisis yeah. Iraq had already been sort of accepted as a failure by that point and then you had the economic Clash on top of that yeah 2008. So we we had like a live cultural Assumption of end of History. I would argue in American geometry even after 9 11 because the war on terror is an attempt to respond to the specific traumatic event of 9 11 by pushing post Cold War American hegemony into the realm of military domination and outside of the realm of you know economic control through Reserve currency and things like that which as we are now seeing is vulnerable if you've got. Rising powers to deal with which was going to be an inevitable response to results of the end of the Communist.

 block but we were going to fight it. We're gonna put our feet down into the Middle East. we're gonna put a boot up everyone's ass and we were going to extend American territorial control over the most important strategic resource and the real backer of currency in the post. 70s World economy oil because we had a gold standard in the 19th century that transitioned eventually into an oil standard. By the 70s the Petro dollar. They call it but we're going to make Petra the petrodollar the permanent feature of the global economy simply by parking America's military resources right where it came out which really doesn't it has nothing to do with like a specific actor within the world. Oil Market getting it like that was the blood foil thing that was facile and then a lot of Matthew Iglesias type slugs like to make fun of oh you're doing.

They think they're doing this for Chevron. No of course not it's a fungible resource. The question is what are the political institutions that are going to exist where it gets pulled out of the ground. That's that actually matters as we're seeing like deciding where to it's a fundable resource but deciding who gets it at what price is still something that can't be planned for and is planned for by OPEC and OPEC.

Situation is different if the US military backs directly your puppet regime through military occupation but of course that was you know not the original idea. The George H.W bush idea that the not that the Persian Gulf War was a set piece to present to the world. I think this is the best way to think about it would not have America taking over in the Middle East. It would have America as the chief enforcer of a global economic order that benefited America maintaining that system and sure you know the rising tide raising all boats wink wink as they liberalize their economies wink wink but the US wouldn't have to stop their army all over the place but we soon found out oh no this thing's a lot rickety more rickety than we thought it was and America's centrality to the global capitalist economy was getting to the point where it was conflicting with the greater health of the organism and when that happens to when you have a conflict between the self-interest of the national host organ for global capitalism and the world economic order.

The world system you get a removal of headquarters from one country to another from the Netherlands to the UK to the United States and we are at the point that the UK was in by the 20s and that the Dutch were in by at least by the 1700s foreign. But we like them are fighting it and we fight them the way that at the end all fighting comes down to actual armies in the field. That is why we're probably going to fight the Chinese and make them take it from us instead of peacefully handed over the way that the Dutch and the English did and it might just come down to cultural difference. You know could it just be that like the Dutch could hand over the Reigns to the English and feel like well. We're going to be taken care of by that Arrangement and the British could certainly feel like especially after we saved their ass in World War one because that we they owed us enough money that it was in our interest to see them win. they were happy to turn it over to us. But can we turn it over to China which is not part of our You know cultural Heritage our linguistic. background you know and yeah. It's like does that mean proxy wars. I don't know I don't know if the US can really afford and I don't mean that with monetarily I mean kind of in every sense culturally politically to do proxy war.

Anymore. I I feel like or um to um to do proxy war with China anyway because the withdrawal from Afghanistan stows that there is no remaining stomach for any troop deployment of any size anywhere and you know your proxy wars eventually draw in your side So I think they're just going to end up going in both boots first without even having a proxy war. intermediary like the us could fight a proxy war with Russia for one part because they're able to destroy Russia direct Russian military Assets in the Ukraine whereas they don't have to risk you know U.S Personnel. That's a huge like that's just free money from from a geostrategic standpoint to draw that out as long as possible. But that's because Russia isn't really a threat to anybody. I mean we've we've hyped it up. It turned into a boogeyman in this country precisely because of its relative weak position because it's reassuring to imagine that it's just the Russians we have to worry about.

It's a different story like China is the big bad behind the whole thing China is the US's strategic Nemesis even though our economies are ascent and our political and economic systems are essentially integrated like compared to any past. political and economic orders that have existed on earth related and and you compare their the relationship between the political and economic systems of different countries. if you had the sort of interconnectivity that the US does with China you would look at it and you'd say oh. That's one organism. We would have a school of thought that says this is best referred to as one thing and of course you have nerds on the other side. Saying actually I think that they're distinct enough but the it would be on the table that these are essentially the same political this is the same political economy and yet we're in a real trajectory towards armed conflict which is insane and and Madness.

But Madness is at the root of the rationality of Western capitalist technological liberalism. It is it is a rationality rationality of a a crisp reinforcing and this is the most important part effectively utilized rationality a rationality that can be weaponized and directed towards scientific and technological advances that give you like real Force multipliers as a social organ. This is a rational order that affirms for everyone within it. It's usefulness every day by its fruits. It's built out of fundamental irrationality that there can't be that there could be a non-holistic relationship between the members of the human species and members of the human species and their bio and that means at the end of capitalism. What do you have you have one knitted together global social political economic organ a media a machine a supply chain that operates throughout the entire Globe using Global standards and it agreed upon legal framework to transact trade relationships.

This is the dream of any communist but instead of that machine working towards the benefit of the people and and lives within it. It is tearing them apart destroying them and driving everything against itself including the two biggest economies. Within this machine the two biggest nodes of production and and and Administration and instead of recognizing that common interest they're gonna blow each other up and this is I've pointed out many times you can't get out of the American politics and say no no. There's some strand of meaningful American politics that is free of this death drive. This capitalist death drive because we've got two main parties in this country. All political activity cultural output and effort is in the Backdraft of these two parties and they're both committed in the medium turn to stepping up military conflict with China and they have a rhetoric and a political language that they cultivate among the American people that is premised on escalating conflict with China and even if it's cynical is here's the thing it can be 100 cynical for most of these guys they'll be like of course. We can't go to war with China that's insane but you know a million coveted dead completely dysfunctional American political system collapsing life expectancy like a real sense of malaise.

Beyond malays like malays comes from at least like a contented morass. Like this is gridlock in panic conditions. This is a car stuck on train tracks and you can hear the. The goddamn choo choo coming and there's no way that we could directly relate directly address any of the fundamental causes of this because those causes are intertwined with our power so what does that leave us with it really just leaves us with China and the thing is though this is where it gets really interesting how the how this mirrors itself and how both parties generate the same psychological Universe with the same Rogues Gallery. The same emotional language and tenor they just are expressed differently but by the same people who are been turned. My Geographic dis difference into these terrifying chimeras of one another and they strike at an attack while not recognizing the the underlying Unity.

So you've got the the the the GOP obviously yes war with China based Anti-Imperialist Tucker Carlson hugely a China Hawk and that is why I don't need to hear anything else about Tucker Carlson's. Bona fides as an Anti-Imperialist as a guy who talks about Socialism or a guy who talks about um the working class in some abstract sense if you are on if you are down with China hawkishness that means you are fundamentally about ascribing the organic problems of the American political system and the contradictions embedded within them for an outside Boogeyman. That's it everything flows from that and that means it's all. If that's the where it starts from so pay no. Mindless from the jump there but of course as war with China means nukes. Everyone understands that so that is why I think a lot of these people are cynical and they're just fine trying to find somebody to blame. But we have to have some sort of hot theater or potentially hot theater where we can kind of get off a little bit on like the the military part of of identifying psychologically with a hegemon which is what we're all doing in the political space is pretending LARPing as the god America you know as as this as this insanely powerful force in the world and for the GOP.

That's the the secondary villain who can be attacked militarily is of course Mexico so now you've got this new emerging idea among the based internet right that we need to go to war with Mexico and it's now getting onto Fox News and stuff like that and spreading to the old people. Now the Democrats. Also at the end of the day have China as the big bad. China is the thing we have to confront but again you need a smaller enemy who you can directly confront and for them for the Democrats. It's Russia and so the Republic. The Democrat Republican fantasy have had to deal with or sublimated war with our son made a conflict with China that we cannot consummate without annihilating ourselves. We fantasize about securing the border with an epic based like we we create a bunch of like glanton's Raiders of guys on golf carts to go down with letters of Mark and scalp. Sinaloa cartel guys play with that toy play with that chew toy and the Democrats have their little worn Ukraine that they get to they get to treat like a little terrarium and they get to check in on and oh look look oh. It looks like the ukrainians have retaken smogorsk. It looks like the stroganoff belt is in Ukrainian hands. Now justice for the 2016 election will be enhanced. Justice for Hillary will be at hand foreign but it's all it's all just a a cover a way to dance around the 

The death drive towards war with China which is of course sitting on top of the deeper and even more unaccessibly remotely subconscious but known abyss of radical accelerating climactic change and the domino effect of result of impact that'll have on every other element of society. None of this can be directly confronted so it is sublimated. We sublimate the the climate anxiety into our war with our war for control of like the world stage. As if that's the thing that you know you can. Even imagine is going to exist for too long in the future and then turn that into a theater of blood that you can prance and splash around it yeah so yeah.

 it's amazing how much ink and mine mind power is spent debating the relative usefulness of one pundit or another in in like oh They're spreading this message you know and nobody on the left is really doing that if their framework is we have to stop all this woke nonsense so we could face the Real Enemy China you're not getting to any critique of capitalism there that can be operational that can be operated from. They can turn into a a policy that a party might endorse you are tailing a political party that that's very nature refuses all class critique in its policy proposals like it won't survive the process of moving from raw votes to candidates and and um elected officials through the legislative process which is dominated not by the the wielders of raw votes but by the wielders of coordinated and self-conscious dollars foreign so that should hopefully free you from like feeling like you need to have an opinion on. If when Tucker Carlson gets fired you don't you can pay none of this any mine because it is only when you deny. The Chinese scapegoat vent that you can actually Zone in on and triangulate towards actual causes identify actual phenomena and then build responses through policy to those realities.

What if China attacks Taiwan very good question I don't really think that they need to attack Taiwan. There's actually been a significant movement towards rapproachment with the People's Republic in Taiwan. I believe like the kmt aligned party the party that um emerged out of Chiang kai-shek's regime. The dope smuggling Warlords who got kicked out in 48 I believe correct me if I'm wrong the party that like is the relic of their military Junta that took over and massacred the formosans in in like the 50s. There now the relative China dubs. So you know the same way that there is a peace faction right. The kmt was always about you know reunification but for a long time they sort of assumed they could reunite on their terms and now they're realizing that they can't it's going to be on the It's going to be on the Chinese Communist party's term.

But they I don't think I don't think really there's no need like given the way that Putin himself conceived of the problem of Ukraine. Like you can argue about whether his take on it was accurate or not. But I do think that his view of Ukraine made War the only outcome and that is the large part because we pushed him in that direction. He still made the decision and it was a bad one and all that it was a disastrous decision. It's awful. No one is getting any benefit from the war in Ukraine. It's just misery for misery's sake. All the worst people in the world are benefiting on both sides. NATO of course the United States for sabotaging zelinski's peace initiative. Because he got elected on a peace platform. He got elected on let's talk to the Russians and then once in office. The Putin took the bait but why because for him Ukraine it's the the lifeblood of Russia is is oil. That's it they're a Petro state they're like a Soviet. They're just a buffed up Saudi Arabia and it's literally bleeding out of them through Ukraine. It's like a stiletto wound a puncture in the aorta so you're just bleeding out through Ukraine because you know he sees the zero-sum game of power politics in the in the shadow of America's failing hegemony and he recognizes like if we don't if we're giving anything to them. Then they're going to use.

It too turn us into every other failed state. That is eventually brought low for the having the temerity to challenge America and this is on the base of a very weak Russian economy and a very poor Russian population and it just it's a it's a country that has a lot. It's shitty. It's a shitty country and we had a lot to do with that. But it is It's shitty in a way that China isn't because even though there's as much there's probably worse absolute poverty in China than there is in Russia there is a trajectory away from it. Whereas Russia is just this stagnant Pond and you're getting this like hugely enriched ruling class. Everyone else is missing.

They're us on steroids. They're us further along in the process that we're on like. We're experiencing our early 90s Free Fall. The very beginning of it like we're in like 1986 87 on the trajectory that the Soviet Union was on so with a declining power. But all these missiles in this huge military and you've got this bleeding wound in Ukraine. I have been to Russia I've been to St Petersburg once I wasn't there very long Then you feel like you are forced to make make that move you can try now and maybe secure a better position for yourself by like flexing your muscles and going where they wouldn't think you would and establishing a new Baseline kind of the way that the US thought they were going to do with the Iraq War but if you don't and maybe you won't maybe it'll fail maybe you're. China is not in that situation with Taiwan China has no existential fear of Taiwan. Not even I mean remaining what it is because that's the thing like it's. It's relationship is not It's not in flux the way that Ukraine seem to be in flux towards like NATO membership. You know oh and the reason there were.

Soviets never got to where they needed to be somebody just reminds us. They say Russia should have done more technology transfers seriously but they were always behind the eight ball technologically and they still did amazing stuff with what they had. They went to the and destroyed by the Russians. It's a style or the Nazis. It's astounding but they had to spend so much money on the military because we were making them that they were. They were locked into a technological underdevelopment so yeah.

I think that obviously China it imagines in the in the in the long term they're going to get Taiwan back. I think that probably will happen I think depending on it's really going to depend on situation in the United States. The political stability of the American nation state that is going to determine the the the Taiwan end game because if we are you know stable I think there is a world where we can talk our way to a integration of Taiwan into China on the model of the integration of Hong Kong into China. I think that is doable for the Taiwanese in the long term for the Chinese. In the long term. It's doable. It's a question of whether we would accept that or not foreign. I think it is more likely that the U.S essentially precipitates intentionally a Taiwan crisis rather than responds to just a unilateral Chinese invasion of Taiwan the way that Russia invaded Ukraine that is more likely to me and that is the point where like everybody knows you can't go to war with China. But if the choice is go to China or the complete an immediate end to everyone's position of power within a structure. Then maybe you get into the Putin's point where you're like I might lose if I go to war. But I definitely lose if I don't that's where Putin is now. That's where we are probably going to get in the future relative to China and specifically Taiwan I guess we did. I just said we precipitated the Ukraine invasion and I said that from Putin's point of view he didn't feel like he had a choice.

I'm also saying that that is wrong and stupid and it's the problem with political structures that end up just being manifestations of one person's neuroses. So back to these guys. This whole thing we're talking about. It seems to be reaching a critical stage. The post Cold War attempt by the United States to hold on to it's artificially No I guess artificial no longer efficient counterproductive how about that counterproductive headquartering of global capitalism. Because the thing is yeah it's moving to China but ideally it would eventually move away from any one nation state. On the long term. It would eventually dissolve into the global bloodstream capitalism. You know I think that's what the Bitcoin people think blockchain and cryptocurrency will get us to but It's it's not going to be any technological change.

It's going to be capitalism moving through stages and its relationship to the nation-state as a form of power projection because for the immediate for the future for the for the current moment in the near future. The nation state is still a critical element within capitalism as much as we talk about how corporations have undermined state functions and the state has been sort of gutted its ability to enforce. Legal Frameworks is still necessary for capitalism to work and that has to for now because capital capital somewhere. Eventually though you would if everything doesn't collapse and there's nuclear war or whatever you would have a decentralized capitalism. We're not there yet or anywhere close. So instead there is the migration to the new functional headquarters because the United States can no longer function as the headquarters of capitalism look what it is done with. Its power look what it's done with its military look what it's done with its power of sanction look what it's done with its Central Banking policy.

Everybody is insanely pissed at the United States right now for what they're doing with the central banks and now with the IRA. We have worn out our welcome. We don't know how to function for the greater good of the whole organism. China has this party structure that has Harvest its economic structures in a way that the United States political system cannot do and. In a future of Crisis which is what the 21st century is then that kind of say capacity is necessary at the center of power but we're going to fight it because we built the thing and we see in our loss of it centrality our self-destruction because we cannot imagine a life without the material comforts that have defined American identity treats in snarky shorter. Shorthand foreign is that the U.S the IRA changed the way that the U.S subsidizes electronic vehicle production and it allows for direct subsidy not through intermediaries and that is something that the EU has resisted doing you know largely because they've got the Germans in charge of their Central Bank and they are allergic to inflation in a way that Americans aren't and so now the U.S EV sector is completely behind the eight ball here relatively in the American one and they are pissed and yeah like there is there's a hope to find some they call it multilateralism but multilateralism is.

This is the summer of 1914. Multilateralism is not good for nobody including capitalism. You need for the at least for the moment. The continued headquartering of a global economic system. I mean friend. macron has now been like making noises that the French anyway are looking more to the Chinese than to us and part of that is him just trying to play de Gaulle because you got to remember that the French have this reputation. This self-conceived idea of themselves as the cool European country that did not become an American colony after World War II. The way that all the other cucks in NATO did and they would Flex their power by you know like going all out on nuclear in a way that the other Coast War countries were freaking out about because of their appetite for Uranium and also de Gall pulling out of NATO at one point French exceptionalism. Because the French are the Americans of Europe way more than the British are Jared Harris I haven't gotten that one before Lane price from Mad Men the son of Richard Harris I'll take it. He's a snack I'll take that comparison somebody else said it.

I didn't say it. But it's because we had the revolutions. It's because the U.S and the French both had populists in some way Democratic revolutions against the remnants of feudalism in the eighth. In the 17th century. of course you know the English did it earlier but they did it so early that it still had the vocabulary of religion around it. It was still thought of by the culture itself as a religious War which meant that as religion receded from the public sphere of the impact the memory of that war sort of faded with it but as you know the as the enlightenment Dawns and as as Bourgeois nationalism trumps the old feudal order all through Europe It's the US and France who are like creating those National identities those specific sort of national identities that have a sacred nationalism where the reli the religious element has been secularized and pulled out of the confessional Christian realm and turned into a quasi-ethnic sort of linguistic ideological identity. So that is why the French of the Americans of Europe for totally different reasons the Turks are the Americans of the Middle East. You might say what about Israel Israel is just the United States. It's not the of of anything it's just a gangrenous growth. It's like if the village is detached from Florida floated across the Atlantic went through the The Straits of Gibraltar and then just flooded across the Mediterranean and just got lodged next to Lebanon.

There's no such thing as not worshiping fact that was why the the turn towards new atheism among internet young people and like younger more educated culture at Large in the early 21st century. It was a complete disaster and I I say that as somebody who of course participated in some way with that General sentiment but that really was like instead of being some sort of rational response to America's religious Insanity. It became a deepening of that insanity and saying saying instead of like yo your your version of God is this cramped neurotic projection of yourself and that like God is something far more vast multifarious mysterious alien than anything that can be so right nightly so tightly packed into a political identity instead. You're just saying no There's nothing but this material realm. pure rationality is the only revealer of Truth and it's like no. It's the ultimate distorter and and obscure of truth and the proof of that is what we are doing to the goddamn planet in in our belief in our irrational religious belief. In our own rationality.

We're going to do a global suicide bombing. We're doing it and why are all those guys reactionaries now because it was never a It was never a response to class exploitation or or the capitalism. As such the real generators of any problem. It was this cultural revulsion towards people who were coded as less educated. It was a way to distinguish oneself from the American herd and also from the repulsive muslimen. The the vile m ammadians come on and I gotta say like this current moment as monstrous. As it feels I have to say culturally I prefer it and what's around in it to that bush era which was just the most radioactively dead cultural soil that has existed I maybe ever in the United States. It was a it was a Bonneville Salt Flat. It was. It was a ecstatic self lobotomizing like people chewed their own. They somehow found a way to get their teeth up into their into their brains and just chewed away. Their frontal lobe I mean yes the 90s was arid but it had nothing on the lead-in and thoughtless. conformity of the Bush era. Like yes 90s extreme culture is of course laughable and embarrassing now but it it was compared to the bush era. It was positively vibrant yeah. You could still vestigially transgress. You had like the Genet you had Gen X you had the slacker. You know you had this persistent counterculture that was totally politically defanged and depressed because it had arrived just as history was ending But it was still a Counterpoint that Counterpoint got totally obliterated in that post. Bush era you really did even though the internet existed and like you could you know read blogs and stuff and you could you know you had friends and there were zines you still felt like you lived in occupied territory. Anywhere you went thank you for reminding me so let's go back to the beginning of when this hero all starts.

I love the I love a good periodization and I would say that the most important dates of post-war American our 1947 which is the year among other things that the taft-hartley ACT is signed and passed over the veto of President Trump. the other 1980 the election of Ronald Reagan and 1991 the father Soviet Union Desert Storm and then of course 2001 then 2008. 2016. Now what you'll see is that they keep coming faster. Why is that because that's that's how you chart a crisis that's how you chart the deepening of a fundamental crisis within a system. Oh rapid disruptive. Traumatic events are happening faster and faster time wave thank you Terence McKenna. So this thing began with dreams of a Brave. New World Bush himself said it he didn't care what people were going to think about it. He didn't even it even occur to him probably that anyone could do that because to him it was self-self-evident that this new world was going to be best for America broadly understood because that's the thing about guys like bushes. They believe their own to a certain degree like America is the best country and if the people in America are having in aggregate the best time then all is right with the world and you know that he probably viewed the Center of America as a bunch of farm animals. But he did think that american-led Global Imperium would be a good way for farm animals to live. It would be good conditions. It would be like wagyu but of course people living on the other side of that experience. They heard Brave the world and they freaked out and we had a whole culture.

Around venerating this we turned it into baseball cards and what's so amazing about the Iraq War. The Gulf War is that and it does make you think about 9 11. It was not the Bush Administration responding to events and being like oh cool. Let's go with this that does describe most events. It's not the US doing something and precipitating something and then through a plan. It's a thing happens and the U.S puts it to their best Advantage. Because they have the power to but in the Iraq War case. You have a situation where the US was in a position to interpose itself between Saddam and the kuwaitis. They were in a position to draw a red line for Saddam diplomatically and even push him in the kuwaitis towards some sort of deal that deal could have involved among other things the kuwaitis laying off on the money that Saddam owed them for oil I'm sorry for loans that he had taken out during the Iran Iraq War. You know debt relief some sort of profit sharing in disputed zones. It could have been worked out instead what the US did through its Iraqi Ambassador April. Glaspy is they went to Saddam and they said to him point blank in the face. We have no interest in your dispute with the kuwaitis. It is not an American priority. It is up to you to resolve and then he resolved it by invading Kuwait and then we decided we had our our new globalist Crusade classic bit of entrapment okay. So what did it get us it got us this beautiful moment of course.

What's amazing about it is that it didn't even get George H.W bush a second term. That's what's so stunning and that does really remind you that like the usefulness of propaganda as propaganda for narrow political purposes is pretty limited like if you can pull off the Iraq War this like Monument to a setup Monumental setup and pull it off perfectly and then because you have a three-month economic downturn at the precise wrong moment 18 months later. You're out on your ass for some hillbilly. Hippie a guy who was it's like oh yeah Bill Clinton met JFK when he was a kid because he was such an exceptionable young man. Ass. But the system persisted because because Beyond any one figure even a figure as strategically valuable is George H.W bush Okay. So let's see what we got here. In this deck we have a military assets a Warburg the mig-23 flogger.

This is presuming an Iraqi aircraft. The US did not fly migs the Mig is the that's looking like it's out of focus. The Mig is of course a Russian aircraft. Russia outfitted a lot of the bath regimes in the 70s and 80s so let's see about this. This is this the the Mig flogger flogger was Frogger taken. You could what the is that all right. Here we go an important aircraft in the Iraqi Air Force. The myocan mikayan mig-23 flogger is the second most numerous 90 jet fighter in the Iraqi inventory. The variable sweep Wing add to the aircraft's versatility for multi-mission operations. Some versions can carry a variety of armament or a host of electronics depending on whether the mission is air-to-air or air to surface. Here. It is it's manufactured by Mika Yan. Gervovich speed is mach 2.4 range is 435 miles armaments.

This is always fun one twin barrel 23 millimeter gun. Two Apex and four aphid surface air-to-air missiles crew one with an optional technical seat alright I'm assuming that we didn't really have any dog fights during the Iraq war. They mostly probably just shot those guys down they just like strafed them while they were still grounded. How many dog fights have America's fourth and fifth gen fighters ever been in is the answer zero. There were a few notable dogfights I would like to hear them. If anyone has any modern dogfights of note I would like to hear and yeah shooting down a balloon doesn't count here we go military asset fighting ship the USS England cg22. Here we go the USS England Serbia 99 didn't they just shoot down wasn't that just the Serb shot one down and that guy had to like be rescued and then they made a Owen Wilson movie inspired by it all right. The most recent aired thank you dank bloke. The most recent air-to-air kill scored by an American aircraft came in night 2017. When a U.S Navy fa-18e Super Hornet shot down a Syrian flag su-22 as it bombed american-backed Syrian Democratic forces in the raqqa province of Syria holy crap. So we actually had a air-to-air dogfight kill against Assad. Wow we really did go for it. There.

It's like yeah the O bungler didn't invade but he did everything short to keep them from like cooing him okay the USS England position in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm the Leahy class the Jim Leahy class Cruiser USS England was part of the Squadron of ships surrounding the large Missouri and Wisconsin battleships. Her complement of weapons includes anti-ship missiles and anti-submarine Rockets. The Cruiser's presence was a deterrent in surface assault by the Iraqi Navy home of the England is San Diego California. oh my God I mean I joked about it being Jim Leahy but is it. Patrick Leahy did that like bribe and kind for Congressman that if you if you spend an insane amount of money they will name on military ship.

They will name some of it after you like the stennis. The USS stennis is one of our I believe aircraft carriers because that's some dixiecrat fossil who is on the Foreign Relations Committee for 500 years and gave them a trillion dollars USS Lindy England yes that's very good all right displacement. 8 200 tons full load damn length. 533 feet Armament Harpoon missiles. Rockets two my eyes are I gotta get bifocals. Two Phalanx ciws's the three triple torpedo tubes speed 32 knots crew 423.

It's just it hung out that's what it did. It says it deterred an Iraqi Navy effect wow what was that was that a dinghy so the guys on the England. It sounds like just duck possible because like this set is celebrating the new American Imperium and one of the founding documents of the new Imperial American Imperium is the National Security Act. What year by the way was the National Security Act you might ask glad you asked the National Security Act. NSA was passed in 1947. Combining the U.S army navy and Air Force into the National military establishment. The ACT also created the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. In 1949 an amendment to the ACT replaced the MN mnme with the Department of Defense and placed the NSC under the control of the president 1947. You kill the working Club you kill the long-term viability of America's working-class organs of power labor unions and you build this unaccountable deep State architecture that will act in violent opposition to the goals of those organizations game over at that point and yeah that National Security Act very useful in doing something like ginning up a war with Iraq to create our new world order.

I mean Harry did God bless him. He did he did veto it. You know they just went here we go we got government. It's Sierra Leone folks everybody who is see. This is the thing this is the This is the promise that the New World Order gave to the new world hey if you join our. Phony baloney coalitions to do our Imperial Dirty Work and give us cover while we just bludgeon. recalcitrant countries into Oblivion. Then you get your own little card. You get you get you get like a little bit more foreign aid and you get a card isn't that nice Sierra Leone I'm sure the people who live there were very appreciative of their country's involvement in this conflict Republic of Sierra Leone. In 1787. Freetown now the capital was founded in a as a Haven for freed slaves from Great Britain in North America in 1808 Sierra Leone was reorganized as a British colony. Opposition to colonialism grew slowly until Independence in 1971. The mining of diamonds boxite and gold is the most important industry. Sierra Leone sent 200 troops to Operation Desert Storm. Wow I'm sure they were very very useful geographic area 27 700 square miles population 4.2 million languages English Mendy tamune and Kiro predominant religions Islam animism and Christianity Capital Freetown government type Republic under presidential regime head of government President Joseph Sado Momo. Literally a former colony of the great Brit of the British happened in all right. Here we go it's another country.

Finland Finland is on the other end of the stick when it comes to vestigial populations that have no strategic or or military power and are essentially at the mercy of world capitalism but are instead of being ruthlessly exploited and left to languish in under development coddled and suckled and soothed with Imperial superprofits Republic of Finland ruled by Sweden from 1154 until 1809. Finland became a part of the Russian Empire then became a republic in 1919. Following the very bloody and nasty Finnish Civil War which saw the white fins creating concentration camps for the defeated red fins. During World War II. Part of Finland was taken by the Soviet Union. Then the rest of it allied with the Nazis against the Soviet Union located in northern Europe. Finland shares borders with Norway Sweden and the USSR join the United Nations in 1955. Finland provided economic and assistance and support for the International Red Cross military hospital for operation so they gave like five bucks for some Band-Aids that was finland's contribution. The hypodermic needles and bed pants get away with anything. Geographic somebody says most autistic country. I think it's still the swedes. I think that lapis that Lapland admixture prevents the fins from being the most autistic country. I I think I think those Sammy's stop the fins from being as autistic as the sweets geographic area. 130 119 square miles population 5 million language Finnish and Swedish predominant religion Lutheranism Capital Helsinki government type Republic head of government prime minister Hari hokere if you ever wondered why is Finland the only Scandinavian country with a president instead of a king for one. They're not really technically Scandinavia because Scandinavian is a language group and Finnish is not Scandinavian language. It's a ugoric language like Estonian is it Estonian or Latvian I always forget which one it is one of those two final year geek Estonia okay thank you so Estonian Finnish. They're part of the same language group not scandinated but also because it was a Colonial holding for all the time of European feudal heyday. They were ruled by the swedes and then by the the Russians the whole time okay.

Here we go military asset armor and artillery. The Challenger main battle tank get a look at the Challenger. Main battle at Hank look at this bad boy I'm always holding this not high enough up is that it yeah there it is look at that look. At that look at the right up. There was some cool tank action during Iraq Desert Storm I mean obviously it was it was Washington generals versus the Harlem Globetrotters but you know they were slugging it out a little bit Challenger main battle tank the United king. The United Kingdom's Challenger main battle tank became operational in 1983 and served in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. Its armor known as shobaham consists of a combination of ceramic plastic and steel plates that absorb the deflect incoming routes. The Laser Rangefinder and thermal imaging system can be used in fog and smoke or at night cool manufacturer Royal Ordnance Factory speed 20 35 miles per hour range 220 miles. Armament one 120 millimeter rifled gun two seven two 7.62 millimeter machine guns crew four I don't know how much the British were actually doing in that one somebody says this isn't the right flag for the UK is that that's the Union Jack. What how is that not the right flag for the UK holding it up holding it up. There it is I gotta remember to hold it up higher all right. Here we go military that's the old flag what's the new one look like military military skill education okay education military skill okay doesn't have Northern Ireland apparently. Okay I don't know how you can tell most most branches of the U.S armed forces require recruits to have a high school diploma. In fact most officers are college graduates. Education is just as important in building a career in the military as it is in civilian occupations.

Damn right give a hoot read a book do the highway of death all right intelligence file oh boy intelligence file Judaism oh boy oh brother do you have a minute are you sitting down oh boy. Hey what's Judaism have to do with conflict in the Middle East. Whoo okay Junior have a seat Jews believe God is above all and created everything accepting the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai formed a covenant or pact with God by observing God's laws. They gain his protection synagogues are the place and Saturday the day of rest and worship. The three main branches are Orthodox conservative and reform nothing in here about the controlling the media nothing in here about Golems or the Prague elders so that's good followers. 17 point 8 million percent of world's population point three goddamn God damn man 0.3. founder founder Abraham and Moses found dead two thousand years. BC sacred texts the Torah so that's Judaism moving on government United Nations security Council. Oh don't you just feel the the legislative Fire coming off of this one.

This the hot policy action wafting off the U.S Security Council God what an idea that was what a genius idea how about we have a global government only five of them. Basically the guns who won World War II just get to decide for everyone else and get to veto any policy the United States Security Council the Security Council is charged with maintaining International Peace. Five members are permanent China France Great Britain USSR and the US also France get over yourself get. Out of there. The other 10 members are elected for terms of two years. Decisions on important matters require nine votes with no negative votes from the permanent members. There you go can't. They can veto anything resolutions adopted by the security Council dealing with the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait condemned. The Invasion ask for a withdrawal imposed economic sanctions and endorsed a naval blockade. The Republic of new Yemen is the only Middle Eastern country currently on the council that's probably not true anymore. It's a revolving seat so all right.

Here we go the last card oh man. Now we're really getting to the important stuff. You thought some of those earlier ones you know National Security Council or getting to the point Portugal that's right folks Portugal Portugal and Portugal the Man no Portugal the country a country. A country that got to raid the new world help establish the modern slave trade and then just kick back and take a siesta for the rest of time. Yeah take a load off you've earned it. Portugal helped found slavery as an institution in the modern world and yeah. Now they're just hanging out in a hammock. Republic of Portugal Portugal is located in South Western Europe on the Atlantic Ocean. It gained its independence from Spain as 11.79 I mean yes it did but it did not gain its final in full independence from Spain until its Victory and it's war of independence. following the Portuguese revolt of 1641 I think so oh because remember there was that there was that Iberian Union that started in 1588. during the 15th and 16th centuries many leading explorers sailed from Portugal. It joined the United Nations in 1955. For Operation Desert Storm Portugal supplied a naval vessel and Jet refueling services so they were Manning. The gas pumps wow so that's that that's another one of these in the future. I'll probably open another one that's very fun I hope everyone has a good evening good night.
