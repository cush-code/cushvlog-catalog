Whew Exeter's host mode finally volume off. No thank you hello everyone back outdoors beautiful day day. Apparently it's snowed here yesterday good lord dismal time. There was a polar vortex. The polar vortex I say and then it ain't in a crazy world. We live in without a sell tickets anyway. It's much nicer today. Apparently it's gonna rain tomorrow but then hopefully tonight nicer later in the week which is good. I'm hoping. We have at least one more good month or so to eventually just give up on our plea to stay indoors and say it like everyone else is because I've really thought about it and I don't see any other way. This goes somebody wanted. I mean something could change you know we could have a huge rupture this in the circumstances but man the way it's looking. Now it really looks like they're just. Gonna say it and they're not even gonna say it. It's the things they're just gonna. Let it happen they're gonna go. Oh. The doors are open oh you guys oh geez. These these states that they're up and now oh well you know. If you wanna. I mean we're not gonna be doing anything just so you guys know. There's no point to your quarantine and that's the real thing that's gonna kill. It is. Eventually people are gonna realize that this whole stay indoors for everyone else you know London during the Blitz solidarity thing we're doing clapping and all that it was all predicated on buying time to have a way to go back to normal that incorporated the risk of the disease and a way to keep it from spreading too far and that would have required doing something like what South Korea is doing or whatever and the thing is that we have done nothing. They have done nothing but cover each other's asses because it's all bunch of absolute crook crooked incompetent offs.

It's the biggest collection of boasts. We've ever had in a government true clown ours. All of them are just trying to like and all those four cabinet meetings for Corona. You know they're actually doing. They're all selling each other multi-level marketing. Like one of them is buying those those Mormon yoga pants and the other one is selling like timeshares or something it's absolute criminality. Everyone's got their hand out and nobody knows anything and most of them are genuinely loyal to Trump at least in the sense that they don't want to piss him off because they know that he could turn on them at any moment which means that even though they know he's a around the whole time all we did was dick around and then slowly and surely because everyone was miserable and there was nothing to do and we don't have any other way of expressing misery in this culture. Oh. If you came a culture war issue and now staying in is for libs and Cox or slash responsible reality based community members and going outside is for you know Patriots slash cuts and that's that's the battle lines now so like today. They're opening up some restaurant in Colorado and it's all full and people are high and people are mad at those people. But I mean yes they're being very responsible. They're very being very selfish but you're also they're also operating in a context where their sacrifice is just not supposed to mean anything where there is no part of a plan that it plays.

It's just delaying the inevitable so people are just eventually because they got to go to work or because they just can't stay inside they're. Gonna make the choice the selfish individual choice to come out and then more are and more are and what we're only thing we're gonna end up doing to deal with it is normalize dying of Corona as a thing that happens now as a thing. That's just what are those things just one of those things that happens to you like a zombie apocalypse. But like we get the zombies down to a level where you know there's like a five percent chance when you go out that the zombies gonna bite you. So I think that's gonna be it and the only real question is gonna be whether the system can actually absorb all the sick people and whether people enough of them make the plunge to get the economy going again and those are questions. I'm not quite sure of it. A lot of it has to do with how the virus response to weather how how it mutates you know how it's when it starts hitting populations or you know haven't really experienced it yet. I don't really have any kind of plan for it.

I don't know I have no idea but I would say that it is likely that we do some sort of we. We scale up medical facilities in a very fast way not as fast as China of course but in a fast enough way to facilitate excess capacity from you know 911 every day worth of people dying from Corona and of course thousands and thousands more getting sick enough to know have to go to the hospital and so we have more facilities to an extent so it's not completely you know wrenches in the gears and it can't function anymore but then a lot of triage and we just actually have death panels. They just full-on Republicans of course. The guys who called Obamacare death panels are now going to actually administer legit death panels. Eric Trump is gonna be a member of a three-judge committee with two of his sorority fraternity brothers who buried a sex worker with in college. They're going to decide whether your grandmother gets a ventilator or not or whether you get one actually depending on how much you contribute to society and there's gonna be all these wonderful metrics. We can get from all these tech companies that have been basically hoovering up every piece of data in our lives until now to use to determine who's naughty and who's nice and then that becomes another way to to condition people because now another reason to stay on the beam is to make sure you get access to health care because you could get sick at any minute now and of course. Most of our attention and anger is gonna go towards our fellow citizens.

Like when this thing when the dam blows and weren't a new normal we're just like thousands of dad's death. Dead. People is assumed you know. We're not just gonna blow it off. We're not just gonna completely normalize it. We're gonna have a lot of excess alienation. Just horror that is gonna have to be expressed and it's gonna be expressed mostly who we blame and that's gonna be like the Chinese. A lot of the Democratic governors are gonna get a lot of anger from conservatives and the libs are gonna be really really mad at Trump of course and the stupid idiot people who disobeyed orders to stay in and wouldn't wear masks and stuff and don't watch Colbert so they don't know what they're supposed to think about things and then that's where the energy is gonna go and that's why I think Biden winning could honestly man if this recovery is this. If this depression is as bad as it seems and Biden is in there like I said James Buchanan and I think that becomes more and more true every day. It feels like because that's gonna be a lot of social boxed. That's gonna be a lot of anger that's gonna be a lot of confusion that's gonna be honestly literally just a corseting of the culture because we're gonna be that much closer to death around us. It's gonna be less taboo. We're gonna care less. We got a lot of guns and the idea of this you know sanam. B l. N't mummy democrat presiding over you know a new normal of of just course and economically depressed society. It's not good.

It's not fertile ground for just historically that hasn't been fertile ground for good stuff to appear whereas if trump's president and this is going on. There's a it's basically gonna be a question of whether he's able to export enough blame to like china which he would require to basically go to war with china to really fulfill the amount of blame. They'd have to take for this to avoid him or. He would actually maybe get a point where he's alienated a significant chunk of people. Not necessarily his base who love him but people who don't think politically and now have politics in their face in the form of you know becoming a in surfing essential worker or kept in their homes or have loved ones die or be refused access to health care there's gonna be enough of a you know a trail of bloody v fingerprints that him in charge. While this whole thing is the whole horror of this thing of sinking in it could really create like a a positive polarization and and well yeah. I biden in there is really terrifying Biden's terrified because I don't know how you get anything other than like some half-assed attempt at like a secession movement at least depending once again about how bad the bad. The economy gets.

I did see whoa boy. I saw Trump I saw Alec Baldwin drink the bleach and man I I said this on Twitter but you know I when I watch Saturday Night. Live people say how can you watch it. It's because it's fine. It's fun you know I'm gonna be doing so. I'm gonna be on my phone anyway why not be on my phone and find out what my friends had said SNL are up to. Sometimes I'm surprised by a delightful sketch that I wouldn't have seen otherwise and then think when things are bad that are usually bad at an interesting or baroque way and you're like wow. They really are. This up in a very specific fashion and you can find it tease it out. It's fun you can engage with. It never sad never made me sad because one.

It's a 40 year old show but also it was never that good to begin with. It's a lot of it as people suffusing nostalgia for their childhood version of the show. That's why they they always are so harsh on the neon. The current program so you suck whatever but man these zoom ones. The zoom ones are just sold destroyed just seeing what like we're willing to put up with already in terms of just cramming all of our anxiety into the most anodyne brain-dead packaging to just defuse all sense of urgency or even understanding of our own life conditions in just like this this tesseract of banality but to do that with everyone in their homes just drawing attention to how absurd. This is it's like a ionesco playing and it's very depressing. It's actually sad as I said that like the earnest like kind of like like panic behind the eyes of the performers who are recording these in their homes and doing zoom calls you can see this glint and it really does feel like. It's videos that somebody a terminally ill person would get make for their kids so that they'll remember them by I was like I hate kids.

I'm gonna do it for some funny sketches so you can remember me after I'm gone. You know that's that's the kind of vibe as the kids say that these things have and it's brutally depressing kyle mooney stuff is still decent because he's a video guy originally. But I mean I'm sure Sandburg also would have done well in this Pete Davidson reminding everyone that he is one of the most cosmically talentless creeps to ever appear on the show or in popular culture. I mean I am just baffled that that I mean this is Marshall also brought on by that mind-blowing trailer for his movie that looks like No thank you. I would rather watch the Collateral Murder video for 90 minutes than that thing holy Wow and he says and now his doing on the on the zoom SNL's as he's rapping. He's doing like self written raps about having to stay home with his mom. It's like that's the one where you do feel like things have gotten worse because you know there's like Davidson is the role that has in previous generations in the show but filled by Jimmy Fallon Adam Sandler sort of like the unique figure who has like a talent that's like orthogonal sort of to the SNL but also intersecting you know and usually has a has a guitar or some sort of musical part of their deal and so he's like in that tradition.

He's a more famous version because he's had famous girlfriends and he has like you know mental health freak outs in public. But he's just like the net the latest one of those guys and of those guys. He is the least talented I mean at least Fallon who is of course not nearly as talented as Adam Sandler was at least Fallon has like a geniality even if it's grating Davidson just I wouldn't want to sit next to him on a bus a little watch him for 90 minutes. Oh getting creep stop thinking about and yeah like Fallon also could play guitar. You know his stuff wasn't as good as Sandler's cuz. Sanders was the originator oh man can you imagine.

One trade man get ahold of coronavirus holy crap. I mean I can't wait to see. It's gonna be funny. Let's see what's gonna happen. Stan's dad is gonna get really obsessed with like a I'm Hamming or something something about like being inside all the time and then Cartman of course is going to be a militant open reopen guy and then that'll be it it'll be funny. I already I already wrote it. It's done Kenny will drink bleach and die done yeah. There you know Stan's dad hasn't only found something like that zoom messaging yeah you get it already apparently that's all that's in production in Hollywood. Right now is animated shows so if anybody's got a pitch for a sitcom or something they're turning it into an animated version of itself which means that the whole thing of animated shows becoming just more you know like literal-minded therapy sessions for the writers. It's only gonna get more explicit so I'll get ready for that belly fun. That'll be nice.

I do like cricket party. Though I'm saying it's a very clever show. You have to be very intelligent to understand the jokes and I actually like solar opposites as well. It's like diet Rick and Morty. It's like Rick and Morty with half the calories yeah. That's the other thing is that like Pete Davidson because he is like this is you know you know he's like he's basically SNL's version of a soundcloud rapper and his whole vibe is that like sand out nihilistic. You know on the edge of mental a little hysteria. At any moment thing. I mean he got a tattoo of Hillary Clinton for God's sakes. It makes it hard. It makes me feel bad for him but at the same time she is one of the most least appealing people they've ever had on the show. I'm trying to think of who else is out there really young Robert Downey jr. As a kid was really horrible Obama gay guys. It's Obama gay man you guys remember when they were talking about how Obama up the swine flu and how that was way bigger deal than this and how everyone needs to talk more about the swine flu and how that was the real bungle. I don't hear that anymore they don't talk about that anymore which really makes you wonder how far those goal posts are going to move.

Ooh is there a possibility of someone like Caesar or Napoleon rising from the military especially in case they take over ooh boy that's interesting that's an interesting question. I because I've thought a lot about this because I've thought a lot of what the real countervailing forces at play here are because obviously the working class is largely not a player in any of the scenes of global the global proletariat peasantry or global Thierry. It has no real say on anything in the United States. Specifically you've got a political class that is largely incompetent. Placeholders who are there in the names of corporate interests some of which are domestic. Some international southern cotton yeah all of them in some degree of competition and conflict with one another but with one general you know interest. They share a lot of the same interests as the ruling class in Western Europe and also China and Japan and they are looking to extract as much money for this thing as possible because they're riding the engine of capitalism as it just drills out the last bits of from the center of the earth and turns it into beanie babies so they are riding this thing to the end. That's it. Their main interest is whatever they can take from this and if the whole thing breaks apart that's fine because up to to not break apart would require undermining the the profit engine which is more important than anything and that's when you hit the self-destruct button. That's when you get what Marx called in the manifesto the common ruin of the contending classes which is the end of a unsuccessful class war.

But the thing is is that the United States also has a state structure. You know politicians in it don't really have very much power or you know popular legitimacy. But there are these function deep state functions that have significant like logistical and infrastructural power. One of the biggest one is the US military I mean there is a direct connection between you know the impoverishment of the American welfare state relative in Europe and our military budget. I mean those things are connected the reason that the Europeans built you know public housing and national healthcare services after World War - is that we were the ones who built all the bombs and all the nooks and and and and protected the free world they were kind of got. They got off of that because they had to make sure that their working class wasn't swayed by communism which was right there across the Erica. We didn't have that and so instead we were the Arsenal. We had we had military Keynesianism all stimulus basically through military spending and that is created in the world's largest like military infrastructure. The largest military power the world has ever known and then even if you have like a real breakdown in in systems of control and infrastructure and logistics networks. They're pretty durable and networks within the US military that are gonna be able to withstand that and they have high-speed core unit cohesion.

All that stuff they have. They have a task and purpose all that but the thing is they don't have anything like a a come out like a United commander like there's no there's nobody like because as I've talked about on this show before that has been a bunch of idiots like we did. We've created a perfect mediocrity out of the fake meritocracy we have because. Meritocracy and Chris Hayes of all people has talked about this well. The whole twilit elites thing is that over time what meritocracy just reproduces inherited wealth because the meritocratic seed on their own merits then create conditions so that their kids can do as well or better than better than them which means that they because they get all the things you know all the all the edges smooth. For them. They do and but then they don't have the competence that their parents did because they didn't get there themselves and then they just do it to the next generation who has even less connection to actual competence and we're like four or five generations deep into that I mean. The Trump family is a great example you got the hardscrabble grandpa comes from Germany and becomes like a what he owned a bordello in the Yukon and then Kate got bought real estate in New York. Like a real like a 9r and here then the Sun takes advantage of you know a bunch of government programs to become a essentially a middleman between you know the New Deal state and the city of New York just a functionary essentially and that his son even less talented even less involved with directly with making the well and that's exact.

Same thing has happened in the military because these guys rise our military goals are becoming have become over the year. So confused listless contradictory and it's suffused with failure because every mission that they've given has been a failure. I mean what is our record in the 21st century it's dog and so West Point and the officer corps reproduces just institutional mediocrity. So this guy's at the top there is I highly doubt that there is a Napoleon amongst them. I highly doubt that I mean maybe at the mid level. You'll have some like energetic officers which was the case you know with the Free Officers movements in the Middle East and in Africa. The question is whether they would be able to coordinate and you know essentially behead two senior senior authority but one way or another when they start just really stripping down the social order of everything to take it private to create like a network of serves snow crash. Libertarian AOS Oasis's there will be an institutional interest by the US military separate from capitalism which it serves broadly to maintain that system and that will be the point where maybe all of these you know these these social or political structural things you know like Constitution and that that's maybe when they finally get broken but I don't know but then of course there's always the more likely scenario seems to me given.

America's size is more of a spiral outward rather than a concentration in word. But once again the big inputs that have to be put in here too haven't been put in yet are how bad the virus is how able are we able to maintain you know. Resilient supply chains how much are we able to get money into people's hands to restart the economic engine. Those are all questions that have yet to be answered. It is as Shaun Moorhead on Twitter called it the time in history known generally as the cool zone if you have a crisis of democratic legitimacy economic viability and public health intersecting in a time of rapidly and exponentially increasingly changing climate. That's the cool.

Only cool things happen in times like that generally from the point of view of reading about them of course you know not necessarily living through but we'll see but the thing is like Napoleon you know it was able to rise through the military because the revolution happened you know there was an actual class-based rebellion against the HR regime. He didn't act first. He had to be like his path. The power had to be legitimized by changes in you know values one of which replacing blood right with some kind of early version of meritocracy which is the whole idea of bonapartism. When a partisan reproduces the you know the hierarchical nature of monarchical government but instead of allowing it to be you know a fair inherited by the the oldest and you know most soft and unaccomplished people on earth. It is a new and vigorous a new and vigorous hierarchy where the people have claimed those roles by their intelligence and ability. But of course you can see even here the way that that never is what works because Napoleon the avatar of liberal meritocracy. The guy who basically invented the concept you know like the Napoleonic codes and his social Civic and social reforms were all about abolishing the the Society of orders and replacing it with a new hierarchy because it was not not in hierarchical but a new hierarchy based on talent. This is this is the ideological underpinning of liberal democratic capitalism. That's what he was he was but what did he do in terms of governance. Not only did he make himself emperor when he conquered other countries. He made his relatives and high marshals their new monarchs as like a tribute system seeding a new royalty across Europe that would have that would then be meritocratic but the goal there. But I believe Napoleon's thought is there yes you know.

We did we deserve it which means if we ever lose it. It'll be our fault and I just didn't realize how fast and how dramatically that impact can be felt when you're living in an interconnected time well that moves at such speed as this one that requires such informational awareness and such speed of action and such such basically the opposite of everything we've allowed to accumulate in our gunked-up social and political and economic order I am wondering what happens if RBG dies by November. I kind of think she's might already be dead. I would not be surprised if the the Google DNC has played a little weekend at Bader's here because you know it's a high-stake. And they know that I mean my god if she dies before November where is their stick to get anyone to vote for Biden. You know because presumably that would be I mean if he nominated somebody it would be. It would be approved almost immediately right like unless it was right before the election she'd be replaced almost instantly like they'd steamroller like McConnell would pull every lever. He has to instantly do that and then wouldn't that kind of undercut the argument for why you need to vote for Biden because like even now Supreme Court gone goof gaiter Bader Ginsburg. She is a damn goof I can't think of another a better example of liberal hubris than her conviction that she could hang around even though she was in her 80s and beset by maladies during Obama's term because Democrats we're never gonna lose the presidency again.

What difference does it make Wow Wow well that but as I've said things like the Supreme Court if we're gonna really change anything if we're really gonna like not let ourselves get turned into bezos. You know bug creatures by the aftermath of this thing like just get plugged into an actual matrix of human exploitation where we were given the bare substance of Soylent and and a bare minimum of entertainment visa. The kwibi shown directly on the inside of our eyelids. Then it's not gonna because somebody got became president and nominated a liberal justice to the Supreme Court or you want a Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court is going to be quite secondary to any any situation like that but it's not necessarily means it's gonna be a legitimate process.

Somehow it'll just be a conditions will not allow like for this. The maintenance of the system itself will not allow its constituent parts to maintain their current order that's a good point about the fundraising. I think the art BG shed is really for the UH for the rooms who cut the checks man can you imagine giving money to the Democratic Party that ooh the most cooked thing imaginable do you think we ever passed Medicare for all see that's another one like the court thing where I think we might end up some version of an actual humane health care system. I don't think it's gonna be because something passes. The House and Senate is ratified by the President and then passes muster with a the Supreme Court. I just don't see that happening. But I also don't see that as an it as a circumstance that will that's enviable and will never end I mean one thing that might ease. It along is the fact that the with it I mean this is this it's not. They're not just making money off of this thing. It's actually it's in especially if we've just decided. We're gonna let people. Die man that's gonna be a huge toll that I don't know if they can deal with it.

All oh man a Nancy Pelosi so I've talked about out they. This bat so badly that we're all now in a situation where people have just shrugged their shoulders internally and accepted that they're just going to be okay with a lot of people dying and then end up. Just you know venting all that feeling on each other you know in in in violence's and hostilities small and big. The reason that's happening is because they'd. Around for eight weeks instead of using the time people stayed home to change anything like create any kind of system for contact and trace or maybe create alternative systems for providing food or whatever suspending the economy that kind of stuff suspending rent doing things like that and obviously yeah. Republicans very bad at everything but like and I'm not even saying Democrats because there were Democrats who actually had things that would have made a difference and could have been points of argument and points of differentiation with the Republicans and Nancy.

Pelosi intentionally refused to allow any of them to appear in any kind of bill that could be voted on up or down. She essentially refused to put anything out and allowed McConnell in the Senate to write the bills and pass them first and then she would send the already ratified version to the house. I think her argument probably would be well since they're not gonna pass anything they don't want to and they have control. Then I it's wasting time to do anything other than pass what they've already passed because we're not. Gonna get it through any other way but of course that ignores the fact that there were real differences out there that could have been a in some way exemplified and maybe pressure could have been a brought to bear and there was no pressure for anyone to get their act together because Nancy Pelosi wasn't applying it on purpose because she was too blinkered in her understanding of you know what the what the moment called for to actually grasp the what's what was going on and like the reason that there's no that if Trump does somehow lose this election or like loses the support of his of his diehards.

If the if the massive profundity of this failure that he and it is I mean it's jaw-dropping the number of people who he's directly responsible for killing is gonna be astronomical. By the end of this he's gonna be in George W Bush territory. Maybe and maybe we will banish him but do you think Nancy Pelosi if you know she eats enough cord blood and adrenochrome if she keeps running for that seat. Do you think they'll ever turf her out in her wealthy enclave in San Francisco filled with very very high information voters. You can't say that they don't know what's going on. You can't say they're brainwashed by Fox News and the and what they're and they're signing off on it.

They think it's fine. They think it's cool really really bad stuff why pretending that there is something to discuss okay. So that's a good question if you guys know that everything is. And it's all just the oligarchs then why don't you just talk about that well that's another one of those things where you heighten the degree of abstraction from like your grasp to the point that it just creates more anxiety and it freaks you out more and worst of all. It leaves you really with nothing to say because what are you supposed to say yes they're trying to try to grind us into the paste. They're using this.

They're using the excuse of this to guarantee that there is no socialist turn in toward it in the face of disaster which they generally has been traditionally the things in history that have led to long term and significant drops and inequality within and within cultures are massive. Wars that destroy capitalism in the end lives significant weather events that lead to things like you know cereal famine and pandemics and disease. I mean the Middle Ages were turned into the modern era essentially by the Black Death. The Black Death is the engine of modernity that's where it started. That's where the accumulated silt of the post-roman order was sort of flushed out of the carburetor and I think our global bourgeois is aware of that phenomenon and is dead set on using the fact that they have accumulated not only more capital than any other ruling class in history but more powerful capital in the terms of more abstracted and technological capital that can be that could that multiplies their actual force vastly beyond their number or even their capital their control of capital and they're thinking we're gonna be the ones that did not do that we're gonna be the first ruling class to survive intact with it when the system collapses and of course that still be even if they fail at maintaining the system. They will still in some instances succeed because you know the the the old the new aristocracy that rose and that rises slowly but surely out of all these great leveling events. A lot of it has there a lot of them have their origins as powerful influential successful families. Before that so you know whatever is built from the ashes of what might fall there's going to be a heavy sprinkling of accumulated wealth from before that's gonna form the toppest let layer of sediment am I disheveled and I Emily tossed why we tossed am I a storm tousled rogue bias term tousled rogue. Yes somebody's asking about like a Cromwell rather than a Napoleon considering the religion will be more prevalent as atomo as an motivator than they was in the last one.

That's a good point I mean half the guys in charge of the military who are up. There are complete millenia nutjobs. I mean they're they're all like that dude who got fired for mouthing off about how his god was bigger than you know the Muslim God and he was gonna go over there and do crusade against them and so. But the thing is that's not all half of them are like Petraeus and McChrystal like kind of like they're basically like military joe. Scarborough's. They're like worldly kind of economically conservative but mostly chill with social issues kind of guys who you know can convivial 'hey hang out with any group of sophisticated because they all they're all have graduate degrees. You know like they're not they're not just. They're not peasant levies. You know there's a lot of them. A lot of them go to Ivy League schools you know so there's this there's actually an internal divide within the leadership of the military that mirrors the educational and sophistic divide in America.

So that's that's a little bit farther down down the path I don't know but it's an interesting x-factor to think about what was the name of that guy wasn't name of that crazy. General Boykins you know at the thing about how James Comey became director of the FBI is an interesting question because he is such an AIF I mean you you you see what he how he talks about himself and it is like a cartoon Boy Scout and you think this has got to be a scam. But then you look at what happened to him and how he perfectly botched everything and got owned out of government and then had to like become a become an inspirational poster a slogan writer. That's a that's clearly he botched something you know that was not that makes you think it was from a real place that he really does think that way. And so how does somebody like that become in charge of the organization that killed MLK for God's sakes and I think it's justice. I think in situations like that you just have to assume that there is another guy or woman in the FBI hierarchy who's like the dark version of Comey who does makes the decisions that he doesn't even know have to be made. I don't know who that guy is. But he's probably he's definitely in there. If Comey is the guy who appears to be. He is just the absolute goof am.

I considered Chinese warlords for America the warlord period. It's a real. I mean. It's another one that makes sense as a potential historical comparison just because yeah like the idea of a unified hunt out coming out of the US military seems less likely than some sort of regional breakdown. Yes. I mean when you consider that you know those bases are all spread all over the place. You know a general jack d ripper situation at any place of a significant size guy in charge of pendleton decides to take over california. He probably could so whoever's in charge of camp pendleton could just become like the visit. The the Grand Mufti of California tomorrow if he wanted to like the Fort Bragg guy could do that to the Carolina coast and then you've got National Guard which is the X Factor because those guys have a lot of and they could be nationalized obviously by the President and are and you are used like for military purposes and overseas. But you know the Command Authority there's to the States ooh boy. It's just a very once again. I think the people who who this are right in that a lot of it is just sort of a kind of honestly bad taste wish wish casting for some kind of you know redemption from this arc of of just the worse. But you know us never changing us allowing things to get worse but just slowly and slowly worse and never changing anything and just imagining.

Someday there's gonna be a reckoning somehow. So I'm gonna crack up and we're gonna get to see it. You know there's a certain degree of that. That's part of it and that's why you've got to remember that this is all dependent on the economy basically cratering to a degree that I just don't think is gonna. Happen. I think that there is enough investment at the top level in maintaining for the near term. Some sort of legitimacy and popular government that they're gonna. They're gonna bail us out to the extent they have to and on their own terms you know so we're all gonna be super surveilled. We're all gonna have to watch a like 30-second. Ad before we can piss in our own bathrooms you know we're all gonna work in there tubes and we're all gonna eat there whatever paste that they you know sell us without asking what it is and it'll be more the same but just more intensified and faster and worse and more brutalizing because we know the human cost that we are all involved with and are all participating in and that's the real gross part is that when people just start staggering back out pretty. Soon they're already doing it and the waves of bodies start piling up and we just normalize it. We're all just gonna feel like it's our own fault and we're gonna blame each other. The libs are gonna blame the the Conservatives who wanted to own everybody by going out in public. The Conservatives will blame the Chinese so they'll probably be some sort of like a mini pogroms going on at like PF Changs and in the suburbs and it's just because we have will have all this feeling of horror in order to put it because we just refused to not internalize that a personal or like social level all misery I mean people talk about people talk about you know in terms of the military. What about private contractors those guys are big deal. It's gonna be significant for us but like right now I don't think there's a private contractor in the world who could stand toe-to-toe with like the military. Maybe I'm wrong about that there could be some capacities. I'm unaware of it would not be surprised if that was the case but for the most part I think those I mean those guys guys dude went into Venezuela. Were. Were you know defense contractor. They were private military contractors I keep doing this today.

I'm doing the finger quotes I remember the thing where Chris Farley he would do him so fast that he flew but it broke because he was fat. It was a good one that's what he said he goes. I'm fat. I'm sorry. Guys is everything worse 25 years worse than fighters. Ago is to just feel that way. I think it honestly is just because we're 25 years closer to you know resource capacity hitting environmental feedback and all that you know and we have not really made a lot of progress except in a negative way becoming more socially atomized more alienated from each other and from labor and less though conscious of it and able to organize against it which is what's not supposed to happen in Marxism. That's the one thing that's not supposed to happen is that increased misery is supposed to directly lead to corresponding working class solidarity net and mobilizing and that is that doesn't happen because the Specht we've been. We've been overly symbolized. We got over symbols. We created a level of abstraction in politics and in culture that just and we have a degree of wealth to distribute in to kind of buy off working-class anger and and put all of that see because the the opening of markets around the world gave like the Western proletariat. An offer that the working-class wasn't supposed to get in traditional Marxism. I think Marx can have understood. This could happen but you know he didn't see it happen as much Lenin talked more about it.

You can provide some planet some relinquishment of the of the conditions of pain and suffering by giving more money giving more recognition of the unions and more union control because you're able to pass off that exploitation to other workers elsewhere and that doesn't with profit and as a result salt of that combat. Those twin motions the culture becoming abstracted and the and essentially diffusing Americans social consciousness you want to call it spirit whatever you want to call it like like that sense of emptiness that we all know to be the modern condition. It accelerated with that that that wealth that we have because of the free real estate because of the free refills because of the traditions just specific nature of what capital accumulation. In America we're all external crises could be resolved through expansion and now we've reached a point where those inputs are gone so now you know as I've stirred. The garage is filling with carbon monoxide but we have not had but nothing has reversed the social trend. In fact the social trend has only been vastly exacerbated by technology and by the internet and by the culture that it creates and now we have it replicated in the physical space by separation through quarantine.

It's it's like every every pathology is reinforcing in a different level and then pushing down and reinforcing on one another. But as I said that pressure is gonna create change and we just have to be ready when change begins. Because this is the fluid motion right. Now we are yeah. We're at that stage in an earthquake. When the friction is so intense that the ground actually liquefies. It becomes essentially a liquid and that's where we are right. Now. We're in the liquid state and that is why because we don't know the source of our pain and stuff and because we have so thoroughly had that you know pain identified with quenching through consumption. There's gonna be a lot of anger as people are not given.

Those things as their degree of access to material pleasures is reduced and there's no spirit. There's nothing spiritual to fill the vacuum. There's no sense of meaning to fill the vacuum. It's just purely hollowed out but that's our task I guess while we whatever we can find whatever way we can rebuild social ties. I guess at any level so like if people asked like what's the next step of the drill pill after you know refocusing on the world around you I don't know the answer but the question should be. What can I do to rebuild anything like a social network social a sense of social trust at the people around me how can we how could I refill that hollowed-out chocolate Easter Bunny with creamy caramel meaning and and it starts with creating a sense of of communal benefit. The idea that you get something by cooperating with your people. Other people that trusting people instead of approaching everyone with the hunched flinching snarl of the like the reactionary gun Toder actually has a benefit. It makes you more relaxed. It makes you feel like you have people who can help you in a prop and that only that sense is gonna get people able to check rise to the challenge.

They're gonna have to believe in it and I don't know what that means I'm sorry. I can't say any more because everything is so wildly fluid. But when the ground starts settling you got to look around you you're gonna have to we're all gonna have to start looking around ours around us and then agreed that we can do that. Now. We should also do Oh God love yourself and everyone around you goddamnit. I guess that's it now Jesus what a difference a couple of years make h a couple of years failed presidential race global. Pandemic that's gonna rearrange the face of civilization and some level even if nothing changes in the current moment. So yes love yourself love everyone around you bite and dropping out.

I think might very well happen after the nomination because I looked it up and apparently if anybody withdraws after being nominated. But before the election the DNC meets to replace them the way they replaced Terry Eagleton with Sargent Shriver in 1972. What that means is Biden the day after the hell. The hour after the convention nomination he could say oh. I'm sick or I want to spend time with dr. Joe Biden and then they can put in anyone they want. They don't have to do any redo of any sorry votes from the convention delegates. It's just DNC members or some grouping within there so yeah. I think that's a very realistic way that could happen especially since as I've said it doesn't really matter with. Biden wants here because he has no independent base of support in the party. He is borrowing Obama's because Obama couldn't be on the ballot and that means that if Obama makes the same recognition of reality that he made before Super Tuesday which was if I don't get off my butt. We're gonna in something that we could win like if like I've said if Trump looked unbeatable if we were sitting still sitting at like one-and-a-half percent unemployment and and the media was all culture war horse. It let him take the fall so we're all hands clean and win. The next one let it fundraise off Trump for four more years. But they really see that they could get it this time. But it's not gonna be with Biden but they can't do it now because it's too it's doing the error which the problem is. It's a long-ass time till what August that's a long time. That's a lot that's a whole summer that they got to keep him not. I mean they don't have to take him out much but they have to keep him in people's public eye. He has to be an actual you know alternative to trump for people even if they hate Trump to want to go out and vote for it.

The most boring ending to the virus yes but also honestly I think in the medium term the most destabilizing because the most boring conclusion is is high six figures. Maybe millions dead and that being normalized and I don't think you can just metabolize that without any ill effect I think it will have significant social pressure especially as the recovery to this economic collapse. That's still in the process will be will make 2008's recovery. Look like you know the recovery after Black Friday or Black Monday or something in a situation. Like that. All that death is gonna have an effect even if in the short term it's just oh yeah more the same but worse unless of course not as many people die as we're all thinking but considering how many are already dead. I don't think that's realistic. I mean we're almost we're almost the six figures already. I don't think there's a way we're not talking about nearly a million. So we're gonna have to really like look at each other and say what were what we're capable of allowing and it's gonna be.

It's not gonna be pretty whoever they replaced biting with is another question though because that's person that has to have juice in the party because you can't just put in anybody there unless they don't have any unless they have no independent power basin and they're no threat so like a total. A total empty suit. Then you have to have total trust wouldn't be able to actually exercise power. I don't know who that would be maybe Cory Booker h but not famous enough. They've got to have mando name recognition and that is why the people who say Hillary Clinton hilariously are you know that's my. That's the funny answer that is kind of isn't that honestly the funniest thing that could happen and so I honestly cuz who else is his famous to try to build up Cuomo but honestly man. I don't know how you pull that one when he it's the epicenter of not only infections but deaths basically in the world. Newsome I don't know if he's gonna be able to get famous enough in the next few months. Especially since there really is an East Coast bias in media and being in California does just doesn't give him the the attention that being an East Coast time does which is what gave Cuomo that pump in the first place even though he's went one of the most incompetent idiots to even come close to this. Thing one of the worst guys and he's in the high 80s maybe they will just do it.

Maybe they'll overlook it maybe the fact that they're all that he killed all those people isn't gonna matter because - the same way that the mag of people will just say although that's because of China or because of the governors or because of Peter stroszek and the lovely lovely Nellie or and liberals will say it's because of Trump. They'll say yeah oh yeah. But he couldn't do anything differently could happen but even then I wonder about pomo. He does seem like a Clinton. He's in the Clinton orbit right. So he's a little st. James Democrat as they call him I hope if there is a historical record of this period of American history that you know how there are different factions of different political parties in history. There were the Bourbon Democrats were sort of the reactionary Southerners who couldn't who had to be Democrats because you know there was only one party. There. They could be the they could be the little Epstein they could be the little. St. James Democrats Bernie was defeated in 2016 by a coalition of little st. James Democrats.

So if Cuomo Cuomo is in there then that's probably another victory for for the little. St. James will st. James of Kratz I mean working councils I hope so I hope we can get people to work up. The level of their job problem is I mean the thing to remember is that even in the Great Depression there was still massive amounts of labour militancy even with so many people out of work. So you know the traditions have been lost in a lot of ways but you know the dynamic isn't inherently doomed. There are strategic places where labour militancy could you know reassert working-class Prague and it wasn't like realigned politics because I mean if things get bad enough. I could honestly see this whole culture war thing really bubble though it could either explode or the bubble could burst. If things get bad enough and people get it at a little workplace level.

It could but we've got to be in the position to make it happen if those conditions are eyes. It's just I hate I like coming out and talking to you guys but one thing that just really I wasn't like I always end up feeling like we're just have to come back to just how unstable and everything is and how hard it is to know what's going on. And I know that that just feels so satisfying to sit with. But I think we all have to sit with it well the way we're sitting with anything else. We have to just sit with our or with things moving in slow motion. You can kind of see where you are in relation to things closer.

So I guess you just got to keep your eyes peeled pay attention to stuff not arguments on Twitter hopefully but you know situations as they develop. I don't know we're all just throwing spaghetti at the wall here just trying to see what sticks just trying to vibe our way through the our lives. On this crazy spinning blue ball somebody wants me to tell them how to help murder and threaten oligarchs know Thank You officer I'm not going to be discussing that today I'm simply doing my twitch stream if you appreciate it. If you please be on your way unless you have a warrant or something ha Felix this idea of the prisoners as the Bonaparte's well. Of course they have to be from Illinois. Our provincial boy will simply not allow the the next great dynasty not to arise from that ridiculous shard of a flatland. I mean we'll see how JP JP isn't really asserting himself. I mean people say it's doing okay but I'm not hearing a lot about him. So you know get your out of a bunch of strings but also because a lot of this whole thing is. I mean come on man.

We all know at some level that like a lot of the Russia Gate stuff was just made up or like a game of telephone because the whole thing permanent was hinged on something that was never proven in any way that there was a direct connection between Trump at the highest at the level of the candidate and and Russia in any meaningful way but also yeah of course. They put their finger on the scale. I just hope we stop talking about all that. Forever I really do. I really hope we could just internalize what a failure that was I hope. Some of the people who like spent any time on it can. Maybe think for a minute of how wasted that time was everyone who is proud of the fact that they know left partes everyone who yelled at Virgil about how he was too disrespectful to the night idea of Lev partes I want them to be right. Now. I want to find out every one of them and I want to ask them do you know who left Parnas and see how many of them still remember. They're probably all cheat by googling. But I bet a lot of them if you said who's left Parnas to them. Now they wouldn't know the you're talking about and that was like four months ago. Live. Parnas dies of coronavirus no one's gonna know who that was including the libs how have you avoided being misanthropic and cynical.

I think the best way to avoid misanthropy is to is to remember us as I've said that everyone is where they are for reasons outside of their control. They have choice you know and they chose to do the things they did. But the options they were presented were not theirs and so that should that's just like drain my feelings about them from with venom. But if they're doing bad and they're evil they should be opposed. But because they're their condition is provisional that means everyone's is which means people can be better. I really think that and I think the proof is in the pudding in terms of human history. You know it. We would have destroyed ourselves already. You know think of those Russians think of like the three different Russians military officers who could have ended our life on earth during the Cold War and chose not to not even knowing really that they weren't dooming their own country to nuclear oblivion the guy who didn't fire on the blockade ships and the Cuban Missile Crisis and of course the guy who didn't sign off on a Lu clear strike. When the the blips came over over the radio radar. He guessed now that's probably not there and even though everything told him he should he did and those systems were all designed to be failsafe. They assumed that given these conditions the person will do acts and they were designed that way and yet when that can't that moment came.

These guys said no and that means that at some level I think we can all say no and the task before everybody right now is to figure out where that where they can start ha all right guys. That was a good time. I thought had fun sorry. If I was Spacey. I haven't eaten yet. Gonna eat a little bit but I've dinner I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye bye.
