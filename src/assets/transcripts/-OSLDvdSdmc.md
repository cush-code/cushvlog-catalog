Looking at the world now that's got me insane think about checking out can't do it again. But I know just who I am how strong I can be. No no no no no no no no no this country is yours and mine all of the Brave and free place for you and me no. It's only a matter of time until we get things back on tap on track. Our values are under attack agents on my trail with the flag. On Christmas day. They'll throw you in jail sorry for the delay on the premium app. It should be out later today. We got we had some technical issues on our end had to record this morning but it will be out there tomorrow or tonight rather so apologies for that Namaste everybody so yeah.

Last I I I teased something last week. I said I had an idea. I had a thing I wanted to say I want to talk about next week and I forgot what it is and now I remember and then as soon as we were done. I remembered what it was all right what happens when you die sorry for people who don't like the goofy esoteric speculative theological episodes. This isn't going to be for you but it's something I feel like I have to get out one way or the other. Because I do feel like for the first time in my life. I have a grasp for myself like a mo a working intuitive understanding of like how human consciousness responds to its It's stimulus. It's inputs being removed I.E dying the thing. That's been the the the sliver in my brain. Since I was a little kid I have I still have a distinct memory. One of my first real memories is of looking up at a stat of a crucified Jesus on the wall of a guest bedroom in my grandmother's house and just thinking back and I got like all kids do you get to when you can't remember anymore and then the realization like this cold feeling of oh God if I can't if I won't remember if I don't remember before then what about after now Mark Twain famously was said hey I didn't feel any pain or anything before so why would I care about afterwards and you know that's true. It's incredibly true but for the vast majority of my life. It did not do me any good because all I could obsess about was the subjective experience of approaching that nothingness that's a very bad way to live your life. I will say that I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a it turned me into a fear-based creature and eventually a really obnoxious hypochondriac. Although I guess it wasn't really hypochondria because apparently to have hypochondria you have to go to the doctor. All the time I never went to the doctor. I just thought about what was wrong with me and worried about it and then try to talk myself out of it logically and that's how I would like that's how I would deal with the bad the bad.

Sensations that came with being in a human body which are inevitable like we're gonna have bad and good Sensations in our bodies as we live. That's what Consciousness is really it is a little boat. It's a little boat in the sea of Sensations and it gets rocked back and forth by ones that are considered subjectively as good feelings and as bad feelings and they come from all over the place and our brains interpret them. But our brains interpret them through a through a Paul through through a veil. We can't really know why we feel anything because that level of a perception is not narrativized. It's too far from our brains because the the brain is a reacting mechanism. Consciousness is a reactive phenomena. You get a stimuli. You don't think about it. First you feel it first then your brain turns it into something now. If it's an A to B situation where like you are cutting onions and you watch a knife cut your finger that kind of sharp instantaneous surface. Feeling can be immediately tracked to a source and then you react to that and then the danger is dealt with but you got a body.

It's filled with stuff and that stuff's moving around and bouncing off each other. It's just a big. It's it's honestly a bunch of fluid. It's goo. It's a you're just a bunch of Goo.

We're all we're all our juices and that means it's constantly in flux. It's it's a it's a it's an inside ocean with the same salinity level as sea water not coincidentally bouncing around and it's making it's echoing feelings all through you. But you don't know why you can't perceive at that level of um acuity to the thing one way or the other. So you have to figure out why you feel a certain way as you try to chart that little boat on the ocean towards the good feelings and away for the bad feelings and a human in a healthy social organism that process of steering the ship towards the good. Feelings and away from the bad. Feelings is part of a social harmony that connects people within a society and those people to their biome to their lived environment.

Now that doesn't mean there's not pain in life by life is always going to be suffering and always going to be pain and for people who were in those earlier more socially um healthy organisms. Life was largely paid much more physical pain than we suffer in the in in at the end of history. At the end of the technological process buoyed about at our little bubbles. I mean even people who are who struggle to make it every day in this country and and suffer. A lot of pain do not have to find their own supper you know what I mean like that is a there. There's an abstraction to social reproduction and physical reproduction in in in the west where we are that means that there's just a Quant. There's a there's a massive difference in the amount of day-to-day pain that we experience now. But what we have replaced that pain with is a Psychic Spiritual pain that's far far far outweighs. Any amount of physical pain felt by people in organized in in um harmonious social organs because you're fighting with nature you're fighting maybe with other people who are outside of your organism and they are and that fight involves victories and losses. It involves pain and suffering but it is conducted by everyone towards the same goal that means that what is good for me personally like the the desire to sit somewhere and feel a good thing tasting in your mouth or having a good sensation on your your genitals like that stuff.

The stuff that's considered sinful by modern religions that emerge out of the abrahamic tradition that stuff is not socially um alienating. It's socially rewarding because it's to everybody's benefits to have these feelings to fight to allow everyone. Within the the social organism to carry out that at those Acts now that doesn't mean that there isn't still conflict because we are all every human psyche. Because of that Veil I talked about doesn't really know what they want what their body wants. They don't really know they're only guessing. We're always only guessing because we're trying to Cobble together after the fact. A Narrative of what is happening to us that is unable to deal with the deepest connections the deepest point of contact between us and everything around us and and because of that lag we're guessing and in that guessing we create unique psyches. We have with subconsciousness and and a conscious mind that has desires that are fueled and shaped by unconscious and unaccessible desires. So that's that's I'm not saying that everybody in in in in in a tribal Society or something is is living this like edenic experience.

No they are living. Regular lives filled with regular alienation and regular suffering but the angle of their life. This is the important time the trajectory of their life is towards dying in a way that allows them to as their mind ends and this is a thing we know scientifically happens. The Mind towards the cessation of of energy inputs looks backward. It's it your brain lights up like a casino and all of your deep. Most deeply grooved memories are accessed. This is this is not this is not a spiritual argument by me. This is just the science of what happens when you die when a organism a human organism where the human brain dies. We know enough to know that's what happens now. What is that subjectively experienced as I believe the only thing that makes sense is that the thing is experienced as is you having the experiences of your life and then they are weighed by yourself.

According to whether or not in the moments that you're remembering you felt in some harmony with the world therefore capable of surrendering back to it as opposed to wanting to either hang on to a Feeling or just as importantly deny. Destroy make even a Feeling so in a in a society where desires are organized. Socially. You can live a whole life of pain suffering Joy misery alienation introspection and as it ends though that trajectory reveals itself and what seemed maybe like just getting through the day becomes retrospectively to oneself. A Narrative of reconciliation because you are remembering you are remembering a life and being brought to ease and I mean this physically as in a body carries with it.

A tension that defines Consciousness like our Consciousness is like a closed fist coming into Consciousness as a human being is to have your brain close around certain things because our brains have almost infinite capacity. We know that you can get hit on the head and speak French having never encountered it before we know. The brain has those capabilities because it has access to everything because it's emerging from a totalized single consciousness but as you come into being and you encounter the rest of the world through echolocation and create a synthetic holographic representation of it which is where the conscious mind resides not in the real world but it had agreed upon socially reproduced fiction. So this is just a but but this possibility that I'm talking about of having your your your your mailed fist right the Consciousness because you're pulling away from capabilities and moving towards certain other capabilities. You're dropping the ability to access your brain to do one thing so that it can do a different thing better that is a conscious always conscious but below active conscious process. We are always keeping ourselves clenched around a certain understanding of the world. Wilhelm Reich talks about this.

This is what he calls armoring and when we encounter death we encounter full and total relaxation back towards that original state of totalized consciousness. If we encounter that subjectively with our bodies relaxed due to our belief in it which is something that we accumulate by Looking Backward and telling ourselves a story that ends with us reunited having spent a life reconciling ourselves towards others and the world. Even if you're fighting you know over over a dead caribou and you end up with a spear in your gut even though if you die alone like let's see the Iceman whatever your cultural programming has structured below your. Consciousness to represent reality will meet you it will rise to meet you and I think it happens to everybody no matter what what happens when you have fixed class-based societies. The ones that emerge not coincidentally around the same time that the first religion textually based religious. Traditions emerge and you go from a system of cyclical accumulations of of social hierarchy that event that is are understood to be temporary to one where they're understood to be permanent.

That's where you get Buddha that's where you get Confucius that first wave of of self-conscious attempts to structure our understanding of living in a totality that is socially alienated instead of living in a in a Consciousness boat that has everybody within your Society in it which is what you have and it's in a tribal order in a fixed Agricultural Society with with consist with persistent class rule. All of a sudden you have a social organism you're still part of you still have that notion of it as a thing that you are enmeshed within and also and what which interests you share. But it's all sustained by a inherently antagonistic relationship with other people who are allegedly inside the boat you go from everybody on one boat at classes stratified on on a boat with with the inevitable. Social alienation caused by that which means you go from a situation when the body coming into con the human body coming into consciousness is a process of gathering oneself into an armored State over the course of the first.

 18 so are years of life when when you're being when you're literally growing into something and around something a social understanding. Then you have the Plateau period from your 20s 30s 40s when you before your free testosterone starts going away if you're a guy or your fertility goes away if you're a woman to carry out to live according to the mapping. You've gotten in that first era then again in a socially in a healthy social body that provides a basic level of personal day-to-day security and like left and and consistent. The important thing is consistent comfort and also has a holistic social order then the rest of your years.

As you know the the energy departs your body literally as the chi that powered you through your earlier years starts to Deca to Desert. You you spend that time de-armoring every day unclassified because you're not out there fighting all the time you're not doing the stressful intense work of building and maintaining a society. You are able to enjoy its benefits and and you are able to be proud of your contribution to it and the other people around you treat you with respect and and deference because of your role and so as you near death you literally relax yourself into being able to accept it. Now you might die earlier but you're going to be dying in some sort of conflict where the fight that you're doing consecrates your death because that's the thing you die violently in your Prime horrible terrifying but at a certain point you stop feeling pain right. The body stops perceiving pain and starts perceiving whatever it wants. But what it wants is dictated by a bodily posture that we're not consciously in control of but once you get fixed social structures around class Society perpetuating itself. You have people coming into an Armory then doing a bunch of work as an adult and then coming to the end of that and the decline phase but at every Point once they have at every point in that map instead of being trained into a social harmony and then able to act willingly out of a desire a loving desire to hold up your social structure.

You are trained to work against yourself one way or the other. If you are on the bottom end. It is to labor for someone else and if it's on the bottom end it is to indulge oneself on the work of others who you recognize as equal to you not not in some sort of sense of they're as good as I am in metaphysically I mean they have two arms. They have muscles. They have eyes they have basic reasoning skills. They have the ability to communicate with each other meaning even if I don't think they're humans. I think that they can show up one day and cut my throat and then you live your. Plateau years battered away from ever being able to assert love in your. In your labors. Infuse love into the experience. The remember the memory of doing a life of Labor you're not building your own house. You're building somebody else's house or you're having somebody. Else's somebody else is building your house and you're sitting there. Either way the time spent is alienated which means that when you're on the downslope if you get there first of all if you die Before that you have your labors were in vain but if you get to decline even if you get to relax you can't relax.

It goes from like this the the chart of like sort of tension relative to energy within the human body. It stays on it instead of being a smooth trapezoid natural harmonic trapezoid. It is like the what people love to use it zips up when you have a thing going up and then it just goes up way faster and that's the thing it's traject. No. It's not that it. God damn it exponential. That's the word I was looking for. I said at the exact same time that that guy put it in. There thank you exponential oh because the closer you get to it actually being close and remember.

This is all you experiencing your body. Do you go do you experience the Pains of Aging as oh yeah. You know I'm in the body but that's fine or are they experienced as Jesus Christ. This thing this shell of mine is rotting and how am I going to let go looking back on a life where I never felt that I was moving towards anything.

I've only ever felt like I've been hiding and that's why old people get go literally go crazy one way or the other and our political situation where we have this total absence of any real political conflict like there is no terrain of political change. In this country there is a single party carrying out a at this point automated process of stripping the state to keep the the global capitalist supply chain going that's it. It's the final cannibal stage but we have this frenzied nearly apocalyptic politics generated by these two political parties who exist essentially to entertain old people that's the job of political parties to provide a form of entertainment for people who because they feel that they're dying and they can't process it need something that's going to keep them energized and activated because what they can't live with is the silence. What they can't live with is the pause which is what is approaching us all. It is silence but not Blackness which is what the materialist Frets about because that can't be perceived any more than totality can be perceived. What can be perceived is the trajectory towards it the feeling of being captured basically like a beam of light spiraling into a black hole which elongates matter which means that death is an encounter with eternity that the human mind trained to Crouch around a single concept. A very shallow and fragile concept of identity and personality and individuality cannot confront.

It's like the if anyone's read the Stephen King story. The jaunt about inner about teleportation and if you go through teleportation well you're conscious you experience eternity and then you come back into your body and you're an insane person or you die immediately. That is it. But we don't go insane or become husks like in that short story because we don't come back to our bodies because our bodies are gone. The door has been. Shut but they got to go somewhere and what we do is.

We dream about our lives as we are centrifugally pulled towards this thing that we can't deal with and that we pull away from. That is what this is and we experience heaven. We experience hell not as permanent States but as subjective experiences of moving towards something. Heaven is moving towards that sense that lived that felt sense of infinite and and everything and the godliness everything but Brahman whatever you want to call it. But we can't stick there because we have we live complicated lives and we largely don't ever really have a chance to come to terms with any of the people in our lives that we really hurt especially now because my God who are we talking about are we talking about people we know in our lives or are we talking about people who like did slave labor to make our clothing and and you know and animals that are massacred to provide our lifestyle. You know like. There are so many potential people that we would have to deal with that we never get a chance to that in that infinite they all get a chance to pop up. We get to confront everybody in our mind that we ever left feeling unreconciled to and then that process of being reconciled back to them. Pulls us towards this inexorable black hole and bounces us back and forth from Heaven to Hell as we repel as we throw ourselves away from this thing that we cannot accept either. We can't accept viscerally the black hole the annihilation because to be conscious is to not is to be not bad. It's just like and man and that's that's pulling us away But then we're pushed away from totality by our inability to hold that because to hold on to individuality to hold on to a into a personality well. This is this absurdly tiny little vessel of this infinite sea of possibility. It explodes it it shatters it so I think we do experience Heaven and Hell the way that the Buddhists describe it.

I I think that the Buddhism really does like nail it in terms of describing the subjective experience and so we have fantasies where we reconcile everything on our terms and we have nightmares where everything goes the wrong way and I don't even think that Hal is feeling physical pain because there's only so much physical pain that you yourself can inflict on yourself because you will you'll flick away from it instinctively. That's what's pulling you away from reconciliation. You know. It's all part of one reflex that we've trained ourselves after spending a lifetime alienated from everyone else and ourselves that that closed fist that we are that won't let go even though if it let go all of the accumulated miseries all the accumulated disappointments and blame sense of Shame sense of resentment and desire to to get revenge all that stuff all that unfinished business. It doesn't get obliterated it. It gets resolved you get to feel it resolve but your body is rebelling so you can't get that immediate jump off to to Nirvana.

So we're pulling away we're pulling towards. We're resisting this thing that if we did let go we would be able to everything we're seeking is already there if we let go. But we can't not be and we can't choose not to because as I said this is a instinctive act that the reptilian mind is doing to protect itself to keep going a mine could override that but it would take a lifetime of focus. This is the people who are at the end of the of their cycle who end up you know ascending to Nirvana because they were lucky enough to be born into a situation where their lives are not traumatized away from being able to do that being able to spend their time focusing on their body listening to their body breathing consciously embodying themselves that is a luxury to be able to do that we don't get to do that so our brain is going to keep fighting away even though it does even though it doesn't have to. Even though this is all unnecessary pain everything you're afraid of happening will be made.

Ridiculous would be made instantly hilarious if there could be a let go. But it's just gonna have to run itself out. It's going to have to just the energy is going to have to disperse itself which means you're going to have to run through a bunch of nightmares and Fantasies and eventually though I think this is where reincarnation comes in because again when you're what I'm saying is at the very end of this journey you are you are accessing accessing eternity unbounded complete all-encompassing consciousness and your. The deepest connections are to that like when we're born. We have an infinite capacity that gets chipped away and shaped by our experience over time and we're back there. So we're going to re-experience everything that we have experienced. We're gonna keep resolving it because we have literally forever to do this and so this search for somewhere to settle for this energies to settle in the real world. Means eventually somewhere in space and time and that I do not know somewhere in space and time. It reaccumulates around a given set of experiences and a given physiology.

It's it's a struct. It's a it's a pattern recognition a a pattern of energy a residual pattern of energy left by a life reasserting itself in the physical world at another place in time and those experiences keep popping through time and space until they land in that Goldilocks zone where you can live come into a a a sense of self. A sense of armoredness live with it and then reflect on it and in so doing come come to that point of death that defines us as Heidegger says and fully embrace and consciously carry out the process of writing that Consciousness spark back to its source and I would posit. This is my own suspicion that in that moment when that mind encounters that infinite sweep part of the process of its reconciliation is a remembering of every experience that came before not just the the last life at the end of the chain but everyone before which includes all of us and that is the moment of Christian Resurrection so that is why I think you really can say that every religion is true because they all provide the symbolic furniture that we rearrange in our minds to make sense of our experiences so that means Christ is seen. Christ is encountered Lucifer all the folk Devils of of Japanese and Chinese peasant Society Thor all those guys. Everything is real aliens because I don't have to think about myself. I'm like well how is this all going to be reflected to me and I just can't imagine.

It's going to be Jesus coming through the door like the Kool-Aid man. Because I've never believed in it. I I encountered him symbolically but I never had a belief. I think people who like fell away from a real Christian belief will eventually at some point in this process come back to it just tidal gravity but I never believed in it so that makes me think maybe for me. It would be Alias you know or a future human civilization because I really do even though I I've never believed in Jesus I do and have believed in the the secular continuation of the Christian notion of arm of of apocalyptic Revelation that is socialism and so like what that belief is is a belief in the human capacity to create a social organism that brings us back which is I think what Christianity is. A response to Christianity is a response to emerging in a deeply con. Deeply deeply rooted slave Society that poisons every social relationship that it is that it generates because of that and to be a member of a people the Jews who had held to a a socially organic sense of themselves first for centuries and were he was in the process of it being Stripped Away by being dominated by the Roman Empire.

All of a sudden our our holy men are these Pharisees are these fraudulent Crooks who live to keep us loyal to the Roman Empire compradors. We got money changers in the temples. Soon there will be no Jews left and gee Christ like Trotsky came to the conclusion well. Then let's make everybody Jewish let's extend this pact outward so that we could all live socially organically on a large scale with productive forces that have been accumulated that is just what socialism that's his Marxism that is the teleology of that is inherent and even if you want to say Marxism isn't teleological or Heidel isn't teleological happen within the context of it. It doesn't matter how much you disavow it actually happening if it can then the possibility of it structures your relationship to the concept so that means that socialism is as teleological as Christianity and a continuation of Christianity stereology. So that means I'm a Christian because I have I I conceptually understand the mandala the cycle the giving away of the self and the abolition of the self and the Willing abolition of the self over time. But I am at the end of five of at this point. Two thousand years of capital accumulation under a regime that has formally taken the the concept of Christianity. The the religious notion of universal Brotherhood and has for two thousand years put it to the service of slave political economy where where where where instead of the person being a Transcendent human category that we are all part of and that every eye reflects itself instead humanity is proportional to property held that is a fundamentally schizophrenic social order and it has schizophrenic social.

 products look at what the last two thousand years have been constant. Constant Warfare endless constant monstrous Warfare that is only over time gotten worse as technology has accumulated around conflict. We like to think of our scientific and technological advancement has been a bunch of cool science epic for the wind nerds sitting around and thinking about things and having apples fall on their head. No the once again. Human Minds coalesce in reaction to things and scientific and technological innovation reacts to war. War is it then to fight the war. We think up stuff to do a better job of killing one.

Another with we just did the Helen presidents that's or hell on Earth. That's the thesis of Hell on Earth essentially and why is that because we are divided against ourselves we're sick. It is a sick social order and because we are our individual little boat is totally diametrically opposed to the good long-term best interests of people around us and the planet we live on but that doesn't mean that Christianity isn't true it has to be because it it did all that the same way that capitalism is now a religion that it is a God that it emerged out of Christianity and and overtook it socially. Hollowed-out Christianity replaced it with itself like one of those one of those lizards that like eats eggs out of a out of a nest and then comes out and eats the bird when they when they're Birds and so this thing will just keep smashing against itself until it is annihilated because it cannot reconcile itself well with Christianity and socialism theorizes that through the social control of Technology at an advanced level human the human 

Consciousness that is able to do that is able to reformulate an understanding of it of self-interest and the interests of others and the interests of the planet that aligns them once again that pulls us back into harmony pulls us back into socially um into social socially. I had the word earlier organic social structures. I guess I mean and I think this is the fundamental distinction. This is the this is the real divide in belief fundamental fundamental belief in the west is do you believe that that's possible somewhere anywhere. Not even here not even with the humans we have on Earth at this current moment do you believe that it is in some Worlds made up of human beings possible to do that or you don't and that is the distinction between left and right to my mind and for me. The the evidence of my senses my emotional and empirical senses is such that the motive force of of belief is so overwhelming that that miracles the the otherwise materially inconceivable. Are not just possible but necessary for the creation of Human Society of any kind and so now the right the right wing in the west. Here is we understand that oh like the doors are closed there's nobody at the wheel. The oceans are rising like this is not going to come together and if you're a reactionary we're not going to get to a point well. That's the thing is the reactionary.

 desire is an anti-rational urge to plunge towards the abyss a self-conscious desire to plunge into the abyss with having forsaken the hope of being elevated to being reconciled. Instead The Gaze is turned downward. Satan is turned into God and that is the the the Warrior Pagan heart of Christianity that sits side by side with the Jewish one because Christianity is functionally this overlaying of abrahamic religious traditions on a European Pagan Warrior culture. Varg talks about this all the time and the hope there is that you will you choose barbarism consciously and then in becoming a barbarian. You regain that sense of purpose and harmony with nature that The Barbarians had but again what they fail to point. Recognize is that you don't have a warrior Society anymore. You have a technologically reproduced class Society. You don't have the closeness to the world. You don't have you don't have the the ear to hear the heart of the earth. Beating the way that a pagan Warrior did you do you that that road has been burned. That experience is not accessible to you you cling to a ghost yeah. The Jewish Judaism started as a warrior Pagan call too you.

The whole Bible is just them killing people and owning other tribes. But they're doing it as a tribe not as a collection of warriors who are showing each other who's the best and it's. Because the Jews weren't very good at being Warriors I mean Judaism is a adaptation to getting your ass kicked if you win. You don't have to do something as radical as redefine what God means and say God is. Not nature God is humans distinct from nature. It wouldn't occur to you if you were winning some battles once in a while so the Jews are basically the indoor kids and that is why the right wing is inherently anti-semitic because to them this is the essential lie that was whispered into the ears of the white race that this kind of reconciliation is possible but of course. The the racial identity that they fantasize about is an artifact of capitalism. It's an artifact of the very alienation that they think they're trying to abolish.

The only way out is through so that means what am I going to encounter in my in my movement. Towards this. This totality this experience of totality they'll probably be aliens. Jesus will probably show up at some point and then there will be other lives here on Earth somewhere else as human as a different species as a as a tentacle man laughs but somewhere along the lines. One of those people is going to die having experienced a technologically facilitated access to subjective Infinity and that once that's achieved it reflects backward and through all of consciousness all of existence which are the same thing because as I said we do not experience the world we experience a mentally projected hologram of the world and our experience of life is all of those Holograms bumping into each other and because we grow into a below conscious belief in the world that we're seeing we act. Like that's true.

We could reform it all tomorrow like that's that's the thing that's why people are drawn to idealist conceptions of History because we do have the capacity the theoretical capacity to redefine our relationship to our environment so radically that it would be miraculously unrecognizable to anyone living now but we would all have to move towards that same goal at the same time which we can't do so. We have to live bumping into each other echolocating off one another which creates in effect a materialist material framework that defines and guides all of our actions and that is what suggests that there is a um. No no free will that that understanding is what makes us think oh it's just billiard balls hitting each other and the thing is yeah.

It is there are a bunch of billiard balls hitting each other but once you have conscious beings who live in that gap between an event happening and their mental projection of that event and they get to fill in causality instinctively and and unconsciously but self-directedly and motivated by not what is really going on but what they want to be true. That means we are living in not the world of our bodies and in the world around and the objects around us but in a mutually agreed upon Matrix. Like that's the thing no we live in The Matrix but there is nobody programming it. We are all programming it. It is the self-reproducing Matrix so that means Consciousness is by definition free will.

Because it is a it is action out of ignorance. It is action out of desire subconscious desire remember. This is subconscious desire so you're talking Death Drive. You're talking all this stuff that we wouldn't in our minds. Think is why we why we are doing what we're doing how we're reacting the way we're reacting. We're having emotional responses to what we encounter and those emotional responses are colored by our projection our our desire in the situation. So we live together in this thing that is a map mapped on the world mapped on. The objects mapped on our bodies but is also separate and death is so traumatizing to think about because it is the mind re-entering the body. It is that hovering hologram world refusing with a body that is not acting for the reasons you think it is that is actually doing other things that feeling you're feeling.

This is why you felt that you didn't know but now you do finally but it's too late to do anything about it accept it except let it happen but our bodies won't let us again because they're living in this world where the assumption is that we are separate the assumption is that I have an interest that is different than the interests of others. But dialectical materialism is the the yearning for a world made at some point out of real material that allows people to be born into life born into individuality and the sense of self encounter others and use their energies to their fullest positive use while they have them and then to die in the process or if they don't to live long enough to reflect backward into this reconciliation and if you have a society where everyone gets to have that experience then the collective experience of those people dying projects retroactively into all Consciousness. This light that we are all being animated by.

And that's why we can't have ai because what makes Consciousness is Stakes. What makes Consciousness is mortality. It is vulnerability. It's what makes want. It's what makes desire and then we carry out a life of those desires and a thinking is motivated by satisfying those desires. The computer can't do that the computer cannot be made to feel those things you would have to do you would have to create a robot. It would it would have to have like sensory inputs that gave it a sense of Separation that that cut off somewhere and that gave that power over its movements like that would have to it could not just be a program because that is what builds consciousness is that grasping towards something because as I said if you've got access to everything you can only be in harmony with that if you don't want anything if you don't because anything has to be pulled out of the morass of anything right a specific thing and that is why our lives are this accumulation of thwarted desires that then consume us as we get older drive us into mania and and hatred of our fellow and a desire to just smash everything if it's got to end. Let it end now before I have to worry about about having to face consequences because that's that's the Suburban Boomer death drive on the right. They're all afraid of MS-13 and and and ice is coming and cutting their heads off. Because they know deep down. They have a coming and they want they want it to happen.

They want to be destroyed by another where they could be a victim. They do not want to be put face to face with their actions in life. Nobody does because we're pushed before we even know it into lives of subservience or domination. The if we are able to come into real alienation from. It's already too late because we've lost the religious capacity to ritually reconcile and we have to be able to ritually reconcile to be able to look back at our lives as we're living them and say this happened that happened. But I don't need to be punished for it. I don't need to punish somebody else for doing it to me I forgive and am in turn forgiven if you can't ritually reaffirm that fact that truth and you can't sit and feel with it because you have been made to feel it by an encounter with others which is how ritual meaning is formed. Then you're just going to okay have the fist grow Tighter and Tighter and Tighter and I think that is the centripetal pull that we're all forced to press against and the Boomer and the fascist Death Drive is. The is the desire to just let it go to. Just grind to smash oneself because then at least we won't have to ever reckon with the enormity of our sins which if we cannot be forgiven for if we if we give away the idea of forgiveness and Reconciliation which reactionary thought is premised on. Then we have to just to smash ourselves but guess what as I said you're in there forever so it's all going to come around every every every death. Worshiping fascist who thinks they're going to get out of judgment is sorely mistaken because on an eternal plane you will be you will be brought to the other side of every wrong you've ever done and in finding that experience you will regret your choices and since choices are the only thing that the modern consumer subject has that's the only thing that animates our identity so whether we're good or bad not not not choices to you know act well to other people or anything but choices in the marketplace that determine whether we we consumed a lot or or not whether we met got a lot of toys or not taking away our choices. It's taking away our sense of the world. We won't let that go easily but I do think fundamentally everybody no matter what bad choices. They make no matter how much they they try to dive into the hell pit. They're gonna get spit out eventually because the thing that's having these fantasies the brain that's making these projections as I said emerges out of a holistically Collective relationship which means it knows more than our conscious mind or even our reptilian subconscious can and that after the energy has been released of this exchange after the unclenching has committed has commenced that last gasp that last little tail. No matter how you're talking like one one millionth of a second if you were to judge it in medical terms if you could if you could you know get a electron microscope and watch. This this energy transfer occur but subjectively who knows again you you you're outside of chronology. Here it feels like Eternity for for for whatever that feels like but what most of all it feels like is is submission and that's why Islam of course also correct ah foreign. I said that earlier I think hell is the anticipation of pain if anybody ever read um.

The Hillary mantel. Wolf Hall books about Richard Cromwell or Thomas Cromwell sorry great book by the way great series of books. It ends spoiler alert with Cromwell getting decapitated at the orders of Henry VIII after failing to ride the bull and it's it's his subjective experience of being beheaded and in it right before it happens. He's a man. He's he's imagining what hell will be. And it's. It's his abusive father but not being beaten by his abusive father but being somewhere and hearing his abusive fathers approaching voice I think and that we're stuck with that as modern subjects who have done wrong. I know I've done a lot wrong in my life. I'm very much. I'm very regretful for I try to make amends. I don't feel like I've done enough. I hope at some point I will get a chance to do enough. But I know I know that if a jet engine fell on my head right now where I had a brain. Aneurysm and drop dead at this moment. Even if there was no physical pain I would have to. I would make myself suffer for those wrongs but not Eternal. He can't be. That's that's the loss. That's the um the learning loss. What do you call it the latency that the latency of the transmission from Christ to his followers and the inherent latency in transmitting in a context of class Society. Now the thing is I haven't done anything. Wrong I did what I I did what I thought at the time was the right thing to do if I had bad consequences. It's because I was angled in the wrong direction. I know that and I know that I will be forgiven. I forgive myself sometimes but again I'm talking deeper than my conscious mind. If it's just if the life's just going right now. I'm not going to be in charge anymore. My subconscious is going to be in charge and my subconscious wired to this body wrapped up. I have tried to de-armor. I have been trying to de-armor. I think I have. It's actually very weird like sometimes I will like meditate or something and then it will feel on my neck like I had a massage like I feel like I am decalcifying. But I'm also aware that you know I'll oh like I do have feelings in my body. That feel like there could be something else. What if what if what if my brain is telling myself that I'm not you know that I'm not worse off that. It's hiding something from me oh. The world looks like. What if everything collapses what if what if there's some sort of horrifying disaster what if the economy falls off a cliff and I'm forced into you know living off my off the lands while being a crippled you know fat idiot. All of that could happen it. All could happen and that's fine the way to live with those possibilities which can't be gotten rid of is by having I hate to say the word but faith so yeah. I'm gonna like be chased by a goblin for a while I don't know be in a plane crash half one of those like experiences of anticipation anticipatory. Terror that I spend my life that I spent a lot I'm trying to reduce the amount. But for a long time I spent my life just trying to ignore and repress literally repress. It's gonna happen for a while. But it's fine. There's always a moment when the door opens and hand emerges because it's all you which is all us which is all everything and it's only really my deep bread cowardice which I mean once again. I can't blame myself too much because I did have this extraordinarily absurd spinal injury when I was in high school that left me partially paralyzed for the rest of my life. Like at the moment I was supposed to be an adult.

I was already pretty neurotic before that because I told you like I started having these thoughts when I was a kid and that's like your brain trying to send out signals till it hits something and if it keep if it doesn't hit anything. It's gonna start making monsters and that's what the lack of ritually reinforced religious belief is done. It's left us just bouncing off until we encounter a monster because there will be physical experience. There will be like you're going your body is going to be sending signals but those signals only mean what our brain wants them to mean and this is the process I was talking about of coming into that armoring. Is we are all navigating good and bad feelings but what in our body are subjectively understood as good and bad feelings are only encountered through experience if it's not abstract. Concepts that our brains emerge to represent it is concrete experiences that are then retrospectively given names and weight and meaning all right. I hope this has not been totally insane sounding. I mean I know fundamentally what this is is. I am an ape I am a big old ape that has been possessed by this symbolic order I I'm. I'm out they're haunted by a ghost of words of symbols that are not real that are not my body that are not my my material experience that are only a reflection of them are not connected are a reflection of and I have to exercise them. We all have to exercise these ghosts. These stateants and for me like I spent a lot of my time still and I know it's like it's because as much as I I want to live a certain way. It's it's hard for me to do because everything is a cross purposes. But I feel less crossed up than I ever have and when I look at why it's because of things. Like this it is. This is literally what doesn't. It is untangling a mental knot that has emerged out of my brain trying to make sense of my body and the world around me and more than anything make its peace with finitude because my body is very finite and only getting more finite and this society that I live in. We're both. We're all sick sickness defines us as as a project and to bring it back to what I was saying the other week about the apocalypse.

Having happened and Satan having won is that that teleology I talked about that is animated the moral Center of humanity. Since the time of Christ has been materially extinguished. We're not we're not going to get the dream of Christ and trot Marx and Trotsky which is a Western tradition born out of the experience of the the Jewish people in the near East encompassing eventually all of humanity in a process of unfolding Revelation. We've had the revelations but we folded away that's because of the role of the dice we got a land mass where something like capitalism could pop up to fully alienate and dominate and technologically absorb Humanity yeah. The Jehovah's Witnesses say oh Christianity was hijacked. Yes. It was that is correct. It was when you take a religion of of of Pop of of universal Brotherhood poverty and you turn it into a justification for regime of slave power. You have created a new religion and then but the thing is there's still that peasant heart to it. There's that the experience of like being a member of a church and getting real Absolution through social encounter that is at the heart of all societies. At least it was some Christianity. Real Christianity lived in the in and and thrived it became things like all the religious Reformatory movements within Catholicism. The albigens the bogamills the lollards all culminating in Reformation the Reformation but all they could really do because they could not confront. Class was build a new Idol a more effective satanic regime. So we're not going to get that but that does not mean that Consciousness will not eventually become totalized in the material world. It just means that this group of people this civilizational pod isn't going to do it that realization is the first step towards meaningful social and political action because it strips us of our ego attachment to change and that is why I don't think that you're going to resurrect any of these Christian structures to to be liberatory of the the Trad calf thing is a dead end. Obviously. It's just a it's a pretentious mask for the the nihilistic anti-rational desire to resubmerge into the the into the Pagan. Warrior Oblivion can we have human meaning without another can we build human meaning without a the Specter of another. That's the question and I think it really is a Plato's Cave deal like the the reactionary desire which is motivated by people who want this to be true because it allows them to sit on their punish somebody for their suffering and they want to feel good that way. It's a belief that no what it means to be. Human is can only give given shape and substance by that conflict with another I believe that only in the absence of that other can real human subjectivity. Deeper I guess I should say a deeper human subjectivity be be achieved and it would be horrifying and inhuman to the the reactionary. But it's only because it involves giving up their armored and illusory sense of self okay. So I hope that was not totally insane but I do think that is what happens and I do when I talk about this stuff. I do feel a real sense of liquidity in my body. I feel in I feel embodied and I think that is what we're all seeking.

This is the subjective experience I'm talking about of being like gloved within a a stream of action guided in a way that is reinforcing across all levels of consciousness rather than punching against so. That's why I keep doing it. Catharsis is the word we're looking for now again because I have forever because my mind can move very fast. No matter what I'm doing I can question that and say well what if what you're really talking about is coping with a hopeless situation. You're essentially doing subconscious hospice like you are winding down way faster than you think and you're actually going to just Keel over any day. Now or a couple months a couple weeks within the near time relatively near time frame and this is your subconscious way of easing you into it. The beauty part of what I just described over the last hour and 20 minutes is that if that worst Theory my worst fear is true. Oh what if that's what you're doing it overlaps entirely on everything else. I just said so then there's nothing to fear. But I'm still in a decaying body. You know I still am cut. I'm literally always receiving pain signals from my legs at every second. I'm alive. I'm aging. I'm I'm I'm I'm I am at the point where you start going down. You start losing your juice. Things are starting to unravel and I'm feeling that and that those feelings have to be subjectively experienced and made sense of that is what this ritual reaffirmation of religion. I'm talking about serves to do serves to allow for moments of charge reaffirmation of belief in a course of action so that you can carry one out so that leaves me here. Maybe the entire banking structure collapses over the next three weeks and living in a Hooverville a month from now that's fine. Even if that's less pleasurable it is no less a Terrain of struggle and it's no less a place to a zone of choice an action and a opportunity to deeply align one's interests with the greater world but you know okay. The other alternative everything goes great and I live a long time well. Everything is going to get bad everywhere else. I'm going to be Aloo from it and implicated in it how how will I deal with that well. At some point. Keeping that Harmony is going to come into play and choices are going to have to be made and faith is Faith in the ultimate connection between all levels and planes of perception and reality and to me that is not a religious. I mean I have a hard time I've always had a hard time with religious Faith because I was this inert ball of neuroses and to have like genuine religious experiences. Your eyes have to be up a little bit and mine were always down um but one way or another. I'm going to suffer I'm going to experience pain. Even though I know it's unnecessary. Even I know I know that that all all burdens could be dropped. The the the the the the the cage of flesh is gonna still push me through experiences of suffering and that that suffering will have to be unraveled over millennia. But I just can't get over the fact that eventually we are all the residue of Our Lives in a sea of infinity and at some point the illusory subjective barrier between those things has to break down again don't have to get religious thermodynamically required to break down and if that is a subjective experience which I think it has to be because that's the only ex. That's the only thing there is and it and it cannot and it cannot Encompass death. There really isn't anything to be afraid of course what does that have to do with the price of X what does that have to do with getting up in the morning and finding meaning that is an annoyingly separate question and even if we get captured in a cycle that cycle will break down no matter how long it takes. It has to all Cycles break down. All energy is dispersed and we are gathered and then dispersed energy. That's all we are and if life is a subjective experience.

Then we are the subjective experience of infinity of of of all of the only meaningful word for God or the only meaningful definition of God all right well. There you go take that with you do whatever you want with it call call in a 5150 for me. Let's see what happens I don't know take it easy. That is that really is all. I can say oh. God take it easy but as Terence McKenna said take it easy but take it bye.
