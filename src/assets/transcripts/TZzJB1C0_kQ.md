See if anybody comes over here. It's been a long time since I've done one of these I apologize but got kicked off of the twitch page I have to be reacted and I wanted to set up my laptop for that because I'm sick of the audio issues happening with my goddamn phone. I'm not gonna be getting a new phone anytime soon because it's a hassle. So I'm gonna figure out with the help of our trusted producer. Chris how to set up a direct thing from my laptop so until I got that setup I was gonna decide I still wanted to do a chat and so decided to do it back here. On Instagram. I didn't get kicked off it just I think what happened is. I was like trying to get on and someone else from the FYM crew went on and it knocked me off and I have to like do the two-factor and Chris our producers moving right now and I just don't want to have to deal with it. So instead. I figured I would just do good old-fashioned Instagram for now.

But we will we will be back on twitch. Soon I promise let me say that when it comes to jizz lane I was just because my theory of the case made juice I couldn't imagine a world where just max was alive and anything I thought I understood about the Epstein case makes sense so if she's still alive that means that there is perhaps a factional infighting going on something like the white hat black hat queueing on concept only the difference is. It's all black ass. There's no white hats. There's no good guys. It's just scumbag criminals. That's all we have our awful awful pieces of and oh good.

Lord did it happen again what am I supposed to do. I can't I can't I I turned it up. I turned up the volume. I don't know what else to do. How's this how does it sound you. Guys need to stop doing this because it really throws me off because I can't know how I sound so like you can't just mess with me and think I'm having a good time you're having a good time. I don't know what I sound like. I don't want to waste it talking in a way that people can't understand because I want these also to go on YouTube and I can't do any of that. If I don't know and I can't trust it. Any of you people aren't giving me the business or that you're not audio files which are the weirdest mutants on earth and people who make it impossible for anyone to make anything that have sound because they just say ah. This isn't flat or whatever the hell bunch of Neil Young's I take this out for does. It just immediately ruin it. Cuz I hate having the headphone in is it. Okay is this still okay is it okay now can you hear me cuz.

I'd really rather not have the thing in my ear so just lame being alive and in fact apparently under FBI surveillance. For almost a year I mean I don't know man. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to make out of that ha unless she's being protected by some other faction of intelligence or the elite who want to see some. Some percentage of the Epstein Network exposed not the whole thing of course but some chunk of it and his lanes. Gonna do that the fact that she's apparently being her case is being prosecuted by the like. The public affairs division of the of the New York Attorney General of Justice Department office and implies that they're going after some public officials. Maybe maybe this is an October Surprise to own the Clintons like by Trump and bar or maybe. It's a counter Trump insurgency within the Justice Department who are pissed about their guy. Getting fired for no reason or I guess because he was like looking into prosecuting Giuliani and deciding to mess with Trump. I don't know I would be surprised if she died not because obvious like there would be above killing her or like there'd be some worry.

Oh. This is too far because we know now there's no too far just that it would have happened already that was my assumption. I thought she was dead. The second Epstein died and apparently she was been hanging around and doing after the whole time. I don't know how to process that so I'm gonna have to do a big old big little shrug so right now. I'm just gonna sit back and see and wait and find out what happened. I'd be very surprised. If there's any sort of large-scale investigation. Some sort of it could be that they brought her out to do the opposite of what I'm saying and brought her out to exonerate people like say Prince Andrew like maybe. This is all a British thing maybe they kept her alive. In case some part of the epstein accusations didn't go away so that she could be brought in to exonerate somebody who was under the under the lamp like Prince Andrew. Possible I have no idea doing the shrug. Emoji now about his life I hang my ass off about his lights. I have no idea but there certainly is like. There are factions within the ruling elite always even within things like the intelligence community and some sort of internet scene. Battle always was something that made sense about Epstein because I mean Epstein thought he was gonna get away with it until the day before the day. He died which makes you think that he felt that he was still protected even in prison. When of course he wasn't who was protecting him were they only pretending to protect him where were they actually trying to use him for something and then somebody got in there and gave him the old the old fake suicide. I don't know I feel like I know more and feel less confident about things as time goes on so but that's all I have to say about just laying for. Now. I talked a little bit more. On the episode we recorded today.

[07:10](https://youtu.be/TZzJB1C0_kQ?t=07m10s)

But I actually wanted to talk about something else to start with something that I talked about last. I tried to talk about yesterday but stupid twitch stream one worth because I did something bad yesterday. I went on Twitter and I engaged which I actually very rarely do because that's not where Twitter is fourth where's for having fun with your friends but something he just hit me wrong and I felt the need to engage and of course. It was waste of time in the sense that nothing was advanced. No one learned anything but I do feel like I learned something or at least I learned like I can explain something a little better than I thought beforehand and what it was was. Chris Hayes tweeted something about how my mom never let me watch the Dukes of Hazzard because she thought that the flag was racist gay mom and it just hit me wrong. It was not grilled peeled to respond I agree but I'm not a perfect being I will fail every day trying to D you know a a mature person because none of us are you know and there are too many there's so many seductions and I tried to impart my lives but like I said I feel like this was instructive anyway.

So I look on it as even though it was a mistake. Hey turn that mistake into a miracle and obviously I'm already kind of annoyed. I've been annoyed with Chris Hayes for a long time. Specifically the way that he spent the early months of Corona just freaking out about Trump's and adequacy of a response while not saying a word about about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party insisting on carrying out primaries that got people killed definitively doesn't say I'm worried about. It just heroes in our way because he's but anyway that tweet was just so nauseating to me because it like what was the point of it. Like what does he really.

I think he's saying there other than my mom is one of the good ones like is he saying my mom is a good white is that what he's saying so I just asked him not challenging him not insulting him. I just said do you really think that you would be more racist if you'd watched deuce of Hazzard growing up in what he grew up in New York City. He went to a magnet High School with immortal technique at DS s and Mero. You really think if you'd seen the General Lee 30 minutes a week you'd be more racist and so I just asked him. He never responded but instead G here everyone's favorite internet pennant. The man. One of the people who have been one of those people who are trapped in the cave of online discourse the kind of people who if you did the the Plato allegory thing and went up and saw the real light and came in and tried to get him away from the fire. They would punch and kick you because it's to them. That's the only world they live in is the Internet and she is hilarious. Ask question to me was do you think w eb du Bois is a Lib. I asked him if he was smelling smelling toast.

It was baffling to me but it started this whole tedious argument that I did not participate in for the most part and ignored about the role of cultural reproduction in maintaining a systemic racial oppression and keeps half of a point was that Marxist tradition black. Marxist tradition has plenty to talk about the way the culture reinforces racism and it really struck me like how online discourse maybe I'll discuss. But certainly the kind I'm familiar with online really isn't possible because I of course no one reasonable he called me a Glidden. Iowa's I said no one reasonable doesn't agree that culture reinforces racial discrimination. Of course. It does culture is where people live. That's the level that people live at of course that's what does it and so yeah things like you know the Confederate flag or or racial tropes or whatever they reinforce racial ideas but then people act on that's true but right now in this moment right. I'll let's talk about like Dukes of Hazzard yes sir now. It's a context of this cultural.

This sort of mini cultural revolution right that we're doing right now getting rid of episodes that have blackface from old shows renaming things pulling down statues and there is a current of thought that I think is long that says that because these things are doing because these things are happening because there's because there's this corporate attempt to to come to nullify and neutralize the protest movement by doing things like hey we're taking the name off and hey we're getting rid of this episode. Hey this actor is not good at this white actor. It's not good to do this black character. You want that that is proof that the entire movement is some sort of like neoliberal plot which I mean if you unless you want to pork George Soros in there that doesn't make any sense because you're ignoring. The fact that culture production expect the culture that is created by corporations which is basically all the ones we know that exists to try to co-opt and neutralize all the social movements that's what they do. This is an attempt and the fact that they're doing it only means they feel they have to which is an indication that there is a potential for power right. That's why there's an attempt to mollify because there is a potential for power well.

The question is how is that potential going to be filled. The corporate answer from above is what if we get rid of these bad episodes of TV what if we take our names off this thing what if we cleanse the cultural palette so you don't see things that remind you of racial discrimination. Racial hierarchy how about that and people individually the people who are in in line with this protest movement and who do things like support it materially through money and participation specifically in protest and the continual civil disobedience what is going to mollify them. What is gonna make them say we've got something. Is it gonna be this stuff or is it going to be a significant redistribution of wealth. But it's been unjustly malapportioned towards white people over here. The history of America and through a disparity that is reproduced by capitalism over time which of those are we going to confront. It's gonna be very difficult to get to material conditions because we don't have deliberative bodies. We don't have an organization and I said this a million times. It's still true something might emerge but it hasn't yet that makes it hard to focus on material conditions. It's much easier to just choose to accept or not accept things passively like the removal of an episode of a television show or the knick changing of the name of something and in my opinion. It is vitally important to resist that to say that is not going to do it that is enough and anybody who is this moment arguing the trivially true but irrelevant point that well you know cultural. Stuff does reproduce racism sure but we're not talking about what reproduces racism right. Now we're talking about what makes it happen like the actual motivator. The actual thing that generates racial discrimination generates racial disparity in experience of being an American and it is the resources. It is the failure to include black people in the the treasure. The festival of wealth in the post-war era and now because our systems are not redistributed the redistribute of upward that has only been reproduced over time. Now the culture is getting less racist right because because of the 60s and because of the change in cultural perception and more important most importantly the change of the way the culture is taught to us through things like television and education. Specifically college where post-war everybody went to college essentially got a a social etiquette class that's what that's what college is really about College.

[15:53](https://youtu.be/TZzJB1C0_kQ?t=15m53s)

The edge you can be interested mate unless it's technical and there isn't even that much technical stuff in a technical degree. What you're really learning is manners how to comport yourself among the blue joie and that is what gets you into the booze was a little piece of paper says I am someone who has these values and those values have gone left now. The reason for that is because conditions have only gotten worse conditions are only wanting worse and there's a bunch of liberals who tend to have a disproportionate control of cultural levers who don't like that fact. It makes them feel bad it makes them sad but of course they're not gonna change anything. They're liberals right liberals mean you can't really change anything oh. I'll pay a little bit more tax.

But I'm not gonna rip up the foundations of this lake Katz's because it's fundamentally capitalism. You wouldn't you would hate to do the kind of redistribution that would be required it would be just you would have to abolish the ruling class to redistribute. They don't want that to be done they are the ruling class what they want us to feel less bad about how it's still bad to be black in this country. So they want the culture to be more a gala tere. They want it to be more racial anti-racist anti-red not even colored by the anti-racist effects but it has happened we've not less racist while the conditions have only gotten worse. So all these people who say this isn't nothing. This is a real. This is a real game we should really be pursuing this. The culture has gotten so much less racist in the last four years and yet conditions. Relax in this country have stultified and in Pat since the since the 2008 crisis gotten worse over time. So we know that because what happens is you mow the lawn right you get rid of racial symbol racist symbolism and culture you reduce racist ideas and it works too. People are more open-minded in America than they used to be.

They are more accepting of other races genders and stuff like that in broad opinion polls broadly it's true but if you don't change the conditions in a country where you think you are participating in a democracy and you're participating in a just fool that just order. Why is there. This disparity still how do you explain and for the ruling class who reproduces this culture. There's never going to be interested in the material explanation because that will undermine their position. It becomes a question then of what's wrong with black people and liberals can say oh. There is still material conditions that are different and there is still real. But they don't have a prescription for it. So it's impotent. If you're not a liberal. The answer is obvious they they can't do any better. They're inferior because why else would they I live in a just country. I have a live in a democracy I live in a country where every government is pursuing.

[19:00](https://youtu.be/TZzJB1C0_kQ?t=19m00s)

What is we broadly considered to be the good. Why would this patisserie still exist and so what you create is this ball of racial white racial anxiety frailty. If you will or fragility that is expressed through either guilt or hatred some combination of both but here's the beauty part. It's a combination of both and everyone. So the most anti racist white people person. His ball of guilt is marbled through with hate and even the most racist white person. His his ball of guilt or his ball of hate is marbled through with guilt - to some degree everyone is this and here's the thing those are both negative of feelings and emotions you don't like feeling either of them. Now Robyn D'Angelo has this sick perverted pinhead from Hellraiser purification of pain theory that you should be holding anxiety and guilt in your head at all times when you're dealing with a right person and if that's good well you know some people like getting their car back with car batteries attached to their nipples.

Most people don't most people are gonna end up. Lead subconsciously black people because they don't want to feel guilty and then the racist who hates more. He doesn't want any black people as it rises his hatred and that that phenomenon will exist as long as a disparity in material conditions exist.

You could mow the lawn but it'll grow back me but if you abolish the disparity which is possible which is honestly if you socialize an economy. The size of America is trivially possible not immediately but over time and and at a rate that would have enough of an obvious socially tangible speed that it would facilitate further it would become self self-perpetuating over time and that is possible with a socialist approach to government with the abolition of the ruling class. The abolition of property as it's understood in Marxism the abolition of hoarded wealth.

The social reproduction use value you would not get rid of racism. You will get rid of racial disparity. The majority of racial disparity. The experience of being blackness country would persist in being less fun being alienated or alienating than being wanted because there's going to be lingering feelings because that bet because the culture comes afterwards the culture always comes afterwards. It's the super structure so it will take time to for those thoughts for that to diffuse but it will and guess what all those Confederate flags will come down. All those statues will come down because nobody's gonna want to keep them up anymore.

We're not enough people are but what G is insisting on and what Hays is insisting on is no no let's get people used to the idea that this cultural change is sufficient when we know it isn't you mow that lawn and the grass is. Gonna grow again because you haven't done anything about the material disparity. You might make it easier for some small segment of black people to go farther than they would have because maybe. Maybe. We have increased affirmative action as part of this or make more a diverse greater diversity in Hollywood right that means there's a lot of more black people getting getting high paid media jobs that and then that money filters into the community maybe. But this is just around the edges and so that's why anybody who's making that point right now is doing the work not only of the ruling class that's trying to co-opt and neutralize this movement but also all of those class first reductionist stupid pop people that you all hate right. The people that the G hears of the world hate more than anyone way more than Trump people. The stupid class first reductionist hate them so much well guess what you're doing their work for them by giving them a living example of you settling for cultural change at the expense of momentum towards material change and you validated their argument so you're doing the work of all of the malefactors both in your little hothouse of Internet commentary and I and thought sucks that it exists to the highest levels of the cultural wing of our ruling capitalist overlords. It is pronounced to boys yes so that is as they say that on that and then there was one other thing I wanted to say yesterday that I couldn't. I wanted to get it out over with here and that is that I wanted to follow up a little bit on the Demiurge that we talked about the other day about what the Demiurge is in Gnostic Christianity and how it relates to the material world we live in I said that the crisis the the spiritual crisis that provokes Gnosticism in the in the in the Gnostic is the inability to live as a Christian in the world.

[24:33](https://youtu.be/TZzJB1C0_kQ?t=24m33s)

He finds himself in because of the Demiurge shaping it in a way that binds us to conditions material conditions that pull us away from God mainly greed and paying our greed and that which puts us over others and dominion over others and then the pain of being oppressed both of which are not good for spiritual. Pursuit and you have a guy who told everyone leave this linen common and and because what is wealth it is meaningless what is physical pleasure. It is meaningless but physical pleasure and wealth are all this world worships. How is that how are you supposed to live in that world. How are you supposed to live in that world. The information was an evil demon came in and created this thing trapped us. It's our job to fight through it. Beautiful Miriam. It makes us look at the adventure hero. We're the guy from pitfall. But what I didn't really get into is that so I was.

I said that that is our condition as humans that we live in a denial reality. We are actually all human beings that's part of the same species being that could and should be at working as one consciousness with the same singularity of purpose as an individual consciousness that is a class and then a species coming into itself consciousness of itself. That's the fact should be the goal of all human endeavor and instead the world is split into fractious groups that are all delusionally believing that they're at war with each other when they're actually serving the interests of an even smaller group vampires of demons who are draining them of their lifeblood well. They struggle through lives of ignorance and pain where they never feel the touch of the divine. But the question I didn't really answer is well.

What is the Demiurge now I said we are the ones who created it but what is the what is the demo energico reality. So the spiritual world. The world where we could be operating consciously is one of material abundance is the one of a environment that by definition can be lived in a state of homeostatic harmony with any species on it if that you persist and we could we could be a homeostatic. Li enmeshed in not it like a stupid like not even it not in a dumb and cap way or no not an cap and I'll go primitive this way. The dumbass anarchical primitive Sargon oh we just need to get back to the hunter-gatherer effect no because the reason you know that you know the reason I know that because we are here now and we started there and we got here which means it doesn't work you're basically saying. Let's try again. No no no he's work through the steps like if we if we were able to harness technology to bring us in harmony with our natural surroundings. We would be able to live the sort of life that they imagined those those been those noble savages did but with clean water high load low blow infant mortality rates low to non-existent infant mortality rates basically life less terrified and therefore life more connected to others a life more more more conscious. We can have it but struggling. There is almost impossible because we find ourselves bound in a physical space that's been defined for us.

Like this land is here I'm on the western edge of Long Island right that's real land and like the things that the wood that build this house the bricks that was all part of the land that was all part of the flora that's all real when it's here again. This export paraded play land a piece of lie clapping ah lanai. Hey I think Indian land in this building that is owned by a holding company in Florida in which I rent the I rent something give them money give those people money for the for the right to live in their house without getting shot. Basically that is the demo ethical reality like the regime of private property in the commodity fetishism that we are locked in that's as much of it as a that's as much of a tomb as the Gnostic concept of our bodies being tools for our spirit.

We are we are as are our collective spirit. Our collective guys are humans consciousness. This is trapped in in the in the dead flesh of capitalism as the godly spirit that the Gnostics imagined was in all humans was trapped in the dead flesh epidemic hard to press down upon us and there's another cool concept from Gnosticism that I use that I think is useful and that is our comms or our. Chon's I never really know how to pronounce the CH there but our chance I'll go with that word demonic entities that were essentially the handmaidens the minions the bureaucrats the mid-level bureaucrats the paper pushers of the deniers of the head. Even be it did his will and shape but they kept spirits from from pushing through where they're basically with. Lakha moles to smack everyone down before they could get to God that's looking at their for and they also form together there's seven of them I think and they deform together one big evil demon.

So it's like a Voltron and I feel. Like that is another concept that has an analogue in the material world. The material lake capitalist world we find ourselves and that is that's there's some people in this world who have so fully assimilated the values of the perverse and anti human values that are part and parcel of this. Demiurge. Achill reality so fully that they aren't able to intuit its will and do its bidding. Those of course are the people of power in this world. Bohemian Grove types the high lease like because of whether they're mostly the fact that they're so born so close to power to begin with that. They have access to it at an intimate level but then also through the systematic stripping away through nature and nurture and learn behavior of conscious of a basic human love of the of the agape spirit of the of the universal loving kindness that is instinctive among all human beings severing those in pursuit of a dead of worship of death of a worship of disconnection and extinguishment and those people are have the function of demons they're functionally demons so that's another thing where Alex Jones not totally off Labine and his concept of our rulers as demons is is poetically and I'd say even metaphysically accurate like Krampus a hour job. But I would say that like if the archons like if you put on they live glasses and the instead of people you saw demons like big demons with looking giant table pieces huge wings but they were figure though like the higher up they were and arconi in ranks. Trump wouldn't be that big of a demon compared to them. Some of the other people who have found that office and people in power right. Now like I think Seth. Minuchin is probably a bigger demon than Trump that is a umbrella. It's not a KKK man yucky yuck yuck yeah. See I'm always been very.

[32:50](https://youtu.be/TZzJB1C0_kQ?t=32m50s)

I've always been very conflicted about the usefulness of conspiracy theory and left organizing and left thought because it is instinctively the way people think is how you fill in the gaps how you fill in the gaps in your in your. In the in the information you have which for all of us is very very small amount compared to what's actually happening in the world. Our ability to orientate ourselves is facilitated by how we're able to fill in gaps. Those things occur later narrative that makes sense to us and with so we end up throwing. We here for the internet mostly from culture and TV and stuff and throwing it back out there and the thing is because but the funny thing is is that because the culture life is as I have said it comes from the economic base right. It's it's not generative. It is generated guess what if you're filling in the gaps of your knowledge with narrative and conspiracy theory.

It's gonna reflect a lot of true. Because culture is reflected truly in our or like our ideology is truly projected in our culture. It's just reflected so that all the bad qualities are turned into good qualities like if we can sexually we context. Culture contextualizes the reality of our physical horror and reorients it to reflect back to us in Reverse where all the bad stuff that is really felt by us is turned into theoretical cultural super structural good stuff and then we live at the level of that stuff too and that's what we use to make ourselves okay with the bad stuff to rationalize that stuff so that we continue maintaining fidelity to the system that is how it means. That's how it does ideological oppression on people. That's how it keeps people pliant that's how it manufactures can sing. It creates a culture where it acknowledges all the horrors of your life. But it puts them through a symbolic narrative lens that flips and makes the bad things good. But then he was getting it back in the form of conspiracy theory. It's been slipped again. It's reapplied to the real world and it flips back so there is usefulness to it.

The problem is is that you're not everyone assimilates to culture the same way and that's the main problem with this mechanistic argument about how oh if we reduce this cultural element like the defender flag or non black judges on lawn order. It will make people do this you can't predict what people will do with information they get from culture. It's different with every person even if it's not a different response the depth of the response. It's different everyone like a favor friend. It's a cultural finger and that is why there's always something stupid about the argument. Whether culture makes people do things in the scent in the 80s it was a remember guys in the 90s. Some of you are too young but in the 90s it was about violence and it was about doesn't does consuming. Violet entertainment make you violent and the left response was no that's silly. That's that's ridiculous. Now. It's does. The culture make you racist and the left argument is of course.

It does in both cases the answer to that is yes in the proximate case like John Hinckley. Jr. Could be said accurately to have shot look to a shot Reagan because he watched taxi driver like that is that is illegible sequence of actions that has a surface plausibility to it. The guy had been no idea who Jodie Foster was until he saw that movie and seeing her in relationship to the heroism of DeNiro makes him snap two and two together and then that turns into because of other old information of taxi driver. I'm gonna shoot the president. Now the thing is though from that is only describing the mere action action. That's the mechanism you can't draw from that from any specific thing like that a general theory of what to do like actually how to practically deal with that fact because it's too individualized like it's not worth it to ban taxi driver to stop someone from shooting the president because he's probably the only guy on earth who would have had that response because he was already set up to snap.

The answer to this stuff is that culture gives someone an excuse. It's given them a little final push. But the thing is you can never know what to set it off. It's um it's completely unpredictable from one person to another. It's stochastic so you can't use blanket condemnation. You can't use big flesh especially ones that seriously undermine free speech and alienate people from the government that you represent you're trying to have popular support for these measures and I'm sorry a mare in America. Especially calls for censorship make some people mad even if they're not trying to defend racism that is a social cost and then you have a social cost of that thing not being able to be artistically pursued which is a loss for all of us to stop what maybe one or two guys wanting to try to shoot the president. It's not worth it. You have to change the civil conditions you have to get changed the material conditions to minimize the number of people who are gonna snap. The number of people who are gonna do anything from commit a murder to act out on racial beliefs. You want someone who's gonna be racist. You want them to have the racism it like a three you can live in a culture where there's still a lot of racism.

But it tops out three. That's a better situation objectively than one where tops out into five or six and that's where culture can play a role to bring that number and so this whole argument about oh these things have negative effects. It's all assumed because you're talking about an individual moment but you're applying it to an entire group of people and it can't work. It's too flimsy that's why you have to always be oriented when it comes to prescriptions to the material and this is where this is the demeaning 'fl. Distinction. I'm talking about this is the real meaningful distinction. I'm talking about you can say that it is correct like when Jeep says cultural racism reinforces. Material felt racism you can say that and be correct but that is at the level of description describing a situation. It is not prescription saying what to do about it. But every all of those distinctions are lost online and the debate is flattened and they both become dimensions of the same question and they're not. It has to be separated and so my mind is because of that don't even argue about any of the food here don't argue about. These things don't waste breath on either defending or condemning flag cancel culture statue cancellations or or the role of low capital in the protests don't even argue about it because I said as I said the other day even you arguing about it contributes to the cycle because it gives someone to something to argue against just focus on the material conditions and the thing is everyone's.

[40:26](https://youtu.be/TZzJB1C0_kQ?t=40m26s)

Having this fun argument about the descriptive question and you want to be part of the fun party you can hear them on the other side of the fence your neighbors. They're having a great barbecue over there you yelling at each other. They're having the time of their lives forming friendships and hatreds that are gonna last forever. You're over here scribbling away in the blue books like the noon softball. I'm in volleyball both whatever at the same time so I understand the lore of it. But it just contributes to the it just contributes to it. Grill has in stay grounded and and most of all take what you know to be true about the material roots of racism and the need to attack it materially if you're gonna do anything about it and apply it to your actual life how about that and you can say I don't know how well then wait move forward. One foot in front of the other until a movement of a direction makes sense but don't panic and try to skip steps by formulating online by expressing yourself online emotionally and getting your sense of a purpose-built build there because guess what it will lure you in like narcissus is reflection if you don't have an answer keep grilling you don't have an answer keep doing whatever is in your life that you feel good about doing that you feel like you're constructing something and then there will be an intersection with the question of the political and then you can apply that so that is what I say to everybody who's getting all hot and bothered about any of this stuff like if you're protesting if you're out there keep doing it if you're organizing keep doing it. If you're not yet then apply the complete and that that rubric of like what satisfies me and what am I good at and actually apply it to the question instead of getting theoretical. Oh that felt good got a lot off my chest.

There been cuz. I was already yesterday to go and that is I don't like coughing on the thing. That's why I take the smaller drops. I know I don't like coffee grow your own food if you can is good advice for anybody becoming self-sufficient in any way you can. It's probably not a bad idea and you know what makes it easier to be self-sufficient. Having other people cooperating. I know it's hard because we're literally we're living through a pandemic that has made every current of alienation in this culture. Exact exacerbating that's a bummer man that's a real bummer. I know I I I remembered with Instagram. You only get an hour. I don't know how long I'm gone. Everybody has a clock so I know that it gets too wound up in there. Like another thing. It's gonna cut me off. I prefer on Twitch. How are you can go as long as you want well. The time we got guys everyone got anyone got time. Ten minutes left so they've been 50 okay all right well. Then I'll just maybe ask a couple answer. A couple questions were logged off here.

The question of the statue is helping helping give people momentum as I've said it's only if the momentum is towards something useful. If pushing down what a small statute makes you get it in your head that now we can push down a bigger statue and it just becomes a question of bigger symbols. You'll never get anywhere but that's a question of how individual protest movements that are not organized respond and that's why it's not a question of description. It's not a prescriptive question for me. I can't I can't apply a prescriptive lens to it because it's not being organized. I can't contribute to its organization so I can only describe it let's say this is happening and look for something that is description that is prescriptive and that can motivate me.

That's that's that's what I have to wait for. That's what we all have to wait for I hope Aaron Rodgers retires as a packer. I mean they ruin a they cost. They absolutely cost him at least two Super Bowls in my opinion that hack fraud absolute clown Mike McCarthy. One of them well the most dreadful probably my most hated packer quarter but quarter a Packers coach of all times. Just an absolute worm man just a sniveling little turd risk-averse Philistine. He didn't realize the punted or feet went four field goals at fourth and with within like I think the 10 yard line poor thing within the 10 yard line. They went 4 field goals twice in the opening half and losing my field or goo that Husky looks.

I don't want to get ablest here. But he just looked like he was a fat middle schooler. He looked like a HUS a guy in a kid Oshkosh pegasi like wandered away like like an extra big kid. You know like it's like. He got an early hit of hormones and it's like sixth grade and he's like like Annie Reed looked in the punch packing kick video. He did just stumbles away from a field trip wearing his overalls and just picks up a mic and a clipboard yeah. So they wasted years of his prime with with that oh and now it's like a poison relationship he's been fighting him. I could definitely think the thing is I think especially if you get one. This is what happened was far you get towards the end. It's like give me one more and they'll do anything to get the one more. But that's all they care about and it's a question. It's honestly it comes down to growth like if you're a real adult if you're if you're at a lighten being you stop playing football as soon honestly as it's financially viable because it's dangerous. But if you do get a spiritual pleasure and it makes you a better person to be a football player and it's gonna be harder to be one without it and you know that play until you reach some sort of equilibrium.

These guys getting into their 40s demanding to keep playing it's because they're chasing something they're trying to fill a hole that can't be filled like that last one's gonna make them feel good for a week and they're gonna be. They're gonna have to retire and then they're not gonna know who they are. That's why the guys will walk away from the game. We're the ones I respect the most Barry Sanders without a ring without even sniffing ring thanks to them. Packers killing them and basically every playoff game pretty hilarious. They're a guy whose career was completely wasted and but he was like I don't want to do this anymore.

I'm gonna move to London to hang out with my dog ador amazing Bo Jackson. He was cut down in his prime but then he didn't like spiral. He just like well that was fun now I'm done with it. I'm gonna make my own arrowheads and bohon possible Ricky Williams. They said weed or football and he thought about it. He said weed I'd rather like open a head shop. Then get my skull caved in so it turns out how mature riders is if he walks away. Then I will respect him more I will say that and if he feels the need to like try to sign on with like oh god like though trying to think of who they might go for where he might like desperately let the packers or not. I'm sorry the Vikings again. The Bears I don't even know who he could go. But co2 is like a as at the quarterback position is actually kind of I don't know but if he does that it feels like he's had some growing up to do he had some maturing to do. He has some inward looking to do to realize the limits of pleasure like that that's how you know that Tom Brady is a broken Holloman. The fact that this guy has seven Super Bowls and he's gonna go to Tampa Bay. He has a sickness. He has a sickness of the soul that will carry him to death unless he realizes the hollowness of his pursuit. All right guys. It's been a good one. I think I hope I can get onto the YouTube page within a few days so catch you guys on the flappity. Flap doodle go pack you.
