Foreign that keeps me from Dancing With The One I Love but my mind holds the key I'm living in an age that keeps looking um that keeps me from dealing with the key. My body is a game that James welcome to my chat room let us chat chats democratic. Oh man somebody writes a oh that would be a great name for a book about like the 21st century. Internet left chats Democratic if anybody knows that would oh it would be a delicious pun on a seminal work on early American working class politics by Sean willins called chance democratic so you could call. It chats Democratic and it would be about like you know the online lab. I'd probably be in there which would be very very sad because the local Focus actually got something done so we'll be talking about the second half of the China boom by half and I believe but first I just got to say something about people freaking out but not freaking out really having this like erotic expiry expiration around Twitter ending and it's fascinating to watch.

Like last night. All the news came out. Oh you know the Elon fired everybody and they're locked out of the building and that means this is it so everybody's posting like. It's honored to know you gentlemen's type stuff like Nearer My God to the Titanic going down moments and the entire thing had this air of like you know a celebration. This is this people who had spent every day of their lives on Twitter complaining about how awful it was how it was la helsight how it was miserable how they felt horrible being there in that moment of like you know Annihilation. When the promise of being freed. From this thing comes onto the Horizon. They're able to look back and be like actually I loved it. It was the greatest thing of my life it made everything in my life possible I owe my sanity to it all that stuff all that stuff that you know. It's not more true than the stuff about my health site that they hated it. That was true too like that's. The that's the reality of living under capitalism. That's the thing that turns us all eventually mad is that all of our Pleasures are lashed into this sadomasochistic framework where the things that keep us going literally like the things that allow us to survive mentally in the punishing alienating late capitalist doldrums we live in. are the very things that keep us connected to it keep us welded to it. Then things that emerge out of it. You know that's the dialectical reality and we can't do anything about it oh God damn. It is the robot voice back. I think that means I'm double I forgot to did I not yeah. I have the thing muted God damn it. So. It's like we have to imagine Sisyphus happy and suspicious is happy I'm going to log off and log back on. Because last time. It didn't do this so that might work okay. I literally turn it off and turned it back on again in the style of Boomers which I am I am Boomer don't off.

But it really shows that like there is both this like love and addiction to Twitter like everything else that were were lashed to the massive and also this deep loathing not even if the thing but if ourselves were being dependent upon it because we could theoretically Break Free. This is the reality that we can't really talk about. We could all of us Break Free of all of the shackles that we are on as a society we could cut through the the the the the black Iron prisons gates with the laser of our minds not blaming anyone for not doing it. I'll tell explain why even though we could we don't but the capacity I do believe exists and the thing that would make it happen is. If enough people decided The rules don't apply to me. I am going to act like this reality is as illegitimate as it actually is as opposed to in every moment of my life. adhering to its dictates not just in public. But privately you know the the Korean self-policement in your head and what that policeman is motivated by the thing that keeps you going is not really the one in the home. Anyway is is the one powered by your addictions by the things that have given you some sort of relationship of of mission and task and purpose and you're gonna. Focus on those because that is where you're able to approximate something like the human will to power to to connection too. Because remember like all of these things run against connecting to other people. They run towards hoarding pleasure to the South because pleasure cannot be really shared without a sacrifice and in a world where all sacrifice seems futile the logical thing is to hoard pleasure but if you decide these Pleasures are not my Pleasures.

These are an alienate position. Then yes you will be thrown into immediate Jeopardy. You will be thrown out of the degree of comfort that you do have and I do mean Comfort down to the level of a roof over your head or a roof of your choosing as opposed to a state provided roof. If you know what I mean or you know actual death. Those are all to the to the you know to the body being separated from the whole. Those are all worth pursuing because what else is there that's the first thing we have because our I mean our relationship to our body is already sort of an abstraction. Like the intellectualized self is a fantasy and it is only sustained through belief like our belief in ourselves is as fundamentally religious as our belief in God or science or anything else and that's the thing that new atheism misses and always did because the very self that you're trying to use to determine reality through rational faculties is a theological conviction because you are in the backwash of this body you know like the mind is only processing stuff. The body is already done in response to an environment that it's in those instantaneous responses that form our bodily reaction to the world. Around us. We don't get to think about them. We don't get to decide consciously using language using our self. We cannot think them into being they have to come faster than that what we think is okay. What did we just do and why we make a narrative at post-factor narrative about what the just happened. That is what Consciousness is by the way. This is also why I do believe that God not just in the sense of oh man world God but like a a universal Consciousness moving towards a goal of self-realization like that is what a God would be. That is what it is like that is our notion of God as an actualized human self. That's what Mormonism imagines to God to be. That's what all of the the monotheistic religions that emerge. Once you have like a concrete fixed relationship between one class. A slave class and one master class that dialectic is going to power all of Human Social history and therefore all of its structures all of its modes of production.

So you we're all seeking something that will sever our connection and the thought is the fantasy that people have is. If Twitter goes away. Then I will be forced to find meaning to be new tasks. New Missions closer to myself which means closer to other people and that means hey I'm gonna through those actions build these new connections with other people that change my hedonic calculus that make me now be like oh my narrow. Pleasures can't sustain me because we don't have easy ones like Twitter. We have things that are harder to come by we flee to the internet because with the the satisfactions of Life are harder to come by or even if we can access them our enjoyment of them declines over time geometrically just as a rate of profit. Falls the rate of pleasure Falls over time in one specific type of pleasure. The rate is determined differently. The rate is determined by our access. The more access to Pleasures we have the more we will be able to pursue those pleasures and stay ahead of their declining like actual felt enjoyment but once you plateau just like once an Empire reaches its territorial limit. The decline sets in and this is all echoed through every structure of Consciousness. The self-making making itself let the mind making the body legible because yes they're the same thing. But the mind is alienated by definition but that alienation can be managed by a conscious awareness of it that turns into over time a deeper. reflexive belief in it which means determining the way you encounter the world and the way your body responds to the things. That season hears and senses the evidence of a census that your body is acting on without you thinking about it.

But if you trust your body then there is no break between what you want and what your body wants and therefore you're going to make the right decision. That's why we're stuck making no decisions because we can't even connect to our own bodies because we're fully our minds. Now. That's the final we've pulled ourselves out of our bodies. Capitalism has helped us do that it's the technology that's pulled our souls out of our body. Now. It's just floating But it can't but we're still stuck in bodies. How do we manage that we have to go back into our bodies. And I think that's what we're all doing that's why I feel like. I'm doing like I feel like in describing myself On these Vlogs I swear to God. I feel like I am managing my own impending death because I have been a hypochondriac my entire adult life since my injury as a teenager and that means that I have basically described my entire life trajectory as one towards Annihilation because the self is all I've ever really felt I've always been super alienated from my body to a neurotic degree and then I had this injury as a teenager that just wrecked my my ability to like sense my own body like to sense my danger level because I'm in pain all the time and so I spent years just panicking about the feelings I had and turning them into death and I still do that but now instead of worrying about oh is this really happening am I really dying and then trying to reason myself out of thinking I'm dying and then ignoring it through pursuit of things like going on Twitter. But over time the pleasures of that get less but the feeling the pain the anxiety is still pressed the same amount. So this this thing is my body put like is my body pushing against myself saying like you're gonna. Die soon relatively soon in that you are mortal but if you do you will not be able to get back in your body. In time you will not be able. You'll be lost you'll be severed. You'll go to hell outer Darkness gehenna or just be annihilated like Tony Soprano. If you're a a materialist one way or another. It is a medical. It's a fear of metaphysical extinguishment that is insanity because you're not not your your. The body is you. It's all one thing and the death of the body is the freedom of the soul. But only if that death is a peaceful one or at least I I really do think everybody is saved but the amount of pain you appear experience. The amount of fear and pain you experience before it happens in your individual life. That's not up to you to decide accept how to respond as it's ending and if you can address your death the what Heidegger talks about. Then you can Rob death of its tariffs and the earlier you're able to do that the more you're able to negotiate your life and the feelings your body has and the feelings of danger and feelings of rewarded punishment feelings of safety and love beyond the self and you'll be able to realize oh. My. Pleasures are only those that can be shared and what does that mean what are the implications of that. It changes what you can have fun with what you can have fun doing you're doing with your time because you're able to think when I die I will look back on the life that I have at this moment like imagine that because we don't know when we are going to die and that is the fantasy that the the fantasy underlying my hypochondria is that you can know that is what comes out of the rationalist fantasy that has emerged out of Christianity that oh 

We've we've run out of Road here in terms of the metaphysics so what what what can we do how do. We make sense of this and that creates this model of a rationality. If we can if we can describe the universe we become God. I think that is the underlying metaphysical logic of of capitalism and that is why every capitalist is trying to become literally God for for a long time rich people built monuments to themselves but that was because of the amount of technology that there was allowing and abetting their rule. You know you're the pyramids the big grades and then later public works like once the political sphere opens up more and it's not just a Bengal of God as interpreted by you know your priests. Now you need a deliver deliberative process because you need you have more technology that you have to wield yeah. Like you have to.

This is why I think taoism is the one religion that is not terminally poisoned by the logic of class society which is why you hit a dead end with Christianity and Buddhism that because you're creating a dichotomy in artificial dichotomy between dying as a sinner and dying is a saint dying is someone who has been saved or someone who has been damned even Hinduism and even Buddhism. The one the religions that Embrace um the circle still have an underlying preference imposed preference for one a way of being in over another in terms of like its ultimate resolution. Like it. The cycle that you are trying to escape right has people who are closer and farther away from escaping it and so you have like a holy class who spend their life basically not experiencing the drag of pleasure the drag of desire and therefore achieving extinguishment which is the reunion with all which is the same as the death of the body. But it is also the concept that heaven in every less abstract in religion tries to explain tries to get across and fails. That is what that's and and that is different than somebody who's going to die and come back and have to go through more and more pains more and more misery. Unthinkable amounts considering how much misery exists in the human life and that's that's a thing to avoid and so you need a class Society to allow people to pull up to provide instruction. But what if the end experience the final experience of all Minds is the body making sense of the actual end of life in that little tale behind extinguishment. That is the soul so that means sure you go through a bunch of. other lives after your own but the experience of of final awareness is still a narrative that retrospectively brings everything together and therefore heals all pain and if all pain is healed then letting go is possible.

That's what we all fear we're regardless of religion. So we won't be able to let go and why because we live alienated from ourselves and each other. Thanks to the reality the Persistence of class social rule. That is why no religion can Encompass this truth in the moment of the end of capitalism when class rule which is terminating here in capitalism. One way or the other I do believe that has to be reckoned with and of course I might be wrong. Capitalism might persist there might not be a crisis but here's the thing everybody in human history lives with some notion of Apocalypse because you can only make sense of everything retrospectively which means all of our Notions of conscious are built on a a perception of something that's already happened and we actually have we have By the way we have recorded in I believe the South Pole evidence of particles moving backward through time.

I think people can correct me if I'm wrong on this in the chat but there has been I obviously I'm a Layman and this is me pulling things out of my ass. But I'm just talking about what Vibes to me what things vibrate. Together. It makes sense you can sort out the details when later you have to act first and that means also intellectually you have to act first and one of the reasons we're all paralyzed intellectually as well. Spiritually is because we can't act but we can only figure out what what to do. After acting the reason. There's a left is because it's a bunch of people waiting for an action. Because they are too strapped to their um strapped to their obedience. We are all strapped to our obedience but if this is true what does this mean when you die you're just dead right. Everything that the materials say it just it goes black right you stop getting signals. It stops telling a story that is true but the implications of that I think mean on the reverse of that that the that the retrospective reconciliation of the Soul is also inevitable.

What does that mean that means God exists in any form any in form that an individual or a group of individuals can imagine not consciously picture. This is the important thing this doesn't come from thinking about them all the time thinking about some abstract notion of God. It comes deeper than that it's the reason that you don't you don't will your dreams into being you don't you don't stage that Tableau that table of stage for you just as reality quote-unquote reality is staged for you because it's all staged. It's all a hologram. But the implications of this is oh. I don't have to worry and what that means all it means. I don't have to worry about anything. I don't have to worry about literally anything including losing my my my adherence to the world. Meaning I can turn against the state in a meaningful way meaning I can start saying no in a meaningful way well the reasons we don't do.

It is because there's no organization to put our actions word other than just being anti-social. There's there's politics but politics is compromised because it's being done by a bunch of people who have not had that moment you know that spiritual pop the belief because it isn't it's not being given to us. We come to it individually by fluke. Our our conditioning is to the non-existence of God regardless of what we think we believe regardless of of how much how based our Trad catholicness is or how deeply grounded our Evangelical faith in in God in in in a Luther or I guess I should say kelvin's God because Calvin is the one who's refining this thing into an actual religion of capitalism as opposed to Luther's earlier Credo core of the die. Like Luther's conception of products Luther's Protestant Reformation is the um Cry of the dying feudal order like as it's it's denied oh like oh this thing is gonna die. How can we save it and Luther is trying to save it. Luther fails to save it because it cannot be saved. Calvin then emerges with the birth of capitalism as the refined form that can adhere to capitalism and push Humanity towards its extinguish and its Extinction. Because remember. The the social order is what's emerging from these the the collective brain of the social order. The collective will of the social orders was being expressed by people like Luther and Calvin. These people who are his history compacted to a point and then they become the mouthpieces for historical forces beyond their conception. Luther is the is the mouthpiece of the historic of the conception of a feudal order that is in. Terminal crisis and the the Reformation is this attempt to to to it. It recognizes that the Catholic religious tradition is damning us to hell because it is making us into capitalists because capitalism remembers embedded in feudalism at this point and is emerging and there are capitalists all through feudalism. Now they're living amongst everyone else but they are living in a way that is dramatically alienated in a way that their none of their neighbors are not and their neighbors respond against them. Anti-Semitism emerges from this. It's the autoimmune I'm sorry. It's the immune system of the feudal order because the peasants get exploited by these capitalist systems that even existed in the medieval like Hydro feudalism. Like like money lending and stuff. It was concentrated around this social other which of course that was that was the machine protecting itself and under stable conditions. It could do that forever but this conditions weren't stable.

The the land got depleted that's a big part even before the Black Death. The land is getting depleted that's crucial that's where the enclosures come from that and then you got you know the life stage which just knocks all the pieces off the board and Luther you know the son of of a pro of a capitalist. Like this is how close Luther is to this transition. Okay Luther's dad was a was a peasant farmer in Germany. I'm sorry Luther's grandfather looter. They weren't before they were the Luthers. They were the looters so Luther's grandfather. No I'm sorry I got it wrong. I'm sorry Father I'm literally saying father his dad I believe Hans Luther was born a peasant farmer. He did work on on his own lands and on the lands of the local Lords in in Germany in in I believe Saxony or syringe around there which is where those cities are popping up that are really doing capitalism and where the the screws are starting to get tightened and where the post black death situation where the The Peasants had a lot more leverage that's getting knocked down by the state you know enforcing this new um this new capital forward formation. Hey these lands they don't belong to you. They belong to me and I can charge. You rents that are Market rents and I can enclose common land so you can't sustain yourself. There's responses to that some people become religious. Fanatics set themselves on fire. Some people become drift of the Cities and become a peasants or I'm sorry drift of the cities and become either soldiers or maybe trying to make their way in the trades.

If they're young enough but probably fall to the bottom Then there are a few industrious money. Getters like Hans liter who take on paid wage making labor in the in the in the Agricultural Center and save up enough money to go to the city and use the new financial instruments. This is the thing he knew about this stuff a lot of the people they had no idea this was happening. It was happening above their heads because it's associated with literacy things like that and he comes in to the city and he lays down a second gold coins and he is able to lease a a silver mine. I believe it was silver it might have been four but and he's able to use new techniques to make it more profitable and he becomes a City Burger. But the whole time he is by the way in huge debt because he never owns any of these mines so even though he's becoming a like member of the city council at airport becoming a big shot like a rotarian type guy. He's in the hot to everybody because he's got to keep paying off each loan with the last one. He'd only make he only pays off the operation completely like a couple years before he dies like. He just he barely has time to enjoy it after giving up the hustle and then of course their son. He's got to rise up in the world so they pat him on the ass and they send him off to law school. But there's this he has the heart of a peasant not because of not because of genetics just because of the mil. You even grew up in yes. He's in the city but like first generation. Like these the the morons of the people he Associates himself with. They're betting himself every second that he's alive deeper than his conscious knowledge. He is becoming embedded in a social reality and his status his dad though who's more wedded to he's psychologically more wedded to this project. He's more motivated and that is the thing that comes down to individual individual biology obviously but also experience nature nurture. Those things create a ball of person that has certain abilities virtues ways of seeing the world and Hans looters was forget.

Money Getting Luther's was not and so he has this Revelation when he almost gets hit by lightning to go to to become a Churchman. That's because he is fleeing from the reality the implication of becoming a capitalist subject that's what Luther is doing there and he goes to the church where he thinks he can still adhere to these section these these social connections and what does he see the church oh my God. The church is a business too known as money lenders in the temple. Why is that well he can't ignou. He cannot Analyze. This the material conditions because he's in them he's immersed. He cannot recognize those things for what they are. You can only see the cleavages and the cleavage here is between religion as understood and religion as practiced religion of Christianity and its implications for the self and for the value system that they should that a person should hold versus the value system that the society you find yourself in actually holds um and so he's chafing but because he's a guy whose brain is just built that way who's who's his anxiety manifests itself in this hyper literacy. This this logaria like he just starts he starts basically a a a proxim of writing. They can only sustain itself why because the printing press exists. The reason that guys like me are on Twitter and then going on a podcast because that's the path of least resistance to our attempt to explain our persistent pinging.

We're feeling from God somewhere from some knowledge that something greater than us exists and then we want to make the world adhere to that because that would allow us to die with the least amount of sin. The least amount of sense that we have violated our Brotherhood with one another that's the thing that keeps us from letting go and the pain that we have to inflict on ourselves by dying unreconciled and therefore having to be born again into another body to go through it again and again you know or go to hell like if you're if you believe enough just burning in hell not for eternity. But you know until you're spit out the other end. So it's like Purgatory comes after hell and it's often pointed to by Lutheran's. It's like this horrible Innovation and it was because it allowed them to do the scam with the with indulgences which allow the church to just grab a bigger piece of surplus because that's all these machines are. The the Machinery of feudalism is just an a extraction mechanism by different Elites military aristocratic but also religiously aristocratic the the sword and and this the cross and it's like we all are forced by capitalism to live as Hypocrites and that gets to us and it makes us worry what if I die right now will. I look around and feel like when I'm surrounded myself with my life. What I've done with. It does it adhere to something that doesn't deserve punishment and of course. We're the one administering punishment because we have we imagine that we are the God who gets to decide. But we're not all we can do is prolong the process by tournamenting ourselves by fleeing to corporality to a chance to avoid the final judgment but the final judgment will be universally. The final judgment is acceptance because how else would it work. It is a Reconciliation to a conclusion because narrative is inherently retrospective which means we either got.

However you want to imagine it. It's God as a consciousness in space time that's the thing has to be in space-time. This is why this is why more rationalist types have problems with Western religion religious. Notions of a god because how is it physically embodied. We're violating what we know which is that there is no separation between space-time. Any of these things there is no out there is nothing outside that's the fantasy that we have to believe in to move our bodies around because if we really perceived ourselves as connected to everything else we would not be able to sustain ourselves. We would not be able to Captain the ship of humanity that's what all Consciousness is. But it reaches a certain point when the richness of the fantasy becomes so powerful that we are able to assert independent. action on Earth we get to do things other than what our bodies tell us to because now we're telling our bodies what's happening and that is why Free Will is absolute. Our bodies are being ping-panged around and you can look at them as this oh you had. This had this head of this but where that's moving it's not being determined by random chance. It's being determined by this the the quantum moment when decisions are made that's where we all live. We live in that Quantum Zone and what do we know about the quantum world we know that the laws of physics that we understand don't exist there right. We know that so that means they're not That means they these things are these Notions of if we accept that like that is the level of Consciousness that the level of the quantum the Consciousness exists in that gap between your body being ping-panged through space and what your brain tells your body to do because of its misperception. This is crucial the misperception of the world around it let's see. This is why I can do this. I can play play. I could do this show and feel like hey. You know I maybe I am dying or maybe the world isn't work getting worse than I think it is and disaster is more imminent or maybe. I am one of those guys who's just going to Keel over of a stroke or get cancer. fast I don't know I can't know any of those things I can't know if my body knows when it's gonna end and I'm trying to talk myself down to euthanasia.

The reason I can live in that contradiction though is that I I got to the point where I realized it doesn't matter if that's true because every explanation gets to the same point and because of this retrospective nature of consciousness some embodied creature somewhere gained ability to manipulate at the quantum level. What is that whatever it is I believe what it is. I believe is a fixed in space and time technological adherence to reality to the material reality. The Singularity right that the capital is talking about but they think of it in terms of individual consciousnesses persisting eternally because they're at the end of the day. fractured Western subjects whose con whose understanding of the universe has been fatally this adhered to a deeper theological truth that renders religions into the tools of power that they become because why you need a saint. Why did Luther say we needed a state to keep people from going to hell but what if what if there is no Eternal damnation though what if there's not extinguishment but there's also no internal damnation what if there is a unwinding an unclenching that has the the experience of whatever that person's deepest understanding of reunion of of of of completion would be and I really feel like doing the show and stuff like that like talking about this stuff. Like I'm sitting here in a body. It's doing stuff. My brain is perceiving it. I perceive a lot of pain in my body. I always have I perceive things and where do I perceive them. I perceive them where I think logically rationally there should be pain but what do I is it traffic or irrational where I think pain should be like I can read about Trump and stuff like oh you know the heart disease that's the number one killer in America right like the American way of life. The one I have kills people with their heart now of course realistically. That's still actuarially likely to happen to me specifically in a a long enough distance that like they're worrying about it more than just like trying to watch what you eat as opposed to like you know really going crazy like finding a mean where it's like you're sustaining health without becoming like fixated on it in a way. That's like destabilizing to your way of being as opposed to just sitting with anxiety. All the time. is to not try to reason your way out of it but to instead accept the premise so yeah that is what's happening. That's exactly what's happening because they're both happening simultaneously until the moment when the quantum superposition happens right when schroederer's box gets opened. But I would say since the sensuous sensuous perception which is how we think of consciousness is this mirror. Image of of this distorted mirror image of the the body and the world is interpreting because of the distance right. The time is the space-time difference that creates this Gap until the door slams and when the door slams when the thing is open. You have yes the extinguishment of a large mammal. The end of life. All the stuff that is horrifying for a materialist to consider makes people want to do things like figure out how to do a live forever in a computer. Why these people are frantically trying to go to Mars why we can't at the top level where people actually have like enough individual independent access to Capital to like sway the direction. It goes why are they all headed towards Annihilation because they have to have to try to seek this Escape because they are psychotically invested in a distinction that does not exist so that means that as a science guy as a guy who has accepted a certain amount of science at least enough science that I can't accept like a supernatural intervention at the level that like traditional Christianity had adhered to people and which was killed by the Reformation. Like I said Luther is trying to save Christianity by trying to save Capital save feudalism from Itself by reforming it because he thought if everybody can read the Bible they'll behave better because they won't be afraid of going to hell. But of course. Luther still believes in hell he has to create a saved in a damned but if everyone reads the Bible yes someone's going to hell but it's none of us right and everyone can act that way the problem is they're not allowed to act that way. They have to adhere to this class Society where they're either being exploited or exploiting. They're forced to do things. They don't want to do but are being forced to do either by direct exploitation or because their comfort depends on it.

Their comfort depends on it and so I'm sitting here saying some stuff that feels true to me. I'm also getting. Sensations from my body telling me. Oh you are going to die right. Now. We're not right now pretty soon now in previous times what would I do with those feelings and they would spike all the time I would spend my time kind of anxiously and unpleasantly unwinding the logic of it until I distract myself with something what was had to be like the volume kept having to be turned up. So. That's what get me on the hedonic treadmill of Doom. But I feel like now what I do when I have those feelings is. I'm saying stuff that makes me feel instead those feelings. Associated not with anxiety and tension but with relaxation with so that I can think and breathe as opposed to just concentrating on breathing which gets harder when you're in discomfort or pain so like if I'm fantasizing about having a heart attack right that means oh my god when that happens I'm not going to be able to like think. This stuff is true because I'm going to be feeling pain that's scary. But what pain can be defeated as any pregnant woman can tell you by breathing now of course. It's still there but you're not annihilated by it and that's the thing we fear that is what hell represents a pain Beyond pain because it is eternal but that as I said is impossible because it's all Container Consciousness contains the whole thing so we are both judged and judger and our final realization is the final realization of that fact and that means our last Act is self as it could not. I mean otherwise be self-ab solution because I mean somebody says you have OCD. I probably have plenty of undiagnosed things. Thing is because of because I have the the spinal injury. I never got to the point where I wanted to adhere my feelings of crumminess to psychological causes because it never got to that point at least in my mind. It's like I know why I'm I I know why I hurt. It's because of this thing that happened to me you know and I I know why I I think certain things. I accidentally so that's why I would have these like anxieties like oh. This is going wrong. I'm gonna die and I'd be worrying about it. But then I would be whirring my way away from it logically and to me because I was doing that I was basically maintaining and sure I probably I was probably manifesting a lot of awful stuff. I know I was manifesting a lot of awful self-destructive behaviors that hurt other people too but it was a slow enough like decline that I could manage it and then when the show blew up it exploded my entire hedonic calculus. It's like oh yes. There's so much more enjoyment to be had. So many more things that you can distract yourself. From so you can just go wild but that then got closed again by covet and a number of other things and now it's a new choke point and the pressure keeps building up because I'm getting older I'm getting out of that zone. The youth zone where the the final thing that puts it off is just the the reassurance of one's statistical unlikelihood of being the subject of such a debt and so that helps you put it off but eventually that gets harder to do that keeps going that clock ticks relentlessly. So you can move with the hedonic thing but the time thing is just a fact and it's going to change your hormones. It's going to change your distribution of serums and juices through the body and that is going to change your ability to enjoy anything and so how are you going to keep yourself from destroying yourself or one way or the other by unleashing to opposition with the state to the degree that you should and being annihilated. That's one way or totally pursuing Indulgence to try to smash them at Lamborghini against the side of the wall. Good old neon Style where you can't keep. Persisting is that agonized middle which we feel as we're hurdling through space and time we have to do.

But we don't we live in the middle. The middle is all there is the middle is reality. The choices the the resolved States that is our misperception of the universe around us the inherent misperception that comes from being embodied by senses that separate so what I go by is how my heart feels like who do. I how do I feel. When I'm around people. I'm around the people in my life. I feel really good to the sense that I can sit there and be like if this is it like I get an attack and I get a feeling. My heart rate starts racing because that's the. Thing your heart goes up a little bit when you get that Spike of perception and then how do you respond to that if you believe it's real you will freak out and you will feel more pain and you will freak out the people around you and it will you'll try to turn it into reality. I've had that happen before or as I said you can just let it run let the clock run and how can you let the clock run if you are feeling that that sense of ease that makes you that comes I believe from well okay if this is the time the reason I don't have to worry about. It is because if it happens so what however I need to imagine I will be reconciled. I will be. However I imagine I have to be forgiven. I will be whatever I'm afraid of happening will not happen even if it's physical pain because again it's not physical pain. It's the imagined world of nothingness of nothing but pain that fills the mind when pain is sharp. But here's the thing about that that pain is still contained. It's still narratively packaged if it isn't. It's not pain anymore so that's why I can sit here and do this show do. These things read my books in the in the world. We live in in the hell world and feel like okay what happens what if this is it. I'm fine. That's the faith because it's like well what if it is what what if it is every what if brings you back to where you are which is in a chair hopefully you're lying down hopefully. You know not bleeding all over the place but also even if then your brain starts dreaming as you die okay. This is another thing that's not made up your. Brain literally starts dreaming as you die dreams have an ending and it isn't waking up. Every dream ends that means the dream of Consciousness ends because otherwise it's not a dream. It's not a dream until you wake up and is it a good dream or a bad dream. It doesn't really matter because what you've woken up in is into a greater consciousness.

A greater understanding that makes sense of what just happened and resolves the contradictions of it and forgives those who need forgiving and collapses down into the the undifferentiated manner of existence foreign. But it is religion of this type born out of this new struggle that's why everybody who's going Trad who has some sort of like fake. They are craving an extinct mode of class rule. They're the people who are around with. Luther was around and were like Fearless of rocks and we want to protect it not because it allows us to be good to each other which is why Luther wanted to save it but because it allows us to be bad to each other. It allows us the satanic pleasures of life foreign is destroying the architecture rearranging the deck chair saying capitalism's Indulgence needs to be curtailed and all that means is fewer people need to be considered worthy of life. Like that's all. It is like that's the entire new all the brilliant. esoteric strands of incredibly thoughtful new right thinking I'll boil down to this It is there needs to be fewer people who are worthy of life life instances and saying it's defined as your ability to to get the good parts out of the machine. The Remain the machine that's just pumping up profit Surplus that is then sat on being in that bubble. That is that has always been the goal.

The point of civilization is to create those relationships and sustain those relationships and so like as as much as you know. The heart of Christianity is in Christ's message of redemption that is at the bottom at the top. It's the other thing. It's it's the punishment. It's it's it's the saved in the Damned. It's keeping people above the line of misery and aristocracy is one way of doing it. But aristocracy is only really capable of dealing with the social realities of feudalism which is some imagined Frontier of agricultural peasant labor. As soon as that Frontier is reached you have crisis accumulate eternally which is what happens in the in the the early modern period and then what emerges out of that is this new reality and so we have a new class of rulers and they don't believe they didn't believe they started off not believing in the the superstitions of the old world. But now we're at the end of History right. That's like okay. We're going to have to we're going they're imagining. We're going to have to get rid of democracy again because we're we're protect. We're thinking this can only get worse which is everybody keeps doing what I'm doing. That's the fantasy of annihilation that we want to be saved from and so the old way which is democracy meaning in the west and therefore everywhere. Eventually access to I hate to say it because people get so mad but treats yes treats I'm sorry. It's treats it does boiled on streets. I know that makes me a PMC Bug Man World economic Forum stooge. But it's also true the Democracy imagine self-actualization. You imagine that you're protecting is capitalist. One that says we still have an aristocracy. But it is not determined by fixed relationship to land but fluent relationship to Capital and specifically culturally ritually what we consume with capital. How we publicly consume it because it has to be publicly consumed. Otherwise it. Stacks up it has to be destroyed. Surplus must be destroyed all regimes of glass Society destroy Surplus. They do it ritually until a crisis of the ecology makes them start having it to eat their own to destroy their own internal structures to adhere to keep it going and undermine it. In turn that's how all societies end and then something else erupts From Below but with those same structures.

So socialism Marxism comes out of Christianity but so does its opposite hyper-individualism which is now the governing. World ideology of every place and aristocracy said the neo-aristocracy with its new adherence to the traditional catholic church is saying let's go back to fixed aristocratic. access to Pleasures treats that confer our ability to be refined our ability to have faith because the dusty rabble can't really have faith because they're too busy rooting around in the dirt trying to survive because we were sitting around all day because we are Estates. We are able to generate peons to God's love that convince people to believe in God to save their souls but they don't need that because they're not going to hell and that is why anybody who is adhering to a any religious tradition that focuses on separating the sheep from the goats. The save from the unsaved is reactionary to court because given the conditions of the world around us. Then the only the only live political question is not how do we stop this it is how do. We distribute the pain of this and if it's if you have ever if you have a religion of exclusion and a religion of damnation then to keep this thing going that allows people to be saved and Damned that it allows us to ritually affirm who gets to enjoy and who gets to suffer then they will. They will always do whatever is in their narrowest self-interest which reinforces capitalism to its extinguishment. Just like at the end of the medieval period. The end of the fuel era Luther is trying to write the ship but what does he do. He creates a cleavage that leads to the 30 Years War and the midi midnight 17th century response to the crisis of cap of feudalism caused by the little ice age. But everybody's so worried about who goes to hell that they fight over that rather than who's in charge who's making hell on Earth to plug our podcast coming up foreign with the end of history. But because the attempt to create a proletarian subject failed the CR the attempt to create a a class-based point of view consciousness that has is is sustained by a material reality. Like people acting to reinforce it. It was birthed into being in the 20th century but then it was destroyed it was extinguished. It does no longer exist.

Now we just have these scraps of identity fighting against each other who's going to be the ones who are saved. Is it going to be the people who have the aesthetic sensibility and and refinement to appreciate the exalted beauty of the Byzantine Latin Mass because my God if it's if we don't maintain a society that allows them to thrive then. What's the point of anything or if you'd say that but no actually it's a different demographic group. It's the It's the downtrend. It's not the rich people. It's the poor people who should be in charge who should get to survive the coming apocalypse but not all of them as poor people of course narrowly as as specific types of poor people because poor people class Consciousness has not been built because people are poor separately. They're poor alone. They're poor as individualized consumers who are sorted by the media by the overpowering media created by capitalism into effective units. Demographic units that then go to war with each other for recesses resources just as the westphalian states went to war with each other in 19 

14. So that means we're going to get another crack up because we can't fix this from the top. It has to come from the bottom that means it has to come from outside of our cognitive window and we have to reconcile ourselves one not to dying any moment of the day but in what conditions yeah sure for surround here surrounded by your friends in a nice house sure but what about outside you know what I mean what about in battle what about sanguinarily in a way that is that that it cannot be aesthetically wrapped up. That's That's another question that's that's the question of pain and only love and the faith that love represents can transcend those things. How are we going to come to that. Consciousness through experience. That's the only way it can happen so like in this thing. This moment that feels like an interregnum while we're like waiting for Twitter to die. So we can be freed because again to get back to the beginning of this if we are free from Twitter because it goes away because we can't go on anymore because that that Road is closed. Then we have to put that energy somewhere else and I mean I'd say cynically that for most people they're going to find another thing that is equivalent to Twitter that has puts them in the same lock as Twitter that robs them of their Essence. The same degree or but some some percentage of people are genuinely going to have to refocus themselves and instead of doing fine meaning in connection as opposed to Severance because we are reinforcing. Severance every minute that we're on social media. I hate to say it but because that's my life depends on it. But it is a fact that means like this thing's gonna go away at some point and we have to reconcile ourselves to it being sudden and to it making us have to reforge understandings of the world that are going to be painful. One way or the other and that is what I daily strive to do is to is to filter my feelings through that lens and I don't have to do it consciously. This is the beauty part because I can go and examine like when am I feeling actually like you know below conscious thought like the thing that we're again trying to make sense of afterwards. My body. You know what is it sending to me and that'll go up and down but our Narrative of it can change and it can change our relationship to our bodies.

 and yeah like one way that I've been able to redirect. Things is that I read more now and I do more projects. I do more I I work more like a hell of presidents thing like that's a lot more because when I'm doing that I feel this Glide and that's what it is. It's we're all seeking the Glide which is the way right in Taoism and you know the the the the search for Dallas Alchemy is to search so that everything you're doing you feel like I want to be doing this and I should be doing. This and your body will tell you that your body will tell you that but that is not. It's not you know making remaking the world. As you see fit. It is fitting into the world as it is but of course. I don't Glide all the time because you know there's a reckoning there's a reckoning in my body. There's a reckoning just from all the memories that I hold that I've experienced you know that that is not goes doesn't go away. Completely. It can be managed but it's still a signal. It's like a tinnitus or a car alarm. It's just a question of turning it up and down and it's managing that dial because it's being a stride sensation. It is not feeling them feeling them is part of it but and and one thing that he and what Hedonism promises is oh I will feel like this all the time but of course that is literally the devil's false promise. It is feeling that way even when you feel bad you know it was feeling something other than anxiety and something other than tension even when you feel bad some way physically for your in a tedious or unpleasant situation and yeah. It's like. It's just. It's this process of basically recoding your deeper reactions to things by being conscious of the way your body is responding. That's why breathing is so Central. It's basically every religious practice. Regardless of what its name is.

I realize I have not even come close to talking about the book and this is annoying I'm sorry. But I feel like some of this was pretty. Useful. I honestly think I'm gonna have Chris chop out the parts of this that are about Lutheran stuff and maybe put it on YouTube. I think it would be a good Amendment a good like intro to the first episode because we talk all about Martin Luther in the first app. So I've been thinking about him a lot but yeah he was trying to bash feudalism back into shape because if everybody read the book including rulers merchants they would be like oh money doesn't matter as much. Pleasures don't matter as much I should act for my fellow man and feudalism could respond to the fact that oh the X amount of land can no longer sustain y amount of people like because we're extinct. We're we're draining it of resource. We're draining it of nutrients. it's it's losing its its productivity but our population is exploding. How do we manage that and as long as you needed an economy to be hey peasants you work. We just sit here on top of it and what do we do with our time. We fight each other over bigger portions of land so that we can then have little sports that are simulations of our Wars like hunting and jousting and and then eating all the Surplus as I said publicly consuming all the Surplus that that's that's our society what if there's less Surplus oh we're gonna have to get more from the peasants squeezing out and the church is part of that and the Surplus because you cannot because there's nothing in feudalism that that forces anyone to improve their production of of Agriculture improve the soil basically over time because if they're gonna just get a fixed percentage taken from their leader no matter or from their leash. Lord no matter what and they're going to be fixed on the land then and working on a land on Farming. Farming is tedious and and unpleasant you're going to work as little as possible. That's always going to be the case So you're like. You. I'm not doing anything and all right I mean I'm not gonna work any more than I have to and you can't make them because power is not concentrated to actually coerce but once you introduce a fixed.

I'm sorry a a market in rent that says oh yeah the the connection from to the soil. That's gone you know that connection to the soil that's part and parcel of your religious understanding and that makes all of it make sense the thing that like the grass root of it. The Beating Heart of it that actually does me like oh yeah. My life is difficult but it also provides me with these reconciliations. These solaces of God's existence you know that I can find help for my. that's all gone. Everything that allows you to live in this world is gone good luck. What are you going to do and yeah you either become despairing you become a rebel or you move to the town or you suffer under the yoke. But the more you suffer the less you're going to get out of the land and what happens in England is there's this free market in in leases that means if you can't Hustle you will lose the land and that means somebody else will get it and who's that going to be the person who is more motivated. The person for whom who is able to look at what's happening and figure something out the more not you might say intelligence. But it's it's as much luck as skill and and you have to take the you have to take the Judgment out of it because we're talking about individual excesses of like perception and we're saying these are better than those because they help us do this. But they don't do it by themselves that is what's that's the that's why we're headed towards apocalypse because we're trying to deify. One type of Consciousness is superior to all others and then like make it eternal. But that value system is based around one facet of them basically infinitely faceted Diamond of human consciousness but it's not just the intelligence as we would understand it. It's much more than that it's Kohler. It's it's attitude. It's how agitated are you. It's how much does being in a body freak you out and make you want to do something that differs from person to person sensitivity but not sensitivity to everything sensitivity to certain things and again shape by Behavior are shaped by your.

Encounters in life and traumas to use that word oh God and that's going to drive some people to do what Hans liter did and go to the city and make his way in the world and then those people are going to be the only people in the world. capable of acting in acting with a full effect because they can act in concert because everybody in the city has the goal of making more money. All the other Elites have completely conflicting goals yeah. They want more money but how they're going to get. It is winning the game though winning the Game of Thrones but meanwhile The Game of Thrones is becoming less and less important because who gets what is being determined in these towns not in the courts of the Kings of the in the mar Graves and the land Graves or of the Cardinal nephews and the Pope that needs a new religion. A religion of people who are in that condition and how do you how do you create it. Luther doesn't create it he's left in the bin. Calvin creates it by making a totally individualized rational religion that says your perception as an individual is the sum total of reality your rational response to that is the sum total of God's. realm of God's conception of the world is only through your individual perceptive Keyhole. This is absurd this is about a Stephen blasphemy as you can commit but it it erupts from sitting in a room reading the Bible all day instead of making religion.

An actual communal endeavor and what are you going to do more of are you going to. Do more feast days and processions as somebody in the city or are you going to do more business where you have to treat people as strangers not as brothers in Christ okay. I'm debating whether I should just go long today or postpone this because I've already done an hour. I feel like I got across some Salient things yeah. What do you think folks what do we think all right well. I probably won't go too long and honestly there's not much to say so.

The second half of the book is pretty anticlimactic because the first half is like okay. Here's the Chinese State built up post from the um the the Ching to to to Xi Jinping or yeah. It's like what does this state. What is the state capable of is it capable of it doesn't represent a challenge to global us-based capitalism. Can it represent an alternative to it and the answer is No not at all are you crazy what is wrong with you. Why would you even think that I have to say the tone of the second half is very much d because he starts from the premise from the from the World Systems. Wallenstein origi premise that socialism wherever it emerged as a as a mode of production. in the 20th century was not a separate system from capitalism but a subsistent a bus um a a system within the greater machine of capitalism and I think that is 100 correct by the way you want to come. At that you can I don't agree to me that seems Beyond debate. At this point. I understand why people want to believe that these states existed as like genuine different different operated anyway as like and the thing is culturally they did operate as an alternative but again at the deeper level. They are component pieces which means over time.

Their economies are shaped by the reality of competing against other capitalist States. The USSR was broken by this contradictions that had accumulated by that point but the fresher younger CCP which is built on a nationalist struggle as opposed to the Russian Revolution which was specifically anti-nationalist and character and remember nationalism is what comes bubbling up first for modernity way before you get to socialism. It's nationalism so that nationalism was was born under the conditions of capitalism in with Russian characteristics emerging in the Soviet Union so that means that when the crisis comes it Crystal candelabra getting shot down by a by a Ranchero but in China where there is this unifying National struggle that undergirds the state ideology. There is sufficient legitimacy to impose a well legitimacy and here's the important part capacity to really adapt and it's not just that they have this nationalist myth to fall back on. It's that because of that the state the Chinese State. The Communist Party state has a done things with that legitimacy. Some of those things were bad and disastrous but also kind of necessary because you've got to shake the dew off the peasant. Lily to make modernity. This is an undeniable fact and honestly people should be more more acceptable accepting of the Wallace thing because it really does take the Soviets and the Chinese off the hook. A little bit like that they thought socialism in one country was possible. They were wrong that they thought it and they acted like it and the thing is they were building capitalism without knowing it or at least building. An inevitable road to a crisis that would create either capitalism or an Annihilation and Russia basically got a little bit of both China though because it should do off the peasant Lily but then with the cultural revolution sort of pivot and and cleansed itself of its guilt for that like. If you look at the great Terror you can look at the great care in a number of ways. One way that I think is useful is to look at the great terror is the great Terror was the not so much it was yes Stalin's individual paranoia that is true but only to an extent. His paranoia was being buoyed forward and and allowed to learn rampant by a general desire and in Coheed desire within the Bolshevik party to punish itself for what it had done Dale thought it was necessary. They all thought that the that's that starving all those peasants was necessary for the greater project and they and they felt that the results prove that look look at the industrial capacity. We're building look at what we're doing. We're creating a viable alternative to the West here without bare hands every day. Yes people are dying blah blah blah but we're doing it and we're doing it. They're doing it right in front of our face though and they're we're doing it to people who we consider comrades.

The the British did the same thing but they did it to people who they didn't consider people. So they never sweated it for a minute. They had already pre-washed their minds of any guilt associated with that. So there's no political purges. There's no political violence at the heart of the British Empire and we get to call it free because of that. Because of the untroubled consciousness of its Bourgeois and ruling class oh congratulations. You are actual reptiles that's why they're the most reptilian country now in Russia. Though because this they had taken power they thought they were going to get a World Revolution. They didn't but they've taken power and they're holding the reins of history. Now what are they going to do with it. They want to bring about the Socialist Utopia they really do because it validates everything else about them. The way the idea of Heaven validated everything that the medieval lords did and they're closer to the truth here because we've gotten to the root. We've gotten to class. We've gotten to the creation of a real Consciousness capable of being the godhead of actually being God but what that means is when you kill all the peasants to make modernity. You did it. The market didn't do it. God didn't do it by making them Brown. You did it that guilt had to go somewhere and sure Stalin made people paranoid but they wanted someone. They wanted someone to pay for it to pay for what they had done because they felt bad about it even though they felt like it had to happen so if that's the case it had to happen but it was wrong then if someone needs to pay by definition. It's not me. I was the one who made it good. I was the one who contributed to the good part of it. Oh the bad part I can imagine being somebody else's fault and I could point to them and even if I know there's no Trotsky records. Even though I know that there's that's all made up. I can still feel better about myself. There has to be this like coming to Reckoning with the reality of making modernity and a socialist polity does it publicly ritually and that's what makes it illiberal and horrible according to Martin Amos but it's also the evidence of its Collective morality. The lack of that violence in the centers of the West is proof of its amorality the proof that it's made by monsters the U.S God bless it. It showed it had a heart because it had a civil war you know but then after the Civil War was determined okay. We will now make more concentrate the pain of modernity before it was going to get all over the place. We're going to concentrate it more on black slaves and white Irish and we're going to let the fact that we're doing it to one scare the other ones and enrage the other ones into a a political alliance with capital that will cut its own throat and now we're headed towards another ritual of violence because we can't contain the contradictions and we can't give out the treats we gotta find someone to blame and so the so the cultural revolution is that in China it's it's 30 million. People died in like two years from 58 to 61 two or three years that the the old thing you see in like a like an old movie or a like black and white sitcom. I'm trying to get the kid to eat. They'll say they're starving people in China. Before people said Africa. They said China and that's because of the Great Leap Forward so he said the Soviets were dealt with an impossible hand.

I'm saying that see why this is what I don't understand. I'm literally saying they were dealt with an impossible hand. If they wanted to stay in power. They had to do that why do they have to stay in power because they had convinced themselves that they were the center of socialism and they weren't socialism is everywhere socialism needs to press everywhere yes. It needs a material base but one that builds the Charnel House of capitalism cannot be that one again how are they going to reason any differently people on the periphery freaks like like Trotsky didn't but he was too much of a. His problem was that he couldn't believe in anything he couldn't make any short of faithful choice and that paralyzed him and that's where we all find ourselves which is why everybody's spiritually Trotsky even if they hate trotskys why they hate him because they're looking in the mirror because you're queasy with what has to be done. The Georgian Thug wasn't queasy about anything because he was the Georgian Thug but the party was not Georgian thugs. The party was people in the middle of this of of of of their Humanity people. The middle of everybody people with hearts they needed to make sense of it. It's like they need to make sense of killing 30 million peasants in the 50s and so then there's a cycle of a purge of that guilt and then the generation that has purchased that but in building that state with the death in the 50s Mao creates the structures that capitalism in China will emerge from the state-owned Enterprises and also the healthy rural population that will then work in those state-owned Enterprises that Deng is able to operate after the cultural revolution which means that when the bill comes due in this in the 80s really in the 70s but in the Soviet Union it was put off a little bit by the fact they were a oil exporting Nation but by the 80s it's hit hard in both places. They respond in different ways because you know the anti-nationalists who buy after the Civil War or I'm sorry. After World War II ended up having to reformulate a New Nationalism the great Great Patriotic War nationalism in order to make sense of that because you couldn't use socialism anymore. It had been belief that it had been extinguished by the conflict by the blood by the monstrosity. China built these State Enterprises and because it did not have the centrifugal force to pull away from it which is what happened with the Soviets. All of their peripheral parts that helped feed blood to the heart we're being we're pulling away. There was none of that in China what they did instead is this is in the fourth chapter The the the central state starts sending out starts setting up these state-owned Enterprises in the regions and then local bureaucratic Elite take them over and and they get incredibly sweet deals on sweet on loans from the State Bank. They're just giving everybody loans and they use those loans to build these big unprofitable state-owned Enterprises but that pers further belief in the state because now the state is actually responsible for giving people.

Things like jobs in these new Industries people are rising up they're connecting to the and greater accelerating capitalism in this in in China but of course it also creates what we talked about last week. It creates a vast amount of inequality within China and this so the fourth chapter is pretty interesting. So fourth chapter is It takes the question of did China really was is China really the reason that we that there has been any progress on global inequality. That's because people want to say people who love capitalism like to point out. Oh Global. poverty has dropped in the 20th century and the response to that is that's pretty much all in China and so this this chapter says oh so how much did. China actually contribute to World um um inequality and he points out that there's two forces at work and that's the thing all of these questions have within them. These dialectical relationships and and so with China you have the fact that so China it gets more per capita income like people have more in income relative to the global mean in China so that means that global inequality goes down. But within China there is places that get more funding and more um development in places that get less and the rural places get less. The the this is. This is a slow motion version of what happened to the 30s in Russia but now in these autonomous state-owned Enterprises that make profit and are getting foreign direct investment but they're unequally distributed so you have this inequality within China that is increasing and once China gets to a point where it's above a the global middle firm economy once it becomes an above average wealthy Nation all of a sudden. Any further inequality change in China makes the global inequality greater and also like China in some respects empowers um developing nations by being able to sort of negotiate on their behalf in things like the WTO and the IMF. Like for example. there was talk in the bush years of getting developing countries to finally scrap their agricultural subsidies which is something that the Washington consensus demands but China has held up any agreement along those lines by insisting that that core countries like Europe and the United States they have to get rid of their agricultural subsidies first and also and that just scraps it because that's not happening. Those are two powerful constituencies. so he goes through the evidence says in some ways so that's one way that it helps them but also you know it contributes to the tribute economy of the American Empire. It contributes through its purchase of U.S bonds by American Military hegemony that you know enforces like raw export models that undermine local the robustness of like local industrial economies and therefore makes them you know less powerful in negotiating with the developed countries. So it's it's a push and pull on the on the whole. He comes down on saying it probably broadly has China has been has reduced global inequality but while helping contribute to the system that is you know perpetuating inequality everywhere and therefore in some respects and in some other places. Distributing that pain basically because you can't have just development. It's coming somewhere at someone's expense at some area. Some part of our ecological and biological Matrix is paying for it and the more it pays somewhere the more unstable. The relationship there to the center becomes and then you get full destabilization.

So the fifth chapter is about whether or not China represents a real difference. The difference political economy than the Western American capitalism that it you know trades with and he basically says no. The United States and China have a totally symbiotic relationship the U.S pumps up credit and borrows money in order to pop up credit to you know buy our arms and maintain our military. Supremacy allow our Reserve currency or our currency to be the world. Reserve currency. impose the actual like sinews of the world supply chain Empire and in return China suppresses consumption in their country They they take the debt. they make the stuff or assemble the stuff and they keep consumption at the household level low because in this dynamic it one part of it is over consuming. The other part must under consume so that's the relationship to China and the United States have and the reason that's able to persist is because of the differing political systems the United States. Yes like they broke they they suppress wages too like the United States. Government has been suppressing wages for as long as the Chinese have But the difference is is that we have extended credit to allow for consumption to balloon. China does not do that they keep the wages low but there is no concomitant easy credit so consumption stays low and on the other side U.S consumption is up that ebb and flow that's that's not that is that cannot change If we don't change structurally and one of the big reasons that he insists that there will not be some Chinese Century that like dominates the globe and changes. Global capitalism is the only way that the U.S that the Chinese economy can persist in the long run without some coming down from like a significant internal crisis. Just like the US is is if it recalibrates this relationship because if it's unstable in one direction for too long like with any capitalist system any extractive system. The second law of Thermodynamics kicks in and you are getting less out of more effort and the only way to change that is to reintroduce movement in the system and that means Chinese consuming more and this is crucial. Americans consuming less like I said America our political system means we can agree together to keep wages low but since we've defined self-expression by consumption we're going to have to offer them the possibility of consuming and so whoever is in charge. The other top side that wants more power for their own membership can just say we'll give you more consumption and then they'll vote for you. So there there's this pressure to keep things in a relationship even if it totally industrializes in The American economy tears the heart of the Midwest. It's the only way to stay in power in China because they kept the party state that there's over for that desire to go no constituency. Pat is there to say hey we're the alternative who will let you consume so. They keep it down and those things aren't changing and if those things don't change then the crisis will happen because they're they cannot reform internally. That is I think the the key insight into this crisis stuff is that they cannot internally change because the people who stand it up structure it to pers keep their Elite status perpetual and once they do that it means that in the future when conditions change and they need to change with them they can't do it. They can't see the necessity they see it through a ideological buffer that just makes them double down on what they're doing so yeah. That's his big. that's kind of the big chapter in terms of his argument is saying in the U.S and the Chinese economies are totally interdependent at the level where neither side can independently reorient their economies. the the Chinese and here's the real thing. The really harbingers poorly is that let's say the Chinese were able to Let's say America was able to come to a point where we're actually voluntarily consuming less where our political system allows us to consume us.

Now this is I think what like the fascist imagine they're going to do. I think that the America First like the real intellectual Mega dumbasses the the dummies. The smartest dummies think they can do is. They'll seize control the government and then by instituting all those awesome values. They love the Epic American masculinity values. They love the the hierarchy that they worship. People will voluntarily consume less because now they have purpose but what they have failed to Notice is that the very things that they're trying to reify are consumer choices. It is you are giving me the freedom to express my identity but it is not my identity as a member of the German folk. It is a member at the end of history at the end of the the the pringleification process. The Peasants are pushed to pushed through over time that becomes the marks of a consumer cycle. So you you will only enshrine a consumer fascism that will destroy itself. It's going. To have to go to war to try to push out boundaries because that's the only way that any class Society and a consumer-based society where consumption is identity and consumption is freedom.

It's by definition class based because you're fighting over Surplus extracted not through a collective Endeavor but through individual immiseration so the Chinese owned a ton of our stock of our treasury bills because it's a it's it's the closest thing to ready money. It's the closest thing to fully convertible and and guaranteed American dollars which is the safest investment why because of the military. So that's why we get to work our things out erratically instead of having it imposed like instead of something heavy coming into our like neurotic political arguments and saying knock that off we get to have these breakdowns in public because we have the guns so One Way Or Another. We're going to keep consuming our model will be consumption so the nukes drop so that means that they cannot even move the lever in China but say they could say they could say something happened in America that led them led Americans to consume less voluntarily or maybe not available but not so many that you know. A crucial block is knocked out of the global order because if that happens then you're back to localized power just like after the Roman Empire and you can't really talk about global capitalism anymore. You can't talk about global anything anymore um and we're talking about can China like avoid this and transcend this. That's that's what the open question is But that would mean they have to consume more and my God.

What is China consuming more look like what is look. How America consuming more looks like what does China consume consider something that Hawaii points out in this book one of the marks. So it's one of the marks of increased um prosperity and the rising of a middle class in China is sure automobile per purchasing but also meat consumption meat used to be the reserve of the aristocrats in Europe. For example the diet of a peasant was almost entirely grains some like fruits and vegetables from foraging and stuff but mostly like a starch. and meat was for rare occasions and harvest festivals and stuff. Whereas the diet of aristocrats was basically exclusively meat it was almost entirely meat. This is the public ritual of surplus destruction and consumption that we're talking about that reifies power so what does that mean what does China eating more meat mean my God. Like yes there are technological fixes theoretically to a lot of these issues but they're not happening fast enough. It is. It's clear that we're past the point where we need to collectively put the brakes on. But we can't everybody has because we have a brick put on the The accelerator everybody has a brick on the accelerator including China yeah like Matt.

Iglesias's book is basically this but he says hit the hit hit the thing even harder but of course what's dumb about him is he doesn't understand. It's already at the. these courtiers their entire thing is seeing what's happening and explaining afterwards why it's good and it's okay. It's fine. It's fine actually don't worry about it. That is the message always don't worry about it. That is the Eternal message of the glacier eye of the world don't worry about it. Hey what about this fraudulent crypto guy trying to buy the entire Democratic party don't worry about it. He is an effective altruist. His parents were consequentialist moral philosophers. So it's like hey look at this Dynamic. That's going to eat the world Matt. Oh we just need more Americans because of our can-do spirit and Ingenuity we'll solve all these big problems now more likely it'll crack up. But what does that look like that's the big question and I think this book helps me further believe that it will be as it always is. It'll be a breakdown power will not go away though the apocalypse that we imagine will not be. There. There will just be zones of exclusion like I said the apocalypse already exists. It's a mile from my house. The apocalypse exists. It's called Skid Row California Skid Row Los Angeles. That is that's it you want to know what the apocalypse is. There. It is you can go look at it. You can walk. There you can go and help people there or you. You can block at them. That's there.

It's a little display item for the Apocalypse and it'll just be a process of of capital retreating to readouts of power everywhere and a guy like Iglesias thinks I'm going to always be in the center so it'll be okay as long as I can explain why it's okay. So he at the end is the same as the fascists. It's the same as the Estates who say democracy. Let's do turbo techno feudalism and I want to be deciding who I get to watch through the CCV camera as they're doing the drone strikes at the border and I get to call it an epic. Iglesias is wanting the same thing he's just going to be. He's going to think all that stuff's horrible but my God if you could just see the green shoots here on the the Terminator Grand execution Council you know the the blood council is coming up with some amazing new fixes for the tyrannical regime of Occupational Licensing in American middle City inner cities so all of their job is to tell you all as well because the people they talk to you know if they all did say no it would be a problem and there are people who are excited by that idea and the people were terrified by it and I really gotta make people like confront. If you're really scared of the thing breaking down like are you scared of being a miserated or are you scared of having to watch more miseration and if the answer is to watch more miseration that means you have the power to not do that you know it just means changing your relationship to what feels good and it really is. It is like now we have a politics that's entirely labidinal. But it's entirely based on selfish individual pleasure.

Nor short term give me something to give me dopamine to get me through the day which is outrage which is self-righteousness which is fantasies of domination and then there's the hard work of politics that we make that that has a lot of tedium around it but also has moments of real connection and meaning and that cumulatively is what defines politics and that is what we all have to redefine if we're going to approach what's coming for any of us and what we have to deal with every day with a sense of presence and purpose okay. So the last chapter is about the coming crisis and how is China going to be able to change it and I kind of already went over that because that's the chapter where he says the only way that China is able to even Stave off a significant and state legitimacy and periling crisis is if it does this rebalancing towards consumers um consumption which is why he says they have to liberalize politically because that will provide pressure to make people be able to consume more. But of course you know that's just deepening the trench that's just accelerating everything like that is that is the accelerationist Nick landian thing is yeah. This is good crashing into at a bridge abutment in a Lamborghini is the best way to go. I simply say the underlying premise. There is again of the terror of repose the terror of of Stillness because of the presence of guilt but if guilt can be made transparent by awareness of the love that is expressed first to the self through forgiveness and then outward to all and that's happening and it will continue to happen and everybody will be saved even if they fall through the cracks.

That's what I believe there's no decision that's wrong in the full fullness. But here's the thing the reality of that. This is what Luther thought that compels you towards that compels you towards the right thing to do because without consequences. Then what is the thing to do the thing to do what makes you feel best is to feel love. That is the thing that feels best all other feelings that we might enjoy are just attempts to um to make up for and patch up a lack of love. But it doesn't work. You ask why you need more and more that's why you'll dig your own grave so like this feels like a moment of suspension but those moments are where you are. You have the if you have the possibility and not everyone does because like you said I'm in one relationship to reality because I don't have to do a lot of unpleasant things. If I don't want to like physically unpleasant like demanding. I don't have a boss so it's like that's why I am still motivated by the sphere of falling from this thing. I become addicted to but I also don't move frantically to try to shore it up. I don't move to a compound because I don't want to do anything that is motivated by a false reification of consequences that don't exist and that is that's the Aubry McClendon Nick land thing is good old neon like. If if I cannot imagine reunion I will make it happen through action. I will I will negate all of those paralyzing questions by creating the one undeniable act we can ever do which is to end it on our own terms and then by ending in our own terms. We we are reconciled like moths hitting flame but in the process what are we doing what are we leaving in our wake by doing that and that's that's that question is what chases us to that point that question. is what drives the pedal to the metal but if it's if there's no one really chasing you.

Then there's no reason to to to annihilate yourself so yeah. I sit here I do my work such as it is which is very pleasurable to me intellectually stimulating and I get to be with people that I I love and I get to do things that make me feel like. I'm making other people's lives better in the personal sense like you know reaching my hand out when I can and there's that churn that's like what else what if this is it. But you know. I think the key is just being able to reconcile yourself to where you are in every given moment of your life and the thing is you will lose track all the time holding on to it is impossible. The way is not the way but every moment has the potential to be a moment of reflection where whatever amount of string you've pulled in you'll be able to drop and that that is the wiping of the slight and that is like confession was horrible. Was was was reviled by the lutherans because like it's another scam service of the church that you don't need. But the cycle of being able to repent is Meaningful a cycle of repentance because we're always moving through space and time and encountering it and and losing our bearings but coming back is easy if we know that forgiveness exists.

So I got off the track a lot but that's the that's the review of the book and I would be open to reading something else. That's more bullish on China as alternative. But it would have to be very focused on ji's regime in specific particular because the general Trend that he sketches of the Chinese political economy up until she because the kind it's kind of a little dated at this point. Especially considering all the stuff that's happened in the relatively recent past you know the acceleration. He talks about Belton Road being initiated and you know. It's really accelerated in the years since he wrote it so I'd be interested in seeing that I'm not going to read the governance of China. No thank you But I I can't escape the belief that China is fully implicated in a global machine. Like it. It still has no underlying logic outside of development through the channels that are at it the control of the specific constellation of Elites that make it up and that's what they're doing. Now there is this like refreshing and renewal coming from below and you're seeing you know some executions of of Finance theaters and stuff. But since China cannot quit the US dollar and this is a key thing without cutting their own throats. They cannot build an alternative to the global U.S capitalist system. What is what is the response to this. If anyone has one I'd be interested in it in order for China to call the shots in a meaningful way right. Let's take this as a syllogism they would have to be the world Reserve currency right. They would have to have the world Reserve currency. They would have to have control effective control of the world Reserve currency but in order to do that they would have to get rid of the capital controls in their money market and if they do that that is the death warrant of the Communist Party of China as an independent. Power Repository. So okay you've done it you're now in charge.

You just you can only persist in the model that the US has created you can only deepen it as the U.S did to the the system that that the British created so if anyone has an answer to that or a book that or an article. Honestly an article would be nice but yeah something that just takes into account ji's attempt to reassert party control and how it's going to deal with just that fundamental contradiction at the financial level. But again people are like they don't like when you say that because they need someone to come in and save the world they need somebody to keep this global system going and when I keep saying when I keep trying to emphasize is that whether it collapses or not the future is not within its walls. The future is going to be built by the people who are being sharpened by necessity but and what necessity means when you are bereft of the technological. Matrix that we've all embedded ourselves in is each other. That's all we got man in order to have the Chinese take over. They would have to be able to coordinate all of these Global capitalist economies from a center and coordinate their actions through policies that would redistribute dramatically resources from the West and North to the South. There is no constellation of power outside of China that would accede to that without just going to the final without sweeping over the negotiating table and going to war what leverage could China have to enforce any kind of changes to the political economy outside of themselves that redistribute in that direction. What we're talking about is how do you make voluntary reduction of consumption in the West. That is the challenge if anyone has any work that argues that chairman G is up to the challenge of peacefully because if they resist then the game's over right we get that that resolves the nuclear war that's over short of that you're talking about a to one degree or another peaceful sure. There will be social deferment in specific countries but there will not be an apocalyptic confrontation peaceful transition more or less of consumption from the West to the periphery not as consumption. This is the key thing but as development as as resource development or I'm sorry as as Industrial Development not just producing stuff for the market but producing stuff to essentially re-terriform the planet basically reducing consumption everywhere and redirecting resources to yeah re-terrraforming the planet now that is a that's a thing that could happen and I feel like the larouches as much of crackpots that they are.

They at least recognize that like even though they're trapped in the same nationalist miasma as every other American political current and that makes them blows them off course. their essential recognition that you would need some sort of global infrastructure project. A globalized Bolton Road to manage the coming crisis is correct. The reason they look like crackpots is because that's impossible but that's not because they're crazy. It's not because they're crazy to think that's what a thing we should do. They're crazy to think it's a thing we could do but that honestly makes everybody who's still invested in Politics at like the national level also even more delusional because if the plural land bridge and Global Belton Road is is impossible what the are you doing caring about who becomes president so it's like you have to reckon with the larouches because they have they see the outlines of any viable future for the human civilization as we understand it and want to keep it and you got to reckon with that and say well what now and to me the thing that allows me to live with that reality is the knowledge that the the green shoots will be appearing elsewhere and also that the larouche project is doomed because the fact that that is the initial reaction of everyone who has not been deeply indoctrinated into a specific esoteric. Internet-based heuristic of the universe tells you everything you need to know because the distance from reality is clear to see if you are not motivated otherwise but that's true of other things through different lenses like I said the iglesi are just as delusional as the larouches. But because their delusion is more widely shared and generated in the media and necessary and generative of the media it gets to be called normal but it's just as wacky man okay if the Chinese if the Chinese do do cold fusion. Then all bets are off obviously like that but the thing is that's that is the Black Swan that everyone is sort of depending on and Elon Musk represents it in human form. Elon. Musk's entire scam was predicated on on absorbing the necessary social belief.

In this rationalized Messiah like the the Messiah as technology rather than as you know a human Spiritual Awakening which is the end result of the Dead machine that we worship ripping itself. Free of humanity and becoming all-powerful and musk is like it's human carapace and now it's cracking because the the fantasy is losing its ability to be sustained at every level. Though the scales are falling but in what direction how will people respond. We're terrified and that's and that and that little visual in in on Twitter was a representation of that we're terrified and we want to be delivered and the the the the the musk worshipers the dead. Enders are the ones who said no like he's. The God is Not failed. We can still do this but the people who don't believe in him are despairing are even more despairing because there's they haven't replaced it with anything. There's just this hope that something will emerge and that's kind of why I think Twitter isn't going anywhere because that's such a powerful load-bearing structure of the attention economy that more than delivering any specific discrete message which is what people get too focused on when we talk about Twitter as a propaganda machine. It's the structure itself that is propagandistic. But it is. It's a vacuum that I don't think can last it has to be felt because we are too distant from one another to put that newly Unleashed energy to better use not individually not. We're all not doomed to that as a group we will tend to the center of us find another thing to do because the center of us is hollow because the center of us has been hollowed out and it's not our fault and we will not be punished for it. We will not be eternally doomed for it. We will learn we will all learn every lesson we needed to okay I feel like we got somewhere with this one feel like this was very productive. I hope it wasn't too robot sounding all right feeling good in the neighborhood. All right I will switch mics for the next one just to see if that helps all right talk to everybody later. I'm gonna go make some soup.
