The legend lives on from the chipotle down and the big lake. They call you chico me like it is of november and gloomy at the end of it with a load about or 26 000 tons more than the edmond fitzgerald with empty the wreck of the memphis gerald. That's indigenous midwest culture right. There admit fitzgerald down in lake michigan might not be terribly long today. I might not go the whole hour just warning you depending on how how it goes but I wanted to show the flag today since we only have a few days left of the trump residency. I feel like I gotta put out as much content as possible since you know we're going to be entering the biden zone soon which man it's going to be weird.

At this point. Having trump not be. President is going to be very odd because how is the press the media press I sound like a 90. The media how's the media going to deal with that because like they've all clearly decided at the top level that this guy is a threat to democracy. They've cut him off from twitter but are they gonna be able to maintain that that unified face in resisting the urge to just cover him like he's still president because my god who wouldn't want to I mean you're gonna have otherwise what you're gonna have joe biden sitting in a rocking chair like grandpa sawyer and break that's not gonna be fun the inaugural. I can't wait for that speech that's going to be a good sign of how much fun we're going to have is how good that speech is how much one how much gibberish the problem is is that he's been pretty good on on prompter. Lately he was good at the convention.

I'm assuming at this point that they do have a special suppository or something that they give him that adrenochrome and. They have to put him in a sensory deprivation chamber for 12 hours to minimize over stimulation. Otherwise his brain will just completely implode it'll be fun though you know we'll we'll find. We'll make it fun. If we'll make it fun damn. It. We'll make this guy fun too this. I mean he's he is by far the most mentally out there out of their president. Since the like second term reagan got to be some humor. There got to be some hijinks new radical song that's not a good one to me that's not a good 90s song to me. I'm sorry um sex and candy. These are the 90s one hit wonders where I wonder how. I wonder how the hell they ever became hits in the first place because there's plenty of 1-8 wonders that are intuitive to me oh. I get why the macarena was a big hit. There's a periodic craving for a big a dance number big dance song people can do together but why the hell I'm too sexy. I get why that was fun and popular. I mean if you know it's. It's. It's fun if nothing else.

But what the hell is going on with some of these songs not a fan steal my song song. Still my sunshine is not a bad song. It's a fine 90s song certainly in the bucket of 90s. One hit wonders where I totally get why they were hits dude old town road somebody's talking about old town road. Old town road is weird in that it's almost less a one-hit wonder than a old timey um novelty song which is a genre that has largely disappeared completely oh god how bizarre. I hated that one that guy's voice was so whiny why who liked that oh my god l-a-f-o-l-e lfo or whatever it was girls of summer a terrible terrible song. I get why it was popular though that was one. I don't like but I get why it was popular some of them. I don't like and I don't understand how anyone could like them. But I definitely got why. I mean they were a boy band boy. Bands were popular.

Oh man somebody mentions alien ant farm. I was thinking about this. The other week how much worse is it being. What's worse what's all right. I mean first of all. There's a question. If you're a musician is it better to have been a failure or a grinder or something or to become a one-hit wonder where you get one a little moment in the sun and then you're a punchline. Is it worth it. I mean in past generations but monetarily it definitely would because in the old cd and album era. I think if you had one significant hit you were going to make enough money there. If you didn't you know do what mc hammer did and buy a bunch of race horses and solid gold pants you'd be sitting pretty but you know you'd still be now. I don't even know if you get that but there's got to be a special sort of sadness that comes with being a one-hit wonder where the one hit was a cover like alien ant farm.

Their big hit was a cover of smooth criminal. Also in the 90s urge overkill from the pulp fiction soundtrack had a big hit that was a cover of neil diamond's girl. You'll be a woman soon and not only does that sting from a from a monetary perspective because you've got to split royalties but you don't even get to be known for a song you wrote you wrote a bunch of songs you're probably proud of and nobody's ever heard them. At least the one hit wonder can say hey people heard a song. I wrote and they sang along to it and they liked it. You just put some rock guitar instrumentation behind a michael jackson song that's gotta suck. I mean it's certainly a case like that some of them. The one that wonder is more popular version of the song that was covered in which case you sort of are the winner there no matter what but nobody's gonna forget showed up with guitars. A bunch of alien and far people died in a plane crash. I did not hear that my god horrifying no one's going to make me understand who ariel pink is you can't do it. I refuse you can't make me find out who let the dogs out was a cover probably but there's no way that anybody did it as well as baja man. I refuse to believe it. They took every potential from that song and wrung it out.

[08:09](https://youtu.be/bNNmkXVbd7A?t=08m09s)

Don't let the dogs yeah even mitt. Romney had heard who let the bugs out one of the greatest politician moments of all time. Something you couldn't script start shirt white mormon reading a bunch of black people and just immediately going who are the dogs out who yeah. I got nothing today kind of waiting to see what happens on inauguration day honestly pretty excited about it I'm predicting one thing massive overwhelming national guard presence and what else is happening at the same time. Everybody who idiotically filmed themselves in the capital is getting arrested by the fbi. Some of them are tick-tocking filming them tick-tock filming themselves turning themselves into the fbi which and those two things make it seem like they are in fact bringing down the hammer to let people know all right. We're all having fun with this and you guys are useful to a degree but you are not um. You're not calling the rodeo you're not calling the tune. The piper calls the tune and you don't got the scratch.

You are a bunch of atomized streamers and real estate agents and a small engine repair company owners and parts distributors and you are not a coherent political force that can upend our very very useful democratic structures. I'm not saying that they're august or virtuous. I'm not saying that there's anything sacred about them. They are useful to power so they're not going to be turned over to these yahoos because because they believe everything they see on the internet including that donald trump is anything other than a complete. Fraud.

I mean the the reason they all did that is because they thought they were being told by the president to do it and that he was going to then use their actions as a part of a plan to take power and he didn't have one he just went home and watched tv. He told him he was going to march with them and then all these idiots filmed themselves because why wouldn't they that this is the this is the overthrow of the old regime. This is like why wouldn't you have filmed yourself breaking into the the american embassy in tehran or or stasi headquarters. After the fall of the berlin wall. It turns out oh yeah. No everything you think you believe is. And I think that a lot of these people are going to go back to posting. Some of them are going to become apolitical and get into really weird. And if that happens I'm down. I want to hear about what that what that is and then some of them are going to probably get get violent.

But they're not going to be any match for the state. Although now you've got The democrats terrified that some of the somebody in the in the national guard is going to kill biden because they know that this is a huge. There's a huge percentage of people in this country including disproportionately white males in positions like the military who even if they aren't cube. Believers are broadly sympathetic to the idea that trump is better than biden and that probably even that they stole the election from them how much what are they going to do about it. What are they prepared to do about it. And we'll see won't we one that where one thing we can all say is that everything is going fine and there's no problems whatsoever we can all relax. I mean that's what's so funny about the people who insist on you being upset or you personally showing some sort of fear of fascism.

It's to say that your particular pet fantasy is not based in reality is not to insist inherently that things are good or sustainable. That sure is not true. I do realize though that there is a real congruity between republicans under obama who would insist that obama say the words islamic terrorism and people telling me that I need to say fascism and the only difference is at least the republicans were asking you know the president of the united states to do it and not a podcaster but the underwriting logic is exactly the same. The under guiding logic is is that if enough people hear the bad scary word they will with the republicans. It's agree with us on you know a policy and with the fascist thing in practice. It's the same deal. It's agree with democrats around a policy and I cannot.

I'm not going to sign up for anything. That does that because the democrats have nothing good to offer anyone just they are people. It's amazing the number of people who insist that they're like look. I'm as left as anybody. I understand the democrats are bad but you know strategically supporting them for x y and z one. They don't care about your help really. You're just some. On the internet you don't really have any power and two everything terrible that you're worried about happening all of the the the ratchet of nationalist and white supremacist violence and and cult-like savagery and like an unrestrained police state that's all that they are encouraging at every step because they are locked in the death spiral the ma extraction and and mitigating any attempt and any mitigating any popular opposition to a program of austerity. I mean that's what both parties do. They pitch it to different audiences but they both exist to predict project a alternative to what people don't like and then they believe naively or desperately that that's what they're gonna get. When really what they're going to get is a bipartisan collaboration to bring about worsening conditions for everybody. I mean it's going to be worse and they're both going to make it happen and the anti-fascist agenda that you're supposed to be signing up for in practice is just defending the democratic party as they create what a domestic terror organization a new intelligence agency staffed with like the the kids from captain planet who aren't gonna be see. No.

[16:03](https://youtu.be/bNNmkXVbd7A?t=16m03s)

This isn't like an evil unaccountable um repressive state institution. Like in the past. This one is has a staff of diverse millennials. It's like the burger king kids club. Here's a kid in a wheelchair here's a blackhead. Here's the latina. These guys possibly couldn't abuse their power and try to suppress resistance to neoliberal hell. No so if that's what the whole point of it is and that is it. It's that's that's what that's what everybody. Everyone is disingenuously arguing for either because they've convinced themselves because they're too addicted to fear and too addicted to to the idea that they're in a cataclysmic moment in history where they could be defined by their resistance to evil in the form of posts or they really just want people to shut the up and let biden do his job and this is a good way to go about that it's a good rhetorical cultural. I saw eric levitz claim broadly claim explicitly. The whole point of the fascism. Thing is to get people to not like them.

It's a it's a It's a messaging tool but who are you messaging. The only people who care about these terms are people who are already in your discourse bubble. They're already they're already sorted you're not bringing any new people into the fold you're not convincing any new people that's really what what people seem to be unwilling to accept probably because it shows how a functionalist they are how unable they are to do anything meaningful other than just fill. A role is that our political discourse is pitched to the same group of of people who who consume political media and vote and that is a relatively stable pool of people whose opinions are made up the only way that you're going to break the dynamic. We have now the only reason the way you're going to destroy the republican party the way that so many liberal leftists demand is if you radically change the the the demographic and size of the political subject in this country.

Corey robin has been 100 right about this the whole way a long way by the way got it. I was I said this on a previous stream but robin has gotten the trump thing way better than a lot of other intellectuals who you'd think would be able to see what was in front of them but but you know are blinded by the same spectacular politics that ensorcel as I left like to say all of us so give him credit for holding strong one thing that one element of fascism that is totally absent in the current variety and I don't think anyone even argues. Otherwise is the territorial expansionism and you can say oh you know sort r saber rattling with iran or increasing bombings in yemen or somalia that's all terrible.

But it's mostly part of the machinery of or of of of of. It's it's maintaining the machinery of the empire we have and that's just it. We have already taken everything where is to expand and that's because fascism was the la the late piglets to the trough of colonialism. The places that went fascists were the countries that because italy and germany were the european countries that because they became modern polities the latest were able to access the spoils of empire last at which point most of it was already taken the monroe doctrine had shut. Western hemisphere to any kind of expansion and africa and china were carved up between the the british and the french how the stuff than the germans and the italians had and the thing that guys like mussolini and hitler realized is that in the in the world of the nation-state if you take as a premise nation-state competition as existential which europeans had for generations and which had been you know violently and horrifically and monstrously demonstrated in world war ii or I'm sorry world war one which was you know in many ways exacerbated by the colony the great game the colonial game um they saw oh.

We don't stand a chance in this contest the japanese military have the same epiphany. We don't stand a chance unless we can access some raw materials. If we can ex get some of those new markets going if we can reach that next higher stage a higher stage of capitalism that lenin talked about and the moral of horror that the allies saw that were able to provoke at the at the axis was essentially that they were doing that stuff or they wanted to do that stuff one in europe. At least hitler did. Germany did in the with the host plan where they were going to turn the ukraine into as a neo-feudal like a neo-feudal agricultural colony with like little communities of ss officers and their families as as colonial barons and then the the remaining slav population that hadn't been starved to death would be working in agricultural serfdom basically um so they did it to the wrong people and they did it. After The rest of the european empires had to a degree or another civilized themselves by virtue of time passing by virtue of success. There's nowhere to go now the the the myth is over.

[22:41](https://youtu.be/bNNmkXVbd7A?t=22m41s)

We're not creating political. There's no movement in america at least of all trumpism that is trying to create a a polity. I mean it's trying to create a national project and I think the reason that that matters and the reason it's not just is because it all goes to the question of well. What do you do about it which is the only question that actually matters right. Obviously. The academic definitions are meaningless. The question is what do you do about it and the the the reality of the the emotional reality of the factions of question is that what it means is what you do about it. One support the democrats in everything they do because they are our only alternative and because they are a meaningful anti-fascist force even though as I've said we're actually operating a system where both parties move the ball forward in tandem inching towards uninterruptedly and that they are like symbolically connected and that the democrats are as responsible as republicans are for the drift of things and so therefore supporting them obviously the degree that it's in any way you know effective is effectively helping everything get worse including the rise of whatever the hell kind of fascist demon you think is being conjured here and then otherwise if it's not that what is it punch nazis spectacles of violence. I don't that just seems like more more personal expression replacing political organizing or or posting a lot of it seems to be posting to try to get everybody to your level of anxiety and then make thinking that that will make people move forward and that might work if we had a situation where there was emerging in the land a a or a coherent nationalist movement to fill a a political space. But there's no space there's just a bunch of people milling around and people filling up carrying out individualized fantasies of violent redemption which is what we've been doing now for generations. And if that's the case then the implications are that the goal or the the um the goal needs to be.

The project needs to be building a left building a coherent expression of a class politics in order to challenge the democrats and republicans and by virtue of doing that challenge. This drift towards like white met white violent fantasy which is a real thing and is truly being ratcheted up and so if that's the case and I think it's true regardless of where you fall on any of the semantic questions the the need to fill the public space with real class politics is still in the set. The necessary goal regardless of anything if you take that fact and add to it. The fact that the the the lesson that many people seem to want to take from a a explanatory model that involves words like fascism and and stuff is is to just do more clinging to the coattails of the democratic party and hoping that they protect you from from the mean bad people. But they're all the same monsters and while they not the democrats might not be as as malicious they might not be as sadistic they might not be as racist.

They are as committed to the machines that produce not if not the feelings. Those feelings the willingness of people to act on them politically and personally god elon musk being the richest person in the world right now. I mean if whatever histories of the era like of the roaring 20s before the big collapse and I don't mean necessarily a collapse of like civil government but a economic correction which I think is inevitable. Just you know you you know who the hell knows when it's coming.

The fact that the richest guy on earth was someone who didn't really make anything who did not have any basis for his wealth that made sense in any intuitive way. Bill gates made computers. People bought the computers. Jeff bezos delivers things to you in computers and other computers. Also other products what does elon musk do. He makes like 10 000 shitty electric cars that cost a ton of money and kill you a year and and lies about building tunnels that are that that and says they're going to replace like mass transit and they're literally their their theme park rides and he doesn't even build them. I mean he's just he he games tax breaks and incentives in the green sector and and in space and stuff just to get his name out there and associate it with a vision of technological deliverance. From this moment that we live in and then exploits that to absurdly overvalued absurdly world. Historically overvalued stock. Nothing has ever been as overvalued as tesla. I know.

I'm not a bunch of an expert on this. But it's not. I don't think a lot of people would argue with that. I mean the underlying financials of that company are non-existent and what it is is the reason. This has happened one because we are in this gigantic bubble where the money is just swashing around. There's no there's nowhere to get profit.

[30:07](https://youtu.be/bNNmkXVbd7A?t=30m07s)

So everything is just pure speculation and also the fact that he has become the cultural avatar for for capitalism saving itself because everybody knows everybody can sense that this is all. In a bad trajectory unless you're a completely I mean unless you have your own fantasies of cue where we're all going to get eaten by reptiles and you're still and everybody is feeling apocalyptic whether you believe in global warming or not. But if you do believe the global warming is real. You do believe that we are going towards a condition of significant ecological crisis and and de ins instability. But because you are an american more than anything and you're ideologically struck your ideological understanding of the world is structured or especially if you're somebody who invests in the stock market and you have a literally vested interest in capitalism is maintaining itself. The conclusion you might draw from the crisis we're in of oh this system doesn't work is not appealing because you don't want to do away with the system. It does well for you and you have you have you also have faith in it ideological faith in it.

Elon. Musk is the figure who has embodied the notion that capitalism can fix itself through innovation and through through brilliance and and dedication all the all those stuff that has brought us all of the greatest technological innovations in history that will also solve the present crisis whatever. However form it takes whether it's energy or environment. It can all be ameliorated by brilliant menovision menovision mostly applying their brilliance to the the thorny technological questions because if you cannot accept that there is a fundamental problem with this the system that is producing these outcomes then the so. The only solutions you can accept are that something is broken within it and that that can be technologically fixed that there that that there is some sort of application of engineering somewhere along the line that can bring us back onto the beam and elon. Musk's pitch to the world is that he can do it. He's gonna get us all electric cars and batteries and underground tunnels that will soothe all of our social ills and buy us more time and people are willing to spend a lot of money to believe that and especially. Since at this point.

It's only an upside because the guy was on rick and morty for christ's sake and so the fact that you have this significance this overlapping series of deepening ecological and economic catastrophes and crises that are compounding one another across a global economic system and the richest person to um to emerge from the system that exists to create giant. Fortunes is this paper billionaire whose entire wealth is predicated on ludicrously overvalued stock that is entirely pumped up by pr stunts. Back room deals with a government and a worldwide self-delusion and need to believe in capitalism at the end of the day. We just have to believe because the alternative is too unthinkable and and musk is someone. You can actually believe in not just from the sidelines but from the position of a investor and consumer you can make it happen. You can buy a tesla you can buy. Tesla stock or you could go online and argue in people's comments about how he's a genius even though he today suggested that they build tunnels under miami which is in florida a state with a water table that is about three inches below the surface of the water of the of the earth and is entirely limestone. I mean just a a bimbo but and a and a classic carnival barker and it makes and it's perfectly fitting that he would be our avatar of global capitalism. This scam artist and then look who is the avatar now of trumpism in the absence of trump mike lindell.

The my pillow guy who is another perfect avatar of middle american petty bourgeois reaction I'm gonna see if I can find the quote but but rick pearlstein's first book before the storm the one about barry goldwater um features in the very beginning an extended description of this type of people who would make up the the first um generation of funders and organizers of the the right-wing reaction to the new deal consensus that emerged after world war ii so let me see if I can find this quote all right here it is this is from the very first chapter before the storm. The man unites imagine you live in a town of 20 or 50 or one hundred thousand souls in indiana perhaps or illinois or missouri or tennessee with a colonated red brick city hall and center a main street running. Its breath avenues rimmed with modern bungalows named for trees and exotic heroes and local luminaries interrupted at intervals by high steepled churches on the outskirts of town or factories. It is june 1959 and three shifts a day. They throw up great clouds of smoke churning out vast pools of cement cords of lumber spools of rolled steel machined parts of every size and description.

Although no one who doesn't have to would ever venture inside one of these factories. Local points locals point to them with pride because they are what make their little town prosper and because all over the world foundries use machine parts inscribed with the town's name imagine. You are the proprietor of one of these concerns your father founded it. Perhaps to start things. He catched a loan from the father of a man you bank with now probably by dent of their shared membership on any number of company boards and fraternal orders community chess and church committees. The bank let it slide when your father who had made sacrifices to expand his plant in the hopes that the town's grandchildren too might enjoy. Its fruits was late a time or two paying off a note you grew up reading the adventure novels in the kit mark tid series by clarence buddington keilan. An author prominent at the national republican party and your favorite was the story of a group of boys taking over a rundown sawmill and getting it to turn a profit up. Till then. A river didn't mean anything to me but a time thing to fish or swim in the narrator says but before I was many months older. I discovered that rivers weren't invented just for kids to monkey with nora yet to make a home for fish. They have their businesses just like anybody else and they're valuable just like any other business getting more valuable with more business they do calvin coolidge once said the man who built a factory builds a temple the man who works there worships. There you agree you like kelvin coolidge. By the time you took over the plant.

 the additions you built were too expensive to finance through any of the banks in your town which was now a small city more and more you found yourself trudging to new york hat in hand for money. New york after all controlled over a quarter of the nation's banking reserves. Your letter had soon bore an address in manhattan as well as the one in your town but it called you that it took what it took to get the wall street boys to take you seriously. You would work much harder than any of them. When they went. You went to college with them back east when the union rep come by just try to sign up your men. There are hundreds but you know most of them by name you told the workers stories of the sacrifices your father made for their fathers. You reminded them of the times you kept everyone on the payroll when business was slack of how you were always ready with an advance to help with a new baby or a sick mother. For 50 years. They seemed perfectly happy without a union but when fdr signed the wagner act the organizers came again. This time with a slogan. The president wants you to join a union a union came.

[39:19](https://youtu.be/bNNmkXVbd7A?t=39m19s)

This goes on for a while but I highly recommend anybody reading it and in it. He describes the small burgers the small bourgeois in in the nation's interior that were the original fonts of new anti-new deal reaction at the cultural level and how over time they became more influential as more people came to agree with them but they were at first very very limited in number because there weren't that many people who were feeling that the bet the deal was bad because that was the time of the great prosperity but as things got worse as cultural differences sharpened especially and then after the neoliberal turn it only got bigger and bigger and now you've got. People who have no financial stake and like the small regional economies are in fact as much serfs to them. As the rest of us are serfs to global finance but who don't see that who only see because they've been. Their politics have been totally filtered through just the cultural affect that that they recognize and either accept or reject and that there's no real underlining politics. But the reason they're doing that the reason they're listing that the reason they're they're responding to those cultural cues is and the reason that they want an answer that is that bloody and is that confrontational and is that apocalyptic is. Because things are worse for everybody and even if they are worse for you you can see them getting worse and honestly for a lot of these type of people. They are getting worse but the ex the the modern version of this guy that that he's talking about here personally is talking about is mike lindell but of course he is the version from now not from them.

He is the version who was a crackhead for 40 years and then decided that oh actually jesus loves me more than anyone on earth and has told me that it is my destiny to become a billionaire pillow salesman and now he is a a small relative to the fortunes back east. Bourgeois factory owner like there's a factory that makes those goddamn pillows in in minnesota and now he is they're them. He is. He is the small holder the one from that that or small factory owner the small business tyrant overblown and now a cultural figure and potentially a political figure as well.

I don't know if he's got the charisma to be trump but he fits the pattern very well and the other thing that he has in common with trump and I think this gets underrated is that and this is also one of the things that undermines all the fretting about oh what if a competent trump what about a smart trump what about a trump who has a plan. That's the contradiction in terms because trump's incoherence and idiocy are the things that people like about him because what got trump through the door. More than any policies was that other dumb people heard him and knew that he was also dumb like them. The reason that you're not going to see the reason that he was able to bowl just bowl over all those regular republicans and why no regular republican will be able to get his base no matter what they say is that regular republicans are for the most part smarter than the people they're talking to or imagine they're talking to and that comes across as condescending. There is a degree of falseness and condescension to political communication that your rustic dumbass recognizes and sarah.

Palin broke through because she was a genuine rustic idiot and trump picked up her baton because he is also a genuine rustic idiot but the thing they als but but because they were both genuine rustic idiots and because their rustic idiocy is what endeared them and made them popular. It also guarantees that they could not create a political movement of any coherence to pass on and to exploit because they're too dumb to do that they're too dumb to care about that stuff. They sarah palin is more ideologically committed to like conservatism as a concept than trump is but just barely she is a instagram. Laughing stock trump was able to take that movement get to the center of it and take it to the presidency but as soon as he lost it's over. He wasn't even this his attempt to to foment a coup and I mean yeah of course.

He tried to overturn the election. There's no question he tried to overturn the election but he did that by just calling people and say overturn the election please and then just tweeting to his followers overturn the election please and then go in front of people and say overturn the election please. If you're at the center of a united states and he had none because he is a rustic dumbass who is just interested in himself has no object permanence let alone a a vision of an enduring political legacy. He doesn't care about passing on anything to anyone else because anyone else isn't him like talking to him about a legacy is terrible because you're making him think about the fact that he's not going to be here someday and he can't conceive of that because he's a dumbass and if he hadn't been that dumb they would have picked up on it and mike.

Lindell is as much a rustic dumbass as but palin or trump which means his dumbass-ness will come off as authentic and it will mean that he will be as incapable of building an actual movement as any of them have been. They will all get led around by the nose by ego of these rustic dumbasses and they will make them do what they want to do which is why trump governed as a tax cut. He had a chance in that election even with covet and his horrible botching of covet. He had a chance to win that election if he had fought harder for checks that was totally in his control to do even if mcconnell was going to hold him up. Even if pelosi was going to hold him up. He could have fought for them harder he could have fought to put his name on him more instead. What did he talk about in the run-up to the election. He talked about how he couldn't get his giant shits down the toilet. He talked about how cher was mean to him because he was too stupid even to know what he was to know where what he was actually like the buttons he was pressing or how where what access to powers and access to um to influence. He had how much did trump talk about the two about the checks and how he wanted more checks. He tweeted it. A couple of times did he put it just front and center anywhere no because his advisors also didn't want those checks. They also probably wanted him to lose honestly. They were sick of him and he served his purpose and he had no ability to push against that even though it was in his power because he didn't even he wasn't even aware of it because he wasn't even able to keep the thought in his head long. Enough to pursue it. He was distracted he saw a He was watching the william devane for gold line commercial again that's and if he hadn't had that if he hadn't been that rabbit brained he wouldn't have gotten in that position. In the first place where people would think he was a god emperor and want to charge into the mouth of congress. On his behalf the stupidity the idiocy. The authenticness is what they're responding to more than any policy see.

People say napoleon iii but napoleon. Iii spent his whole life fixated on becoming emperor of france. He thought it was his birthright. He got arrested several times and spent time in prison years in prison for trying to overthrow the government in his prison. He wrote himself not have not just have a ghostwriter wrote books where he imagined what like the political economy of a restored bonapartist empire would be. He was actually pursuing all along a goal and then when he got himself elected president thanks to the potato sacks in the countryside and the sausage addicted soldiers and the lump and proletariat.

He was able to ex exacerbate the conflicts within the ruling class in order to overcome them and defeat them in turn and supersede them because he was actually trying to do that trump has never tried to do anything. The trade war is the closest thing they did to any kind of like economic populism and it popularized a bunch of soybean farmers in the midwest that was and because it's like we're getting killed in trade. He's not doing it as some sort of attempt to create a new industrial policy and like create a bring back the jobs whatever the hell that means he's thinking in in pure terms of of of like state competition. Even though these are interdependent economies and it ended up just being a button-bashing disaster that helped nobody it did bring back the mcrib though. I think. I'm not sure if that's true. But I think I read that one of the reasons they brought back the maghrib is is that china's retaliatory tariffs on on pig pork bellies led to a glut which meant that mcdonald's could swoop in grab them like.

Trump only cares about his own brand and not even like brand beyond himself like to his family him because he cannot imagine himself dying. He cannot imagine himself not existing. That's why he has to watch tv all day. That's why he has to keep the focus on himself at all times and keep the volume up because he's got to drown out that voice in his head telling him. He's going to die one of my favorite trump moments ever just as a pure tableau of just monstrous crudeness was during the campaign. I think he was on an airplane the campaign plan being interviewed and there was a big tv on and it was blaring the empire carpet jingle. This guy's supposed to be a billionaire running for president and he's just glued to the tv.

Like all like right like like your grandfather which is why they love him because he's the same he's. There is a identification beyond politics beyond even words and it's a recognition. It's mutual recognition just think how many times he has heard the celino and barnes jingle and the empire carpet jingle in his life. How many times has he heard the catheter ads that they play on fox news. It's my money and I need it. Now you have a structured settlement and you need cash now the people whose have those songs in their head. All the time are unemployed loser types and failed sons such as myself and old retired people and the pres the literal president of the literal united states. I was always wondering about the jd wentworth thing. How many calls do they get a day of from people going hey. I want one of those structured settlements. How many times does the does the person at that. Hotline number have to say no we can only restructure an existing settlement. We can't get you one. I would probably to have fun kind of be like well if you want a structured settlement. Here's what you do you go down to the grocery store you find a nice recently. Mopped piece of floor and you just eat. Foot you got to really really really commit to hitting your head on the floor call. Jd. Wentworth.

That's something guys no damn it well. That's gonna be in my head for the rest of the day fantastic. Oh god vaginal mesh ooh that's got to be one of the grimmest jobs is at the call center. The vaginal mesh lawsuit number caught people calling in to tell you about their mesh mishaps. Their vaginal mesh mishap their vaginal mesh mishaps vaginal mess vaginal mesh mishaps vaginal mesh mitts vaginal mesh mishaps vaginal mesh mishaps vaginal mesh mishaps there we go did it three times very proud of myself yes please clip that that should be a clip. Clipping is disabled maybe because I'm getting canceled too much. I don't know. I never just said. I never disabled it. I don't know how I wouldn't know how to go about doing that. I still don't know how they get these little pictures of me in the in the chat. I don't know how that works like hey. There's a little me. What's going on hey there. I am hey. I was hoping. Someone would post that my little face there he is hey adorable jimmy wentworth a77 cash wonderful. It's wonderful what you have in your brain instead of memories and feelings and connections to other people. You just have this these broken toys of jingle shards and slogans and context-less phrases. Pontipo really was really was this prophetic film so much of our our berserk moment.

I think obviously at every level it's being forced and exacerbated by the continual. You know pressure of worsening conditions of worsening of greater precarity remember it's about precarity. It's not about absolute conditions sense sense of felt precarity and lack of control on top of that just everybody's head being filled every day with more like we used to have three memes a year there used to be three memes a year and two of them came from super bowl. Commercials now you get three memes a day. How are you supposed to have a brain how are you supposed to be able to think with that noise in your head. At all times yes I am grandpa simpson but some of the older chokes will remember the pre-internet era. Not even pre-internet pre-like social media era. There were very few things in a year that like would become a cultural reference point and a lot of them were commercials specifically super bowl. Commercials you'd sit and you watch the super bowl and one of the big things you would do. Is. You would pay attention for the big. Ad was up budweiser frogs and then that would last you for six months.

The bud bowl does anyone remember the bud bowl. They had. The little bottles play football and we were supposed to get all excited about who was gonna win. Oh man tastes great less filling. Doritos did a number of them the dally larder no. I know that was her name. I can't remember her name but there's a a woman who like got an acting career because she was sexy in a doritos commercial. It was not ali larter. I think her name was allie something she married She married mario lopez. I think and then they got divorced very quickly. After that ali landry. They're saying let me check yep that was her. She sexly ate a dorito and became famous for it different time so yeah. If I have any advice for anyone. It's limit your own meme intake because if you just let yourself indulge in memes willy-nilly you are going to get meme diabetes. So it's up to you to limit your meme intake no more than. I'd say a meme. You know what a meme a week you get one meme a week see if that can handle if you can handle that all right bye-bye.
