Keep on shining shine on the one that's gone and let me blue. I said blue moon a kentucky keep on shining. They shine on the one that's lost and left me blue. It was on the moonlit night sun shining bright whisper on high lava sucker by I said blue moon kentucky keep on shining blue. Tv. I go walking after midnight just like we must be. I'm always walking after midnight searching for me. I walked in miles along the highway. That's just my way of saying. I love you and always walking after midnight searching for you. I stopped to see a weeping widow crying out his pillow maybe. He's crying for me all right.

We got it here. Wow that was so easy now that. I can do it on the computer. This is a miracle it snowed in ohio on 4 20. Bless blessings we're blessed out here fam ah how's everybody doing today. I really have nothing so this should be interesting. I haven't really been thinking of anything my head is my brain is kind of smooth like. I've just been nothing really going on nothing really to think about or talk about so we'll just we'll see what's going on. I had a peanut butter sandwich for lunch that's usually what I have for lunch. It's pretty easy. I got the fluoride stair and the inch a stair I've got both of them. Oh people are talking about variants. Oh don't give me anything about variants. Folks don't give me any of this okay now. I don't care if.

I don't care if kobe becomes a sentient being and starts ravaging the countryside. We're not going to let it happen again. I really don't think so I think that absent some sort of you know tube neck super flu captain trip situation. We're just gonna in in the places where we're now blanketing with vaccines. We are just gonna act like. It's all going away and if likelihood of getting sick likelihood of dying goes up. It gets metabolized as part of doing business. So I'm done. I'm done speculating about any movie. That's now available that's about the fourth year of lockdown which was made last summer something that absolutely is baffling to imagine. Someone thought was a good idea. Apparently it was michael bay and of course that means that you know the least 

The most vulnerable people are gonna keep dying more than they need to more than they should. But that's a one-way ratchet that's really the That's the horror of this thing is that nobody at the at the level of of the most acute encounters with With the existentially annihilating features of contemporary capitalism are coordinate are organized politically in a way to even express the reality of their of their oppression. Like the only people who you got in the media sphere in in in the conversation are issues that while they may be serious are always put through sort of a filter of middle class anxiety not working class outrage and I think that's one of the big reasons that things kind of stalemate politically is that the only people talking are people who are more afraid of falling than they are truly feeling something that approximates the experience of living in this country because honestly I've said this before. I feel like that experience is so disenchanting with america's trappings and rituals of power and politics that people make a beyond the fact that they're not. They don't really have access to a lot of the avenues for expression that that people take for granted at a higher strata. If they wanted to. They wouldn't bother because the absurdity of it is already self-evident. That's why the continued demiseration of the middle class. The continued like dissolution of the middle class and its attendant cascading um nervous breakdowns that cat that make up politics right now are both. I mean. It's it's a process that's being driven materially but the politics of it are so detached from real not only conditions but levers of power that it seems like as things get worse at least in the firmament of politics. Things are only going to get more absurd until something ruptures. Why do I not care about the working class that's an interesting question I guess. I guess. I don't know what the word care means in that instance like do. I have a do. I have a sense of like human recognition that like the working class is made up of people and therefore you know my existential like co-species members who I mean. I certainly. I don't think you could argue. I mean i. I don't know. I don't know what that means. I don't know what it means.

Care could somebody who's asked the question go a little more in depth is what they mean by that that's so weird. I feel like that really does speak to the nature of politics because it is now in a a series of public demonstrations ritualized public demonstrations of virtue and that is all politics not just liberal politics. That's what q anon freaks do too. They're they're showing their virtue that they're the ones who care about child zoos and closing them and so everything gets turned into a a a bidding war on who cares the most but care by definition doesn't mean. It doesn't definitionally connect to action because you have to perform that caring you have to actually take care the emotion of care and invest it with action that corresponds to the feeling. But there's nothing in our politics that it necessitates any one path there and a lot of the path people take to show they care is to show they care and it's not something.

You can blame people for because it is for most folks. I think the only channel available to them that feels accessible. Everything else just feels too big and impossible but if you have the feeling you want to express the feeling in the moment. You don't want to bank it up and feel bad and so you you perform you you pronounce.

I mean I care about the working class and that I wish we had one jesus christ like not because they're good people not because they're better than other peoples in some moral sense but that they have the relationship to capitalism. They have the unity of interest to drive history so like do I care about the working class. It's like it'd be great if we had one of those it would be wonderful. In the meantime we have people who are at various stages of being dissolved in the acid of finance capitalism like we're all in the stomach of a giant beast being eaten and we're just fighting with each other because we can't see the the stomach we can't see it but it. But the thing that stops the working class from existing more than anything is that while there is that unity of interest that can be forged it has to be forged out of social existence and cooperation and we just don't live that way. That's the challenge and that's what everything has to start from.

That's what you have to engage with. And it's one of the hardest things to really look at with sober sense because it does make a lot of the things that seem important and that invest your time with a sense of a charred sense of meaning with a charred sense that you are an agent of history and not just a passive. victim of it is actually very much illusory and and and carts ahead of the horses. I mean anyone whose instinct is is to edit the left right to say x y or z has no business in the left. No matter what it is. They might even be right in some abstract sense that if you had a left you wouldn't want people like that. In it betray a complete denial of the reality of the situation which is that there is no left in this country as I've said before I've been. I have not really I gotta admit it.

I've not really been writing because I've been kind of stuck in this. this self-conscious loop about like what exactly I'm trying to get out what the point of writing is and I've kind of come to the conclusion that like a lot of the stuff that I want to get across makes most sense in like this format in in the in the spoken in the direct address format and so as a result I am putting I am working on on on some projects that are premised on these. This form of address then like turned into writing or turned into something else but I am looking to start a writing project soon that will be not directly political like. That's what I've realized is is that if it's worth the stuff that's worth like trying to push into a new and different means of expression that is not something that I'm terribly familiar with It's gonna have to be the reason. I basically end up always freezing up when I try to write is because I always end up getting stuck on where to start how to cut the thing because we're talking about everything and like when I'm speaking. It's like the I'm propelled forward sort of by the momentum of trying to express something and then that ends up tunneling me kind of through it without me even picking as I go but when I try to write that becomes overwhelming so I'm gonna sort of let this be the mechanism for for shaping it. That's why I think if you had something that was fictional. For example it would and more abstract in its relationship to politics. You can tunnel through from that perspective.

So we'll see we'll see what it ends up being ah the carnation revolution you know. I love talking about the carnation revolution. I don't think we would see anything in america and remember of course. We're talking about in a context of collapse right. We're not talking about the army of just marching out of the barracks at any point in the future. We're assuming that there is a crisis that comes on you know on the hoof beats of the night and you can point to things that say that's possible that that we might be getting there but again technology is the x factor here technology. is the is the thing that very well could change all of these rates of decline because we're talking. We're all decline is is written in but rate of decline is the is the question so if you have enough of a rate of decline if you have a steep enough rate of decline. I don't think you're going to see some organized ideologically socialist military movement sadly just because the ingredients don't exist for it because that's what happened with carnation revolution is that you had this like middle strata of um army officers who had been disenchanted with the estado novo and specifically the disastrous um colonial wars in africa that they were fighting turned to try to find a new explanation and they they found marxism the same way that like nasser and the bath party guys all found arab nationalism and that's they picked that because of the context of their their moment and you have to take that into consideration. There is no context that's going to create self-consciously marxist political military officers in our disenchanted middle strata of of the art of the military. The best thing you're likely to say is that if political conflict escalates along its sort of increasingly identitarian lines which is sort of in the interest of capitalism and is like sort of inherently built into the nature of crisis under capitalism that the military provides the the means for organized power outside of an identitarian framework from emerging which is certainly not what people were met are hoping will you know save the day.

I didn't do these two hands. Somebody says I'm drinking like trump. I didn't do this god. I love that this guy was the most alpha person in america right. This guy represented for what like half half the white guys in america. Maybe more represented just masculinity and it's untrammeled of power to overrun our our emasculated social niceties and he just goes it's just amazing. I don't even know if I miss. I mean. I guess. I miss him if I'm being honest just because that's a thing that I don't get to experience anymore is him doing things like that is him. Saying things is him tweeting things and there it is like. It's a it's like a you know like a hint of hint of paprika or something in a in in your egg salad. If it's gone you miss it. He does seem though to have disappeared as a political force as soon as he lost his platform and man what the hell happened to q what the hell happened to q. It really does feel like the millerites they came down the mountain and they just like went their separate ways. I guess we're half gonna have to wait for them to go into hibernation and come out with some new. We haven't even had the stochastic political violence that everyone was assuming was going to happen remember a couple weeks ago when somebody crashed a car into the capitol and like there was a an hour where every lib on twitter was absolutely convinced that it was like another another q anon sally and then it was like no the guy is in the nation of islam. Everyone just decided to change the channel because at the end of the day it really is people who are just looking for something to do on the internet.

It's not a thing to work to be worth dying over. That's really the thing. That's I think holding back political violence in this country from where a lot of people want it to be sort of subconsciously or imagine it should be. It's that yes. I would argue that a lot of americans are at a point where they are willing to kill because of how they are feeling precarious stressed alienated. They're absolutely willing to kill many fewer of them though are willing to die and without that willingness to die. It's hard to get off the couch and that's because we're getting more alienated. We're getting more It's becoming more unbearable to live moment to moment. We've become more disenchanted from the mechanisms of control that we have internally and externally built but that alienation is built on a foundation of pure nihilist or pure materialist selfishness. we we imagine that there is no god. There is nothing but our pleasure and our experience which must be hoarded and extended as far as possible to push back the specter of an annihilation. But that means that no matter how bad the bad things get. It's very hard for us to get in a position of endangering ourselves because the thing we're really afraid of is that obliteration and that's why I really do think that in order to have any hope of a resistance to the full dissolution of like the individual consciousness into a soup of pure um pure nerve ending pure stimulus response.

 is going to be a revitalization of a religious instinct which can mean anything as long as what it means. At the end is a proper emotional perspective for your own. Personal safety. and your own continued pleasure and existence and that doesn't mean any specific religion. It's just me. It could mean anything as long as it's persuasive enough to get you to act and I think that's it's going to be very different. But it's going to be variated. I think it's going to be syncretic and it's going to come under some sort of banner. I mean essentially a holy war against capitalism is is necessary.

No that is not the people's temple. The people's temple was a self sealing cult. I mean it was it was it. It was so organized around the personal fixations of jones the personal ego of jones that it required very brittle. very very brittle borders in order to maintain the internal structure and coherence. But a lot of people at the time thought that they were you know a a man support emancipatory force especially in california where they became part of the moscone political machine.

It's a reasonable fear to be feared for for the end of yourself but it it's only reasonable with certain false assumptions buried on top of it like in a very real sense death is not a thing to fear because it is a It's it. I mean. I know this sounds kind of goofy but it is just an energy transference like you. The stuff that makes you up doesn't go anywhere because there is nowhere for it to go. Because this is one universe and it is one like consciousness experiencing itself subjectively and a lot of the fear that we have is built on the illusion of our egos and that might not mean anything just to hear you might be well and that thing for me for most of my life. I heard this stuff. I thought okay yeah not. I don't care. It's still all. I have is my precious stream of consciousness and my mind. It's all. I have yes yes cosmic mind. Death isn't real blah blah blah but what about when. I go no no. I can't go away oh my god and that's true of any religious idea from the outside. None of them are persuasive from the inside. They are fully persuasive and you have to get inside something. You have to get inside some sort of consciousness shift that puts you abstracts you away from that animal-like terror because if you're it is very you you're not. Gonna die in the very near future probably and if you do well that could happen to.

Anybody you're probably you're relatively safe but it's the fact. I think that so much of our time is spent alone really alone. It's including all the time we spent on the internet. At that time. Alone builds a morbid reification of the ego. It it petrifies your ego into this totalizing thing whereas like social social existence like there's a reason. One of the big reasons that religion persists in traditional social arrangements is because a socialized life where you are not spending. Most of your time by yourself with your thoughts is one where there is just simply less opportunity to just build up an ego and now we are all alone and we are all spending a lot of our atomized time just slowly like a stalagtite building. This hardened promontory of of of ego and fear around the elimination of that ego that it makes us it becomes impossible to move at all becomes impossible to do anything because anything can lead to a decline. Anything can lead to less pleasure than you have now and that's what's so funny about woke. Somebody says this wokeness is a religion. It is absolutely banal to say that of course wokeness is a rel is now a religion in this because secular liberalism is the final or the I guess. I don't know if it's the final stage. It's it's the most recent stage of liberal protestantism and before that puritans to modern wokeness and what it is is. It is.

It is personalized calvinist religious obsession where there is a individual relationship with god where your relationship with god is not one of connection but one of eternal separation god as unscrutable and unknowable and terrifying where our only ability to soothe our. We fear of god is by performing in a way that we imagine that he would approve of and over time as as the people who believe this center in those urban areas. Those big cities like first boston and then new york and as they spend time in their parlors and read their darwin. The religious the actual emotional fear of god goes away and and god is turned into Instead the self we are replace god with ourselves and so we have to manifest virtue in our lives to affirm our our status to show that we are good but what this doesn't have at its heart is belief. It's neurotic. It's pure neuroses now the same thing is happening to conservative protestantism because white protestantism like you got to say white because you know.

It's it defines everything Once once slavery emerges because you know there is a black protestant tradition but it's different because of race it splits off and you have merchant northern protestantism turning into congress going from puritanism to congregationalism to mainline protestantism. Until finally it's not even nominally protestant anymore. It's it's it's just a universal virtue ethic that you're carrying out unconnected from any belief in anything transcended. In fact. It's been turned into manners like like our like all of our politics gets turned into but then at the root at the at the at the sharp end of manifest destiny's. enslaved africans um god also died but was and was replaced by the self but not but there.

The focus is on showing your virtue through your domination and mastery of the land as opposed to amongst the northern liberals the domination and mastery of the south. I have restrained myself and that is why I am good as opposed to. I have indulged myself and that is why I am good and what shapes those two approaches to religion is the is your economic productive mechanism. The farther you are away from the sharp edge of exploitation. The more you are able to fashion a politics of moral virtue as performance and at moral abstinences performance. If you're closer to exploitation it cannot be sustained indulgence essentially makes up for the the the the moral dearth at the center of it. No that's not now of course black protestantism isn't completely different because it's american also and you've got guys like your creflo dollars is your p tg. Jakes's that are essentially reflections of like the the white protestant. opportunity gospel. But that's because class operates in um in the black community too and pulls people apart at least or income. I guess because class is going away completely.

I'm good thanks unsolved mysteries. I watched all that man what what do you even know what you're getting you even know what people liked about it. It was robert stack of television's the untouchables never. Gonna start watching anime. I really. I really don't think it's gonna happen. I've thought people have asked me about anime and I just have to. I just have to say. It's something that very little. very little appeal to me but then again who knows. I could encounter the buddha in the road and kill him and decide that all. I can watch. Now is giant robots have fight over they fight aircraft carriers. I don't know barnes and noble stories. I have one like classic like readers digest head slapper moment where somebody came up to me at the information desk and said that their kid needed a book for school and they needed to know the author and it was the complete works of shakespeare do.

I feel weird or guilty that I have a job doing this talking about marx and while everyone's struggling. I mean obviously I feel weird about it. I would say that that weird feeling is the main generator of everybody having politics in this country. it's everybody feels a weird sense of of guilt if they have if they have if they're struggling less than others and of course they've been acculturated to feel that way. Plenty of people have not and don't and in fact resent being asked to feel guilty for other people. but a lot of if you are acculturated a certain way if you if you take the college pill. As I did yeah. Of course you feel guilty you feel weird and guilty about everything and i. I think the challenge though is to identify those feelings and then ask yourself okay. What does this mean like what should I do with this as opposed to. I think what generally happens is leaving it as this unresolved catalyst for anxiety within you that leads you to wrong conclusions that leads you to jump to things as a way to purge it because the most the main thing that that mass guilt does is demo demobilizes and de-politic or d not d politicizes. Extra politicizes people but demobilizes people because if you're guilty if you're responsible then who are you to imagine that you can make anything better beyond unless you purge the guilt and the thing about the guilt is it cannot be purged. Only the changing of the conditions can get rid of the guilt and nothing is changing the conditions because people who are doing relatively well they don't want to what renounce all their worldly goods. They could do that but their cup they have they have personal selfish urges.

They have they have a self-interest. They have duty to others that they want to continue to honor and that means that they have to construct a mental structure that justifies their position and then you you do that either like republicans do by blaming those people who are below you saying. It's actually. It's their fault for making me feel bad them or by creating a ritual of self abnegation that cleanses you like a a ritual cleansing. I mean that guilt is the same guilt that power the puritans and everybody else. It's the original sin which is now framed in a capitalist. in capitalist terms like we imagine the original our original sin in the middle classes as as a as we imagine our original sin as a as a sin of exploitation which it is. I mean we all are in a machinery of misery somewhere or another and to some degree.

We are having our time alienated and exploiting the the alienated time of others and then we have to cleanse that but religion is close to us. Real religion is closed off. So we have to do it secularly and that's what politics ends up being a secular demonstration of that man somebody's asking about the oscars why did they not just cancel the oscars this year why the did. They why why are they pretending that this thing is still real. I mean if movies are coming back this year. Just like just say hey we're not doing it this year. Like when they didn't have the olympics they didn't have the olympics they're not doing a zoom olympics. There were no movies there were no movies. No movies came out last year. I don't recognize any of these as movies. I'm sorry and what I mean by that is forgetting even the streaming thing is that none of them have any like is there any mark left. By any of these. It just feels like. It's such a decline.

It's such a it's a it's and obviously it's because film I hate to say it. But film is dead because to me the theatrical experience is it is definitionally definitionally enmeshed in the concept of a film. I feel like if you don't. I mean yes you can watch a movie at home. You can watch a movie on your phone and it's still a movie but if without the theatrical ritual of a thing being displayed in public people coming together to watch it at least having the possibility of doing that and then the first impressions of that movie forming in that experience and then filtering out. I don't think that you really have film you have something else you have streaming content which is what we now have. I feel like the streaming is its own new genre that has replaced and synthesized television and film to the detriment of both because this is a negative dialectic. It's just straining all the good all the art out and and turning it into and leaving only the residue of of commerce and pandering.

So there's no There's no more movies. So they really should get rid of the oscars because oscars are for movies and there's no more movies. But we do have the on cinema oscar special which is of course worth it. I honestly do feel like once upon a time in hollywood might have been the last movie when you look at that. Like that movie is this. It's the culmination of tarantino's career. It's this look back on on the golden age of of hollywood. A thing that was a movie that was intimately about the theatrical experience and that was theatrically released and was a huge success theatrically that feels like the last real movie and there's talk about them being they're being like a 20 hour streaming version and I will watch the out of it and I will love it. But it won't be a movie. It'll be. It'll be a streaming product. It'll just be a really good streaming project yeah. I mean yeah movies had their run. There were movies for a while. Now they're gone. They'll still be around as a curio.

Like you know like theater. But it's just no longer a genre with with a dominant cultural influence yeah. No the snyder cut wasn't a movie either. I was annoyed that they acted like it was a movie. They could do all this stuff but the only movies left will be james. Cameron movies he's going to be the one to keep it going god bless him. I will be there when avatar 2 comes out n3 and 4. I will watch avatar 5 in a climate refugee camp. Machi and it doesn't even have any of the favorite your tolkien favorite characters.

It really tells you that we are at a point now where we have gotten rid of the commercial There's no longer a commercial structure to art to it. It's almost now becoming either algorithm just an algorithmic response to to what people click on or the personal desires of billionaires which is why that write a check that is less than he spends on skull shiner on a month to make another season of lodge 49 for christ's sake. That's how you know he's evil is that he's never brought back lodge 49 unless he does bring back lodge 49. In this case he'll still be evil but but one tenth of a percent less somebody said some rich dude said that elon musk could do jurassic park if he wanted to like make a real jurassic park and I gotta wonder why no super rich person has tried doing that yet like all their stuff is this fantasy of escaping to mars or whatever why don't why don't you want to make a dinosaur how about we do congo and we create Evil silver apes evil white apes super intelligent give them guns apparently. China has hybrid monkey humans yeah what the hell happened to nanobots where the hell is our damn nanobots. We were promised tiny tiny tiny machines. Instead. All we have are those damn boston dynamics. Killer dog robots running around those things are not nano pots. It really kind of makes you think that all that all of the fantasies of singularity and space travel are just the things we tell ourselves as the microwave gets warmer and warmer and as we start popping like sausages.

It really is fitting that a scamp like a lyle lanley guy like elon musk is the richest man in the world right now on paper and that his companies are obscenely valued considering what they put out. It's because he is the person who more than anyone represents a a future because capitalism is without future. Everyone knows that everyone can see before them that the given structure we have leads only to miseration and annihilation. Everyone on all sides is agreed upon no matter if you're reactionary you're leftist. You're a liberal. You see that the way things are going. You see the trend line unless you're stephen pinker. You don't think there's a future but then you've got this guy musk who's hey. He's the richest guy in the world. He must know what he's talking about. He must be able to master this stuff who says we're gonna do tunnels underground. We're gonna have We're gonna have renewable batteries everywhere and electric cars and we're going to have mars missions and we're going to have brain We're going to have brain what the cybernetic brain links. We're going to have a sci-fi future and that is his role is to is to allow people to perform some some sort of faith in the continuity of the system through a technological innovation. But all of this stuff is made up.

It's maybe hypothetically possible. But it's distance from being practically applicable is cavernous and pursuing it while everything else falls apart and while all of the things that we take for granted as part of the the technological and economic infrastructure that power the global system are are losing their functionality are turning are falling apart before our eyes. It's it's madness. It's it's the final ponzi scheme at the end of capitalism which has just been since it's begun a series of ponzi schemes like america. The american experiment is a ponzi scheme. It is the fantasy of eternal and unending growth. There will always be something for the next guy to have and what has allowed that to happen has been technology.

So you concentrate capital concentrate to concentrate it. You destabilize a biome you destabilize the social order technology comes in and saves the day technology rescues the instant or if it's thanks to some. If there's you know before before we had a global economic structure. one collapse would be made up for it by boom somewhere else but now that's all foreclosed and so we are now left with this fantasy of technology um unmoored from reality but somehow worth real money because at this point we cannot afford in a literal sense to acknowledge the nudeness of the emperor because there's no other emperor there's nobody else in town. No one else can can resolve the contradictions within the system. Any other meaningful attempt to get out of this. This crisis requires challenging capitalism and that is the one thing that can't be allowed to happen.

It does appear we live in a society isn't that a oh man. I honestly the it's so funny elaine. Maswell goes on trial on friday and it's like at this point it doesn't matter like I guess that's why she never they didn't kill her because so much stuff has happened since epstein that everyone recognizes that well what's the worst that can happen what comes out oh yeah. Oh these guys are all pedophiles okay so what we got other stuff to worry about. I am intrigued though I am intrigued by the the trial I will be checking it out. were elites ever held accountable no the only times you really get. Any kind of elite accountability is the occasional proxim of collapse induced political revolution and then conquest by a different social order with a different series of elites that's about it and then even there you usually only have a stratum of people at the very top. I've read that the cut the families that make up the ruling elite of china right. Now the new. The new billionaires are the same families that were ruled that were powerful and influential before the the before the revolution of 1910.

All right. I'm going to sign off here have a good talk. talk to you. Guys soon might be doing more of these in the future and still trying to think of a book to do another reading series on if anyone has any requests any suggestions please let me know. I'm still available to them. I'm still amenable. I rather bye bye.
