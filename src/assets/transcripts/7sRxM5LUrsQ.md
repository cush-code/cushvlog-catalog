So I've got wheels a polished steel. I've got tires that drag the rope. I've got seats that selflessly oh my friends and a truck that can carry the heaviest of loads. I got a mind that can steer me to your house and a heart that can bring you red flowers. My intentions are good and earnest and true but under my hood is internal. Combustion. Satan is my motor. Satan is my motor hear my motor purr.

It's always been a favorite cake song of mine and uh lately I've been thinking about how truly evocative it is of just the condition of being a a liberal late capitalist american subject you if you grow up in the middle class. If you grow up west. You know with the fading beneficence of the post-war american economic boom that we're all slowly whittling away. If you get any glimpse of that any grab of that you get a chance to be turned into a a person who's better positioned than almost anyone in human history to thrive to thrive have the ability with your hands to create a destiny. Now of course it is all on the backs of the massive exploitation of others. This is without saying but within the narrow sphere of the personal you can feel like you have some control of the world because you know you have access to capital uh the lingua franca of the world access to its markets its beneficence uh a introduction into a bourgeois social uh network that is embedded and that provides you with like a real identity uh that that off acts as a social capital that can make up for a deficit and actual access to capital you're in as good a position. As you could be you are you get the best of like secular uh. Uh um education you get the ability to live a life well-lived without having it constrained by oppression and happenstance and conscious alienation and yet the engine. The motor of all of that is this poisonous self-conception. This uh imagined singularity called you know your ego and this the satisfying of it because you can't satisfy your ego. It can only ever just be fed from outside uh in the form of desires that are given to you to want and which make you take your beautiful car and drive it all over the  road. In any way any a just drive you away from from truth because the the the the motor is the devil ah uh so jeffrey.


Tubin took his dick out huh and was jacking. It is this what happened. He took out his penis and was jacking it during a uh. An election simulator you say interesting. I guess that's just the peril of the modern workplace. Am I right folks coven just to think if it hadn't been for covid. We wouldn't have had that little hilarious uh story to all enjoy so maybe it was all worth. It might as well look at the bright side jeffrey.

Jeffrey's tube man I do wonder how many people get off on being nude during zoom calls though from the lewis down or something because you'll never know and that's probably appealing to some people. Especially. Since zoom calls are so deadening and and you know they they further alienate the work day by making even your place of you know your your home uh kind of a constant office and getting rid of any private distinction like being able to assert any independence of that is going to be pleasurable maybe in some extent and maybe if you really concentrate on it sensually thrilling so I wonder what percentage of people do zoom calls uh pantsless I am wearing pants. I I have shown myself to wear pants in previous streams in which I was moving around so. I think that the benefit of the doubt could be extended uh that I am in fact wearing pants but honestly really. What's the difference if you think about it especially since you never know who else is pantsless you sort of have to just leave it to fate and just act like nobody is pantsless or act like everybody is pantsless whichever makes it easier for you to engage with them as fellow human beings. I will say that uh.

I'm not going to talk too much more about that good lord bird show. But I did watch the third episode where they go meet. Frederick's douglas and it just seems very obvious to me. The whole thing just seems very very surface level. I mean. I don't really see what it's it. It's like a lot of shows. Now. It just feels like the twitter hive sensibility expressed visually in a different context like here's sort of the hive mind of the twitter received liberal left wisdom that all of the creative class who make all the stuff marinates in what is that gonna what would that be. And then they show hey what would that be when you're talking about the civil war and and slavery or john brown or what about if you're doing um. You know uh rich people in the current moment like succession which is another show. Like this. It's just is reproducing sort of the received wisdom of of online left liberals and that's just not interesting more than anything.

It's dull to me because I can see where everything is going. I'm not going to be surprised or challenged in any way. I'm just going to have myself affirmed. But that's what people are looking for in art now as we've had to settle for the swill of like this mass-produced television which is just getting worse as a medium while it becomes more hegemonic over everything and tough. Film itself is destroyed as a  genre and turned into just another type of streaming television programming and I don't. I don't need that. I don't. I don't want to just see it reproduced and barfed at me like a baby bird which is uh which is what we're getting yeah. We can't get any middle around movies so we get middle brow tv shows but then everything becomes that that's the problem because it's like. It's the middlebrow film turned into an entire. The entirety of art really and I gotta say that guy that jeff the jeff.

The the uh the guy who plays thomas jefferson on hamilton who they got to play frederick douglass who have seen a bunch of things. I just don't like that guy he's just not uh. He just doesn't have he's one of those guys who just I hate to use the word soy because people get it was like oh you're winking to the alt-right and you're creating a fash pipeline but god help you. It is a useful descriptor of a certain sort of affect that you see with people with guys trying to sort of accommodate. The more you know feminized public space of this moment uh and and it's like it's not bad. It's not evil. It doesn't mean you're brainwashed but it is a certain sensibility and this show it's like at that point. A character like that exists for like a soy infusion because that character frederick douglass is the imagined creators of this show like fred john. John brown is is is removed from us by his faith and his in the distance of his worldview from us frederick. Douglass is a more worldly man and we can imagine ourselves in his shoes so he becomes the stand-in so of course he embodies all of those characteristics. Ethan hawk is a trump supporter damn that's a zig when I didn't think it would have been a zag hell yeah that's pretty funny. I think you do you mean uh he thinks john brown would have been a trump supporter because I don't think that ethan hawk is a noted hollywood lib. I'm being gaslit in my own comment section again. I don't know why the hell I talk to you people now. I don't think soy is homophobic because it's not about. It's not about anything having to do with sexuality. It really is about like um like a performance of uh non-threateningness and like if that gets coded as gay.


That's just that's just that's not that's not a first order intent. If it's there. It's it's. It's not intentional on my part. We love artivo folks we love tivo. We love it. We love tivo folks you go and you get all the shows you get every show all of them you know. I gotta say uh the guy who's uh who po who who people all found his uh his trump impression the guy on uh twitter man. It's really good and actually watching that it. Uh that's what reminded me actually yeah. Mine is terrible. Mine's not even close to that terrible. I'm embarrassed of myself. Now. I was stunned by my accents though damn it. The accents are still good velma and I am better than that of alec baldwin who's this terrible and tifa we love.

It don't we so because we love to do the trophy. We love a trump. We love him so uh. I do wonder how many uh like uh coups and assassination attempts.

The cia never got to run because they couldn't get trump to sign off on them because he was too busy drinking milkshakes and it's amazing he might be like a genuine like mr bean like an anti-imperialist mr. Bean who's just going around just destroying accidentally. All of these you know like finely woven uh clockworks of intrigue and deep state para political power and he's just smashing it up without even knowing it like mr magu in a construction site of course. People say ah you're you're saying he's a dove or something no no no he's he's got incoherent nationalist uh leanings he could have definitely be brought into war except for his individual narcissistic terror of losing and being seen as a loser which is what stopped him from ever doing any big military action like when they wanted brinksmanship with iran. What pulled him back from the brink was that he didn't want to get owned because he had owned jeb about the iraq war and he was like why do. I think it wouldn't happen again and that's what stopped that from happening I mean it doesn't necessarily mean there would have been a war but he pulled back from the brink at several moments where presidential decision making is crucial just out of a naked fear of being made to look like a loser loser folks and you know if that speaks to anti-imperialism. It's just that um it's just the anti-imperialism of his like narrow focus as a totally self-centered uh egomaniac looking through a totally personal lens and recognizing the weakness of american power which maybe it's you know.

Planners are less concerned about because they know it doesn't matter. If they win. It doesn't matter if every politician has this around their neck. Forever they still get their war that's what matters they don't give a  war.

That's the objective and expanding it changing the terrain disrupting the enemies maintaining revenue streams. But trump is narrowly focused on his re-election which is a similar reason that obama kind of reigned in a syrian intervention. I know there was a ton of u.s syrian intervention but the deep state the blob was clearly much more intent on pushing farther than obama went and uh in most cases like the the difference there from a democrat and a republican is fear of electoral uh blowback for the their narrow short-term interests from the american people in general due to their the fear that they have and innate hostility to failed american military ventures because they don't want to see people getting blown up for no reason in foreign countries because they don't get a benefit from it at least not nearly directly enough to feel it as anything other than continual loss and and humiliation and trauma and ways for and whether that's because they're animated by some international spirit that says that those people are just as much as right to life as I do and that their suffering is mine or if. It's just narrow focus on the idea that there's a limited amount of resources and we shouldn't waste them on other people one way or the other I don't care if it's blowing them up or giving them schools that's money and men and resources that we need here right now whatever it is whatever strain of uh like moral calculus gets you to the point. There is this majority that wouldn't like it and it's sort of the only millstone around the neck of the of the deep state. But it doesn't stop the drive that underlies it because at the political level there's never enough of a organized opposition. An articulated opposition to the very existence of the thing and sadly biden is not going to change that at all the good times are going to keep rolling for the for the for the draculas of the military industrial silicon valley entertainment.


Complex raytheon disney amazon I did see soderberg's shave but it was a long time ago. I should watch it again. I'd be interested to see I remember liking it a bit somebody's banging. A dang drum is it seven not six. I'm seeing the chicago seven movie tonight. We are going to be doing an episode on thursday that was inevitable. Apparently it's rich with liberty goodness and sorkini nuggets. It's got all of our favorite things. It's got all of the specific sorkin idiocy. It's got more general delusional like boomer nostalgia and and uh misunderstanding of the of the 60s and it'll be interesting. We're gonna hopefully talk to uh dave anthony and josh olson from the west wing thing podcast who talk about sorkin every week to talk about it that'll be interesting especially since apparently like they like the new left guys a little more than I think.

I do and I know amber does so there might be some sparks there. We'll see but I'm sure I've heard. It's terrible and that makes me very excited because there's nothing I like more than a bad movie with very high production values and a lot of good actors in it. Oh that's some of the best movie watching. You can do is a just a bad like uh in some way like risible film. That's got a nice rich patina on it especially since there's so much. There's so little content these days in terms of streaming that it seems to pop out everything just seems like a slurry we love our actors don't we folks oh man.

Barry's that very seal movie that was amazing that's like a  definition of a limited hangout deal where they talk about barry seal and they say that they say yeah sure the the cia hired him to run guns uh illegally uh into uh nicaragua to arm the contras during the iran-contra scandal yeah. He did that but he also and he also while he was doing that uh was moving a lot of cocaine for pablo escobar into the united states at the same time and maybe the cia knew about it and looked the other way but most of the government didn't know about it that's the official and that's perfect example of a limited hangout because there is the the horror of oh my god like they're they're giving these guns. These drug dealers are arming these terrorists on behalf of the us government that's amazing but the idea that the cia is directing the flow of  attack. Uh no absurd where'd you get no look we're telling you as far. As it went. He did move drugs while he was moving the guns and we maybe looked the other way but you know at the end of the day. He was just a an american boy who wanted to do good and you know what the fact that he was so ambitious about everything and just wanted money.

So much doesn't that just really indict the entire american system. After all aren't we all to blame move those crack rocks meanwhile you're moving crack rocks you're turning. You're turning pieces into weight and then back into rocks after having basically created the modern heroin trade during vietnam and then in afghanistan. You went from having a situation where the taliban had been very successful in eradicating opium production and it brought into like into it near extinction. Like it was on the path towards eventual uh extinguishment and then the u.s showed up after uh 9 11 and after that moment from that moment on not till now uh afghanistan has gone from something like in the single digits or like. I think under 25 percent. I believe of world opium uh production to 90. Like oh wow we just we couldn't do anything other than let that happen like these huge networks of uh. You know uh extremists and guns and uncountable amounts of untraceable cash just gonna go out of the country without the u.s having any idea where it's going oh god charlie wilson's war. Another sorkin bomb. We are honestly the show goes long enough. We might end up doing every sorkin property because I think we've talked about doing a charlie wilson's war episode. But we never got around to it. It is absolute dog  not just from the standpoint of its awful typical like it's another limited hangout deal. Oh we armed the muay jaadin. Oh weren't we stinkers um and then oh man. Taliban exists now exists. Darn fumbled the ball in the end zone.


I guess what we get for being too cocky but sorkin dialogue terrible philip seymour. Hoffman is the only good thing. He's he's great as the pissed off cia guy who by the way uh was one of the guys who helped administer the. It was like mike lee mike nichols in his like senescence when he was just making these boring. Tv movies and it's got this amazing the only action scene in the entire movie spoiler alert is this is a shot of some mujahideen uh shooting down a hind helicopter with a stinger missile that had been provided to them courtesy of representative charlie wilson and the operation cyclone and it's just these two guys in sandals and and headdresses standing on a rock that could have been in  griffith park and then they cut to what looks looks uncannily like stock footage of a soviet helicopter and then they should cut back to the guy and he fires the missile. It looks like an snl sketch and then they cut to and more footage that swear to god looks like it's a stock of an exploding helicopter and then they go yay dog.

It's bad a few good men. I say is is his best stuff but a few good men is an unimpeachably solid film. I would. I would not really want anything else out of that movie and you know it's also one of his first films. It's one of his first chances. He had to uh show off all of his tricks and  and I think the fact that it's a different context and it's different actors that is subsequently used over and over again. You can kind of enjoy the sorkin stuff uh without it hating your ear wrong because it's not reminding you of the 500 other times. He does that same thing because he has three  tricks in his sleeve. But it's still I think it's entertaining and rob reiner who's certainly nothing more than a journeyman at best. Uh is pretty confident directing it and of course.

Nicholson is fantastic. I have more responsibility than you could possibly fathom. What's so funny about that is that he gets up on his high horse about this. And this is in the 90s though and it's really going to show how america was grasping towards the cold war without even knowing it how we needed to reestablish like the the threat matrix of an external enemy like the soviets for our entire defense posture and our relationship to our military to make sense like we have to find a new one because this is the end of the cold war and  uh. Nicholson has this giant stem-winding speech that's supposed to like cut to the quick and make you question your assumptions as a pious liberal uh and it comes down to. I'm afraid.

The cubans are gonna get me even though I'm hanging out in a  uh. I mean this is a post-war world where america is the dominant hegemon of the entire globe. Everybody else is either building themselves up or putting back the pieces together and this got their their colonial outposts uh in front of like a cow economically sanctioned pariah state that we've like waged unceasing war on for 7 50  wire any day. Now it's it's it's it's absurd in the moment but like our culture didn't have time.

911 showed up just in time to like catch the foot as we were spinning off into nothing like catch us on the next rung of the ladder and move us along oh good. Now we made now the world makes sense again because for a while there we were in a real. Uh uh personality crisis we were real real crisis of identity. There. Uh and 911 came wrong um uh either because it was an inside job and it was the state making it happen or because we were literally just driving into it as a culture subconsciously because of our like zardoz ask death urge to to find meaning at the end of history because we've been so deeply. A culture to this barracks mentality and this apocalyptic framework of confrontation that our institutions could not survive becoming decadent. We could not survive the end of the punic war. Any better than the roman republic could and now we find. Oh.

No this replacement has only accelerated the process because the process was always accelerating. It was just disguised by some freak moments of uh unprecedentedly um ill-distributed capital accumulation after world war ii pubic war indeed indeed indeed said the pubic war yeah because the alternative to that uh apocalyptic confrontational framework is a climb down from our position at the head of this thing a chance to put the gun down and like close our eyes for a bit and hav and step down from our position as this global global strategic hegemon and also as the consumer of last resort and the the primary uh just mouth and that means like not not a stat not a drop in standard of living if you're talking about a like redistribution of wealth. If wealth is genuinely redistributed you could eliminate profit and replace it with public welfare in a way that reduces any kind of like felt material deprivation. Even if maybe there aren't many toothpastes you can choose in the  healthcare like roads you could drive on like some sort of guaranteed government income slash job program I i know those things are always fighting each other. I don't know you guys figure it out. Those things could be achieved well like allowing other countries to uh to absorb like a a of you know of economic activity and we never had the political constituency for that because by the time the crisis came our political system was wholly subsumed into a totally separate class of humans like a that has almost no real participation from the working class at this point and and that real re-establishing that connection has has to be paramount. Uh someone asks if I will carve a gentleladder jack-o'-lantern.


This year. I already have sir it's. Spooktacular it makes me want to do a twitch. Uh can you watch like old movies on twitch do like a twitch halloween like movie night be like a svengoolie type guy like a local uh like hey welcome to chapel halloween theater whoa that might be fun. I might do that later we'll see if we'll see if I can get a night. I definitely need chris for that one though night of the living dead for many years was public domain.

I don't know if it still is though there was a while where any publisher of any like vhs company whatever could just put out a cop an additional night of living dead with any kind of aspect ratio. They wanted her film. Romero was pretty pissed about that although I got to say the fact that he lost living in the in the copyright divorce with his co-producer. I think it was to his benefit because dawn of the dead day of the dead. I just feel like those are punchier than night of living dead. Now night of the living dead is perfect but I just feel like day of the living dead just doesn't have as much punch as day of the dead or dawn of the dead. Most of all dawn of the dead molly's game is not bad. Molly's game is very sorkini but it's also zippy and entertaining and one of the things that makes it fun is that the stakes are very low. I mean obviously he tries to build up molly as a world bestriding genius because he has to because it's his protagonist and he can't doesn't care about a protagonist unless they're as smart as he thinks he is which means they have to be world geniuses uh and uh it's got the snappy dialogue and it's just about her like her life.

If she's gonna go to jail or not there's nothing about the fate of the republic. There isn't there aren't even like a lot of grandstanding around around like civil liberties in regards to the fbi uh prosecution uh and that made it reminded me that he's he is. Just he's he understands rhythm and stuff and what makes like dialogue surface appealing to people. What makes it smooth even if it's you know not realistic but man he gets up his own ass. I watched qb halloween. It was kind of cute. There were so many callbacks to the old happy madison films. I was like ah. I feel like this is my like dying dream like. I'm dying and for some reason as my brain is asphyxiating the last part of my memory that's getting accessed is all of my collective experience of watching happy madison programming and it's turning into this film in front of me that's suffused with elements of all of it. And I'm like turning all of these elements into imagine people in my past as I like bid farewell to this plane of existence. So it's fun uh.

The 90s version of night of the living dead is interesting because it really does. It changes the source material in a provocative way uh because it switches things from in the original night of living dead. There's barbara and uh dwayne jones uh the protagonist the hero uh and then the family with the bald creep and his uh his uh. His pushover wife and their little sick kid and in the original barbara is basically catatonic. The whole time and gets eaten by the zombies pretty much immediately when they burst into the house uh and uh the hero dwayne jones. He shoots the dad. The mom gets killed by the girl and then even though he survives the night when he goes there out to look that's what's gone in the morning spoiler alert to a movie. That's 50  years old. Uh a local posse of people hunting zombies shoots and kills uh oh snap in the remake. Tom. Savini directed me remake. Barbara sort of is is the main character who over time kind of comes into her own and uh she escapes like. I think joins the posse or something comes back to the house. Uh the hero has been zombified but the dad is still alive uh after being a craven piece of  and she kills his ass. So it's more of a girl boss version. It's more of a girl an empowerment version. A feminist feminist retelling the special effects are very good.

It's tom savini but it just doesn't feel necessary other than other than that you know inversion tony todd's good though do I ever wake up with music in my head. Often. I'll I'll go sometimes like a week or so with the same song. It'll just get stuck there like at the beginning like at groundhog day and with uh. I I got you babe but eventually it just stops but yeah. I'll have it happen a lot. I uh. I watched the cats movie recently and I got the uh the mr mistoffelees song stuck in my head for a couple days there that one that one got wedged in real good yeah.


There's no cat more. I think. I forgot it now. There's no cat more more dastardly. What is it never was a cat. Never was there ever yeah. That's it never was there ever a cat as as pimp as mr mistoffelees. I think that's it. I actually found cats is obviously. I think bad from a dramatic perspective. I mean obviously the content is bad uh. It's just these dumb cats introducing each other for  uh 90 minutes. I mean that's it they're just hey. I'm this cat. That's hey. I'm this guy. That's all it is. There's no structure. There's no story at all. It's barely. Even there. It's just an excuse for the song. So it's all about how good the songs are. Some of them are pretty good. Some of them suck the big. Most famous song from the thing in my opinion is awful and I hate memories one of my least favorite songs on earth. Uh thumbs down to that one uh but some of the other ones are fun. The skimble shanks song uh of course. The cavity song you know they're not bad. I really hated the the whole thing really hated the whole thing with uh with rebel wilson and the dancing crowd uh. Uh cockroaches grotesque uh kafka ask in a bad way. Buster jones revolting thank you for reminding me of something. I blacked out in my head. Definitely. The low point of the film was the introduction of the disgusting simpering creature known as james corden uh just subsuming the screen and his early genius.

Uh simpering face terrible terrible is one of those brits who they just give us and say here you take him now like a cursed amulet like that trampoline that uh he's like that trampoline that homer gets from uh krusty. When he goes to take it back. He takes out a shotgun and says keep on driving that's what happened with courtney. We tried to send him back and the brits were like nope. We rescinded his visa. He's yours now and it's like. I guess we'll put him on late night disgusting awful man simpering oaf talent void but yes thumbs down to the odious buster for jones boo to the odious busted jones. The cavity is truly not there. It's true. It's true so oh. This is one thing. I wanted to clear up so the uh the hard done by outcast cat jennifer. Hudson who plays who sings the terrible uh showstopper and is given the the the uh. She's she's taking to. She's taken to jellicle carousel at the end and put on a  hot air balloon. That's just a euphemism for her being killed right like being put down by like maybe. The pound comes around or like. Somebody has to get kicked out of like the warm spot and freeze on the street. She's dying right. It's it's it's euthanasia. I talked about eucalyn two things. Someone wants to talk about bolivia. I said my piece on bolivia uh on the show.

Today. It'll be out later tonight good news for once and for anybody who says cynically and I know that the instinct comes to me to think it. This is all this is only happening because moss has been uh in some way disciplined that the message has been seen sent and that ensures that there will be further there will be compliance in the future and you know what there was certainly an element of that to some degree. They wouldn't have they wouldn't have they would have pulled out more stops. I think if there was a real threat that they thought uh that that uh moss posed an existential you know danger in any way but uh but at the same time they only had to they still had to give power back because of popular pressure and that means. Popular pressure is still sufficient to advance like a unified interest uh in the face of all of the entrenched institutional deep state  and the connections to finance and global uh capital and that you know as conditions change. That power can be advanced forward especially because you got this victory under your belt. Like everything everything is a double-edged sword. All events have potential for disaster and an equal measure of triumphant. Only time will tell seems like a cop-out. But it's the only way to engage with the moment earnestly and in good faith when it happens instead of just writing things off because you've already made a decision that can't be made until conditions materialize.

Uh is castro a contender for all-time chat. You know. I was talking to brendan james about that the other day and I think that was exactly what we said. I think we actually said castro has to be the chad of history at least at least modern history. You know the condition the the industrial condition how do you get more chad that you're you're a fail-son lawyer who uh who has an absolutely failed attempt at a revolution. Just a ridiculous adventurous uh action that makes you get you in jail where you could very easily have been executed. But instead you give a historical stem-winding uh prison oration that gets you essentially a commuted sentence and then you go to mexico and then you borrow somebody's boat and come back and go into the mountains and take over and overthrow the government from that position and then look at the face of the the continent. The striding hegemon that had determined the fate of your country's politics since 1896 and uh 1898. I'm sorry uh and just say  off and then survive for 50 years of constant assassination attempts and undermining efforts and meanwhile to like establish a system that is rooted enough in some sort of social project that it was stands the fall of the soviet union which which very few other socialist states could uh and then also the death of castro himself. The the guy who was supposed to charismatically hold the whole thing together. It's it's it's mind-blowing and then you know just baseball player cigar fact that he just had an instinctive understanding of how not to get killed by the cia which which scuba suit not to wear just know that it's the one that doesn't have the fungus on it. That's going to make you choke to death in the water so that when when the woman is sent by the cia to kill you you seduce her and then get her to confess that she's there to kill you and give her a gun and say go ahead and do it and say you can't do it because no man can kill me come on chat well. I think the difference between tito and uh tim fidel can be in part shown by the fact what happened after each of them died uh and you know and after communism fell he had an ability to withstand uh.

He he he would he had created. He had helped coordinate the creation of institutions that were durable in a way that the ones created in yugoslavia or not. But I will say that yes one thing that tito had to deal with which uh caster did not is the whole ethnicity problem which is a real deal like it wasn't entirely ginned up cynically by guys like milosevic and tujman uh. After the fall of soviet union. It was certainly in part but it had been there and it had been simmering. I mean the ustasha really did that  czech the croats did a genocide. They they out nazi the nazis. Yes. That's the funny part. They all hate each other but they're all just turkish. I don't understand why all these turks are mad at each other. I hope nobody murders me because I said that yeah.

Uh the ustasha were the were the uh the guys who were most with this the catholic church was most directly involved in uh in helping to flee europe. After world war ii. It was called the rat line. It was a joint operation of the uh the catholic church and the oss to get the high level of stacia guys including ante pavlick the head dude out of uh croatia and into latin america. It's pretty wild like. I can see why there's hard feelings there and then of course you have like the civil war between like the czech knicks and the communists spider network indeed that's real stuff.


I did like siriana. Siriano was a was a good movie. It was one of the few uh hollywood products of the of the bush era that I think hold up analytically in any way. I mean obviously. It's very on the nose and sort of on its sleeve and and simplified in many ways. But you know. It's got a kind of social realist. Uh uh charm to it and clooney's very good in that as well that and that and michael clayton are my favorite clooney performances. I think besides oh besides the stuff of the cohens all of which I love. I love all of his stuff. He's he's they're so good getting getting the the idiot out of him. I will say this about clooney has obviously made bad movies and he is you know in his convictions and aesthetic preferences. He is a very stayed uh uh you know lib. Like clearly you know the bogus of standard libs you could get and therefore not terribly interesting when he sets out to create like uh self-conscious works of heart. Like all of his directorial efforts and stuff they're mediocre at best but I will say this about the guy one thing you can say about as a measure of a a-list actor's commitment to you know actually trying to be an artist in some way any way you can in that world. It's directly related to how often they play cops and it's not because of any ab a-cab  or worrying about propaganda. It's just because police officer is the most boring bog standard job. You can have in a movie and movies where the protagonist as a cop tend to be boring and fog standard in some way because that's like the default thing is hey. He's a cop doing x and then you have implied drama and action. It's like it's it's just a big bowl of ice cream for everybody always and so if you're always a cop. It's like you kind of don't really care about anything other than what people are going to want to watch and clooney has almost never played a cop. I think the only time he's played an actual like the closest thing to a cop was when he was a marshall in um a us marshall a desk guy though uh in um after reading so I'll give him that like look at a guy like bruce willis.

On the other hand. He basically only plays cops just just shoots half those movies while in his trailer. So I'll give I'll give clooney that. I think he's still trying to do work even if his instincts aren't that great there's intention behind it which hey is not true of most of those guys so I'll give them the glad hand tm lex g yeah. I would like to get tubin on to do some uh some supreme court analysis maybe we could get him in age. He could we could have him come out in a judge's robe that's cut off right above here. So it's actually just sort of like a judge's tank top and you can see he's winnie the poohing it oh yeah. Clooney is also a big propagandist. I believe he actually like funded the creation of a uh satellite to like uh hover over sudan to prevent the sudanese from doing any more genocides which I'm pretty sure is like part of some rube goldberg contraption of like neoliberal clampdown in africa like some yeah like it's part of the spoke of some like surveillance wheel. That's part of you know the molly uh uh uh installations and and like you know the special operations headquarters and djibouti and the  I'm talking about I'm talking about the product. I'm talking about the product you. People we've gotten to the point where the personal is political has been so absorbed and the idea of the gramscian cultural hegemony being like this sole vector of reinforcement of capitalist relationships that we get.

We can't think in any terms other than uh ideologically ooh the best halloween candy certainly not candy corn which is disgusting uh and vile but of course if it's on a table. I will eat it if it is presented to me. It will be eaten by me and I will at least one occasion. Maybe two give myself vampire fangs that will happen but I will not like it. I really. I gotta say guys. I don't know if I like candy anymore. I think I ran out of candy love. I mean I kind of got. I got gentrified taste now like as soon as. I got. My first taste of like a a dark chocolate covered almond like that's delicious. I want that I don't want. I don't want hershey's. It's just too. It's coin. I'm afraid. I'm a sophisticated now. I'm a dreaded member of the pmc. Grifter over class which means I must have the finest suites. I must get the 499 tub of trader's joe salt salted dark chocolate covered almonds thoughts on garibaldi uh pimp what other word do you want to describe him with uh. Like you could say that like john brown was like the american garibaldi uh and garibaldi just was operating in a little better uh tactical environment. They both they both had problematic age gaps in their relationships though and I would say to my italian american brothers and sisters that if you really have to have a day you really got to have a day for your people uh fine but how about garibaldi he's right here. Hey he's a better guard what's so wrong with him huh. He's a gold. I mean he's the guy who actually created an italy in the first place for you guys to be italian around and I know the idea is like well. Columbus like is the american part but again not united states of america a concept of america that they don't encompass at all in their self concept as italian americans. It's an entirely different national identity from anything columbus did yeah and garibaldi did go to. He was in argentina doing  pimp but I honestly don't know why the italians need a guy. I mean who else has a day the irish have a day. I guess.

It's whoever was in whoever was in the big ethnic east coast machines that like ran the democratic party for a while that was their version of identity politics that was the identity politics part of the material. The care the material and cultural case uh for the democratic party in the 20th century was yeah. We give you patriots jobs and suburban houses with union benefits and also we give you a day for your people. Okay just imagine fdr like old patrician blue blood fdr going yes yes would you guys would you people like a day. Perhaps they got to be like yeah. We're part of the team we're part of the ruling class. It's like yeah. Sure you are buddy thus perpetuating false consciousness. It's a devious game but germans don't have a day. I mean oktoberfest doesn't count. I'm sorry and it's just what it's just because we fought a couple world wars against them. I'm sorry. But they make proportionally the largest percentage of like european extracted americans. Now uh the whole thing is. I don't care about it either way really. It's just kind of a thing. That's one of those things.

I have a hard time getting my mind in the getting myself in the mindset of yo god how about an english day where we just eat. Disgusting potted meats how about that fourth of july is the opposite of a british holiday. I guess technically because the people who did it were british citizens thoughts on the carbonari. I'll tell you right now. I could go for some chicken carbonari. It sounds delicious. Someone keeps asking me about nicotine. What why how would you have me profitably discourse on nicotine. It's an addictive substance that is utilized in the sale of uh tobacco-based products. They're a drug that has been successfully synthesized. It's it's a market has been successfully successfully synthesized into the workings of uh the aboveboard capitalist economy unlike drugs like marijuana or cocaine or what have you scheduled narcotics but is essentially the same thing as a scheduled narcotic in terms of its market I i know I shouldn't respond when people just kind of rep spam comments but that one was baffling just because it seemed so left field and I was hoping. Maybe there would be a follow-up but it doesn't look like I'm getting a follow-up. It looks like once again. I am lashed to the mast eternally to be tormented by the pelican-like shrieks and pecks of my demented followers as they fail to engage me in good faith on my twitch streaming platform instead finding it humorous to distract me with non-sequitur questions and trolling and also mistruths that lead me on uh wild goose chases. But I understand my. Uh. The twitch stream is sort of my instant karma. You know it's like I'm getting back everything. I put into the world as it happens. I know that's not technically accurate but that's how it feels all right guys. I think. I'm uh I'm done for the day.

Maybe one more question before I say goodbye horror movie. I'm gonna say a movie that I just went on my uh your kickstarter sucks to talk about with uh jesse and uh and at dog boner. I love that I love that handle uh return of the living dead halloween classic. You can't go wrong with that one speaking of films that came out of the romero uh the branch off the romero tree of zombie films great film check. It out wonderful mix of horror and comedy wonderful effects. Great performances. The wonderful james karen we love to see him and folks here look dan kalfa. It's cold for folks look at him. He's already coated bruner. He's the board tradition. Okay. He cuts up the bodies and also look at this. He's a nazi. He's a nazi mortician. It's crazy folks. You wouldn't believe it was happening but you gotta watch it. It's right there send more paramedics. Hey america. Hey world send more paramedics.
