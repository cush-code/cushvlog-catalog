There we go if you like penis colossus in your mouth or your butt come with me and we'll have some and you will get a nut if you like getting sucked at midnight let me bust in your face. I'm sorry. This is a family stream that's really awful. I shouldn't say that oh crap. I forgot that re-post this guy honey. I gotta re-boast this thing here ah bubble ball all right. What about this pardon me. I'm just finagling all right yeah that'll be fine. You can hear me right turn. The volume up a little bit all right yeah. I'm sorry about the e4 thing on yesterday. Just we could not get it to work. We could not get the stream to go the like the obs thing to process the goddamn thing. I don't know why it was chris doing it. I trust that he did everything he could so sorry about that maybe we can make it work after the tour. I don't know okay hi folks so we can't sadly do universal universe alice. Although honestly I was kind of wondering what I'd even be able to do because it just looking at the screen made me feel overwhelmed but what we can do is.

We can talk about the next two chapters of this here book first class passengers on a sinking ship by richard lachman about the last two countries to make a stab a successful stab in lachman's opinion which is not shared by all at hegemony before declining and being replaced by another hegemon. Those being the dutch republic. Those delightful freaks those mayonnaise-eating swamp germans with their hilariously made up language which is it's absurdly precisely halfway between german and english. It's like a joke language like if you were going to make up a a joke language between those two countries. What would it sound like it would be dutch but anyway so those freaks had a short moment in the sun as a global him on setting the terms after the decline of the failed attempted hegemony made by the spanish habsburgs and before the french had their failed attempt right. I guess simultaneously yeah the dutch golden age runs at about the same time the french are making a play for continental hegemony but if they were going to get it they would have taken it from the dutch in the late 17. The late 1800s I'm sorry in the late 17th century 16 late 1600s because the dutch golden age starts winding down. In the latter decades of the 17th century the pizza of westphalia actually ended up kind of kicking their ass.

 peace was was was the engine of the sort of the elite consensus that had powered them to that point of hegemony and then once they get peace they're kind of and then they fight the british and they lose even though they have more money than the british. That's when louis the louis. Xiv is trying to make his stab and failing before the british take it up so we get failed spaniards. Then the dutch actually achieve a short hegemony. They falter britain and france vie for it. The french the british take it pretty conclusively at after the seven years war.

That's the end that's the that's the eclipse of france until you have the brief explosion under napoleon when they you know are able to create a modern state sort of almost overnight that is able to make up for their relatively backward colonial position by just wiping out elite conflict completely with a guillotine but that was because it was a conquest regime not the kind of commercial consensual empire yes certainly also coerced but not only coerced or not largely coerced. The problem for the napoleonic style of empire is that you cannot get sufficient buy-in from local elites to make to make governing it a winning proposition in the long term. They will eventually revolt because they're not seeing enough money because it's all being hovered up into the metropole because it has to be sent back to the provinces in the form of pay for your administrators for your civil and military administrators.

Whereas the consensual empires are able to enlist local elites get them on board because they are cut in essentially on on the deal of course at the bottom. You're getting a pointy end of the bayonet. No matter what but with more elite buy-in you have a more stable civil order that means it's cheaper to administer which means you get more money out of your colonies and that meant that in the long run if if if a conquest regime like like napoleon's france or germany's hitler's germany later once you can no longer expand you're. Whereas a capitalist hegemony can extend that horizon artificially whereas the the conquest regime is mired in the need to dominate a finite space that will not allow for infinite conquest and you're not even get with with formal conquest.

You don't even have to wait till to get to the edge of the globe to run out of room you'll run out well earlier than that because of the amount of friction with other polities and within the ones you've dominated that is going to accumulate all right so last. We left the book the spaniards because they have this autarky rule where you have a dynasty on top trying to create a centralized state but having to contend with localized authority that is essentially independent and then is only able to reproduce that relationship in its colonial holdings. So you have a bunch of independent landowners independent aristocrats who will send back as much tribute to spain as they feel like they need to to avoid too much hassle the rest they will keep to themselves. They will send out into the trade networks of rival powers.

They just bled out as they were trying to fill their empire because the hose was leaky basically and it just kept getting leakier as the power in the colonies increased as american elites became more influential back in spain so when the dutch who started off as a rebellious province of the habsburg spanish empire. This is the amazing thing they are a fraction of the spanish holdings but what they were was. They were the most economically fertile the most urbanized part of their empire which meant that they were going to be able to create local regimes of administrative capacity that and and and just a sheer engineering ability increased efficiency of operations that your big lumbering empire cannot contend with so eventually not only did they break away and they were hegemonic in the process of fighting spain. Like that's when the dutch golden age really begins after the because the truce the the 12 years truce and the 80 years war between spain and holland that went from 1609 to 1621 is the space where the dutch were able to establish. They were. They got the breathing room on the seaways of the world where previously they've been fighting against the spanish. They gave them the breathing room to turn their nascent colonial holdings that they had built up in an attempt to you know get around habsburg rule. They were able to turn those into durable sources of economic activity. They were able to create networks that brought incredibly valuable global spices and resources two to the netherlands where it was able to be turned into capital and then they used that capital during the second half of the eight years war which coincided with the second two thirds or which coincides almost completely with the 30 years war. both ended with the treaty of westphalia in 18 1648. By the end of that they had established a genuine hegemonic relationship to the other merchantile empires competing in europe but it didn't last more than 20 years after that. Why now first we have to say why did the sp. Why did netherlands why was netherlands able to build a capacity for hegemony and we look here. We find the same answer as we found in spain in spain. There could be no hegemony hegemony because the polity of the spanish emp of spain of the iberian union.

 was made up of these local orders of aristocratic military rule that had been the people who had fought off the moors who had kicked the infidel. muslims out of spain and in so doing had established firm legal tenure over the lands in their domains that means legal control of the of the output of their peasants and of the legal system that their citizens in the countryside and in this nascent small cities spain did not have it was not industrialized. I'm sorry spain was not urbanized nearly to the degree that the low countries were at this point because nobody was you know. This is before you really see the post-black death explosion that's because people think of the the reconquista as this is this thing that happens in 1498 or 1492. It is a 300 year long process and that over the course of it these military orders come up kick out. Parts of spanish or overthrow sultans and emirs replace them with their own regimes of power over everything and that meant that when it was time to try to create a dynamic modern state those power centers were there to resist it for their own individual interests as opposed. Now you have essentially the opposite situation in the low countries in the very the the the the place that would be the netherlands.

 essentially has no real aristocracy after the fall of the the charlemagne dynasty. The original holy roman empire that encompassed northern italy and france as well as germany. The one that collapsed almost immediately as soon as charlemagne's kids started fighting over over fighting with one another. The first thing to go was was was that area and it was never really It was only ever lightly governed by independent counts.

 the peasantry were essentially free. There was there were very few feudal obligations that they owed to their you know their accounts and which were almost entirely in the form of like a yearly tithes. Just the old you know the the feudal thing of like you know you owe me x amount of your barley or whatever the for the year. But no labor requirements which was a huge part of feudalism was labor obligations like two weeks of two weeks a month or I'm sorry you know like a national guard service like you know one weekend a month and then two weeks a year. You've got to work on my on the the lord's property. The lord's private property and you provide free labor so that they could have their own agricultural surplus that they don't have to put a finger on that is done but as contribute contribute contribution labor from the local peasantry which is enforced by a legal system which is controlled by the aristocracy.

Only on top of that is like a later larger dynastic royal authority in place that never existed in the netherlands. The the peasants at most owed some either rent or Some other surplus to their alleged lord. They were not enmeshed in a feudal relationship with him and part of that is because of how um labor how capital intensive making that part of europe profitable as an agricultural endeavor was because it was a bunch of putting money in and if there's one thing that these spendthrift aristocrats of europe whose entire economic their entire role in the economy was to consume not to reinvest as under account under capitalism but to consume they're not going to castle and sometimes like fight my cousins for entertainment and and go to balls and listen to bowels balls listen to brass band music have my little jester dance for me. I don't need to worry about like oh what like we gotta supervise putting in the dikes we we gotta design. It.

You want me to tell you like what shape the fan blades or the windmills should be that is a pain in my ass and I don't need it because whatever you guys make. I get a portion of it. The only people who are motivated to do the work of clearing that land of create putting up the dyke systems that could irrigate it that could power mills with wind were the peasants so the infrastructure of the low countries was built by peasant communities like essentially cooperatives that where people pitched in their own labor instead of giving it as tribute to their overseer. Their own labor to the project of building a dam building a windmill what that means is that when first of all when spain tries to impose a greater tax burden on these independent burgers because what happens when this occurs is it brings people into cities and all of a sudden. These farmers are moving into cities and you have these these dense urban agglomerations where consumption happens because if you're in the city you're not growing your own food. You're not making your own clothing and that creates mark demand demand that can be filled and it also gets people together to figure out things like how to build better. ship fishing boats so that dutch dutch fishing fleets can trap more goddamn fish than anybody and have more surplus from the sale of the fish allowing more and more land in the netherlands to go towards creation of consumables. not not directly as food but as elements of a greater consumer economy thing that goes into clothing things that go into stained glass windows or or little dancing puppets.

Whatever the all the economic activity that comes from getting a bunch of people together and that creates this new independent urban elite never part of the aristocratic structure. The aristocrats the few that there were were getting are giving each other head injuries in their castles and sitting on their sufficient. If tribute like if they really want more they'll go get more territory and if they if they try and fail they get killed and then somebody else takes over the logic is always the same among the aristocrats. I'm not investing any money anywhere you give me what you have. And if it's not enough we take over other people's. It's the robber baron logic that that is at the heart of the military bandit class that ascended after the fall of the roman empire to to to assert some level of security at the base level to allow for commerce so that means you've got.

These independent city folk literate ones who have they hear about about the same time that the spanish are turning on the screws and demanding more in taxes and demanding more administrative control. Over these self-governing cities. This is not like a traditional aristocratic over class. This is a foreign aristocracy because there is no local aristocracy they've been overthrown. You've got the house of orange and a few other guys. That's it in the in the in the poorer provinces. Because remember. It's 12 provinces that end up getting independent. At first They get more later but they are not all equally rich.

They don't and are not all equally urbanized. Some of them become places that contribute agriculturally to cities that are in other provinces namely amsterdam. The big one the heart the the the city that is essentially the other day too big compared to everything else in the netherlands to allow for hegemony to be established and not so quickly undermined. So they're getting martin luther and john calvin and all these store and all this and this and the geneva salter giving them a culture of religious resistance to the catholicism that undercurrents the habsburg monarchy at the same time that they are becoming independent economic actors. So of course they revolt and they're able to successfully fight off at least in the north a big this army and it's because you have a unified elite who have a who are able to align their interests around the central goal of getting independence and what's this the way to get independence build a durable commercial empire and though they do things like they create the dutch east india company and they and they create 

Then later. The west india company and now these are not just. This is not sending out a bunch of pirates to just grab something and then say it's theirs and then like just right basically have them buy a piece of paper from the king. That says they own it and then lets them do whatever they want. These are administrative bodies. They are not technically part of the dynasty or I mean they're not technically like state-owned.

But they're staffed with the members of a single class of of largely amsterdam merchants and so it is through that it is with that end in mind that unified end that they carry out their colonial endeavors and they're so much more successful than spain is at getting money back to the metropole because there's no independent power occluding here and that's how they're able to build this this this dynamo and that's why they're the kings of the slave trade and then eventually the the the spanish have to piggyback on and at first the british do too have to piggyback on dutch trade networks in order to get anything out of their colonies. But oh though what's interesting though is that eventually they get these things built but then the the cost of war begins to overwhelm the benefits coming from the the expansion to fight it and the dutch burgers who are paying the vast majority of the cost of the war. Holland and amsterdam in particular are the by far.

The most heavy contributors to the state coffers. Everybody else is essentially free riding on the dutch or on the the holland economy but those places are filled those those places where they're making like produce and agriculture. They benefit from high wartime prices. They actually. have a vested interest in seeing the war continue forever but they're losing money in the in the merchant capitals and so in the face of resistance from guys like the house of orange who were the military heads of the effort. Because none of these burgers could marshal that kind of authority. That kind of authority did still reside in the the room. The the aristocracy that they did have that passed for an aristocracy native aristocracy in the netherlands and that was mainly the house of orange disproportionately the house of orange compared in a way that isn't true in other dynasties where you had a much greater competition of large dynastic families. Big houses in gambo terms great houses rather and so there's this material interest split on the question of the war. The duck the the amsterdam merchants get their way and there is a there is a truce but their whole time during the truce. There's this political war over whether to extend it or end it and go back to war with the spain and it becomes expressed as a religious war between people who are hardcore calvinists and those are the war party. The people who are making who made more money selling their agricultural products under the war conditions people who were refugees from the southern netherlands who wanted their their property back and could only get it if they were reclaimed or liberated or wherever you wanted to put it and then you had the amsterdam. Merchants who just didn't want to pay any more money and were happy to see these thriving net the commercial networks being able to be butt up unmolested in peacetime conditions and they are the ones who support this guy arminius who says actually you know what maybe it's not predestination.

Maybe god isn't such a sadistic monster that he dooms people to eternity and hellfire before they are born. Like that is basically burning ants with a magnifying glass. If god is good. God does not do that and that becomes this our alternative calvinism and they go to war and eventually the war party wins because the military power of the shot holder is able to essentially repo populate the the the judiciary with members of the war party because of their wartime powers and that leads to the leading armenians getting executed including john ban alden barvan barveld who is the head of the the the peace party and it's it's it is declared by the cyanide of dort. It's declared um. Heretical and calvinism is affirmed now that doctrine that alternative understanding of grace and free will ends up being the kernel of methodism later which is ends up basically swamping calvinism in america because conditions get different conditions get better basically because we're in america and we're able to secularly satisfy a lot of the stuff that we used to have to satisfy spiritually and intellectually so we can make do with methodism and I think that that is the split in the bourgeois psyche that ends up emerging is between the calvinists the god's will is wrought by deed.

 those who suffer are suffer at his command. Those who prosper prosper at his command. That is the that's the pointy end of capitalism that that there's people who were slave owners and who now are small business owners and the other one. The armenianism that is the christianity of the soft-handed merchants who don't have to extract because they live in the They don't have to extract because they live in the abstract realm of exchange where all the violence is done elsewhere. They have been temporarily and spatially fixed away from it. So they can have this fantasy that they're good people and that god is judging their works as they live which is otherwise an unsustainable belief. Under capitalism. The dutch invented the slave trade basically the whole time they're having this fight they are literally inventing the slave trade but as soon as they create this new unif so the for a minute for the for a while.

The the burgers of amsterdam are sort of overthrown. The war starts up again but dutch and economic fortunes are still great because they've built this machine that is so much more effective than what the rickety-ass spanish can put together even though they can draw on theoretically more resources. Eventually they become the entrepreneur of europe. Amsterdam is is the the finance capital of europe. The war ends the burgers naturally solidify power and this is where you're doomed because bachmann's entire thesis. Lachman's entire thesis hears that the the specific arrangement of forces in elite relation. These the specific alignment of elite forces that can create hegemony cannot sustain it because having hegemony creates new challenges new challenge. new challenges new conditions that that fixed relationship of elites cannot address and so therefore it it declines because lochman is is really does believe something that I do too that you cannot really have a reform from within a given hegemonic elite structure. It has to just destroy itself because it has complete command if it didn't. It wouldn't be hegemonic that's scary because a lot of us imagine revolution is this salvation from below but only under conditions of collapse that have already been created by that failure of the elite structure. To adapt can you have a revolutionary situation which means you cannot avoid the disaster.

You cannot avoid the emergency you cannot avoid the horror. See somebody says the calvinist response to the frying of the magnifying glasses. Thing is that whatever god does is inherently good if god god's god does not get to decide what's good. God's goodness cannot be different than human goodness because that assumes a universal unbridgeable distance between people and god and the entire point of religion. I thought was to bridge that gap calvinists reify it into an eternal abstract reality. You can logic your way into saying and that's what calvinism is. It's a logic game. It's replacing the rosary. It replaces the physical rosary with this intellectual rosary instead of feeling god in your hand. You're supposed to make him real in your head logically rationally re-convince yourself because you can't feel it anymore you can't feel it. You can roll this things but they just feel like wood. You can't feel it so you have to think it and so that means you have to make god essentially into a rational human mind. But rational human mind is a is a is a construct a expression of a greater total truth that is called god and that is I think the only real thing that you can.

The only real blasphemy is the blasphemy against that and that's what the horror that we live in is that we are trapped in a religious tradition that because of its need to dot create and sustain class rule has now enshrined in the hearts of almost all living beings. A heretical view of god as a separate thing and people walk around thinking that that that that they're honoring god when in fact they're creating an idol by needing it to fulfill needing god to fit into your box that is the horror of the of the of the christian tradition. Specifically others are like this too in their own way but I don't know them as well but the the the tradition of saying that we have to justify faith logically and the thing is you only have to do that as a not as a theoretical not as a spiritual or theological problem as a practical consideration of the persistence of class rule because we should not have to justify god logically if we felt god in our interactions with one another. If we lived in a community without exploitation without what's the big a alienation the snake in the garden.

If we did not have somebody taking someone else's sweat right in front of them and then having to call it good. There would be no need to justify god as an abstract concept. What would you need that for you need to do that because your the world you see calls god one thing and the people whose name people say the name while striking down their fellow man. How the hell are you supposed to believe in god in that situation we better prove it to you like we just stopped feeling god because we were no longer able to sustain the fiction the social fiction that that that that that god like was a force in our lives. It would have to be something that we have to call towards ritually inscribe ritually rituals. The only difference in catholics and protestants is the refinement of the ritual away from actual acts like carnivals and and masses and and eucharist and sacraments and a book symbols.

On a page that you look at and think about those were the dutch the kings of that they spread across the globe but what they did in doing that was they created a fixed new hierarchy that was not going to be able to adapt when the conditions changed when mainly when the british created their own structure that was capable of doing the same thing the dutch were and started competing with them on a relatively equal footing as soon as that happened. the dutch were required to to change things to change the compas the the general thrust of their of their political economic engine but because the families that had created the dutch east india company the dutch west indi the west india company had written it into the contracts of the founding of the companies that their families would control their seats forever trying to create essentially a new aristocracy within the commercial economy. It meant that if fighting the british hey we actually we need to increase military spending here. If we're gonna actually compete with the british we might not have to like you know build more ships we might have to invest more the amsterdam burgers. no we want low taxes please no taxes please and they had the ability to veto anything because the the the united provinces the dutch republic allowed any province to veto any proposal and so amsterdam had essentially a veto over every policy which meant that they could not adjust and they got their. Asses eight now then the french go for it louis.

Xiv tries to take over spain after the war of spanish succession invades the holy. Roman empire go gives it a shot but he didn't realize that the game was not going to be won or lost. In europe. It was going to be the one and lost in the colonies and the french just as we talked about for other reasons and we talked about in previous chapters. They did not have the capacity to to really compete colonially who did the british who come in and create the longest yet durable hegemony of the capitalist era about a hundred years. Although again some people disagree some people say the british never actually held a chimney if you define hegemony as more you have a greater put out on any given axis like you have a bigger army than the next two rivals or you have a bigger manufacturing sector than the next two rivals and the two rivals standard. The british barely ever dominated anything during that whole period. But I think if you take hegemony to mean setting the rules for a global trade network which I think is makes sense and definitely is the way that the united states could be defined as a hegemony then.

I think that this is a good standard and um and the british certainly for that 19th century really they had it they held it and part of the reasons is that after 1688 glorious revolution where the british commercial bourgeois that had struggling that had been so powerful that had been able to punch through the dynastic system. In the 1640s kill a king but could not stabilize a a non-monarchical structure to negotiate elite conflict which is what a government is. They couldn't build a new leviathan so they had to have cromwell step in to fill the gap and then they brought back the stewards and james. The second went catholic which was essentially the second version of the stewards trying to fight what was coming which was the overthrow of the dynastic ruling family and its positioned atop this um this this post-feudal aristocratic military order that's falling apart that can't compete with the dynamic center of capital in the cities and it's again defined religiously. Catholics versus protestants this time but again on top of the same basic interest structures and they literally import a dutch king to come in and have him agree after basically a job interview to rule as a reduced sovereign who would essentially be there as a backstop and mainly just as a avatar of process. A ritual reaffirmation of like the agreed upon rule set that the bourgeois the rising bourgeois we're going to use to govern in parliament and so that means that like the dutch the british are able to create these companies.

These chartered companies like the east india company and allow them to acting as independent con corporate entities but connected to the british state and crucially required to provide a vast amount of of rents and loans to the british state that was the condition of the east india company and the other companies being chartered is you're kicking back a ton of this money to to old john bull and they were able to create a a structure that was capable of busting open india and turning it into this massive cash cow with the money being directed towards this this new center and because again this is a staffed bureaucracy and not a bunch of independent free booting would be failing aristocrats and like up jumped boot buccaneers like in spain their employees. They are able to be constrained in their ability to operate independently of the metropole except or and they are able to exercise though individual initiative. This is the crucial thing but and that any individual initiative pulled the british state deeper and deeper into india probably against its own wishes but in so doing without anyone knowing it building these like roots that would end up taking a hold and creating this insane money or a capital machine that just pulls estimates of trillions of dollars.

I believe 45 trillion dollars is the estimated amount of wealth taken from india during the during the east india era and the raj afterwards but instead of that action creating independent power power bases. What it really did was it built a incredibly robust british state and bureaucracy that when the time came when the east india company was cutting too many quarters pissing off too many natives doing something like revoke provoking the great indian mutiny the sepoy rebellion as they used to call it in 16 in 1857 they were able to just nationalize the unlike in the netherlands where the those companies operated as these independent fiefdoms their entire existence because because the burgers could veto the more um all the money coming into england created a unified elite block in england that was able to exercise influence through parliament. The interests of rural landowners and industrialists and commercial merchants and financiers all came together around extracting resources from the colonies domestically manufacturing products in england and then distributing them to both a well-established internal market and also to through the rest of its um colonial holdings that was a state capable of just having a vote and saying yeah east india company that's now the that's now a british arm of the british. state department because the big the big money thing that people had were not shares in the east india company. Although plenty of people did it was shares of government debt. It was it was it was it was it was corporate bonds. It was stocks so they are able to um absorb the estenia company and create the bellapoc of england as the victorian era when they were the the dominant force on the planet.

The proof I would say the ultimate proof that the british the english in the 19th century were absolutely hegemonic in a way that the united states later became is that one of the most important contributing factor factors to the failure of reconstruction had nothing to do with armed resistance by racist whites in the south. the johnson the disastrous johnson administration corruption or anything else. It was the goddamned gold standard which was imposed by the city of london on the rest of the world if the united states did not want to get completely. In its trade with the british and the british were their number one trade ally after or number one trade partner had been since the revolution because who else was there to trade with nobody else had the networks like the stiff-necked aristocrats. At least recognized that the british were the actual ones who were buying stuff so the u.s if it wanted to maintain a decent trade with britain and not end up having its it's in its currency inflated away in value by a run on its money. It had to stay on the gold standard. Now it didn't have to and I think there was a politics a greenback politics that guys like benjamin butler represented that could have fended off that but it would have required the full emancipation of southern slaves instead of the failed attempt to do so. That right reconstruction became but one of the things that made that made that made that thing inevitable was that in a context where there was great resistance to the imposition of reconstruction there was basically an incapacity at the federal government level to deal with economic conditions by increasing people's livelihoods. The entire period was this deflationary era. When these cyclical panics would destroy the economy and then there would be no federal aid possible because there could be no debt run-up it could be. You could not just print more money. So that's how and that's and that was a decision not made in dc. Although the majority of people in both parties wanted it that way because they were creatures of american capital which.

Was essentially a symbiotic creature connected to british finance capital but it could have been fought from below but we didn't get it. We didn't get a real fight against it sadly but that's a hegemonic. power let's get to this but that's only india the other thing you have is the settler colonies north america. oceania those are where the problem comes in. That is where your hegemony gets up the spaniards which is independent power accruing in the colonies. Now the place where independent power accrued the most broke off the united states. The other places did not have sufficient to resist fully british power but they still had a capacity to extract concessions and you see in those other countries. A willingness after the u.s is lost to a seed to successions largely because the british throttled america the way they did in part because they didn't think they could afford to lose the revenues they were getting. There. They couldn't afford to bleed out to the us developing its own independent trade networks because it did not have us anything else to back that up. it's it was still nascently in india when the other settler colonies start acting up. India had been well established then as a huge money winner a huge a huge resource like american cotton could be replaced by indian cop A slave labor in the caribbean could be literally imported from india so you could give the colonists more of what they wanted. You could give them more leeway and the other thing what making them want to get more leeway is that eventually this independent ruling elite or this this united ruling elite which again it's composed of everybody most of the old aristocrats who were landowners. They brought themselves into the finance economy. The the mission the the manufacturers had the merchants had everybody. It bought into the financial economy so they had all settled around a common interest around free trade and a strong pound which means weak public investment free trade in a strong pound means you can't print.

Money means you make money for capitalists through profit but you cannot return it to anybody who made it now. That's fine in the colonies because they don't count. They're out of your. your your social structure but they will still resist and they'll resist everywhere where they feel that they're being squeezed. This way and the states has an interest in being able to deal with that but what stops them from being able to is that these independent settler colonial elites are able to demand things like their own tariffs to build up their own domestic industries which british manufacturing which you need you can't cut out the heart of manufacturing or else your financialized economy will eventually blow away in the wind of fluctuating macro conditions which is exactly what happened to the english they could. They were they stopped their their dyna. The dynamic unifying elite that went out and conquered became completely resistant to actually paying for a every british aristo and and merchant and and shop owner. anybody with a a piece of stock with their name on it spent the entire british empire era bitching about how much it cost and they were paying a incredibly low rate. They they didn't. There was a doubling of the tax rate after reform finally kicks in that takes the top tax rate to like 7.4 percent and that was doubling the previous amount and they have the ability because of that control of parliament to shoot down the sort of investment in an actual military that could allow you to defend an empire instead of eventually give away so much to these peripheral elites that you're essentially competing with them so that means that by the time the americans and the germans catch up in the late 1800s they're manufacturing base is collapsing. Let me read some crazy about about how how how quickly british manufacturing collapsed at the very end of the 19th century. Let me see if I can find this but this thing like it created this insane wealth. Just this huge jump of wealth at the top. It also raised wages which is what minimized domestic like the domestic labor war like that.

That's a big reason that britain never really developed. I mean they got a labor party but they never really developed a meaningful I mean I remember like lenin lenin for example was like the british aren't gonna do it and a big reason for that is that that empire did have spoils and raise wages went up and the ability to do a thing like go be. A colonial officer or go make it into one of the colonies was a live option that diffused a lot of social conflict but eventually by the 18 late 1800s not only are they having to fight like other white people which means you can't use colonial troops. Many most of the wars fought in the 19th century were with colonial troops indians mostly so they could get killed all the time and it wouldn't matter but then you get the boer war you can't have you can't have indians getting used to killing white men. So you gotta use all white guys and that pisses people off and it costs a lot of money. They want to spend less of it.

But the reason that this your manufacturing gets killed is that bank consolidation sucks all the money out of the local economies into foreign investments because that's where the highest rate of return is nobody wants to invest in local businesses so that means that local manufacturers which is most of them don't consolidate. They don't get the um influx of credit that they got in north america and in germany which is an industrial policy that can't be carried out in england. What with the desire of the of the of the financier is is the desire of the ruling class unif in the unit in dominance if not unison and so they say no dice so that means that local manufacturing falls behind. It doesn't consolidate. It doesn't get the the The competitive advantages that the consolidating manufacturing sectors of of north america and germany get and it starts falling behind let me find this goddamn. Idiot suffice it to say in the late 19th century. The english british manufacturing output is absolutely collapsing which means that they're losing on a bunch of other axis including militarily which means when the big war comes they're and they turn and decline and then who's there to pick up the ball. People who are able to take all those who are able to at a later date consolidate a different and more dynamic set of elite interests into one unified elite interest but you know because there are fewer resources and we finally hit a global maximum the time before crisis emerges and something has to change is much shorter which means decline sets in even faster and we are now in the decline phase because we have an elite that cannot be challenged from without all of their interests are arrayed against one.

Another or all their interests are arrayed against a general interest because they have created structures that give them the ability to overrule. They used to have a unified interest with the state so they could together steer it. But now the state has an interest in like taking their money. The state has an interest in breaking their political power. The state has an interest in radically reducing their share of of profits but they build structures that ensure that that is the one thing the system can't do. It's like how robocop can't kill anybody who works for ocp like yeah if they're unified they're unified in resistance to any centralizing oversight. Now. They all think it's for their own reasons but they they are all still motivated collectively in that direction and even there. Though there are sectors and specific power structures that aren't they get swamped. Now the question is what happens next like the decline of these previous henchmans is relative. They don't stop being powers. They don't stop having economies that make a lot of money for their elites. They don't stop having a functioning political economy and social structure. They're just no longer in the driver's seat. The difference now is that america decline does not appear to offer a viable alternative. China is the one everyone talks about where again elites have emerged later to deal with some of those problems oh the chinese actually can where they need to explorate. They're not. They're not programmed to not be able to excorporate. But I the problem I see with that is that this the structural problems we have are so deep that they go beyond simply redistributing on top of a capitalist political economy because we're exacerbating with every action. The crisis conditions more than any human action can address them.

We're behind the eight ball all right here. It is all right britain's international investments and the ease with which british investment firms facilitated. The transfer of capital around the world helped firms in other countries borrow the money needed for industrialization which then made competitors for british industry. This led to a boom in industrial production worldwide but a decline in profits which hit the less efficient older. British firms harder than newer technologically advanced and vertically integrated american and german corporations does. Anyone does this sound familiar to anybody man. He's a scholar on these subjects who defines hegemony as exceeding the next two powers combined finds that britain met that standard for industrial production between 1860 and 1880. On a per capita basis its industrial production was more than double the next two powers. From the 1830s to the 1880s britain still retained first rank in the um all right sorry on a per capita basis. Its industrial production was more than double the next two partners from the 1830s to the 1880s. Britain still retained first rank in 1900 falling behind the united states by 1913 by which time total u.s industrial production was 250 percent of britain's and germany had surpassed britain britain accounted for a third of world industrial output in 1870 and a seventh in 1913. It produced a third of world seal in the late 1870s and a 10th in 1909 to 1913 when germany produced twice as much and the united states quadrupled british output chronic trade chronic trade deficits were clear indicators of britain's declining position in the world economy. Now that's a problem that we don't really have that's only marginally ours because we took financialization farther than the british could have possibly done it because of technological innovations. But we are still in a general downward trajectory because of an inability to maintain a domestic real economy.

Because there are knock-on effects of that one of which is there's somebody other than these freak elites able to exercise political power. There's another thing that is able to sit at an elite table but is not composed of actual elites only I guess you'd call them labor aristocrats if you're thinking globally you're able to bring to the table actual workers who's who do not wish to see the state destroyed and replaced by private power completely. Because the state is what built them. They are fused to it in a way that can't be the same with the ruling elites who all imagine themselves as having emerged first and for the state to have been imposed upon them. Now at the base level. It's meaningless distinction but psychologically and culturally and socially. It's very important so like you've got. For example these local extraction capitalists in america.

The the small bourgeois of the big bourgeois the beautiful boaters whatever you want to call them you know from the koch brothers and the teals at the top to to skilled electricians with mortgages at the bottom if you want to be totally open with it but of course not equally powerful not equally accessible to direct energy which is why talking about them as one group is kind of dumb and it just becomes a question of like moral. moral oblique like oh you're bad because you're part of this coalition right but at a certain level. You're just talking about people who are rooting for a team like oh. They might vote and that might contribute to something in an aggregate but individually individually. They have as much moral power as the sports fans especially compared to the other members of this broad. Coalition who actually are able to pick and choose who gets to conserve an office that's way more powerful and those people are big capitalists. They are not just petty bourgeois or homeowners or boat owners and they all recognize the doom state that we're in like liberals are really hamstrung politically because their res their legitimacy resist resides in maintaining a kayfabe of a functioning state. The republicans have a big advantage is that they get to point out that the thing is falling apart problem is from like a objective perspective. They literally want to make everything worse all the things that are making it bad. They want to exacerbate but they don't know that because they their class understanding is through the screen of their personal identities they're and that is why their politics are identity politics even though that's what they claim to hate most in the world and that is competes elites competing for what they think is staying in their position maintaining their power because they see one way or another a threat to it.

But none of them are able to actually effectively do it look at the libs. The libs believe that these other guys are going to destroy a planet that they're going to destroy of the american government and they're not really wrong about that. They are like objectively opposed to the continuance of democracy as we practice it in america that cannot be denied. Whether they can actually do that independently is the real question but they think it's real they hold positions of power in political parties. They write checks to political parties and they can't do anything effectively to stop it. They cannot even effectively challenge them at the ballot box even though demographically they are the govern. They are the natural party of government in the united states and yeah like they are heightening the contradictions. The working class isn't heightening anything. I mean people are doing it at their workplace but there's still no post cult. There is no cultural or political machinery structure on top of that energy that struggle yet. It's being built in our as we say as we speak and all of us have have a have a oh. We all owe it to ourselves to contribute to it. Any way we can but you know really materially and if we can't expect you know find something else. But if I figured out oh god I hate prescribing you can't prescribe can't prescribe can't prescribe brain aneurysm. But I'm not saying it doesn't it um. It won't exist but right now it isn't there which is why all we have is this.

 this one-sided class. This one-sided mobilization against a failed liberal political consensus and constitutional order. But they lack cohesion too which is what undermines their power and their ability to exercise their will. They're all trying to sell each other mlms. They're all trying to pick each other's pocket look at. They think it is from the bug world and and and they're stealing millions of dollars from their own supporters with some fraudulent idea of buying the wall and building it yourself an impossibility. That's why it's so fascinating because you have a total awareness of the bankruptcy of the moment but out without any constructive response. Now we all have individually I think correct readings of the situation but we cannot structurally reproduce our action along our understanding of it. That's why I'm definitely thinking that after this book we'll take another little break. But then I want to read one on china. Somebody gave me a good recommendation on a book about china the rise of modern china and where where their governance is at specifically right now. I would like to know it's very. It's. It's definitely a black hole for me.

I mean look at the democratic party's gynocracy the fact that it's all 90 year olds. This is a perfect example of this no institution that had people within it operating on a consensual understanding of what is best for the organization would allow that to happen and it wouldn't be hard to prevent. It would not be hard to prevent that from happening all you need to do is clip seniority. A little bit all you need to do is get enough people together when a challenger pers when somebody seems like everyone understands okay this person's a little too old. They've lost their fastball. We can all agree that they're gonna go and then you just present it to them as a fatal complete and they gotta go. They have no choice but everybody is a siloed little political entrepreneur. So no one can organize and so they just keep winning elections because they've structured it so that in most of these safe seats an incumbent can't be defeated so the voters are never going to notice that they're a billion years old and you can't as a party edit them out. That means you have no control over anything which is why I just can't understand anybody who's like still clinging to it. The idea that the democratic party can can can represent anybody's aspirations for resistance or countervailing force. All right guys gals that was it next week. We're gonna dive across the span of time and across the atlantic to the new hegemon. The decline the current the the once and future and non-forever king. The american state good old u.s of a and I think we'll just do one chapter each for this last section.

Yeah. We'll see because I think these are like individual articles. Basically. I should raid hassan what he would they they would not notice how could any would notice. It's a raging torrent. Over there does. He actually read that chat is he able to do that if he can that's amazing that's skill oh my god. Everybody's always asking what the book is. This is the book first class passengers on a sinking ship richard lagman all right. I'm out of here chumps and chum bets.
