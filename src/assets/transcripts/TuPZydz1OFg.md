Change your mind about leaving leaving me behind well bring it to me bring your sweet love and bring it on home to me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I know I laughed when you left now. I only only hurt myself bring it to me and your sweet loving bring it on home to me yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah you know I'll always be a slave until I'm buried buried in my grave oh bring it to me bring your sweet love and bring it on home to me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah hey folks back from the first leg of the tour with a big great success. A lot of fun thank you charlotte thank you atlanta thank you nashville honestly. Really own made us feel like we all owned ourselves by not going to the south sooner. It was It was great and on saturday we going to texas for the second leg looking forward to that as well but that gives me a chance right now to sneak in one cheeky. Little chapter short look chapter of dawn of everything before going back on tour and then when we come back hopefully we can have at least a couple weeks where we can keep going through yeah that's why I got a haircut so I could go on tour. I wanted to look respectable yeah. We're gonna be in austin for south by southwest. This is very funny. Never thought that that was anything. I would ever go to or be involved with But there's also a bar show. We're doing the next day as well. We're gonna make sure to keep it weird not gonna. Let anything unweird happen I've been deputized by greg abbott to neutralize with extreme prejudice anyone who's not weird in austin okay. So I don't know how long we'll actually talk about this chapter today because it's pretty short and I was thinking about maybe like you know adding the second one another one with it. But the next chapter is actually relatively long and also you know there's no we've established a pattern here. So I think next week when the which is a chapter or the next 

When we get back from the tour again the next chapter is about early urban life in the first cities in the in the world which were dominated according to grab grow not by settled agriculture but by by this mixed economy of foraging and agriculture and that's gonna be interesting but to set that up chapter six here which is called ecology of freedom how farming first hopped stumbled and bluffed its way around the world. The purpose of this chapter is to set up the conditions for the emergence of agricultures that as a dominant ecological or economic paradigm and they start off by pointing out that there are traditions of communal farming systems that redistribute land hold land in common and involve a like politically enforced egalitarianism that have persisted throughout the world up to the present day or up to the modern era anyway I mean they got wiped out by capitalism like everything else. But but the the thing that this suggests to grab grow is that there is nothing that requires intensive agriculture to inevitably create private property regimes controlled by hierarchies because you have examples in places like peasant russia and indonesia all over the place of farming communities that maintain communal if either communal land holding or system where land is swapped between families to prevent that accumulation by one family one group one clan over another and that if that can happen then according to grab grow it means that nothing about agriculture specifically nothing about the putting of crops in the ground and making them grow makes hierarchy happen which is contra the traditional understanding of how so america human civilization emerged so around 12 000 years ago. At the very end of the once. The the the final ice age glaciers are seeded. We get the emergence of a moment that allows for sustained human social structures supported by sustained agriculture. The holocene it's called this is a this is an era when we finally get a stabilized um a state a stable band basically of weather that allows for allows humans to realistically and reasonably expect that if they pursue an agricultural project that it will in even the medium term be be sustained you know stability and as a result you have this eruption of agriculture zones all over the world 

They've actually got a cool little map here that I'll show you guys look at this guy. You guys see that am I holding it up high enough now yeah there so all these spots. All these places on the map is where you see agricultural societies start to emerge people. Not just you know putting some crops in in a littoral area. Just you know and letting them be irrigated by tides or something talking about an intensive application of human energy into intensifying intensifying crop production by cereals and other impulses and things like that and also domesticating animals. It's a crucial thing you can't really have one without the other. It is. It is both domesticating wild crops and domesticating wild animals that come together and so in all those areas and those maps map. I showed you there's this explosion of of agricultural economies and and in all of them they have different packages basically of of plants and animals that get domesticated and the fertile crescent you know which is the place that we have the most documentation of the place that we sort of give the most focus to when talking about the rise of agricultural society. You had in the west wheat barley cattle and pigs and in the east barley sheep and goats and but you know in in in south america you had like in the andes they were doing potatoes and and domesticating llamas in they're doing pigs in yams and in new guinea you know they're they're bringing into human control. These different crops and animals so what decides then where agriculture erupts and when why and here grabber actually give a little bit of credit to among others jared diamond who they ridiculed earlier in the book and who has a lot of You know black marks on his record in terms of his interpretation of evidence. I mean he wrote a book about the society collapse that has a completely radically incorrect interpretation of the end of the easter island culture for example and also iceland for that matter or greenland rather but one thing that he gets stick from stick for I've seen people ridicule. This online is his famous north south versus east-west axis argument saying that only in eurasia do you have this incredibly wide band of of land where plants can essentially migrate via you know weather.

Patterns from one place to another and people point out this ridiculous of that because africa is way way wider. It doesn't look that way because for among other reasons the dang mercator projection but africa is huge and it's incredibly east-west but what that ignores is that it's not just the question of whether you have an east-west axis of travel. It's that there is a consistent um climate along the axis if you have a variety if you have like a deserts and and tropical zones along an axis they affect as barriers between transmission of these resources and unlike africa or any other continent your. The eurasian landmass has some a band an incredibly large east-west band that is all temperate that's crucial and that's why you see. This. This rapid transmission of agriculture across the eurasian steppe or the eurasian landmass and they get into grab. Girl get into the idea that you know that european colonialism was a ecological colonialism. It was the practi the the practice of taking eurasian dire derived food ways and and crops and animals and and essentially euro forming the rest of the world and grab gross say you know that is accurate you know yeah by the time. By the time of the age of discovery. Quote unquote you have a systems array in such a way that yeah you know the advanced technological societies. Of europe are going to be able to dictate agriculture at the barrel of a gun but what about they asked earlier like at the very beginning when when when people are deciding where they're gonna put down their roots and what they're gonna do. There why did agriculture be develop where it did because it did not become universal. This is a key thing that they want to point out like that map. I showed you it is not a map of this relentless spread. It's these specific zones within greater areas and in the rest of those areas you just do not see evidence of agricultural lifestyles um and what grab girl. I think are mostly hypothesizing but I think is is persuasive.

At least from a from a superficial reading is that the places that saw the emergence of agriculture are the places of most marginal. Productivity like like um. All of the most densely caloric environments are taken by foragers by by these fusion hunter-gatherer societies that create the surprisingly robust and complicated social orders. That grab grove listed through the earlier chapters and of course you know it makes sense why that what if you're in a place that's that calorically dense why the agriculture. Like that's the that is once you get agricultural civilization up and running and you know we'll talk with the rest of this book about where grave growth think that thinks that actually comes from because we still haven't gotten there um once. It's established as I've said on this stream before the social superstructure where we all spend our time engaging with each other ritually and and symbolically becomes a a zone of struggle to avoid having to farm because it sucks and so of course in in the in the places in specifically in coastal areas where you have a bunch of easily accessible you know tree fruits shits that you can just pull off of things that grow naturally and a bunch of animals that you can you can hunt or fish. There's no incentive there's nothing to make you farm the places that saw farming emerge. Are places where there's less ready calories where the effort of intensifying the agriculture is sort of necessary to sustain any kind of you know stable. Relationship with the environment. Now one thing that. I don't really talk about in this chapter which I'm kind of intrigued by is where do these groups come from like what distinguishes the people who stay by the water to the people who go and and try to dig into the dirt inland. I mean are they people who break off are they people who struggled for that area and were defeated. I mean. I don't know they don't really get into that and I'm kind of interested in in how the land picks the people that end up adapting it like who is called to the soil and and it's it's large.

I mean as we're saying here It's necessary right but like why can't you make it work in the with the people by the water you know if you really wanted to. I think you could make it work with the people on the water. Why couldn't they make it work. Why couldn't they squash the necessary beep. Why was the conflict so persistent that they're like all right you know what sun all day to avoid having to be near you people.

But anyway so you see around 5000 bc. The emergence of these clusters of agricultural production and agricultural communities being built across the world and there's the most interesting sort of anomaly. Amongst these is a a bunch of linear pottery built makers in central europe that emerged around 5500 bc and created you know earth. Protect ditch protected settlements with like mud houses and were growing cereals and against the idea that once agricultural once agriculture takes root. It becomes an unstoppable force rather than you know continuing to expand By 4 500. This civilization has a massive collapse which involved at le who knows what went into it completely like my guess is climate. Shifts probably had a lot to do with it but one thing that definitely had something to do with. It was violent conflict with neighbors because in these settlements there are tons of bodies that have been brutalized stabbed. Decapitated evidence of some sort of conflict and then decimation like like the trojan war which and and interestingly one of the pieces of evidence. That kind of can be put in next to this and and at least creates a a narrative.

Even if you can't really prove. It is an interesting phenomenon. The fact that among these mass graves you don't see a lot of young women and that among remains found of coastal european hunter-gatherer settlements. You find younger women with anomalous um diets because one of the big breakthroughs in in I guess what what do you call it. It's not archaeology. I don't know the study of old. Has been the ability to use what the hell is the name of it. I forgot the name of the pro the process. But it's a process whereby you can determine from. I think like isotopes whatever the like what's in the diet of like a a skeleton you find. It's not radiocarbon dating that's not it. It's something else carbon dating that's for dates. This is literally for um for like what's in the body what has been metabolized by the body and then like isotope. It's an isotope. There's isotopes in there somewhere anyway. These young women we find in these coastal areas don't have a lot of fish in their diets. They've got They've got meat they've got red meat what's the deal perhaps they get carried away do. They get owned and then all the young women got carried away who knows but one way or the other. This is a early agricultural development that did not lead to any kind of sustained growth at the same time. Around the same time. This is happening you see much more successful agricultural experiments in the nile delta and in the lupita horizon of oceania going up to but not going to across going basically down through oceania to papua new guinea but not not getting to australia and also so so these are the oceanians the egyptians the central europeans some successful.

Some less successfully over time are building like real sustained agricultural societies where the diets depend on the surpluses produced by agriculture where they fully domesticate wild crops and animals. But at the same time this is happening. There is also agriculture in amazonia which is doing that balancing act that grab grow like to emphasize was wholly within the capabilities of early humans of taking from agriculture that which is culturally useful really more than anything while maintaining the flexibility and and the sort of enforced egalitarianism of the for the foraging social order Like for example they didn't domesticate any animals but they did have a ton of pets who were essentially obtained jungle creatures and they would travel while foraging with these this. Menagerie of jungle creatures who were all essentially parts of the tribe so that's a sort of liminal liminal zone between you know pure hunter gathering and and the domestic the process of domestication because the goal there the self according to grab growth. The self-conscious goal of the social order is to prevent any kind of accumulation of disharmony caused by the particular pathologies of a given form of agricultural product or echo economic production and shifting between the between them so wrapping up the chapter grab. Grow want to just make several sort of culminating statements about this transition to agriculture before we get to the second half of the book which I think is going to focus more and more on the emergence of all the icky regimes of hierarchy that they don't like and that you know. Nobody really likes at least nobody who's reading the book probably um but which according to them were not required to make the transition to They were their shift towards hierarchy was not commanded by their embrace of agriculture so to wrap it up.

They say that farming emerges as a as an act of necessity to get more calories out of a land that doesn't have as much easy access to calories as you get in other areas and so as a result. It's a less in the early stages like the early human social like during early humanity prehistoric humanity. Looking back we make more out of farming. We assume it was more influential and more dominant in the world among the humans who existed because it has more remains because settled agricultural communities built out of more durable materials left. More refuse piled up more crap in one place and are therefore easier to study and so we're able to look at early humanity and just see where farming emerged. Grab growers are arguing that while that's happening yes it's happening in marginal zones where the most people are where human civilization is most complex and where it's thriving. Are people who are still hunter gatherers and foragers but and who do but are not gonna leave the the trace remnants that the agriculturalists will and so the centrality of agriculture to early human social forms inc which as grab girl point out are egalitarian and hierarchical all at the same time. There's there's hierarchy among for foragers there's egalitarianism among farmers. There's no nothing determined between these relationships but we look backward and tell a story that central centers farming because that's what's left the the record. In a similar way we look at hunter-gatherer societies through the lens of the present remnant of hunter-gatherer social orders which we take to be the dominant model even though by definition these are also now dominating only in the most marginal environments like it's been inverted over time in the very beginning of humanity. Hunter-gatherers state where the resources were stayed where the calories were and those other people.

The losers had to end up going out in the woods and finding some way to eat living out of the dirt but eventually hierarchy and technology and got fused to agriculture and its increased ability to heart to create surplus and distribute. Surplus allowed it to completely overwhelm and destroy hunter-gatherer society except where things are so remote that there's nobody interested in it and so we look through. So we have this perfectly reversed understanding of early human social civilization and in both cases. It's a product of the limited the limitations of our evidence and our failure to take into account the dark matter. We look back at the archaeological leavings of humanity in the early era and we only see the we see much more of the leavings of a agricultural social order that was marginal and now we see the most marginalized social order. On earth is hunter-gatherer societies which are basically kept as like museum living museum exhibits or are just destroyed if somebody does decide that the land that they have is worth anything and we see how they are organized through the lens of of their precarity but precarity is not the defining characteristic of a hundred gatherer social order. It is only a historically associated one now with this time frame with this fixed historical era. That's that that scarcity which informs so much of con temporary hunter-gatherer societies could hypothetic would would be different in a system or in a in a time when there's barely any humans on earth relative to how many are on earth now and way more plants than animals so to get at the so.

The next chapter is going to be about cities and it's a big long one. So. I'm excited hopefully. We can get into something juicy. This was really felt like more of a throat clearing chapter. So the next chapter chapter eight is imaginary cities eurasia's first urbanites in mesopotamia the indus valley ukraine and china and how they built cities without kings so here's where grab girl. I think are going to also argue that in addition to agriculture not determining a hierarchical social relationship urban life also does not imply a hierarchical relationship necessarily I'm. I'm. I think this is when we're gonna start having some real sparks fly between us so looking forward to it and I will unfortunately though it'll be a couple weeks because going back on tour very excited about that. I'm gonna take the take the george. H.w bush tour of texas and then go to now lens where I'm hoping to be beaten to death for. My clay higgins impression so yeah that's it for today. I mean this is a short one so maybe I'll take some questions finish it up. Somebody says that it was step nomads who wiped out all these settled peoples which doesn't that validate the kurgan thesis that they talked about in an earlier chapter which I didn't say it at the time. I wish. I had is something that and I think it's pretty cool is that the bad guy in the highlander movie. Is called the kurgan like he's like the er warrior.

I mean I guess. It makes sense you know if you're out in the step. I think scarcity more than anything has to do with the creation of hierarchies and and of like violent social orders. I think it's when you have a situation where you have people who need to live and the environment keeps telling them. No you can't that everything gets thrown out you know like when you're. When your hot air balloon is sinking and you gotta throw things off all of our social rituals that maintain social comedy that maintain the the easiest way of living the easiest way of living and when you're not afraid of anybody. That's the easiest way to live that's the best way to live. That is the that's. The heaven heaven is not being afraid of anybody and I do think that there was a strong current in human civil. Human development that pushed towards that and resisted encroaching hierarchies because as soon as you create hierarchies and as soon as you have the commanders and the commanded all of a sudden. You have this this fracture and that fracture creates anxiety alienation fear resentment. What is what are they gonna do to me and of course you know. It's one thing if you're afraid of your enemy if you're afraid of a of a different tribe a different group but to be afraid to be afraid of your your people inside the the tents inside the ditch that is a social poison and nobody would shoot.

I don't really don't think anyone would choose to bring that into a social dynamic and this is why I disagree with grab grow on their idea that there was no no inherently egalitarian. Super early humanity like hundred thousand years ago. Now. I think that there was um. I don't think that you could have human social order take root. I don't think you could have like tribal structures even emerge without a a commitment in their forging to egalitarianism. But necessity is the ultimate arbiter society. All the culture stuff and all all of the civic rituals that make us think that we're free and that and that relieve the alienation of living in a society living in society. Like all that stuff is at the end of the day a luxury. It's a luxury that is brought about by hey. We don't have to you know keep running. We don't have there's no saber-tooth tiger at our heels. We can rest so what should we do with our time of rest. Everything comes out of that and the expansiveness of our civic life depends on just how blanketed we are how protected.

We are how large the buffer is between our luxurious ritualized social interactions and necessity and that's why liberalism turns into fascism because liberalism is a luxury and when necessity comes to call in all the liberal stuff gets thrown off of the bow leaving only just the hard carapace itself because what liberalism is is a civic ritualized religious reversal reversion reversal of our basic. Like ethical notions. It literally says bad is good and good is bad but in such a way that people can live within it and be fully convinced that their idea of the good which is I would argue for most people. A good faith engagement with notions of virtue like I think like transcendent concepts of of of you know doing unto others all that because as I said it's the ideal state it is what we rationally want. Liberalism says that's impossible and so therefore on top of our real good faith best best effort ideas of doing what's right have to go out into the world and do what's wrong we have to do wrong to do right because we can't live that way there's something broken in us. Whatever it is. We can't live that way. We can only negotiate through this marketplace but the marketplace in in an ascendant liberalism has so many bells and whistles and gigas and gim cracks and so many channels to allow for a public ritualized redistribution of resources. A enactment of a sort of kabuki justice that we can believe in it and most of us do believe in it.

But it requires surplus and it requires stability in the input of the economy and when fascism or when those inputs break down there's nothing left. But the machinery of exploitation and the filter that turns bad to good is removed and so the only people who will wield power who will choose to seek power are those who are self-consciously bad have have fused their idea of virtue to the machine. However whatever costume that has it's it's the nile. It's the final nihilistic destruction of humanity. Like the the the sufferers they will be destroyed physically people at the bottom half of the dispersal when crisis hits cap hits liberal capitalism the bottom half and the scapegoats those two groups like it's the yin and yang you got the bottom half and then you got the scapegoats so the bottom half of the of like in terms of income and resources plus those in the top half who can be chosen as scapegoats.

They will be physically destroyed and then the winners will be spiritually destroyed because carrying out that process carrying out that elimination will squeeze the humanity out of them like toothpaste which is why fascism is a death drive. Because it is not it cannot lead to a stabilized identity because you cannot live as a society as a social organ with like all types of human beings with the human instinct towards connection. The human just like the feeling you get looking into another human being's eye like the stuff that builds your consciousness and informs your understanding of the world. Around you you cannot have a whole social body. That fascism imagines all able to deny or warp that conception around like the total war that fascism requires. It's not stable it'll destroy itself and so it must be destroyed externally. So it's just gonna run. It has to run into a wall but here's the thing about this what I'm describing here a lot of people are like ah yes. This is This is what trump is threatening. This is the global fascist wave that we're talking about and yes it is. But it's also liberalism. I mean it's also the last gasp of liberalism because there is a liberal fascist vision with its own scapegoats and its own mechanisms for destruction of the of the other that can be embraced like so and and the only difference will be the targets who ends up at the bottom and who is the scapegoat on the top and that's because there is no class-based political formation to challenge that at the end of the day nervous breakdown within the psyche of the global middle class which is what politics is like there is a there is a liberal technocracy that is going to leave to machines and the the technology of law.

The job of wiping out the undesirables basically like as you can see with democrats and republicans switching power and nothing changing about the the the situation with the border no matter how much people yell about it. It's just a question of do you want those border areas to be theatrically and violently imposed like helicopter gunships. Strafing refugees drone bombings that like go on live leak or do you just want to put up the fence and and let the machines handle it and ignore it. It's a question of where are you going to put your energy into as a spectator rooting for this or one or the other of it. Somebody said that the technology talk scares them more than climate change. I don't think you can extra extricate those two things because climate change would not be so terrifying if we had any faith that we could intervene collectively and the reason we can't is not because of fell human nature.

It's because of technology. It's because we have alienated too much of the job of governing ourselves to technology which is organized around a central algorithm of profit extraction which is the only real thing in the system. That's the real god profit extraction is the the split atom of like god's consciousness. Like it is. It is the motive force. It's the engine. It's the first mover of a global techno technological governing system that has no human inputs. We have the technology to just as we have the technology to cause the climate to almost to go into overdrive. We have the technology formally to reverse that but people say that all the time and it's true but it ignores the fact that part of the imp part of the implication of having that much technology is that you would have given up the same amount of governance over that technology for it. To be that powerful. There are two elements. There's the there's technological capacity and then there is humanoid human agency within it and as one rises the other declines as technology gets more more developed human impact on it becomes less so and that is why the hope we have for human flourishing is that the machine breaks down. There was once hope the marxist vision was that the machine's controls could be grasped and there was a mighty effort to grasp them that consumed the 20th century. But it was a lost cause skynet has won but that's not doom pill nihilism because the conditions of their victory are the terminal destabilization of the system that their technology depends on. They're selling their own the rope to hang themselves and and what what what that breakdown means is up for us to determine okay.

I don't think this is a process that like we need to await it's clearly a process that is happening. Now. The only question is how long can it continue in the in the face of no resistance. That's the thing is that right now we are not a factor as humanity in the conditions of this collapse which means it might take a while. It might take a goddamn long time like I do have a of a real vision of a of a future where everything is as it is except worse and le and in fewer geographic areas. The creation of a global archipelago of of like a supply chain archipelago. I mean you could argue that that's already what we have. There are big chunks of the world that are outside of of that that eye and it's only going to get bigger and then within. It's only getting more hysterical and shrill and the need to find scapegoats within the wire is going to become more intense and that could go on until humanity just winks out. But at every point along that continuum which we're on a process is ongoing. We all have to live and in living we can make decisions. We we can our very ignorance is what gives us free will. We very well. I think we are in a billboard universe where all of our actions are fully determined. But we can't know by what and it's in our ignorance that we actually can assert independence and that's faith not faith in god as a as a social symbol but faith in the existence of the human. Like the idea that you're human and that others the other people you see are humans and that doesn't require any kind of like sappiness or or like lobotomizing yourself. Oh you believing in humans look at humans. They're epic fail absolutely. Humans are epic fail but what about you you have an idea of what's good you have an idea of how things could and should be.

They are they have certain values attached to them that you can put your mind around and carry with you don't you have to assume that everybody else is too so. It doesn't require any any grand leap. It just requires assuming really believing that you're real because the process of of like the idea of the the we the the the winnowing of the human spirit that that technology has accelerated us through over time. Is a process of dis of disenchantment. We go from from experiencing ourselves and the world around us as equivalently real. The world is as real as we are and we and it's like that isn't something that we have to interrogate or or or run through some sort of logical calculus. It is the exac it is the evidence of our eyes. It is our empirical reality our empirical reality is that we are together because there are no abstract concepts to crowd out the space of pure like connection and then over time. As surplus accumulates. We begin to become disenchanted with the rest of the world around us but that understanding of the world doesn't go away that that degree of like motor response to the world around us that we could only feel. If we really felt that what was real was what was around us was happening that we are real. It just gets internalized. We go from thinking that we in the world are as real. We go for I'm more real than the world. But I am as real as the people around me to I am more real than the people around me because it's only when you think you're more real than someone else. Then you could really harm them. You could actually like dominate them because if you're both as real as each other then the distinction is illusory and violence inflicted will only come back on you the rational thing if you know everything is real is to not be violent. This is the this is the idea. This is the in my my basic premise for the human. Human nature is that you will act in the world in relationship to your degree of faith in the world. In its reality.

I know that sounds circular but it's important to emphasize that we don't think the rest of the world is real like why the hell do have we all decided after abandoning christianity that we're going to talk about it being a sim the world being a simulation. Even though it's the exact same theological structure. It's the same idea. It's just one where we have replaced a god that signifies unity with a a technological demiurge that signifies separation now the hope of communism. The hope of of the world spirit is that the technology that we would all start using to commit violence against each other as we started to lose belief in one another which as I'm saying comes out of scarcity comes out of conditions of disequilibrium that require necessary actions that impose a harsh hierarchy and violence that's the social order doesn't normally have. It's like an antioxidant just banging into your your little social corpuscle. Eventually it's going to knock its dna out of place. It's cancer so we've gotten all the way to the point where the only thing that is real is us. But the good news is that if the only thing that's real is us then that means that the world is as real as we are boom and that means every person is as real as we are and the way we feel the centrality that that godliness they feel too boom click. It's on the table.

Now there's going to be a lot of incentive for people not to pick it up because a lot of them are too in resentful and in pain or because they're too comfortable too addicted to the pleasures of of of being on the right side of the machine. Yes I am balding that is correct. I know. It's a bummer the dream of communism. The only dream worth having once capitalism becomes inevitable which I don't think it had to be. But it was gonna. I think it would have emerged eventually given the conditions but its approximate explosion as a result of proximate conditions. The only hope is not to collapse back into like pre-technological civilization because the cycle will continue that's all history was is the cycle of this of these ways of life being built up interacting with a change so homeostasis that their intervention caused and then their collapse.

A dominance hierarchy is maintained by a surplus distribution that is maintained by a calorie extraction process that involves putting in x and bringing out y from the soil and the x factor in that is the environment. The x factor of that is the climate and the thing about it is thanks to the butterfly effect. Intensive human intervention in natural processes has a reflection. It causes a response a reaction in the natural system homeostasis is is disrupted and then you get the distress call. It's it's your biome telling you hey. This doesn't work anymore. You can't do this and the people at the top get this. They see the response oh it's failing oh. The the crops are failing oh boy whoa what's going wrong well.

Oh you know what it is. We're pissing god off. But the god is the god of domination. The god is the demires the god is satan always will be cast to be because it's a consecration of a of a of a sin of of the original sin of socially consecrating a fundamental difference between human beings. So they change their social order and they do what they absolutely have to at the ground level to keep the thing going but as things get worse. Their first goal will always be to maintain the structure. They're in not to actually address the problem which means they will always misanalyze it and then miss respond to it which means they will only hasten the collapse and then the thing falls apart that is every era of human history. Since since we started writing things down that is every social order. The only difference between those times and this one like that that's that cycle happening and and that interact and that reflecting our um current moment is that those were geographically fixed locations within a greater homeostatic sphere. A globe where other life systems were happening with different relationships to their environments with different degrees of of of stability and the the general push was towards that and these could be absorbed. Now. We have the final totalization of capitalism over the whole globe which is the totalization of a dominant structure carried out by technology and we have throughout and and we've reached the critical moment. When the stuff we do to maintain. The structure causes a disruption to the the natural cycle that provides the inputs for our economy and provides the calories and the surplus that all this runs on. But because there it is a dominance hierarchy that is unchallenged for power and has its hands firmly on all of the buttons. The few remaining areas of human autonomy that exist do so at the very top of this system and those people are the most committed to its maintenance and they always will be even if they individually had changes of heart. They would all be replaced. Now i.

I think that within every single previous cycle of of of hegemonic imperial power rising and falling you have the same thing you have a social order that is an engine for surplus creation and exploitation for the for the allowance of some to pleasure at the expense of others and then through social ritual inscribe that evil as a good that is human civilization broadly defined and within it. There is a constant civil war within its middle class. The people who are not fully committed to it through the fact that they're unexploited at the top or fully enthralled to it by the fact that they are dominated at the bottom but rather exist in the middle area where their comm their Their exploitation within the system is also compensated for consciously with benefits from that system because the superstructure to to the enslaved is clear they all have they are naturally equipped with the they live glasses but in the middle is where the obfuscation occurs and so politics is this middle class frantically trying to rearrange the order to accommodate crisis without recognizing the fundamental driver of it because all of the culture that they interact with is designed to obscure it. But even within that there are attempts where the scapegoats from one group one one defeated. Middle class will hook up with the most active and and kinetic and and energetic members of the oppressed class and push against power to break it up. They've all are defeated. That's the and then you get the common ruin after the defeat of the one by the other and you know it's slave up.

That's what it looks at like different things in different places. It looks like like slave uprisings in ancient rome. The servile wars in the middle ages you're talking about the millennial movements associated with the return of christ and the apocalypse and the need to live in common that you saw repeatedly culminating in like I would say the the climax of that movement is the anabaptists of munster and then under capitalism. It was the labor movement which is that alliance with the disaffected middle and the activist bottom yeah. The peasants war is a good example of of of what that looks like under medieval feudalism and eventually what happened is that the most febrile of the middle class who went for the jugular. The disaffected middle who joined the who joined with this the people of bottom were doing so out of a genuine commitment to values that transcended the personal that understood humanity as collective. But that was an anchor because it inhibited their the refinement of their movements. The middle class could move as a unit as a class conscious movement which it did in the mid 20th century so when capitalism comes to shatter the the The grounded particular particularized territorially designated power of earth and replace it with a global concept of of domination a world empire for the first time who will dominate it that was what the 19th and 20th centuries were about who will lay astride this machine. A coalition of the of the disaffected middle and the active south or a fully self-committed middle in alliance of course with the top. Because the top are going to be most connected most most committed to the system. They might have outliers but they'll just drift often be hobbyists. They have no there's there's no way that they can assert the market pressure the market power that the organized top can and so what emerged from that crisis of the mid 19th century from the revolutions of 1848 to the civil wars in there but also culminating really with the um.

The paris commune you see that's battle be fought and that is a fight between the top and the middle and the middle and the bottom and when I say I'm not saying all of them. I'm saying the most active of them the most capable and the most pressed and so that is why over that period of struggle. The winner was fascism which cloaked itself first in liberalism as a sheep as a wolf would with sheep's sheepskin and now as as the crisis deepens and as necessity intervenes and interferes with our civic rituals and disabuses of disabuses us of our faith in their reality. It turns into fascism which is why the first place to emerge with a fascist. Drive for annihilation is in europe after the great war which is the signal carnage. The the mass sacrifice necessary to enshrine the victory of the ruling of the middle and upper coalition because the victory of the allies at the end of world war. Ii is not the defeat of fascism but the taming of fascism to the ends of an atlantic liberalism that was able to wield power behind of a a veil of democracy. Due to its ability to access resources from people who don't count we were able to ex the west. The anglo-sphere is able to expand by maintaining social harmony. Within I mean there's still social disharmony but by alleviating it by exploiting the labor and land of those who are outside the circle of belief of of of human brotherhood without outside of the social circle. Germany couldn't do that germany was our luck they were last. They were last piggy to the tit during the scramble for africa. They got scraps which is why they fought world war one and then when they lost it. That's why they were the ones who turned fascist because they were the ones who were economically dominated. At the end of the war. They were the ones who could least their systems could least handle the pressure of mass austerity that the west could the farther west the winners. I should say of world war one and the only way that they could hope to do what the anglo spirit done after world war one is go east lebensraum go east young man and grow up with the country but that meant doing to europeans what had previously only been done to racialized others and that is too destabilizing to the self-conceptions of western capitalists so they said no and they allied with the with the with the commies and I gotta say by that point the soviet union under stalin.

I'm sorry. It's no longer a coalition of the activist workers and the most disaffected and most principled middle it is. It's the domination of a new bureaucratic middle and they are. They operate foreign policy and they imagine themselves to be part of a democratic. Like socialist project. They really believe that but their understanding and definition of it is inextricable to their place within the structure of power and that means that when they have to fight the outside world when pressures increase when the environment changes they make the wrong decisions and they get owned and they can't create and they can't maintain a social basis under pressure over time because there's nothing for anybody to believe in everybody gets mad at khrushchev for his revisionism. But it was a recognition of reality. They had failed to transform the soviet union into like a revolutionary project which meant it was just this country like other countries and which meant it had to buy off its workers. The same way that it bought them off in the west. What do you want you want a tv you. Want you want a up. That is the carrot that you have to give in lieu of a social project so that means when the final when the first real shocks come in the 80s the final shocks that can't handle it. It can't hold on and it collapses.

Cuba survives because that distinction I think didn't really develop the same way. The the activists working class were Inter were integrated into systems of like party control at such a deep at such a basic level that there is a way to be a working class that is exploited oppressed worker. A like spiritual patriotic metaphysical connection to the state project of cuba that's the thing that the exploited of our countries cannot imagine the exploited in america the bottom tier of america just like at the west. Most other places has no allegiance to this project they're alienated from it completely. That's not true in cuba that doesn't mean. There aren't working-class cubans who aren't disaffected from the system absolutely but again we're talking about the most active. However you wanted to find that socially intellectually the most femoral you know the most the highest frequency turners. There's a way to end to if you're a working last person to work towards that goal and feel like you are doing something good which we don't have. We can only feel like we're advancing the interests of somebody else for powers that we are feel oppressed by and that just makes us feel loathing it makes work suck. It makes life harder and I'm sorry but the proof of the failure of the soviet project is that by the 1980s that's how the soviets working class felt about their country felt about their project.

I don't think you can deny that because they would have not of let it fall otherwise it was just this party machine. This little encapsulated bubble this bureaucratic strata trying to keep themselves afloat while the conditions collapsed underneath them and then finding no popular support. So they got torn apart by the outside forces of capital and then the worst of that middle that worst of that sector. The most the people who were benefiting but didn't believe in it. The worst people are of course the ones who seize power as soon as it ends and of course. We helped you know we helped rig the 96 election. I said on the recent episode that we put putin in. I don't mean that in the sense that we installed putin the way that we like the way that we did like mabutu in zaire and just that we created the political conditions. We dictated the terms that essentially demanded that putin be put in power. Once we destroyed the socialist project and replaced it with capitalism. The only person that was going to be able to dominate that condition declining material conditions under capitalism where there's no national project to be committed to the only thing the only thing that could control that structure would be a crooked nationalist. That is the only person who could take power. The only people who could take power were people who were fully committed to be to their their self-interest the truest capitalists and this is why china is so interesting because I i know that china chinese culture is riven with contradictions and there's huge alienation amongst its obviously amongst it's still very poor rural population and it's you know. It's alienated working class in the cities and then it's anxious downwardly mobile middle class in the cities as well. But there is also genuine belief in the chinese project.

I don't know how deep it runs but I think it is a mass base which the west doesn't have just don't have it and then what's silly about the reactionary project. The fascist project what makes it the most pathetic cope possible is that you can imagine that kind of thing re-emerging in america in the in the symbols of our extinguished exhausted liberal order. Like you you guys want to take the symbols of liberalism that have been exhausted by their failure over over time and just rearrange them and hope that that can like re-enchant people to a system that just sees them more miserable every day. Those things were forged by moments when things were going good. Those symbols were infused with meaning at times of ascendancy like all those that like the the the tradition of christian chivalry of the medieval era that like neo-reactionaries fantasize about and that they embrace the the symbols of and these and the social structures of those are the fantasies that an ascendant feudalism was telling itself about itself and the thing is is that because it was ascendant there was benefit to it. There was perceived benefit to it and so it eq accrued to it faith and then we carried them around as symbols as the conditions deteriorated and then they lost their power you have to. We have to create new symbols forged out of struggle where we feel like things are getting better but not because of the whims of the market which are only going to push down against us all but because we took discrete actions to infuse our alienated activity with meaning so yeah what in fact the the neo-fascists are the most. They're the most cap and cope people. On earth. It is nothing but cap and cope from those people. They want to take the the they don't like see. Here's the thing there is a symbolic shape that is created by each social structure that it's self-conscious like ascendant middle should imagine itself to be right. Like there is a form that we're all supposed to view as aspirational. It's how we define ourselves. These are this is what an x is supposed to look like and ruler person in charge person who deserves the benefits of a of a unequal social arrangement. The thing that makes it right that they should have that is that they hold these positive characteristics and that might be blood.

It might be merit but all it is is a rationalization of power so what the fascist does is. He sees the the machine coming in and they mean he sees the imminence of like mass scale violence coming and he wants to arrange brace himself for it in a way that will make him able to cope with it and the best way to do that is to conceive of oneself as in alliance with the interests of the machine. But there's a contradiction the image that the machine it produces the cookie cutter of what a good person who deserves good things is is no longer compatible with decelerating material conditions. All the values that you're supposed to have the package of liberal values you're supposed to have in the culture that people with those values create. It's not one that can allow you to do the violence that is going to be done because during the ascendancy of liberalism you could bet you could balance that appeal up with the real material advantage of being a worker in the middle of the system in in america and in in western europe and and in korea and south japan wherever we were going to put enough capital to really build a robust social order which is of course premised on extraction. We're extracting more and more from the app environment in order to distribute more and more surplus to accommodate more and more exploitation and since all the machine wants to separate the good from the bad and to kill the bad and make the killing of the bad a ritualized performance of human agency. But the only people who are going to be able to enjoy that are going to be people who have embraced fascism as an ideology. But they're coping and one and the people who actually carry out are going to be the biggest psychos and the ones who just root from the sidelines are going to be the the biggest. The most the most the soft ones the ones who aren't mad about the system exploiting them and and are driving to punish people and then and and struggled upward in the hierarchy but people who have mostly enjoyed being middle class so this liberal order that is predicated on liberal values is going to have to be overthrown to give an and to give the last shred of active amer. Human citizens. Ones who are able to move towards power and affect change ones who are in physical proximity and cultural proximity to power and can exercise it are all going to move towards it. That means that the formal system in the wire is going to move towards total authoritarianism. The only thing that could intervene and destroy fascism would be a fully technologicalized technologized fascism which would then allow for us to live in a fantasy world and maintain our liberal rituals and you know continue battling with the threat of fascism forever like what that's going to be like it's called neo-feudalism but that it implies a regression when it's more of a of a negative dialectic.

It's like you had this the feudalism feudalism was like It was the old imperial model losing grasp it was a recognition. Feudalism is just a recognition of the failure to be able to effectively control a slave society. Like that's all it is it's like oh the social. These social inputs that allow us to maintain order in a slave society have evaporated and that means we need some other way to extract surplus but that is less alienating and that is the the contract the bargain the consensual agreement that underlines feudalism. But then it came in the fennel terminal crisis thanks to climate change this is going to be basically the thesis of our 30 years. War show is that climate change comes knocking in the form of the little ice age and it means that this this fatally undermined and decaying feudal system has to respond with something else and and re-re-establish its basis and that conflict is the third is the the mass upheaval of the the general crisis of the 17th century out of which capitalism emerges in north in england and in the low countries and now there is a still a bunch of debate about what caused the little ice age. There's one interesting theory that says that so so one thing that definitely contributed to it. One way or another is that not this is. This is how nothing is a fully closed system when you talk about this stuff and there's always you know um there's always chance determining all of these otherwise over determined social relationships.

Sometimes things just change because and then and then and in this case you had in the early 1600s 1600s you had a massive decline in solar output sunspots which are explosions of solar material outward like super abundances. Basically stopped around 1618 which I don't think totally coincidentally is the first year of the 30 years war so that happened and that's nothing we had anything to do with. But at the same time european interaction with the new world was causing death. Human death on a scale basically unprecedented massive die-off not really even because of deprivations although of course those were horrible but because of disease and what that led to was huge areas that had been you know filled with co2 producing human beings. Just overnight almost were returned to nature and saw a huge efflorescence of of carbon sucking um plant life emerged where that those humans had previously been exhaling co2 and that those things combined with a huge explosion in volcanic activity which might have been caused by the sun. Spots actually interestingly enough but also happens simultaneously. It's this three-fold cross rip that breaks up every system of mass power practically around the world except for places that had basically stored up rice for the winter and had been able to benefit from stability of resources long enough to like build really stable social structures like japan is really kind of the only big exception and of course colonial north america.

So one way or another. This changes the inputs once again. All the assumptions of feudalism were based on x amount of calories. They were no longer viable. How does a social order accommodate that it has to build a new god. It has to create a new structure of values.

A new story to tell itself about why things keep getting worse for some people because it's getting better for others and the people it's getting better. For it can be told a story as to why it's getting better for them that they will believe because why wouldn't they they have nothing else to compare it to. It's life. The only way you can be disabused of. It is experience of at its bottom or the middle experience where you feel alienated and assimilated to power and creates that nervous breakdown that's schizophrenia that that is a feature of like the capitalist mind that kind of It's the breakdown of that. That schizophrenia that that pushes politics and that's why it pushes it towards fascism. But I think that the thing that's going to determine how this plays out is going to be At this point. The I guess not I guess just not really guessable fluctuations like like. I just it feels so wrong to say that what could happen and that's why I really feel like if you raw if you if you stop trying to look like toward the future and accept how much of it is going to be determined by huge feedback loops like we're looking at coronavirus just like through sand and the gears in a way that like and accelerated decline and centripetal undermining of all systems. You know. It's. It's like. It's sugar in the gas tank of an already failing automobile. I I don't think that I don't think putin invades ukraine if the coronavirus doesn't happen. I'll say that and you can who could predict the coronavirus. You can say generally oh there could we will eventually get a disease yeah of course but how does that help me so yeah no predictions. I'm trying to trying to keep to no prediction gang so yeah.

The political question then becomes a personal question like what do you need to do in your life to maintain your sense of self maintain your relationship to people around you like. I don't want to eat the bugs. I don't want to go the um cube thing. There is a like it's muted and mangled but there isn't just a recognizable humane instinct. There what technofascism promises you is yes. You can enjoy life in this declining empire but you will observe the horrible horrible despoilation and misery of a lot of people while it's happening and because you have access to global information you will be inundated with it it cannot be refused. You know about it. How can you still stay in your position relative to it. How do you not resist it. If you feel like you are trying to change something and so much of what allows comfortable middle class people to stay where they are is the comforts of believing that they are virtuous people and public virtue for liberalism has to be racially blind because it it does. It does connect you to the world which you need to have and it has a belief in the other which you need to have to have a politics at a global level because there has to be a stable political community. Like what fascism is. The is the seeking of a stable political community around one group dominating another which of course could. Only then lead to it destroying itself that's why it has to destroy itself that's why it did destroy itself. Hitler didn't have to invade russia. He invaded russia because he was giving he was doing. Country was gacked out of its mind but what it means to be a good person. 

I mean the aggrieved middle doesn't have those values because the whole time that we have been building this edifice of capitalism. This alienated structure that doesn't really need human inputs to keep going we've been building a cultural superstructure on top of it and in that there had to be a place for the aggrieved middle and I would say that the aggrieved middle are the middle who feel social alienation from the project of capitalism because they're not part of its story. It tells itself about itself or they're at proximity to violence because I would say that proximity to violence even giving out violence is a psychic toll. It is an alienation. I I i would argue that a a slave owner on a plantation is vastly more alienated from the condition of capitalism or social domination. What a feudalism whatever whatever you want to call it than somebody who passes bills back and forth in a sitting room in boston where nobody around him is enslaved.

Nobody around him is getting whipped that proximity to violence is a stressor that has to be released and it's by identifying with the violence and so those people still exist. They've still created a powerful social order that has been the engine of capitalism. It has been that thing that broke the tide of the working class broke it in the 1870s by destroying reconstruction broken by by building the the regime of anti-immigrant fervor in the north and and racism in the south to split the working class. It did it after world war one the first red scare and then fatally did it away with it in world war ii what was what was the rise of fascism if not the defeat of socialism in germany. The elimination of the alternative through violent means that set fascism on its death drive. It had to destroy itself then and there as soon as it eliminated the alternative it had to destroy itself but in the west socialism was not destroyed. Not eliminated the liberal social conception of secular virtue through egalitarianism could still exist as a horizon as the thing that made everything okay a thing that made our participation in this system virtuous and that's why the slaves had slavers had to be put down. But we couldn't let the working class win no no no no. That's a no-no because remember the top is. There the whole time asserting power independent of everybody else the only truly self-conscious class.

That's a huge huge disadvantage and I would say after world war ii like the death starts and then but the thing is. We didn't see the results because we won the war and that means we got the spoils and we got to distribute the spoils and we got to live off of the spoils but now the spoils are running out after world war. Ii ended after the reactionary segment of the democratic party took power with the removal of fdr and his replacement with harry truman after stalin's capitulation to the west. His acceptance of a u.s led global market where the u.s would get to determine things like reserve currency. I gotta say stalin taking that deal is a reflection of his thuggish narcissism and not recognizing the moment for what it was which was the crucial moment if we gave if we gave the baton to the algorithm of profit driving western liberalism and synthesize having synthesized in the process of synthesizing fascism and distributing it throughout the whole structure. Then what the hell were you doing it for. That's why it's unfair to blame khrushchev for shifting to a consumer-based economy and liberalizing he had to.

Because this was going to be at the moment of revolutionary project was over we were going to be the soviet union was going to be a state among states dedicated to maintaining its bureaucratic structure and the culture around that bureaucratic structure tell yourself stories about how you're fighting a revolution tell yourself stories about how you're the vanguard of the global working class but really at the end of the day only caring about your dasha the fact that you don't actually have to work in a black sea. It's an eventual bureaucratic coup and the same thing happened in china but later because china started off way. Farther back. It had to develop more. There was basically in many parts of china during the early days of the of the chinese communist rule. There was basically no mode of production. You had these ancient like trade structures that had existed for 2000 years and then essentially non-existent formal regime for extracting anything out of it. It took them much longer to develop that that bureaucratic counterweight the question is because they built it in conditions of surplus. They built it in the conditions of chinese. Relative advancement gave chinese people a reason to think that the communists were doing the right thing.

I think it means that in this case the bureaucratic like hive of the ccp might very well have enough hooks to at least stave off final. The final capitulation to the borg and maybe buying time is all they need to do while everybody else who is being chewed up and spit out by it rallies and then and and tries to take it down from the outside like the sea peoples like think of us as the sea peoples or not us that's very smug but anybody who realistically could try to push this rotten edifice over from outside of it. And I don't think it's a coincidence that it's now theorized that the sea peoples who whose interaction with the late bronze age helped accelerate at the very least. It's collapsed caused by climate change that it couldn't accommodate by the way were refugees fleeing from the site of ecological devastation. The the volcanic the volcano zones in the mediterranean and that they had come together as sort of ad-hoc communities to to interact with the those old late broadcast cities and because those cities decided to fight them. They they were destroyed. The the the the nemesis was brought to the annihilation of the thing and you know you can look at that as the apocalypse. But how do we know that how things got distributed in the in the aftermath of that work better in the short term and the near term and I mean the medium term just because we don't see the continuation of the ritualized The ritualized um like expenditure of surplus in the form of you know temples being built and and things being built that doesn't necessarily mean that like in conditions where things were declining anyway and people are gonna have to find a new relationship to surplus no matter what that given that condition things were better and maybe gave left blueprints and left structures that later humans could try to try to enact but yeah the reason that we're all so neurotic and so depressed and so anxious is because we all recognize that we're not the protagonists really of this story.

At the very least we can watch from the sidelines and maybe participate on the margins. The center of gravity here is people outside of the comfort zone where even where where the distribution of pain in the social body is so disproportionately felt that legitimacy cannot be maintained at the political level and what they're gonna do is. Gonna determine how humanity ends up and all we can do as individuals in the west is look around us and act in accordance with our best feelings and and let that be politics and whatever that is we can't know and it could end up being incredibly important. Because of that god damned butterfly effect and because of our relative proximity to power yes. We're far from power but others are catastrophically farther from power and the closer you are to power. The more coordinated activity can push against the flow okay. This is a long one so yeah. That's why everything feels so weird because nobody can imagine themselves in a place in the future because we can't take for granted the conditions that we're going to be living in and that doesn't even necessarily mean like we're going to see our own like lives change but just our perception of the world around us because these things all have resonances you know like they all ratchet up the frequencies and that is that is subjectively experienced no matter how far you are from actual pain because you're aware of it. Others are aware of it the fact that they're aware of it influences their actions. It resonates out in sublimated ways in in symbolic ways and all we can really do is wonder like well will. I feel like. I'm being squashed or will. I feel like I am in charge of my life because that's the only way that we can actually carry out virtuous ethical action which we want to do as. I said because it's the most rational emotionally satisfying thing. It's the thing that makes us less afraid. This is what I'm getting back to is that is that altruism is rational because putting yourself putting as many people as possible between yourself and the sensation of fear is maximally hedonically and also evolutionarily advantageous. The fact that we don't think that that's true the fact that we think there's a difference between those things that facts don't care about your feelings is down to us needing to reconcile the existence of a machine of exploitation and destruction that pulls us against our best interests is actually good is to create an inverted reality a shadow world on the cave for everybody to believe in everybody to believe it.

There's no puppet masters. We're all invested with this ideology. The only difference between people at the top and the bottom is the people at the top are able to organize as a class more effectively. That's it we're all acculturated to the same system of ethics. The same liberal notions of of of human worth and value and rat which include rationality because rationality is how we're supposed to get to the right action. Living rationally in an irrational world is the job of culture and it's the job of politics. It's the filter that we run it's the adapter. It's the dongle we use to connect these two worlds and the dream. The horizon of socialism is that you can accommodate. You can assimilate the humanist vision of liberalism and then re take it another step back to a common project. A global project where our interests our rational self-interest is a calculus that includes other people because a rational self-interest is a bunch of different things and it weights other people relative to ourselves and so a person's rational self-interest is not determined by their relationship to other people. Objectively. It's their subjective relationship to the people in question. I think I'm pretty far out into the galaxy brain right now but I i. I'm still comfortable that this is all useful information for somebody. Hopefully. Somebody can get something out of this. I feel like it kind of makes sense. So the dream is that you can assimilate those things to a to a social project that can effectively control the reins of power that can control the inputs that means winning a war with capital over control of the technolo. Technology of capital and in the four capital will be represented in battle by essentially its assimilated human nodes and we're all in the middle. Between these things we're being pulled in different directions and only crisis will reveal to us through the imposition of necessity. What our real values are and I i say that people whose values are all-encompassing or more encompassing than capitalisms have been can create together as they have in places like cuba a alignment between a state project and a center of gravity of oppressed people within it. They can move the ship push towards the distribution of pain equally through the system. That is I think the that's the goal. Even if this whole thing collapses there will still be people and if not people sensing octopus who walk on land and there will still be the detritus of civilization that these people or whatever the hell or or octopus are going to shift through to try to reconstitute social. It's going to keep happening as long as the world exists. I mean the thing is. Cuba's also got huge alienating factors. It's got a huge prison population obviously nothing like ours but relative to other latin. American countries. Um like a lot of people want to leave because it sucks there because there's part of a global capitalist structure. They're not allowed to distribute resources because they don't have them but there is a path for working cubans to feel. Now that not everybody feels that way. But there is a path that path doesn't exist in america. That's why people create fantasies like q and like we're in a millennial death spiral because there is no outlet there's no way to feel in charge of anything and and the fact that they're up.

They were a oppressed colony and somebody points out. That's an interesting element of china that we don't talk about enough is that yes it's a nationalist project. But it's not a 19th century nationalist project. Like the ones that produced fascism. It was a 20th century nationalist project which means was forged in the context of anti-colonialism so it is and it's got in its dna anti-colonialism. Whereas 19th century nationalism was imperial. It was it was a struggle for resources and control by self-conscious empires and in every case it's all forced by violence. German nationalism was teased into being modern. German nationalism was teased into being by napoleon's invasion. All these germans who were living in this rat trap of a holy roman empire just got their sawed-off frenchman why because the french had a national concept that they were willing to fight for and so the germans said we got to get one of those the french got theirs because the ruling regime had lost the mandate of heaven by failing to distribute enough the pain efficiently so it was overthrown by the act of bourgeois who then of course subscribed the nation because there was no international working-class movement yet to take the burden of that project to to reproduce it. Socially. All you had were you mostly had artisans and artisans are middle class subjects. They are They're the they're. The free peasant of the city basically and free peasants have a different class consciousness than worker working-class people. And that's why you couldn't get communism out of the french revolution you got nationalism which then was weaponized to kick the out of the rest of europe but then created new nationalisms there. But crucially that defeat by germany was not felt as a colonial violation. It was felt as great powers duking it out in europe as they had been forever. China went from being the cradle of civilization the longest tenured civilization on earth equal in majesty and exceeding in majesty anything in the west for for centuries for millennia gets in the in the blink of an eye gets invaded and dominated by outside forces and exploited economically and and and loses any like national um legitimacy and then the necessity then is is inevitably produced to create one the century of humiliation.

The first gas bill was the taiping rebellion when it had the mantle of an imported european concept christianity and then almost top of the mingan you could almost say it should have and that that's actually a very interesting hinge point is if the the ming dyna. If the king dynasty rather sorry was in fact overthrown by the taipei heavenly kingdom which came very close to happening. It was european intervention that tipped it back towards the king. It was at the end of the day. It was like the devil you know there were western advocates of the typing heavenly kingdom because they're like hey. These guys are christian. We should ally with them but that implied social leveling that the west didn't want so the king hang on and then of course. They lose the middle class which is when you get the nationalist. 1905 revolution of sun yat-sen but then you know in those conditions that breaks apart almost immediately because you just don't have the structures to support this thing warlord era. Then of course the japanese invasion another imperial outsider interference and you have a you have a a protein communist party here. But it's it's sheltered in these small urban enclaves on the coast in a country that is overwhelmingly peasant and it's those same peasants. It's those same dispossessed haka peasantry the working class of the countryside.

Basically the proletarians of the countryside who had formed the backbone of the taiping rebellion under the under the banner of christ and and then the the equality promised by christ. The heavenly kingdom of of redistribution is now the by the by the 20th century that symbol is dead. Nobody believes that here anymore what's left is marxism is socialism and so that's what is picked up for the next stage of that rebellion and this time it is successful and it carries out the process of middle class. Active middle class not landed aristocrats not the feudal order the capitalized either in the west capitalist but in china bureaucratic and russia bureaucratic The people who sit in offices and make phone calls the important. The nodes of interaction that actually have like a human variable involved they modernize of course. They kill a zillion people just like every modernization process does and they built and then mao tried to he saw what was coming. I don't think he could deny that sure ma wanted to keep power but he also had a project in mind and he saw it coming apart and that's why he hit the panic button for the cultural revolution stir up the kids and just hope that they could do something like break down these bureaucratic structures. These bourgeois value systems that had never been broken up before these hierarchical relationships that had not been breaking up have these federal kids go in there and just go crazy but you can't depend on students. You need people who actually work for a living and those people had been annihilated by the great leap forward and then what emerged was this compromise with capitalism after the maoist push towards communism within capitalism failed which you could always you could just call a concession to reality and then you got to give dang credit for being the clearest eye of any of the communist leaders for seeing what was coming gorbachev of course being a complete doofus the guy who should have see the real god damn it. I might have to talk about this more on a different stream but I kind of get the feeling like maybe. There's one more hinge point after 1945 and like the consolidation of the cold war where maybe things go significantly differently is if nixon and brezhnev in the 70s had really been able to bring china into a global system and then negotiate everybody's movement towards a globalized corporate order a holistic system of systems. I'm not saying that would be good or would be capitalism. I mean that it would be socialism but it could have met the challenges of climate change earlier and more effectively which would basically just buy us more time. I mean my god the way that bruce after nixon gets gets murked Brezhnev's entire approach to the obvious decline of the soviet union was or and of the world. System was to just float by on high gas high oil prices because the very thing that was telling them all that they needed to change the structure of this system to redistribute things to make this less inefficient of a structure to cut some of the fat. It was a short-term boom to the soviet economy and so for the people whose job it was just to stay in their office and keep their keep their their comfortable position. It was an easy call to just ride get oil prices until reality comes knocking in the form of the collapsing afghan government and then boom the same flails of a dying empire that we're going through. It's just they're cyclical because there's nothing to oppose and transcend any of this yeah. I do wonder sometime about nixon because he really was trying to he was trying to assert a human agency over This thing that everyone by that point recognized had defeated any alternatives to it and of course it was racist and patriarchal and violent. Of course. It's western capitalism. He's not a communist but instead of communism being beaten and destroyed. It's able to maintain its position as like a grounded material political economy that's able to assert influence and power in the world. Maybe the soviet union doesn't collapse. Maybe climate change can be addressed. Maybe we don't respond to the crisis in the 70s by cutting the throat of the working class who knows something to think about all right. That's a long one. I hope it made sense but bye guys you.
