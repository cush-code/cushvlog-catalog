Roland was a warrior from the land of the midnight sun where the thompson gone with her heart fighting to be done. The deal was made in denmark on a dark and stormy day so he set out for biafra to join the bloody fray. I'm 66 and seven they fought the congo wars with the fingers on the trigger knee deep and gore. For days nights. They battled the band two to their knees. They killed to earn their living and to help out the congolese roll in the thompson gunner.

Howdy folks. This is a muncher only stream if you're not a munch head. If you have not accepted muncherism as the only meaningful ideology of the 21st century. Then you need to log off this chat. This is for munch heads only muncher number one munch munch house. The munch is loose. People don't know what I'm talking about It was revealed that the new slimer for the sequel slash reboot of ghostbusters just have to stop myself from doing some miming something that might get me taken off of the stream He's been is out and his name is muncher and he is if someone wants to put a picture of him in the In the chat.

Here it'd be helpful or you can google him yourself. He is I don't have a way to show it. I'm sorry. I guess. I should draw a picture of him or something. He is green. He's blue instead of green. He has six arms instead of the two and then he has a face of pure misery. He looks just an embodiment of agony. He looks like one of the damned souls in a bosch painting. He is pure anguished existence. He is begging for a death that has already come as opposed to slimer who's like just a big fat party animal who enjoys putting a lot of hot dogs in his mouth and what's interesting about this to me and the reason that I muncher speaks to me. Is something that a friend of the show josh. Androsky said he said that muncher is gritty for people who know that it's over muncher is a mascot of of true hopelessness because think about the trajectory that you have to do to go from slimer to muncher. What is the distinction here how how are we to how are we to place the mantra in context.

So first we have in the original crush busters. We have the ghost himself this slime and what is this slimer. This slime up is a being a pure desire. The the slimer he seeks to consume he cannot not for digestion not not for nutrients but purely for the pleasure of consumption and he is presented as such as as as a being of of a pure expression and desire. At lust the the the lacanian subject. What is mantra muncher seeks the same out outcome. The muncher seeks to consume the muncher they are quick to point out. He wants to eat the corn there is corn behind the monster and the muncher he wants to eat the corn. This is key that the muncher also much like the slimer he wants to eat the corn but but this is the crucial distinction. The monster does not enjoy the consumption of the court. The muncher is at no point in finding his pleasure even momentarily satisfied because she is the simulacra.

He is the the copy of the copy of the original slimer. His his consumption has consumed him his failure to wrecking realize his desires has consumed him and left him unable to enjoy anything much as we. The consumer of the programs of the films are left to watch the ghostbusters film but have to have none of the pleasure of first watching. The gauche buster the original busting of the ghost because the muncher is slimer emptied of any reason for being because muncher's there because the ghostbust slimer was there because he was part of the concept of ghostbusters that genuinely insane man dan aykroyd thought of and he was a part of that muncher only exists because a certain segment of the population has heard of ghostbusters and therefore an investment of money into the ghostbusters. Franchise has some degree of probability of being recouped at some degree of level that can be put on a piece of paper to mark the market accountant to keep the flow of of bonds circulating through your your corporate entity. That's it that's why muncher exists and so even though he's doing the same thing that slimer was doing consumption from beyond the grave. This literal hungry ghost a literal hungry ghost. His pleasure has been robbed of him and also the other reason that he is divorced is of of pleasure of of any satisfaction is because he truly is slimer after 40 years of being slimer much as we collectively are slimer after 40 years of being slimer like america.

In its post-seventies form is a place where all questions of democracy of autonomy control over one's life and circumstances of life have been seated in exchange for credit basically and and with that credit the ability to consume cheaply. So what has that left us it started. The go go reagan 80s. We were the bright green goblin stuffing hot dogs in our mouth exalted in the pleasures that come with unlimited access to cheap goods. Anything we can imagine it doesn't matter that industrial capac industrial policy and employment policy and wages are no longer democratic questions that our control over the pace of and conditions of and substance of work has been lost unless you can make it through the gauntlet of post-graduate education and get a get some job that gives you some illusion of meaning even though even there you are fully at the whim of your employer. What we've given that up that section of human self um self-realization self-actualization has been seeded in exchange for consumption and what have we done we have consumed and where has it left us it has left us at muncher. It has left us sickly blue blue. The color of depression covered in arms to grab to grab desperately and a face wrapped in to quote myself referring to the baseball crank. Another signal of the time an anguished rictus and that is why I believe that muncherism is 21st century marxism and must be supported against all critics. We love muncher don't we folks we love him.

We love the box look at this guy look at him. He's blue. He's got the arms man. He's gone can you guys have you guys been able to get your head around how fast trump disappeared after being the only person in america in some significant ways. For four years. He is now an unperson we just like kaiser. Jose I gotta say I did not see that one coming and I think more than anything it boils down to them get it taking away his twitter account and I think something about getting the twitter account taken away and honestly deutsche bank pulling the plug. Disciplined him like deeply as much as he wishes. He was still out there screaming into the void so that he could fill the void with himself. He is he's finally for the first time. Maybe in his life feared a consequence and as a result he is allowing himself to be forgotten because remember he has the choice he could be out. There he could be continuing himself like twitter and account or no twitter account.

He could just say hey I'm going to a a rally you want to come problem. Is he would have to do that stuff himself. Now the machinery that existed before to allow him to say. I want to go to the alamo and then they go to alamo texas because even the people he surrounds himself. Even the professionals are morons. He can't just press a button and have that happen anymore and so he can't do anything.

It really does tell you and it really should tell more than anyone the libs that he was never in charge of this thing whatever you want to call it. He was never a puppet master. He was never a string puller. He was always being allowed to do what he could what what he wanted because it served the interests of other people and that's the thing that people who like to point out like when you're trying to argue about fascism. Oh god. They'll say it doesn't you can't point out that trump is incompetent. The real fascists the original fascists were incompetent. Yeah. Hitler and mussolini were a couple of complete fail-son work and they were too lazy or lacking in in actual skill to support themselves any other way than getting on a stump and bullshitting to people.

I should talk. I'm in the same phylum of human. I mean I hope. I'm not as evil and I'm honestly not as charismatic. But they were fuck-ups and when they took power they didn't become any less fuck-ups. They were essentially gamers. I mean d-day succeeded in part because they were the german high command was too afraid to wake up hitler because he slept till noon every day during world war. Ii and mussolini was like banging 15 of his mistresses a day in his stupid palace while looking at a giant globe. Like they were they were just they were lazy. The reason that they were able to take power is because they were given power by powers that saw use in them and trump was useful and he no longer is and we are seeing that absent those supporting institutions. He has no independent ability to operate which is why it would be hilarious if they oh god no.

I'm just saying if they're gonna do it. This stupid about holding him accountable. I'm sorry. He left. He lost the election he's out of office what you're going to double kick him out of office and this idea that oh you're going to banish him from future office. We've already seen how much he is dependent on all these exterior things to keep him in power and secondly hey if you don't want to term how about that and that goes for the republican party too how about you like become coherent in some way to oppose just being pushed over by this guy and I honestly think the reason they're doing. This impeachment trial is because they know in their hearts. He's not going to get a criminal trial because we cannot hold anyone who's ever held real power in this country. Criminally liable for anything nobody can even imagine that anything they do either in or out of office either enter having to do what they're being president or not seeing the inside of a jail cell. Oh no no no no no no no because as soon as that taboo breaks then the politicized prosecution of political enemies and losers is on the table and these guys are all criminals so they don't want to have that happen and so instead we're going to get a big stupid trial in the senate that will waste everyone's time and do nothing and we'll just further emphasize to anybody casually paying attention to to proceedings that these the biden administration these about anyone and they will be correct do. I go for it on fourth down of course. I do that was one of the most absolutely. I mean.

[14:25](https://youtu.be/vIvFg-_oskM?t=14m25s)

I can't get too mad. I haven't really been watching this year. I haven't really cared about football for a while. I really more at this point just want my boy. Aaron rodgers to get another ring because I think he's such a such a pretty quarterback but I did watch that game and that last that was about one of the most baffling just. I felt the spirit of mike mccarthy cackling with delight and now he's gone. He's definitely gone bye-bye. Apparently he took a flight to dc to talk to dan snyder which hilarious if it happens and you know what he I it would be fun if he did like a tom brady and went to another team and immediately won a super bowl. But we'll see bye bye yeah. No that was baffling that was that was really not great. I do not buy any game stock stock game stop stock game stop stock.

No. I didn't buy any of that because at this point it feels like it's too late right. I mean obviously they can keep going for a while but I don't want to be the last money in there. I'm never. I'm not on reddit and this truth maybe. I should be on reddit more get on the ground floor for some public criminal behavior. This has to be intervened with right like there's a there's a on reddit decided to buy a bunch of game stock stop. The game stop stock with their stimulus checks. Wall street cannot allow that to continue there will have to be prosecutions or some sort of regulatory crackdown just because not because it's wrong or even illegal. But because it is too disruptive to the flow. It's too. It's adding too much unpredictability to a system that is already clearly teetering of course. One thing they could do is crack down on short selling which is what this whole thing was premised on but can't do that. Because that's that's how the real people make money yeah.

We're certainly definitely not in a in a bubble people asking about glenn greenwald or Jimmy door bad faith forced the vote. People are very frustrated by all these arguments one way or another or having or they're frustrated that they're being had. This is the outcome of losing and having trump gone like if you have invested in you know politics to this point. If your politics have been shaped by this online discourse and by the underlying assumption that online discourse can provide meaningful guides to action or meaningful coordinations of behavior that can affect politics then this moment where the democrats are in power. There's no real plausible way to pressure them now and because the dem republicans are right there that 50 50 senate oh god perfect for them to get to push off to for each dem for each base to be placated with accusations against the other for not being unifying enough. We get back to the obama years in every sense but now with a fully developed political social media subculture which didn't really exist under obama or it was like it was it still existed but it was it was in this weird transitionary period between the blog era and social media. Like that whole obama years you didn't really get until the second like the last the last two years of obama's term before you get something really like the even early emergence of a self-conscious online like left-wing movement to use the word incredibly loosely and so now you're gonna have a fully developed one with the same dynamic. The same dynamic of powerlessness at the bottom and a republican part.

A democratic and republican party dedicated to you know bipartisan austerity in the face of misery at the top and that means that you know there's gonna be a lot of hate to be made and a lot of incentive for people to create big fl sparky fights with each other to simulate forward movement to simulate power and authority. More than anything that's the really important part is that this stuff is about creating the illusion of momentum forward because if you're fighting with somebody who is on another show on another has their own you know click and you can criticize them have them criticize you that dynamic that conflict can simulate a like a movement finding a direction like it becomes our virtual reality version of you know like a floor fight at a convention. Only there is no convention and there's no party and there is no um power and then no one more importantly. None of the people represent anyone they don't represent anyone in the sense that there is a coordinated group of people who have like certain demands have certain um. They don't have a block. All they have is viewers and the thing about viewers is that there's a lot of reasons that you watch something or listen to something they don't always they don't correspond politically because it's not really politics. It is entertainment and I'm not really condemning this.

I'm not saying it's bad. I think the argument that's bad is premised on another misconception which is if people weren't doing this they would be doing something more productive and maybe. If they were online less. They would find something more productive in their lives but as long as they're gonna be on here anything. They do is going to be non-productive the I guess. I just I just personally cannot invest the energy in it. But it's because people feel frustrated. I mean my god. We're we're in the middle of a economy is teetering on collapse. They're They're got their thumbs up their ass about everything there is there is essentially an admission by the power. The party that just took power in a huge up vaccine rollout. The massive increase the the the massive the numbers of deaths. Oh more strains coming We're gonna see about we're gonna listen to the science but that still means reopening stuff because there's no alternative to keeping the goddamn economy. Moving keep the money circulating because we have no large scale capacity or interest in doing anything else. Anything that could actually be a meaningful check on spread instead.

Fauci's out there today saying you know what maybe wear two masks so that now when you're out you can feel better about yourself for having two masks and you can judge all those other people who only have one mask and then the people with one mask now have like a nice precarity where they can feel superior to the people who don't wear any masks and then feel like a weird hostility and resentment of people who show off by wearing two and so you get another layer of resentment field. Self-expressive politics to make up for the complete lack of any coordinated ameliorative project here and in such a context why wouldn't you be pissed. Why wouldn't you want to see someone to blame and if you really have spent the last four years convincing yourself that these debates push the wheel forward in some way. Then there's a lot of emotional investment in picking the right leaders and holding the wrong ones to account for their bad faith and their bad views. I mean the people a good example of this is the boogaloo boy thing with jimmy dore how many boogaloo boys are there in this country. Realistically how many of these guys exist what difference does it make and either way and I'm sorry people say this is like monstrously dangerous because oh people are gonna flood into their movement. No no it's all. It is it is you are you are you're talking to this and you're talking to and about a incredibly self-selected group of political maniacs. People who have driven themselves mad by politics one way or another and are invested in like public performance of politics that is a thin slice of the population that cannot and will not like spontaneously regener like expand its size and the idea that well these people are being funneled into it who is being funneled where everyone is just online and you have to be a certain type of mindset to see this whole. Thing playing out and go yes. I'm gonna wear a hawaiian shirt and carry a gun around in a protest and that that combination of stuff the very last step of that is whatever they see on the internet.

[25:36](https://youtu.be/vIvFg-_oskM?t=25m36s)

That's the last thing that gets someone there. It's and honestly the least consequential step of all of them. It's almost arbitrary. I am not the most soy person ever thank you very much at least at least. I have an actual beard. I did used to have a neck beard. I will admit but I do have an actual beard. I always annoyed me when people would say call me a neckbeard after I got a real one. I was like I'm sorry sir. This is not a neckbeard oh good thank you. Someone asked about that hilarious american conservative piece saying that we need a salazar ma I love that because it really does show a lot of the very the pathologies we're talking about here um if people don't know salazar. Is like the he should really be more loved amongst like the the dork right you know like the book nerds like the guys who the insult types because he is of the 20th century european dictators. He didn't come out of like the military or anything or even politics.

He was a professor. He was an economics professor and when the military overthrew the government in portugal they no one really knew what to do and the only competent person in in who got a a portfolio was salazar who because of his technocratic economics economic skills was made finance minister and he did such a dang good job that they made him prime minister and eventually he was able to consolidate power around himself and away from the military and then he had like a franco-esque run as a super as the guy as pres as prime minister of the estado novo. The new state which is like the syncretic thing that he created there and there's a whole and him and franco also shared the fact that their deaths were very prolonged and in salazar's case kind of comical because salazar had a stroke and everyone thought he was going to die and an opponent and a a successor was appointed and was already ruling when he came out of the coma and they didn't want to.

I mean they'd already done the transition it was going and nobody knew how many marbles he still had so instead of putting him back in charge. They just told him he was back in charge and gave him like a little desk and a little phone that didn't connect anything until and then waited for him to die and then after that the His successor was overthrown by a communist-led military coup well.

Very rare thing indeed the carnation revolution which as I have said is the closest thing we really have to anything we can hope for so. This is sort of like the right wing flip side of that. Like I'm I'm pining for a a a american carnation revolution and the american conservative is pining for an american estado novo but one thing that really exemplifies is what I'm saying and refers to that. I was talking about the total boutique irrelevance of all of this online argumentation like. I would say one in a thousand americans.

Knows who salazar is at most. This is just a thing for nerds to talk about and then even in the but even on its own terms. It's a failure because I read that piece and obviously it's garbage and he soft sells salazar's brutality because they were brutal. It was a brutal police state. They tortured and murdered communists. They had concentration camps and also they carried out horrifyingly brutal colonial wars long past the point when it was pretty clear to every other colonial power in europe that it was no longer viable to have these things. He was one of the last supporters in europe that the illegal white minority government rhodesia had which he didn't talk about but what he did say in the article is. He created this beautiful syncretic thing this paternalistic traditionalism that gave everybody like security where they were and prevented the. Market from like totally destabilizing everything and prevented most importantly politics from poisoning every relationship and that since we're all too politicized now to really deal with one another and that is true and this thing that we have to deal with the fact that like the the basic premise of of um like political collaboration that has to undergird even partisan conflict has dissolved like that's a real crisis that we need to deal with but his res but the idea that the way to solve that is some integralist state shows you how just how much people don't understand what america is because even if you accept his description of the salazar regime of this I don't know on face value. The thing that allowed it to work is that it was it truly was like a barely post-feudal hegemonically catholic country that actually did have like social traditions that could undergird a political order. The idea that america could ever duplicate that is insane because there is no social betting social um restraint to individual desire everybody in america like the american traditional the ideal that the that that would have to undergird whatever he's talking about our version of that like catholic individualist which certainly couldn't be catholic because you know there aren't that many catholics in america and most of the ones who are and most the catholics we do have are protestant.

[31:56](https://youtu.be/vIvFg-_oskM?t=31m56s)

We have what we have as like an embedded social tradition is I get to do whatever I want and that's true of conservatives as true as it is of the most licentious liberal and I think the last four years have shown that pretty clearly any argument that that that there's that the patriarchal capitalist protestant order that like woke capitalism is overthrowing is in any way more like that is is any more more socially restrained. Any anyway less maniacally committed to self-satisfaction at the expense of everyone else like I get to do what I want when I want and and limitations on me are in fact limitations on freedom. Conservatives believe that just as much as you know the decadent bushwick witches that they hate do there is no social framework that involves a idea of social expression and liberty that is not maximal like it is not maximally committed to personal for personal satisfaction and for americans that means more than anything resource consumption. And if that's what it is you cannot have any stable non-political order overrule that and and and coordinate that because figuring out who gets what is politics and if there's nothing in your social framework that even suggests that anybody else but you get everything then you need you need either a strong like alienated technocratic You need a strong if you have a government that's gonna work at all. It's going to be.

It's going to necessitate as much access to resources as possible and our crisis is a crisis of resource access and the reduction of it. The reduction of the expectation of it more than anything and salazar could tell to the the hungry. Masses of the 30s go to mass stop stop wanting to tell what stop wanting a car go to mass or. They wouldn't even consider that the most part you're talking about incredibly poor people in portugal they just wanted to. You know the bishop doesn't want you to do that think think of everybody else there's nothing doing that there's nothing to to ground us there's nothing to work from even if the the the normal americans even if our like white middle class. The white middle-class base of conservative reaction in this country took power there'd be nothing there to ground them because everything I want when I want it is the sum total of american culture and america's expectation of um life and the only way that maintains itself is domination and extraction at home and abroad in some combination.

But yeah it reminds you that the right is just as out to like the the online intellectual right is as out to lunch as the left is is. This committed to building their little ships in a bottle and fantasizing about autonomy and ability to to influence the market and politics. As the left is people want me to talk about australia day. I have no idea why you would what what about australia. It's is that like the fourth of july for australia basically. I'm assuming that every year it's a big culture war thing because of the whole settler colonial genocide deal. I don't know why they are so what wrapped up about australia don't get too attached to it it will be uninhabitable in 20 years well.

I would not get too like fixated on on that hey thank someone is asking about kurt schlichter. I I was idm some friends of mine the other day and I said what the happened to him. He this is his moment he wrote two books about an america that's like broken up by a civil war between woke people and and real americans. Why was he not at the capitol why was what is he been doing. I mean. I don't know what he's tweeting because he blocked me a long time ago. But I would I would assume that I would have seen his takes like come through the trade transom because even though he had me blocked he was always good.

I would always find out when he said something insane because somebody else would say check out this and somebody like whoa. I haven't seen anything from him since before the election he's still around right. It's kind of blowing my mind like did he just lose his nerve because this. You would have thought when the election was contested and people were going to courthouses and demanding. They stopped the count and people started saying we're going to go to washington. A second american revolution. You would have thought he would have been at the precipice of it. You would have thought that he would have been like on point rallying the troops. I'm going to see if he I'm going to see what he's last if he's been tweeting because this is honestly baffling to me how quiet he went.

[38:54](https://youtu.be/vIvFg-_oskM?t=38m54s)

Oh did he get well. This might explain it. He's not did. He delete his account. Ah there. He is ah. Here he is wait a minute. He has a town hall article about how joe biden is a draft dodger. Are you was talking about during the george not even george boyd during the halfway. I mean I guess you can't expect anything more from some guy who like sat behind a desk in kosovo and basically acted like. He went into fallujah with the first first marines oh pathetic pathetic. I mean if you see that if you see that moment pop off after all that running your mouth and two books about it and that and honestly this should have told you all you needed to know about how serious this like insurgency was anybody who has a mortgage anybody who has a little bit to lose or or is like well secure enough in like the media ecosystem that they don't need to like risk their life and safety for clicks and and engagements. They're not going to poser. Oh.

He's just whining about celebrities being mean to trump oh my god man. I mean it's probably good that he didn't go to washington. He's of the body shape to be one of the guys who keeled over tasing his own balls. Yeah. Muncher sort of has filled the spot for trump. Isn't it like our collective expression. Like he is a tulpa in the same way. Trump was I think. I've talked enough about muncher for now. But I might come back to muncher. We'll see yeah so about the new book. I think I might do. I might do black reconstruction but I'm I'm still deciding. I will I will. I will let you know soon though what's muncher educate this fool muncher is us consuming hands and mouth filled but still miserable. People are mad yeah.

Oh man so there's a recall move for gavin newsom um. I'm actually kind of interested in how that would work because the way they recalled gray. Davis is that daryl isa the carl arm crook congressman carl um congressman from orange county paid millions of dollars to hire canvassers to go around and get signatures and a lot of people signed them because he had botched the the blackout situation and he had I mean it was enron's fault if anyone's seen smartest guys in the room they kind of make and gray. Davis look like a sort of a martyr because enron was the one who actually he could have seized that and he didn't do it because he's a go along together he's gray davis. He's a democrat so I have no sympathy for him like people are mad at him for a reason and but isa had the money and did it and of course in one of the greatest cuckings of all time. He did that because he wanted to be governor he was going to be the guy who swooped in and replaced him and then schwarzenegger just goes hey. I want to be governor and then he had to endorse him and just an amazing bit of coverage but for one how are you going to get are you going to get enough signatures now with every fewer people out and about and two has the partisan dynamic change. So much that no matter how bad newsom is doing any recall.

 will be will be assumed to be republican and therefore will be rejected by a california electorate that has turned pretty strongly against republicans in general. But if he doesn't it'll be too bad because it would be a beautiful piece of history repeating itself if newsom got recalled and then the rock became governor of california and of course people say well. The rock is a republican. He would obviously have to run as a democrat that's a no-brainer but I don't think that that would be too hard for him because he's already a you know on the on the um on the edge. He's already. He's already condemned you know divisive talk and stuff and that's all you really need to do for democrats to love you. Forever. Clooney would be good because remember california is nutty if there's a recall. It's not like there's a primaries or anything. There's one election where anybody who gets enough signatures or like files. The paperwork can be on the ballot and so you could get like some celeb democrat to do it that would be cool but. John's the rock makes the most sense as like a sequel to schwarzenegger somebody asked if poser and hustler is a better word to use in grift or grifter.

I don't think that there's any reason to us use those terms at all because it is. It's all the whole question of grifting is the spider-man pointing at itself meme because the grift if there is one is the grift of the presentation of a fabricated reality whereby your participation in online political argument and online political opinion formation is organizing that is not true now the people who operate from that assumption might not know that it's not true. They might be lying to themselves in order to keep themselves engaged because they have no other way of imagining themselves. Being and others might be aware of it but have justified things otherwise but it's such a pervasive thing and it so undergirds all of these things that like pointing out one person as a grifter over someone else seems to be a pretty small boar. I mean how it's dissecting the grape like how do you determine everyone is grifting. Everyone is operating off of the same shared delusion.

[47:32](https://youtu.be/vIvFg-_oskM?t=47m32s)

Yes liz and brace should run for governor and lieutenant governor of california. America is a grift someone says 100. That's one of the best things about lodge 49 is that not only did it show what it's like to struggle in this country. The payday loan cycle and you know people putting off purchases and putting off health care because they can't afford it and stuff like that they get that part. But then what it also really gets is that the people who are making it. The people who are actually succeeded in this economy are not doing so by creating anything useful or by presiding over meaningful economic activity.

They are sitting on a nesting in nesting pyramid schemes. They are there to be names on paper to move around money that is never that never has to be invested profitably in anything that just has to be moved around and just has to sit like the whole. The background of the show is that the the big defense contractor which they call orvis in the show which is modeled after boeing which is like which has that role in as like a key industry in the real long beach is closing and they're in the process of shutting down all of its departments and and selling off all of its assets and creating these big and then dealing with the land that it had it had been on and all and that so that was a real company you know that actually made. In the the fortist you know military keynesian heyday after world war ii and what's replacing it the the the chain restaurant and the 

The fake residential development are all just competing scams and of course to tech sector which is the only place where you know real. Money has been made in the u.s. Economy outside of extraction in the past 20 years. Is the most exemplary because that's entirely fictional none of those companies make money. I don't know if anyone has seen the graph that was put that was put out recently of of the stock prices of non-profitable tech companies. Over the last few years it is a shocking image and of course. We now have the richest man in the world being a man whose company makes cars a few of them that tend to blow up and kill people. Like tesla is a boutique car maker. It's like maserati it is not like gm or or ford or chevy in terms of it's. It's the cars it puts out there's no reason for. It's to be worth what it's worth other than the fact that musk has as.

I said before been able to monopolize the brand of a salvageable technological solution to our current crisis and uber has lost more money that could ever make back even if it did become. The monopoly transportation provider in the country could never make back the money that's been spent on but that's not the point the point is not to ever make money. The point is to is to move the money around and as I've said with the tech sector specifically invest in technologies of surveillance and control and now they're doing a thing with lift where like you have to bid for a route and like you have to take you have to take a lower rate to get more rides. This is the opposite. This is a this is a I believe daniel bessner.

 pointed this out. This is like the old um. This is like the old hiring halls for unions only from the owners where and where they get to dictate your your terms because they control access to the to the opportunities to make the small amount of money and the same way that the online political media ecosystem of grifting whatever you want to call. It depends on people who want to be grifted because they want their engagement with this to mean something. All of these stacked up criminalities. They exist because we need them to be there yeah the new social contract at the world economic forum it's neo feudalism if you need a spoiler alert. It is you own nothing you you have access to things you have access to streams of data to housing to to food sources that are conditional on your relationship with the companies that provide them that you want a good quick definition of techno feudalism at like a at the level of your like economic relationships. That's it and what that means is you have zero leverage over anything.

Not only have you lost the leverage as a as a worker as a producer that was lost with the end of organized labor. You have even lost your leverage as a consumer which was what we were supposed to get instead which was supposed to be the deal. Yes you no longer have control over your work. But you have control over what you buy and that control exerts. Allows you to exert leverage in the market that's still too much that's too much leverage when people are going to have to exist with less and less so that has to go away too and that's the new social contract all right. I'm going to wrap up here in a minute. If anyone's got any more questions well. Somebody says they're not enjoying the surplus. It's really more about the distributing the surplus that other people and machines make elsewhere because remember. This is when we're talking about neil fueller's we're talking about it. You know the way that that's going to express itself in america. It's still going to depend on resource extraction and labor in other places of the world par other parts of the supply chain and then that surplus comes here and then it's distributed at the whim of no longer. Any kind of collaboration between you know people and capital that you saw in like the mixed economy of the 20th century. Capital unbound godzilla or king khan I'll I'll watch that movie for one thing for sure. I mean i. I see a movie if there's big things fighting in it even if there's cgi.

I don't care. Someone wants to say that they thought my diabetic joke was funny. I I'm sorry if people were offended by that. I it was really I was not saying that like I was not making a fat joke or anything. I swear to god. I was just trying to make fun of libs as always but anyway um.

I will see a movie where two big things fight each other. I actually kind of did like the first godzilla even though it was too self-serious. I enjoyed how much of a sense of proportion and size. Godzilla had that movie and also the fact that he was in it so little a lot of people complained about that. I liked it because she didn't burn out on him. I liked kong skull island did not like godzilla king of the monsters very much. But hey it's kong vs godzilla and what are you gonna do what's wrong with that. Although it is very funny how they had to make kong way bigger than he is canonically because obviously the size differential is so just so big that it's not really a contest which you know. They did that already with the original king kong vs godzilla. But the one thing that always made it seem like a mismatch is the fire breath you know he has atomic town from another zip code. How are you as a giant ape supposed to defeat that and there's a shot in the end of the trailer where he like has some sort of device that he uses to reflect the thing. I don't know they have definitely um in these new godzilla movies. They made it a little better a little easier for king kong because um they've sort of made it so that godzilla doesn't get to blow the fire very much he has to like save up to do it which hey that could be the case biologically but of course.

The real thing is that obviously there's not actually going to be a winner or a loser. They're going to turn on a real enemy to fight together because they're both good guys. They're both now canonically good guys They cannot one of them can't lose and that's fine. It's just who the bad guy is like. I'm sure it's gonna be some other scarier monster. I would really like it though if it was the people that would be the perfect king kong vs godzilla movie. If they were basically made to fight one another by these humans for their own amusement. More than anything or for you know the the dark power designs of some of them and at some point in the fight godzilla and king kong realize that and just start wiping out humanity. But I don't think we're going to get that sadly yeah like deep ecology and the thing is is that there they had a so. They've had a a weird through line of that in the movies because the whole like godzilla is presented in these new godzilla movies these new legendary godzilla movies as like this balancing force who restores the homeostasis within within the ecosystem. Once it's been thrown off and I don't understand how after now it's three movies. Godzilla has not realized that the thing destabilizing the goddamn ecosystem is not some giant.

 is breathtaking the the degree to which they assume that everyone has not only watched all these movies and the thing is yeah most people probably. Most moviegoers probably have watched all of them considering how much money they made. I'll admit. I've seen them all but not only that that they does not assume audience investment in the crap that he makes. There are five transformers movies which I've seen all of the lore in them like the internal canon changes from movie to movie. There is no internal consistency whatever they want to do. They do and they essentially forget what happened in the previous movies because they know you're just here to see some stupid words in the first transformers movies are a voice over by optimus prime saying in the beginning there was the cube and he says that this energon cube is what created life on cybertron and they're fighting over it. I think in the and then in the second movie. They introduce the idea of like the other. This this race of primes who all like killed themselves on earth millennia previously to hides the matrix of leadership and that there are and even though the first movie showed the cube like making machines come to life when it touched them. They had machines giving they had like baby robots being burst out of pods and robot heaven. The fourth movie had a robot goddess. I believe voiced by kate blanchette or somebody be the person who created life on earth and also the transformers and then of course the fifth one had king arthur and harriet tubman as like secret autobot allies through history.

None of it is connected to itself. None of it makes sense even internally let alone from movie to movie whereas the and that you're going to sit through 30 minutes of a incredibly unfunny parody of a 50s sitcom because my god maybe there's something lurking beneath this. This placid suburban facade when have I seen that before so that you can get a few crumbs of reference to the movies that came out years ago at this point psychotic and an imperial logic that is that is monstrous and and once again give me give me give me bay give me bay's simple carnal desire to see things blow up and to see women in wet shirts bend over motorcycles. All right folks talk to you tomorrow. We will see how much gamestop stock is up in the next 24 hours and then I'm if it's still going up. I'm gonna feel like a real idiot for not buying some all right bye-bye.
