All these people that you know all these people that you know all these people that you know floating in the river out lungs. I could buy myself a reason I could sound myself a job. I could hang myself on trees and all my folks. I know are gone. All these people. They know all these people that you know floating in the river on logs. I could find myself a reason. Am I was ever drunk. I can hang myself on trees. I know I'll go. I can take this pot plant to the woods and set it free. I'm gonna tell the owners just how nice that was of me I can find myself a reason. I can't have myself a job. I can hang myself on trees and oh I am my own damn God.

Hello folks hello how's everybody today. I'm fine feeling groovy. I've diving head first just to let you guys know what projects I'm working on I've been headfirst into the Spanish Civil War for a multi-part inebriated past later this year. That's the next big thing we're going to release. Chris is going to take a break because he did way more work on hell of Earth than I did before we come back and reconvene later this year to start working on the Seven Years War pod which I'm very excited about because that's where you go from sort of Brenner you know which is how we end how on Earth with coming back to the Brenner thesis on the emergence of capitalism in England and then we synthesize and merge it with the Seven Years War and tell the story about how that rhetorian process was enforced through trade just as Wallace wallestine says and His World systems theory predict speaks of so that's my goal is to connect those two theories that people are constantly arguing over into one process. You have a specific. Geographically fixed phenomenon of capitalism is emerging out of the um the creation of a ground a free market in ground rent that's the thesis that Brenner and woods wood um promote. I I I I buy it. It's a narrative that makes sense to me and that's how I understand anything. I don't understand numbers I understand stories because I am a Humanities dork at the end of the day never be a stem. Lord can't do math gotta count on my fingers so I buy that and that's how we end Hell On Earth as we have this stagnant system that was broken open different places had different reactions to that crisis.

The response in England specifically the coming together of reformation and declining agricultural yield in the land like just D the the soils being depleted by repeated agriculture which is just entropy in the system but as I said as I say not just that the reparation if you don't have the enrichian reforms if you don't have the liquidation of the church in England that process which is occurring elsewhere you know there were enclosures in Germany. One of the things that led to the peasant war in 8 15 25 was the end of the beginning of enclosure of public lands in middle middle Europe. So it wasn't just in England that was happening but it and but there you have this Holy Roman Empire this this. Dog's breakfast of a system that couldn't assimilate that without destroying itself and in England you have a process that fuses this political revolution with this change in economic conditions to create a new social realm and then that world is exported with the Royal Navy and the bank of England. Those are the two things that drive this process. It is the the bank of England and its system of a stable national debt fueling fiscal expansion tied to a a government program fixed around the building up and the assertion of Naval technological superiority because England's never going to be able to fight on an equal basis on land. It's not it's in Europe.

It's never going to be able to challenge for Continental hegemony against France. More than anything Germany might have broken up but France has brought even closer together into this absolutist state. This really powerful social machine but it's land-based that means you've got an option. You've got a place to go and they put. They put all that money that was being built by the circulation of this currency into the building. This Navy that just forced everybody else to unleash their bourgeois on their own terms in their own specific ways. So you have this revolution in the countryside in England turn into a political economy that then conquers the world and the Seven Years War is really the breaking. It's the inflection point for this process because up until the Seven Years War you had these two blocks emerge right out of the 30 Years War Austria and Spain the habsburgs they're in terminal decline. At this point the Dutch have flourished but they're going to hit their own limits on their viability since they're just a little postage stamp in the middle of the North Sea France and England become the dueling hegemonic Powers. Neither of them having hegemony France dominating on the continent through the massive land Army that Louis XIV creates and England is doing it on the sea with their vast Navy. Both of them are also though in conflict in the colonies and and they split North America which is where the game is going to be decided and the difference between them is that the powers that be in England connected to the merchant economy that they've created know that the colonies they know guys like William Pitt. The Elder are fixed on the colonies the Seven Years War unlike the other Wars that happened under Louis XIV success Spanish succession Austrian succession which were sparked and began on the mainland in Europe.

This one starts in North America. It started by George Washington and it's over the Ohio Valley. In central Pennsylvania is France going to get that or is the United or is England and the British are like this is where the contest is going to be decided. The French thought that the Canada was a pain in the ass. It was a Backwater I mean part of it is it's less hospitable. It's colder there's less of a colonial project for a number of reasons. But for them it just isn't worth the candle and so they kind of fight. But as usual they're focused on the mainland and see North America as this Sideshow. Whereas the British see the colonies as the whole game and then by winning the Seven Years War they guarantee their hegemony over the world system that will be built out of their economic activity. The triangle trade in the Atlantic and but then also eventually locked into raw material exports in India spices and spices and Exotics and silks from East Asia and when it ends England is ready to kick off the Industrial Revolution. The process of fighting that war of of concentrating Capital around these questions of military efficacy is going to create as a byproduct. A new material economy that people get to interact with to invent things that might not necessarily be for military use and that's how you get this explosion. This efflorescence of technological innovation you had a similar thing happen at the birth of capitalism in Europe the military Revolution that we talk about on a hill on Earth Factory. It's a level the next time there's an explosion. It's going to kick into an even higher level which is exactly what happened in England and so the continental and international hegemon of England going into the second half of the 1800s.

I'm sorry the 18th century is now going to have a mechanical heart that everybody else is going to have to run after and try to unleash their bourgeois in order to catch up on. We only have the Russian Revolution because Sergey vitta in the late 1800s looked around and said we can't be futile anymore if we want to keep being a country and this process that had gone on over centuries and it involved the the expropriation of the entire North and South American continent in large parts of Africa and the domination of India. All of a sudden has to happen like that and so this feudal kind of Quasi Mongol. Tributary state has to become a capitalist economy overnight so that process happens in every European country depending on their specific conditions France invent. Under this pressure France invents modern liberalism I'm sorry liberal nationalism England invents. Liberalism. France invents liberal nationalism and so that ends up leading to a military a social revolution in the French Revolution that culminates in this character of Napoleon who is this synthetic figure who guides this historical energy to France's maximum capacity and France has an insane capacity at that point but by that point what it doesn't have is colonies or a Navy that can compete with the English and at that point it is even a question of material.

They could have put all of their money into building a Navy that could numerically rival the English that would cut off that would cut the mouse elsewhere that would undermine their military. But they would not be able to replace England's sheer degree of cultural. Knowledge stored understanding of Naval Maneuvers and Naval life that you get out of a at that point a deeply seasoned British Naval community. Now at the bottom you're churning out. You know people are getting literally shanghaied onto boats and kidnapped to be you know. This the squabbies and the and the and the the the ball carriers.

But the officer Corps is seasoned and knowledgeable in a way that your your expanded french navy will never be able to compete with because you're going to be dealing with green shoots. You know it's very interesting though Napoleon himself was thinking about a naval career at one point and it's very interesting to imagine him trying to deal with the constraints. The resource constraints of the British Navy of the French navy to exert himself in the in the Army. He was able to you know rise meteorodically because the the the Army was the heart of the French Revolution after especially after Thermador because you've lot you've killed the social ferment at the heart of the thing you're no longer pushing a social boundary.

You're defending a social you're presenting your defending a social truce between classes. Class war has stopped so that means that that has to be made up for somewhere else and it's made up or in war in Conflict. Like liberalism is considered cynical non with passivity a desire to negotiate towards Solutions rather than violence. But it was the gerandans. It was the moderate gerandans who pushed most deciduously for France to enter a war with Austria.

A war that Austria didn't want the other there was an assumption among the French nobility. Maybe that the other powers of Europe would rush to their a but at the end of the day Francis. Their main rival France is is destroyed from within by chaotic social forces that's good for you. There is no incentive for them to stabilize their social system so they and they were basically just waiting to see what would happen. It was guys like brousseau who pushed for war. The Liberals pushed for war because they had to validate this regime. Now they have to validate it as a moral undertaking now that it could no longer be said to have a social Vision. A social apocalyptic vision Marx is from the rhinelands. Trier the child of emancipated. Jews emancipated by Napoleon foreign so that machine that social machine of the French army is able to dominate the continent but it burns out its Center.

Like those liberals first they tried they fought and they lost and it terrified everybody and then the Jacobins led by Robespierre who by the way had opposed the war had said don't go to war with Austria who said when purso and those guys talked about spreading liberalism at the point of a bayonet he said nobody likes the only thing people like less than a missionary is an armed missionary and so it ended up being the the sharondans yes. They were eaten by the revolution but it wasn't because of their commitment to the social question. It was because of their desire to avoid the social question through a bullicose foreign policy but then when they start losing battles -oh. Not the people want somebody who's more ruthless and then the Jacobins fill that space. They filled the space of of a better. Steward of a revolution that was at that point considered to be deeply imperiled why because they've invaded they fought Austria and Austria was kicking their ass. But this is why this is the you have to think of the process as as Progressive no matter what because you can look at Napoleon in one hand and say he was the end of the French Revolution but then you look at the fact that when Napoleon's armies marched into the Rhineland what did they do they emancipated the Jews like what they were fighting for had a remnant of what had been fought over but the class war at the heart of it. The the drive towards social equality had had broken against the lack of technological capacity to make that change France was a peasant Society. At that point it did not have means of Productions adequate to be socialized and so you get a Bourgeois Revolution. Instead you get a compensatory war with Austria instead. Then you have the rise of the Jacobins whose war on the the ruling class and perceived traitors that the what made up the the Red Terror. There the the great Terror that was to make up for an unfinished social Revolution but why are they having this social Revolution because they have been forced into a global competition for power by England that they could not sustain.

They lost the Seven Years War. Then they tried to get back at England by contributing to the American Revolution but then in the process they bankrupted themselves because they had not modernized their economy and their financial system. The way the English had with their unified single Central Bank lending out a stable currency backed by the debt to that to the government in the form of bonds. The French had nothing like that they were grasping for money from a aristocracy that still held feudal privileges that prevented them from being taxed. They England didn't have to worry about that they were getting money. They were getting tax money consistently from their upper class and middle class like a machine by that point and so this thing starts to break open you get a few ruined harvests and you have some Rising food prices to kick it off to make it take it from abstract to concrete to take it from generalized discontent to a willingness to act the lack of calories.

The hunger in the stomach always is going to be the Catalyst and you have this Revolution and then you have this new state that's oh my God unleash all these capacities. This rationalized modernized capitalized state that that Napoleon births to the world then but it is still not going to beat England and then all the other countries in Europe come into being in recognition of this new competitive framework in Italy and Germany are formed out of the need to compete and what these explosions are is a given country's social base coming into coming to terms with capitalism as a mode of life. Like it is the moment when enough people are feeling the Destiny in the air I guess to act and so you have that happen in England in the English Civil War which we talked about in Helena of on Earth. You have it in France. The French Revolution. You have it in Russia with the Russian Revolution and you don't have it in Spain which had started off the entire struggle for early modern hegemony in the first place.

Like Spain is the first early modern hegemon Spain defined the terms of the contest like as as Christendom is collapsing into confessional camps. You have a hegemon and it's Habsburg Spain with with the Holy Roman Empire. It's like a kind of a wounded Tale by the end of that war. By the end of the 30 Years War they're they're cooked and so that they avoid this. Reckoning this intersection between social the social ferment of people struggling under these old conceptions of identity and religion and and social life with this new demand of being abstracted away from those things territory deterritorialized pulled from the earth like in a meaning like literally pulled from the earth. In the in the case of the peasants you do mean literally pulled from the Earth but also everybody pulled from their social relations uprooted and this causes violence. Everywhere it is a it is a supernova.

It is a birthing Pang as the Condoleezza Rice would say of a new subjectivity and Spain's is the latest of all of them because Spain was the first one that means that it's formal. It's its structures were frozen in its apogee because with an Empire what got you to your greatest extent will be your downfall because everybody who will have claimed power while the empire was innocent. They will be wedded to the things that got them to that point even when they stop working because to change those conditions to change that subjectivity would be to be to be to be declining instead of rising to to to be coming to Earth instead of ascending into godhood and they couldn't have that Spain takes and so the Spanish state this Catholic counter-reformation state that takes over North America a big a big chunk of Central and South America and has access to the silver. It is this it is a feudal state in every sense you've got the you got the most Catholic Majesty.

You've got your Cortez dominated by grasping local Nobles. You've got a huge degree of regionalism and factionalism. You have a very little Central Authority I mean you do you have more Central Authority than anybody to your East because the Spanish Kings had control of the Inquisition. This the Spanish Inquisition is called that because it was not the Catholic Church's Inquisition the the officials of the Inquisition torkemata and those guys answered to the king of Spain and that gave and it was the only institution that covered all of Spanish territory. It's the only one that's that's written ran everywhere. Otherwise. It was local feudal Authority so that was the thing that they had that a lot of other monarchs didn't.

But it was still very relatively little but they were stuck with those all through the cut fight that would come with the French with the Dutch when they Revolt in Germany against England. They're fighting with this Antiquated system that they can never fix because it it got them there so instead they will slowly be detached and and lose their empire and become cannibalized But they will never create a social engine within organically of Spain to push through these contradictions. They'll just sit there during through the process of combined and uneven development and that's where they sat stagnant until the 19th century. When Napoleon kicks the door in and jump starts modernity and that is the story of um of nationalism capitalism. Bourgeois revolution in Europe is is defined by Napoleon showing up to a disorganized in the case of Germany and Italy or totally medieval social framework like Spain and get everybody like oh. What's going on here and then being agitated by the this violent act and oriented towards a consciousness of some kind and of course. It's the most active group social group is the literate Bourgeois they've come to prominence and around ideas of nationalism that are defined by the context of a national contest with France and being dominated by a national government in France and so for Spain gets this Kickstart and so you have a liberal Revolution.

The kickstarts river liberal Revolutions in Latin America so that they lose their. They lose the Empire that by that point wasn't even getting them that much money because local control was so predominant. They were getting a trickle of the resources that they should have but they because they did not have a modern State capable of extracting them. So they lose the they lose their their Holdings at most of their Holdings in north in the new world and they still have the Philippines and they have the Caribbean islands and then there is this series of Civil Wars between conservative landed Aristocrats. Organized around the Catholic church and and land tenure and all that and the up and coming bourgeois and that fight is all the way through the 19th century but at no point it's fought to a draw. Every time capitalism does come but slowly cumbersomely not as a social system just as this foreign imposition of capital as people invest in Industries. Mostly though in like Barcelona in Madrid nowhere else really but it sat on a low simmer. Now when most of these countries have their big conflagrating moment with capitalism is World War One which is a continent-wide sort of recognition of the of the stakes and a a somewhat deliberate process of waging National War to avoid class war and that leads to this explosion that that massacres Millions including the large chunks of the working class. In these European countries and then in the aftermath of that you have battle lines drawn in a modern context. We are we are changing our social lives who is going to be in charge of this process and it aligns into these blocks which broadly are the Bourgeois themselves and their liberal institutions and liberal Intelligentsia.

 and the social base that they connect to mostly professionals You have um the working class broken at this point by what happens in Russia which is a national manifestation of the class war. No longer. Is the class War hidden it is now overt because it is now expressing itself through the framework of these State. The state competition that Westphalia in is seen to like represent the beginning of and now so that question of like orientation towards Russia splits the working class into factions which come down to you know. The things like the amount of degree you're alienated to your social situation. Like for example in the United States. Immigrants were more likely to be pro-soviet than native born Americans among the Socialist movement but for whatever reason it is difficulty of work. You know specialization relative privilege. These things break the working class into fractions and then you have the lower middle class and the small farmers. The people who own their land. Beyond subsistence Surplus sales you know and then the lower middle class in the cities. We're talking clerks white collar workers. Small business owners that kind of thing self-employed yeah Craftsman and all of them are now in this hell.

This this this cauldron of blood and misery that is this dark Chasm starting in 1914 and then just barreling through the horribly tumultuous twenties and then the the bottom falling out in the Great Depression and there's a series of conflicts. In all these countries over the the resources of the state and there is a civil war in Germany that leads to the permanent defeat of the working class. There they didn't know it yet but they were done but among the allies and that among the Allies you have this fight carrying out in parliaments you know among political parties. All of this on top of this. This class of liberals trying to you know have the have all of the benefits of capitalism and all of the development but without any of this icky social conflict that emerges and it creates this eventual stalemate as fascism takes power in France I'm sorry in Germany and in Italy legally because the divided left is defeated by an alliance of capital as an independent Force defining all these other institutions contributing to all of them in one degree or another dominating all of them but not being defined by any one of them you've got capital. The military aristocracy the junkers and then that middle class and that's enough to take power against the divided working class. So you have the stalemate by the mid-30s where the communism and that fascism are rising as these polarized camps in a existential Collision Course and then you have Western Imperial capitalism anglo-american capitalism connected to This Global striding Empire in Africa and Asia.

They're all driving against one another. Something's going to pop and the place that pops is Spain because the Spain is the farthest back in this process has done the least to create durable and legitimate liberal institutions. It happened to Russia first of all of course in 1917. Because they were even more backward than Spain because they were an entirely different context like they were in they were their their um for most of their history. Their competitive framework was not against Western Europe. It was against the ottoman Empire and like the Polish Poland Lithuanian Commonwealth in Sweden. It was an entirely different competitive framework defined by States that had not had so capitalist revolutions so they they pop a gasket pretty much immediately the there's there's nothing they can build between February and October of 1917. Capable of channeling the energy that is being Unleashed by this social apocalypse that under that undergirded the Russian Revolution the social Apocalypse of World War One but France Spain didn't fight in World War One.

By that point. They had lost so much of their territory having had the last of their Holdings jacked by the United States in the Spanish-American War that there was no reason for them to get engaged in any of this. Power block ship any of these alliances because they weren't defending anything. They had a a scrap of territory in Northern Morocco that they would go and have War there instead and they would get their asses kicked by Rift tribes people but so they had this little pocket Colony that they could kind of amuse themselves with and give their army something to do really what it was like like. We have this military because we've got this. This this still ruling quasi-futile aristocracy with all these sons that we got to do something with and what do you do you put them in the Army because they think it's cool. They think it's epic because like that. It's all the it's all these Remnant chivalric values that we never got around or overthrowing. So we got all these. What are we gonna do with them well let's send them to Morocco. They can get ambushed by a tribesman so then while all these other countries have had this Titanic experience of world war one that had forged their Estates one way or the other. The conflict of course not coming in Spain in France and England because they won because they were gaining The Spoils of Victory with the United States so that social conflict was reduced but in the losers and in Italy which fought on the winning side but didn't really get anything for it.

 the crisis exploded and you had some sort of radical shift towards something else fascism in this case as a mutant response of capitalism under crisis under specific conditions of a late Comer to the European power political game so in Spain by the 19 mid 30s. You have this incredibly powerful working class movement that was divided similarly to the German working class. But the dynamic was different so in Germany because I think it was the first place because feudal uprootment had been happening for so long there um yes you had the the split between the radical Communists and the more conciliatory social Democrats. But the Communists maintained their basic adherence to a legal approach to power yes. They were in. They were subservient to the common turn yes. They intrigued around about rebellion and revolution in the in the early 20s. But by the mid-20s they were a political party are competing for power on a legalist framework of participation and had a party that reflected that in Spain you didn't have that the more radical faction is anarchists who are trying not to work through capitalism that they feel that they're enmeshed in which is the experience of a fully capitalized subject.

They are trying to resist the imposition of a modernity that will alienate them from a a conception of social life that is still rooted in the village. It has been stripped of religious language because they hate the church because what the church has done for them and done to them as an agent of power but the Social Gospel is still alive and well and that rejects the requirement of marxist dietitianism which is to push through the process of modernity. Instead. They say no we will resist modernity. We will step aside We Will We Will sidestep modernity and we will develop a post-scarcity economy through the building of it not through claiming vying for state power imposing capitalist rationality and Central and Central Authority from the center and then turning us all into people that we will not recognize. No we're not going to do that and there were enough of them because there were so many more than anything there were so many landless rural Farm laborers.

The type of people who were peasant war of 1525 finally come to Spain. It's it's the rep like it is the the the the explosion of the socialist movement in late 19th century Spain when it is being industrialized because that's when they all started getting industrialized whether they wanted to or not. That's when Russia started doing it. That's when Spain started doing it so you have quickly the emergence of this new working class exposed to these new ideas that instant almost instantaneously transfer transform the dead Liturgy of Christianity as represented by the Catholic Church and transformed into a social gospel and the Socialists. The marxists around the ugt union and the Socialist and then later communist parties that really does represent the Lutheran current in this Spanish reformation and the anarchists are your anabaptists and they have a much bigger social role than the anabaptists did in the 7th 1600s 1500s because of the technological Revolution that means we don't we aren't just a bunch of people. We aren't just a bunch of unemployed Farm Workers.

We have access to radios cars firearms. These things can be organized and brought to us. We can the the factories we work in. We can go in there and seize control of them. We can organize our social power in a way that the peasants of middle middle Europe and the 1500s who got slaughtered then the anabaptists who got cornered and massacred in Munster. They were able to actually assert power but only for a while because of the contradictions at the heart of trying to fight a modern war against capitalist subjects as a feudal one. It's like you gotta. It's it's a hand behind your back and that's why what I hope to do getting back to what I started talking about what I hope to do with the Spanish Civil War. Miniseries is give every side. It's due and describe the internal logic of the factions and point out. Like given these points of view. These people are right. They are operating from what they believe to be proper premises and you don't have to choose between them.

For the very easy reason that they both ended up losing. The anarchists were not able to defend their Revolution against the Bourgeois and communist Alliance and then the Communists were not able to defeat the nationalists. Once they took power. It wasn't there either way and that's the tragedy of history is that we're forced to act in conditions that we don't choose and outcomes are determined. By things that we largely don't have any power over all we can do is is find our moral place and act from it and not try to project like that's the liberal paralysis because the liberal gets to sit in the middle of all this tisk and say oh look at these barbarians. We wouldn't do that but only because they're sitting in gravy only because all of the misery and violence that sustains their world is out of their View. Like I've started doing my research here with the classic. The probably the English. The the most esteemed one volume history of the Spanish Civil War by Hugh Thomas. It's big. It's it's it's comprehensive.

It's it's well regarded. It's it's the filet of the genre as Jeff Daniels would say in squid in the wild but you know and it's got a lot of great information and I'm gonna go from. There you know like okay. What do I need to follow up on and then I will follow up in those directions. That's how I do it start with a big thick General book and then dive into specific subsections. But what's really funny reading. It is Thomas's like complacent British liberalism. He's just looking at all these sides. Like oh these these hot-blooded Latins. They can never compromise but the thing is only the liberal can feel the Titanic shift towards the capital of subjectivity coming and be fine with it. Everybody else is horrified at the sound and wants to stop it and is going to strive to stop it and they of course couldn't and one of the big reasons.

Is you got guys like Hugh Thomas sitting over across the opium you know having having prostituted the entire world to the pound sterling and just to say oh we were so peace loving. You had more violence than anybody but it was all in North America and in Africa and in India and in China where you opium so you could hook everyone on drugs and rebalance your. Your species. Trade books with China because oh no we're we're buying too many Chinese Imports and we don't have anything they want how about drugs and so we have this idea of like where you should at how you should act in a crisis. What you should do that is that assumes a a liberal distance from consequences. So that's what I hope to do with. This is just be like everyone is acting how they thought they needed to. The tragedy is that that's those clashes are the only way that any Clarity comes to those sort of situations and that the last thing you should do is sit around trying to figure out who was right and who you would be you're not them. You're you and you have your own questions in front of you. We all do and we have to defeat that self-satisfied liberal in our head.

Somebody asked about Ernst Tallman in the in the German Communist Party of the 30s and whether they could have done something to prevent or the 20s and early 30s no yeah well. They could have done something to prevent the Nazis coming to power I don't think so because by definition the German Communist party is going to be hotwired to the foreign policy goals of the Soviet Union. Like that is that's what defined the Communist party is that it was orienting its itself away from a german-based political movement like the SD s PD and a a as an instrument of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and this to them was the strategically smart thing to do you. Why would you not want to work in coordination with one of the powers of Europe which is now in the hands of the workers it made sense to them. They were committed to doing it. There was no way we're going to stop them from wanting to do that so the question becomes what did the Soviets tell them to do and the fact is is that Soviet management of the German Communist Party throughout the 20s was awful. It was disastrous because it was being done in Moscow by people who didn't know what was going on in Germany because the only way that you stop the Nazis from taking power legally and forced them to to Rebel which they want to do and will do if they have to Like the anarchists were able to force in Spain.

Like okay we know you guys are gonna. Do this at some point do it so that we can take power in fighting him because we're not going to win. Through The Ballot Box. We're the Communists we're the existential threat to everything that the state is. It will not give us power through the front door but the only thing they want to stop the the Germans the Nazis from taking power through the electoral system was to have a electoral front with this the Socialists which they figured out after the Nazis took power which is when they switch immediately from the third internationalist. Social fascist demand to refuse any and all engagement with Social Democratic parties because they were social fascists worse than the fascists.

It switches almost overnight to a policy of encouraging popular front solidarity with not just other working-class parties but is this social Revolution. Grand hotels in the soup kitchens you're scaring the Straits hey cntfai you're scaring the hose span France and and Britain but again it's not their fault why shouldn't they Orient themselves towards Moscow. The STP shot them all. The STP conjured the fry Corps and then out of the fry Corps the Nazis to defeat the left but somebody had to do it. Somebody had to make the Tactical decision to either to do two two of what do two of one thing tactically a lie as a delaying measure with the social Democrats. Even if they hated you find a way to do it because yes the STP also resisted the Communists but it was Mutual polarity. If one side was moving towards something might have happened you either do that or you plan for a seizure of power you plan to fight it out. Maybe you do them hand in hand.

You make the short-term agreement to do the long-term plan for military action. But what they did was neither of those they sat around and waited to get Nazis and that's all that's all the direction of the common term yes that the patient that the decision depends on your strength in that moment which is a decision that can't be made in Moscow. Let's see what I'm saying in doing the thing that they thought was going to help them the most tie themselves to a world revolution's headquartered in Moscow. They hamstrung themselves and made it so that it was impossible for them to act in the moment. Bourgeois Bourgeois democracies were not going to survive the in Europe we're not going to survive World War II and the Liberals that are look backward as Heroes people who are trying to settle everybody down and prevent all this violence or actually just the most deluded around because they were the only people who didn't know that and a lot of liberal. Judgment of these actors retrospectively basically says well if you'd all only believed in it too. It would have kept going but belief is in results and the results of Bourgeois democracy were that they had rendered themselves moot to anyone but the most deluded and or most materially adhered to the Bourgeois State Among Us.

So it's again it's just a big tragedy. I mean Solomon himself. It's kind of funny like he was just kind of a bimbo or he was a he was the kind of guy that like was fetishized by by communist iconography like a like a real working man. But he didn't really have a nuanced understanding of what was going on. But that's the thing Nuance kills you at a certain degree. You need to have people of both sides the Frederick Ebert. He was the person who saw what was happening and acted but he acted from the position of wanting to save the bureaucratic structure of the Social Democratic Party not to advance a working-class revolution and that is because the German working class political movement had had 30 years of legality to build that kind of self-regardance. But as the Bolsheviks have been who are the most motivated of the of the political organized class. Had been illegal right up until the Revolution would the US be better off with a parliamentary system. I mean it's hard to imagine any structural change meaning anything because in order to have structural change you would have to have a drastic political you couldn't have moderate reform at this point absent a revolutionary attack on existing power structures like you can't even dream of reform through the or the system. We have because of its total capture at not just the level of Institutions but at the level of the individual mind. Like the closer you are to Machinery of power.

In this country. The more Hollow you are of human feeling of human values. The more you adhere to a reptilian worship of this alien structure. This this this oily piston spider and because it is so technologically abstracted. Those points are very few and the people there are not like you and me I mean we're all we've all been warped dramatically by our exposure to this social system and our relative position within it. It's defined us. It's stamped us. But there is still a ambient Humanity that that crinkles and Sparks underneath the surface. But it disappears the farther up.

You go conditions change and they could lead to dramatic change but say a parliament for America would only come on the other side of that process. He could not help initiate that process you know what I mean because that I think is the the fantasy. If only we had X Y and Z institutions. You are Take You Are in a desire to appear reasonable. You have made invisible the steps that would have to get you there and our current political system cannot be changed that way by which I mean citizens voting in elections as a measure of political participation. If that is what we're assuming and I think people who talk about reforming structures like electoral systems. Assume then you can't get that from here and so it becomes sort of a a beside the point because that question of like is it is a parliament good will. It be helpful need to be made by people in a position to build it. I mean and a good way. To point this out is Australia has a lot of the features a lot of reformists in America dream. We had they have short elections. They've got proportional representation in their Senate. Although it's insane they have a senate get rid of that what are you talking about. They have mandatory voting and they're is neoliberal and devoid of Politics. As We Are God Australia is so cut because they're cut by England and the United States in different ways.

It's brutal like they they're they're just. They're getting lucky. Pierre like they've gotta. They've got a queen. She's still the queen. They got the Union Jack on their flag but their currency is called the dollar and they're fixated on our culture of course oh right. They've got a king oh. My God I got to start saying that the K we've got a king. I thought that was never.

Gonna is the pope gonna die because I wanted to see a Papal election and I gotta say I'm not having it with these long ass Pope terms in the Middle Ages. The pope would drop dead every 22 weeks. Now they keep anti-pope. Somewhere get African Pope give me an African Pope Robert Sarah. They always say that he's a front runner the Pope the Archbishop of Ghana or something rap singer did not last long. He just died if he had not quit we would I would only be seeing my second ever papal election. Now instead. I still only had two because Francis and ratzinger I want another one. All right I gotta go guys bye.
