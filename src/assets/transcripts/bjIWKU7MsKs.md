Hi everybody the hooting and hollering just started the seven o'clock Putin holler everybody putting on everyone else everybody being thankful that the lights still works everybody being thankful that they can still order ground home. Under the gather the garbage is still getting taken out and that the internet hasn't stopped working hey everybody thank you guys that's nice today as it was the other day. Sadly. It's been raining the last couple of days but it's good enough to be outside question already. Wow can I suggest a film for Chapel to watch I mean like as a thing to talk about well. There's a couple that we have a store and a couple ideas. I've had. I think we should probably do what about Southland Tales. At some point we've talked about it a lot might as well and I wanna do an episode was will about Richard Jewell. Soon cuz I feel like that movie that movie was really good apparently.

Some stuff I said last night was part of Orthodox Sunni. Thought of course. It is. I mean it's a cliche to say this and it's like it sounds like a coexist bumper stickers but like oh all religious traditions start from a fundamental understanding of the same reality. They are just translated differently based on the cultural context in which they emerge don't groping towards the same thing. We're all grabbing the same elephant and so it makes sense all this stuff for fraks through every other secular and religious belief system like I said like Marxist Marx was binding on these same frequencies the same way that Buddha Buddhist star and Sufis and you know whatever whatever even some props do that not that many of course certainly very few in the United States because they think heaven is real like. It's a city. I gotta say I don't really know you can like communicate realistically to somebody who is convinced in the way that I am convinced of what I think is real that heaven is like a place like there's a street. There's something with those 72 virgins like really that's your idea of eternity. You know what eternity is. It's like yeah. It's basically like South Padre Island come on shape up religions.

Let's get out of here I'd address this but why say a preferred Abstract Expressionists isn't because it did not have a political valence because you look at a piece of abstract art and you're going to have an individual response to it. It's not going to refer to material circumstance that other people can all that other people who see it can all agree - it's totally individualized the response to it is entirely individualized and that's great then you guys could argue about what it means and none of you will be right and none of you will draw political implications from it because you are making totally subjective emotional reaction social realist ours that we can that is inextricably linked to the conditions that produce it and points towards those conditions that's a common vocabulary of a kind of set of problems that emerge from the work. The people who all who see it all who expose themselves to it. They can all have that are all going to have the same vocabulary discussing it. It's not going to be an individualized point of view and that is dangerous. Hypothetically I mean presumably a lot of those feelings will just get read pitch elated and reabsorbed as it always are but you know if there's too much excess. If there's too much that can't be absorbed. Then you really have a problem. Picasso was not an abstract expressionist of course. Cubism is not abstract expressionism.

How will they underreport death counts with bodies keep piling up well for one thing. They're already keeping death counts down by not testing people who have died of it who suspected to have died of it but died before they were tested and by calling things like heart attacks and strokes and yeah. They were opportunities. I'm sorry I got. I don't get the second I'm trying but there are and that people value like the number of people who are dying of COPD and pneumonia are already shooting up and those aren't being counted as kovat deaths. So we're already under coming to begin with and it's not even at that point. Gonna necessarily be any question under counting as a question of normalizing to the degree and now you might say well you know you could overwhelm the health care system not if we read not if we if we reorient like the expectation of care. If you have it it'll be like oh you have it there just isn't any place for you or it's full or it'll be triage by like wait time or or ability to pay and if you can't get the care and time that will be as sad for you and for your family. But it will also be how things are now the same way that thousands of people getting shot by guns thousands and thousands and thousands of people being killed by cars tens of thousands of people dying hundreds of thousands of people dying for lack of health care people dying from surgical mistakes. People buying from every element of capitalist corner-cutting and and and copper theft at a copper wire thing thievery that has made up the the morbidity.

Latino opiates look at how many people are dying of opiate addiction tens pet what is it my 80,000 people a year or something like that. That's a stunningly high number compared to what it used to be even a few years ago and it's just a sad bummer. It's a thing that happens yeah you normalizing the structural violence. Then you do that in every level like if you accept that like this stuff is a mixture of natural circumstance and and structural inevitabilities and yes it's violence and obesity to obesity to like yeah. We're gonna keep everybody. We're gonna replace real food with corn paste. We're gonna put pesticides and everything that we have no idea what they do to people. And when we find out what they do to people. We're gonna throw them away. We're gonna dump that information so you never even know yeah.

People have we have so much roundup in a piss that we could like write our names in the grass and it would stick there because it would kill all the blaze and it kills people. It's like gives you cancer but that's just the brakes and it's like there has to be a moment of absorbing and recapitulating and like rationalizing the phenomenon as it emerges which has happened with all the things I'm describing which means that this is just going to be like a more open and more dramatic and probably more contested. I hope more contested process and the degree to which that's going to be true or not is the degree to which they're going to get away with. It is a degree to which we left them. I mean in broad sense like in descriptive sense not in it not in a judgemental sense like if we let them. It's not that word makes it seem like it's our fault. It's not because we don't have the tools and the question is whether we can build them and there's no certainty we will be able to. They might be able to we might not. But it will be our fault but it will be because we didn't stop them in like the narrow deterministic sense.

[09:07](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=09m07s)

But that's what they're gonna try to do now that might not happen like one of the big reasons is they're gonna open up again. State states are saying they're gonna open up right now what if I mean people people have to work but people don't have to be consumers they really don't. They don't have to go to Chili's. Now a lot of the you know these yokels who show up with the shotguns and the ar-15s in front of state capitals to shoot someone. I don't even know you know that's interesting that guns that those are really more interesting than the guns that like the the rallies where they're trying to like. Because the guns have the the culture war rallies that have been before this and these guys are all copying. The guns are they're presumably to protect them from the Anti Fog right I keep up empty spot but now when they were protesting this these coded closing there's only a key pop. The any kids they're all cuts their home.

They're actually Florentine so the only people there are the medical staff who once again aren't ordering people to do anything they're just trying to protect. They're trying to save lives who are that are being lost by the actual existence of the virus and the police officers who are actually enforcing the law so once again what is the law for I mean what is the gun for what is the why do you have a gun dude. Why do you have a gun and the clinic. I don't even know if they would answer because I think it's just because I'm doing a protest like. It's like you wouldn't ask somebody to protest while you're holding a sign. You know.

I think that's it. It's like they're expressing their they're expressing their latent. Their political power and their latent unspoken willingness to go beyond the ballot as a world. But of course it's for most of them a bluff and yes. It's a pacifier. It's a binky like you. They don't even know what they're what they're carrying it for because it's that people ingrained as a totem of strength that they don't actually possess but yeah and technology is gonna be part of it. They're gonna track the track and trace stuff that's like literally tracing people and then because I mean realistically these guys are gonna. I mean if the technology exists and it looks like it probably does if you can do like water scale testing and tracing which of course Trump resisted. Trump resisted testing because he wanted to keep the numbers down because he doesn't he has a child's understanding of everything which means you know like he. He understands at one level at one axis level.

He understands they like you and I like Trump and and any other president or any other person. What understands a large number of people with the disease is bad to have we all understand this most people because that information is connected to a foundation of presumptions that lead to it and have been worked through know. Then that if the number high number of 10 of people with this is bad then the way to prevent the number from going up is to intervene some way to stop the spread Trump. He understands the the mere idea that a guy number is bad but because he has not done any thinking to get there and couldn't if he wanted. I mean maybe if he really thought if you really concentrated you could get there but it would take him weeks to get to even one like banal statement of truth.

That's how unn unn reflected his life is that's how unn unn how little work he has done into examining any of the structures of thought that he under so he sees numbers bad and he thinks well don't okay well. If you test people they're. Gonna come up with more numbers so don't test them and then the number won't go up. So they told people don't text and that is it's like. It's that's the difference between an idiot responding to a situation and somebody actually thought through what the situation means even though they could agree on like that that's why I'm so annoyed by the by they're getting annoyed with the binary way. We discuss rightness and wrongness about ideas because it leaves us to argue on the wrong term. The wrong planes in the wrong terms like big number is bad is something that both Trump and you know say jay Inslee or you know somebody who's considered a confident response. To this the south korean president they all know big number bad. So they're both right about that. It's just that they're the truck is wrong and how he got there. His presumptions are wrong and so and so you have to pick like the level where the wrongness is to to get at where the mistake has been made the original branching off into into just premises that will lead you inevitably to the wrong thing. But anyway I forgot what I was saying about that. But yeah Trump wants the number to go down and that's why it resisted testing but now it's inevitable or you're good and you test it cuz.

[14:53](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=14m53s)

That's the only way you could possibly reopen things and the best way you could reopen. Things solve two problems. You have solve two problems by reopening and they're only solving one right now and we'll see how much the effect there is that you can you can say things are open and your businesses can open and if you work at those businesses you got to go to work because you had a $1,200 stimulus jacket nothing. All else web you probably lost your health care insurance health insurance and you might get a deadly virus at any minute. So you so you will go to work. But you can't make people go and patronize the businesses you can't make. People go to the restaurants and go to the bars and go out if they think the thing is real and most people do. They're gonna be worried about that and even if they go out it's going to be for the last time fewer they're going to spend less money. It's like you have to make them feel comfortable about getting out too so. I think what they're gonna find is the only way that they can square the circle like I've said the real way to fix.

This is to war communism the economy and create direct provision and like essentially suspend capitalism and and and you could you could do that don't ask me how but I guarantee you. If I got enough people in a room. We could figure it out since that's not gonna happen because it would undermine capitalism. I gotta remind the markets we have to get back and Americans of consumer service industry economy. We can't it's not like you can go oh. We could leave her factories is the thing. If these are factories then it would be no problem like if we had an industrial economy. You could make them go back to the factories and then you're done you're producing the thing and you can send it out and they'll be sold somewhere.

But but this still doesn't follow the service industry. Not even where the service industry is a huge huge chunk of our economy. Maybe the demand any kind of significant demand shortfall will result in sustained and suppression and contraction and they don't have any intervention for that or they want one so they have to prevent it. And if you have this deadly virus out there and then you're finding out oh yeah. By the way you can be like totally healthy and it just can suddenly start curdling your blood and then you get a do that I'm just saying. If you work on it is in the economy. You don't have a service industry. You get rid of the you're not doing it anymore. You're getting rid of you're just. It's it's. It's supply chains replacing a the market Jesus Christ so to fix both ends of that equation to get the back of the work and to get people out of their houses to patronize the businesses.

They're gonna have to be they're going to have to who like they're going to have to take the suppression like all these basically if you if you if you stripped down to it and you ask all those people protesting at those state capitals if you were to like make them break down their belief system on what this is and you got to exclude the ones who think that it's not a real virus because that's that's an incommensurability beyond your ability to breach but if they believe the virus is real and it is as deadly as a disincentive so you got to start with those people and that is gonna be a subsection but if you've got them down and they admitted that then what they're basically arguing for is. This is slavery that we have to be kept in our homes. Freedom would be if people who are sick had to stay in their homes and I got to go out and that is a perfect capsule description of the American conception of freedom since the founding of the country. That is what Liberty is. It's a X amount of work has to be done X amount of surveillance must be maintained.

X amount of discipline must be enforced. X amount of misery must be inflicted essentially to maintain this social structure. It is unfair to me Liberty is being a puppet of being infringed. Freedom is being undermined the degree to which I must feel it and then the reason for that is because there are people who deserve to feel it and not more than me or in a binary sense. They do and I doubt and of course that's where slavery you know the southern colonial mindset of like the justification is the difference between me and you. That is what and it's in my head. But it's what justifies the imposition of the social costs. The externalities the external miseries created by building a social order and maintaining it on to you and that is freedom because I because I'm here don't deserve to have these things infringed imposed on me. They did and that's where you know that's that's that's the basis for the anti-immigrant xenophobia stuff.

[20:10](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=20m10s)

And so the next like group that's gonna enter into the pantheon of others who deserve to have this stuff. Happen to them will be people who are sick with porn with korben korben date-date. Bill. Corbett know people who have it because if you can if you have robust testing which we could do we really put the pedal to the metal. Then you could get a better map of where it is and then innit. When it did emerge. You could get it quickly and then button it up and then if that went with tracing where those people are and enforcing through full legal means quarantined on them that would be freedom to the people. Doing the protesting that would be that would be Liberty now people talk about how authors know anybody's blah blah blah whatever not talked about. We don't know any about that stuff and honestly it wouldn't matter because this is all about Corbin Bernsen. This is all what what they have to do and like I say if even after then because of lack of antibodies there's still a higher mortality. It will be incorporated it has to be I'm just talking about the general contours and so even though the the imposition of on the person like here we got a thing where there's a light load on everybody. It's not that hard there's a light load on anybody.

I guess I would say this there's a light load on everyone who is under quarantine. There's a heavy. There's a light load at everyone reporting because we placed a heavier load on the people who still have to work in essential industries. So we have like X amount of like general Liberty. Now we have less and it's been just that's been displaced on to essential workers but even that thin amount of liberty imposition on quarantine people with jobs. But but a basement full of ar-15s is too much because it's a me basically and so their solution would be take. This small amount that I have to feel and place it on to this larger category of people suffering from kovat and they will have their freedoms restricted. Even more than the essential workers had or certainly we all had collectively under quarantine. Now you are tracked and traced and can be arrested and I guarantee you in a situation. Like that. The penalties would gets tougher would get more severe because the need to maintain order to maintain the system of individuals to say to him because these aren't just people under quarantine. These are people who are positive. They will amount to humanism look at John Cornyn saying like you know 50% of Kovach deaths.

There are bad underlying conditions like obesity and heart disease and it's like dude that's all of your constituents and everyone and it's like they all know they don't think of it that way because they're not. Gonna get it so like you see that you're like well how would a fat person who lives in Texas and it's not like their heart and he in likes cornyn how's it. Gonna read that he doesn't read that and say your life is matters less because you were overweight no because that loser had core koban and I don't know it won't get it so yeah like that's what American liberty has always meant it isn't the extent to which I am free of the burdens required to perpetuate the circumstances of my civilization and that's why and that's where these that's like it. It is it like I think that out very little things are actually hypocritical.

I don't think autocracy is real honestly. I feel like either one like hypocrisy of like I'm like believing in the thing in acting a different way. I don't think that's hypocritical because as I said believing a thing doesn't mean anything. It's you're acting out if the thing that you believe which means that like for example if you're a Christian fundamentalist who has an affair checks off that doesn't mean that's the none of that negates you being a Christian and being a Christian doesn't negate you having checked off or cheated so like the hypocrisy. I don't I don't think that the idea there the underlying idea is that well if you are. This you'll never do that. And I don't think that that's realistic because the doing that is is everyday the thinking that is only afterwards and it's incorporated either way and in things like this like these kind of ideas. Like these ideological contradictions like oh you know you got a gun but you see black.

Police lives matter. It's like that's not hypocrisy because their definition of Liberty is such that Liberty is other people who deserve it bearing a burden of policing and authoritarianism and exploitation that I because they have it coming and some fun that went away if they've brought it about and so that's I mean you want to talk about Protestantism being like a key piece of software or a key piece right. Now one of the most important lines of code that went into the development of America is that is that really one of the only ways to make sense of that is if you believe that that you could know who deserves anything in this world and of course. It's like racism is an easy way to do it visually because it just it carries a lot of with it. But before you even get to racism you get to fortune you get to who's happy who's losing successful who is where they are if God controls all that those who are pleased those who sit in the positions of respect and and prosperity why why would God let them be there. If you didn't want them there.

That's if they were believers of ours and it's like you can argue about how that's not really what was in Calvinism and it wasn't but like you know their Buddhism like how many forms of Buddhism have like gods and like demigods. I mean it's. It's all syncretic own religion is syncretic so so like whatever pure strain theory that nerd Calvin was talking about with predestination and stuff whatever the hell. That is the the the American settler was not operating on anything that refined they were operating on you shall know him by his his his. Basically so that means if you've got kovat and I didn't that was I mean somebody made that happen if you're black and I'm white somebody choose to put the Mark of Cain on you or the mark of ham on you so period. If you live in to Guatemala and I live in the United States and you're. The one that gets the death squads that my country pays for I did not get a haircut. I might I might shave my head.

[28:03](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=28m03s)

I don't know might do it why not people want to know if ALC sucks now once again. I feel like these are the terms that we should not think yeah if somebody does something you don't like like ALC did a periscope with hip warned today and it's like oh god. The idea is like if you don't like that and that is it's like there's an amount you cannot like that that will like guarantee. Okay. I have now brought this person as bad this person's in the bad bin and that doesn't really help you in any way because they're still around and you still have to deal with them. The question is always is aoc useful and that and that is an independent question of whether she's good or not. She might be a celebrity liberal. I think she probably is but I can't know we're all divining chicken bottles. We're all looking at entrails and trying to figure out if we know these people we never can. We can't even know ourselves how the are we. Gonna know all these other people ah this person's actually a celebrity sir craving liberal. This person is actually a real true believer you will never know you will never know you know them by their actions. Their clamor their collection of actions and that shouldn't make you have an idea of what they're what's inside of them. It should give you an idea of what to expect from them and those are different things because what to expect from them imposes the idea that it's going to be contextualized that every given moment is. Going to have a context that will determine what the right thing to do is that is different than saying bad what that means that no matter what's happening there's no situation where this person should ever be engaged with and that I think is I mean I'm not talking about it morally being wrong. I think that it's just a long way to think about things. I think it's a way it's too brittle. It's tool two-dimensional. I would say that I don't trust AOC because of her past actions. I will continue to not trust her but I will acknowledge your reality of existence and deal with it and what that means doesn't mean a thinking. She's a girl boss or saying that she's never done anything wrong or that she's always gonna do everything wrong right nothing. It doesn't imply anything other than then that I'm going to have a certain like expectation.

I'm gonna consult when I'm like processing a given specific situation. This Felix Enya Felix is in the stream oh my god. I didn't see that Felix was in here yeah she's crying what what up though hey buddy somebody not bad what's going on just rapping why let me let me put in let me get my earbuds. So I can have better audio for this. I'm just I'm done with all my tasks for today. I did them all. How did you talk to that put these I own like three things and I well that was the problem with the jewel and that's like one of the reasons I don't use it anymore. Yeah got them like dude I went to. I went to Duane Reade cuz I needed new headphones and there there was this woman in front of me in line who is like basically screaming at the cashier for not having a mask and he was like tried to be nice and he was like yeah. I told them we need masks and they don't like have clean ones for me and she was like she was like you. What I could do you understand either that thing that people do is service. Employees were they're like oh you understand.

I don't think you understand and I was like in a bad mood because I was resetting my sleep cycle like it was the only reason I was in a are you like Hector in this poor guy and she was like she's like scream. My friends have Kovac and I just lied and I was like yeah. Mike you I just you she deserved for me to live to her yeah yeah yeah. No they just like okay I found them. I found them they were accent a coffee table a good place to put them no yep. I mean this is like no I'm not like anti locked out or anything. But it is like I think like people are. Gonna read that it is alarming how quickly people could just use this like turn on other people or like just rat like lock into their pre-existing thing of screaming in service workers and normal people or whatever they're able to produce and get enough great thing going that they're going to just like are the next like people we hate are gonna be people with Tova's yes. We're gonna get rid of the quarantine on everybody out and people with it are gonna get like you know gun to your head can't leave your house. You it's like yeah.

It's I mean for a while there I mean like stupidly optimist about some things and for like the first week or two weeks I was like yeah. I mean like more people that I haven't talked to in a while or contact. You mean like people seem to be talking to their families more and that's nice and like maybe this will make like a lot of people. Less awful. Insane and people are still doing that but I didn't realize how quickly we just become another awful thing. Another thing that you slide preexisting awful behaviors into yeah changing situations don't really change people. You just apply your pre-existing shittiness to the situation yeah yeah. Yeah. We always we assign like mystical qualities to both time and situation as if there were no there no like overriding characteristics. Prior to that. We think that time is time and both trauma are forces that work for us. For however we want them yeah that's what that that's like so like if I've identified like one message of the Biden campaign. It's like a minute when America comes together can accomplish anything and it's like I couldn't realize. I didn't realize like quite why like that hit me on such like a woman who she just signed up to work at a grocery store. She was young and she wanted to just like help people. Drink ovid and her she just died and her last paycheck was for like nine dollars. Insulting and I realize why it like it hereit ated me so much it was because it's like well. People are coming together and like a lot of people a lot of people who are like in very precarious economic spots or whatever like they're they're like yeah.

No I won't go out. I won't do any of this I will like risk homelessness. I will or in the most extreme example like this one like I will literally risk death and I will die to help people during this and it's like now people are doing that they just don't get. Late working class people like ego you have to come together like they are. But he's literally just literally just. It's I figured out what he he means. He means that like his suburban voters can be friends with their troubling uncle together yeah yeah. Everybody shakes hands over there over there. Barbecue with each other yeah. Yeah gets the stock fighting about Trump after all yeah. It's such a unbelievable cynical but but it's like I think that's like if anything can only turn suburban people out. It's that that's what they actually care about ya know that's the thing it's like people talk about things getting worse making people more possible of organizing. It's like no people things are miserable but but the flip side is is. Yes. Things are getting worse but people are like by definition having to come closer together. Just survive because of how much worse thing forgetting and if there's anything good happens.

It's gonna be because of that yeah yeah. Absolutely I like yeah. I don't know what changed it. You know I have no idea yeah well. We're hoping discover the value of you know non market transactions. I got you know less money and less ability to do anything and like he is.

[38:09](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=38m09s)

Gonna depend more on people helping you in ways that aren't putting your hand in each other's pockets. You're. Gonna actually have to like cooperate yeah and I do want to sit like I don't want to just be pessimistic. I've seen a lot of those seem like I don't know. I've seen a lot of people like go out of their way including the people I've never known to really do that. But is I don't know it. Just it sucks that like the main political message of this year will be like let's stop fighting over Trump. Let's come on Jack. It's all it sucks and now even like even though even the phony meets you. Feminists have now realized they can't ignore the preponderance of evidence and so now they're like yeah. I guess is a rapist but yeah what what can I do oh. Wow that's just you've. Like you've admitted that your time. It sucks it sucks and now even like even though even the phony Michu feminists have now realized they can't ignore the preponderance of evidence and so now they're like yeah. I guess is a rapist but damn what what can I do oh wow that's just you've like you've admitted that your entire like the thing you claim to be fighting for this whole time means nothing and now you're supposed to get people to actually engage with this process well.

That is I think that's like a silver lining of the Biden presidency and like if I was gonna try to sell it to someone. That's it like that is gonna be the end of that type of media because like like no one reads it and like by didn't like you. The body people don't have any use for that like you're gonna tell like Biden's not. Gonna talk about bodies and spaces no yeah and it's like also the retreat of liberals from like any type of like cultural or political struggle because that that's just gonna like give people at least like 10 million people the permission to stop giving a about any of this. No totally no I honestly could foresee. I mean I mean first you have the reality of the virus but beyond that I could see just a jaw-dropping participation like we could bro we could go under 50% easily turn out easily and then like look when I see like Teen Vogue post. About okay I I mean that's the logical endpoint of all this that everything gets subsumed to go opted when I see Teen Vogue be like y'all we're doing. It's like yeah. That's they're gonna go back to what they were like three like two years from now. If Biden wins because it's like you can't keep this up. There won't be a market for that anymore. People will go back to just posting about a funny oh honey. It'd be so funny just and like what what's what's hunter. Gonna do oh god what if hunter smokes crack in us that would be amazing. I would love that I would absolutely love that I mean like yeah he yes yes. He's going to man that's gonna be hilarious. That's also gonna be. We're just never seeing. The president will come here.

Yeah. I mean when that is so when I when I thought I was gonna lose and I got really into the idea of him and I got that idea for like goodbye. A novel I did think of him as this like awful person but tragic figure but and now like then. It's like he became clear to be the nominee. It was like how did that doesn't work anymore. But I actually think it does now because like if he becomes president he will preside over the fall of the American Empire. More than Trump did absolutely and it would make sense and like yeah like your version of him makes most sense and it's like the the gravedigger of empire yeah. It's like they finally give him the job for seniority like sorry. Show's over. This guy portrayed betrayed any good thing Indians get this and he finally got it at a point when his brain didn't work anymore and like that's that's perfect like Twilight Zone ironic ending. It's perfect. It's absolutely perfect exactly how so it's exactly how these things go yeah. Movies are gonna be good again though I think probably not kasa because I feel like there's both like the Trump obviously has massive economic crisis.

But if people blame it on China it won't matter you know yeah yeah like always been true that the economy's bad the president loser and that is the fact but no president ever had something that they could totally fix externalize the blame onto like the Great Depression the crashing away there was no wait explanation of it that ex kept you out of it as like the party now yeah and it's it's like. It's one of those rules that I don't think you have to follow super close because it's like well nate. Silver loves these he's like a candidate South Carolina by X margin. He's never lost the presidency but a little bit and it's like those you. Your sample size. For that is like just the 20th century really and so like yeah what yeah what you just said about how like every previous example there are no externalities they could blame it on and also like hmm. It's no. It's not really comparable in scale. But there was there was like a bit of downturn in 1970 or 1980 7 in 1988 and George HW Bush still won yeah but yeah I mean I'd you so I think it's awesome to I I could see the ways in which Biden loses very clearly.

It's a little bit harder to see how he would win but just my non-scientific evaluation of it where it's like. It's the most funny and like sort of tragic and shitty outcome in some ways outcome and that has generally been the truest outcomes so far yeah. I think it's a good. It's a better rubric than anything else because the sample size is about. It's the same yeah yeah oh I was just thinking so I the Biden's small that you might as well. Just say the funniest thing should happen which would be but winning funniest thing happened with like Briggs. It and Trump those from both like oh what if they actually like one was you're supposed to be a referendum and David Cameron yeah. Fine whatever and that country is awesome because they are just like going down the tubes and they're they just love it. They love it they're so happy to finally die with us. Thank. God let me die. It is like the board like love Boris about it sucked like their country sucks and it's like like he's a big sticky oh who like hates all Pete all poor people and they're like oh that adorable. Rose. It's because they have been bred to worship the most disgusting amongst them like that's what like that is in their blood yes. Yes. I think I mean we're we're kind of. I mean we got. I think that's where we're liberals right now like.

I don't think that they there's yet position to openly love Biden. But I think in like a generation or even like 10 years. Like they're they're working themselves up to it. The worship of the Obama family is like has always been very hurts them to me for those reasons but Johnson Donald Trump Joe Biden running for presidents all right the way he could win is if the suburbs have really turned on trumps. Away. Yes so far have appeared to because between the primary and 2018 the suburbs did a real hard swing and if that if that's sustained then it doesn't matter that the that I do believe that you will see a drop in voter turnout but it will be made up for for the Democrats by a big swing in them. In this suburbs butts up oh. I can't hear you. I can't hear him okay sorry. No I was saying I could definitely. I could definitely see that like that's that's a great example how could how it could happen and like all their messaging and all their models seem to be geared towards that yeah.

[48:59](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=48m59s)

Because like they at the end of the day make you dislike that Trump is rude they do not like the stuff including fans like like yes they find it embarrassing. They watch liberal media. They are. They are they are in the zoo of custom so much that they do find him embarrassing as president and then that makes them not trust him and that makes them think that he's doing a bad job. It makes them more likely to believe that he's dumb and then he did something you. I its it is like the board like he loved. Boris is that it's no yeah yeah and like people the the praise of Biden from concert' like you know like Jennifer Rubin conservatives. I mean I don't even know what the Boris Johnson Joe Biden Donald Trump drove I'm running for president all right the way he could win is if the suburbs have really turned on trumps away. Yes so far have appeared to because between the primary and 2018 the suburbs did a real hard swing and if that if that's sustained then it doesn't matter that the that I do believe that you will see a drop in voter turnout. But it will be made up for for the Democrats by a big swing in them in this suburbs butts up oh. I can't hear you. I can't hear okay oh sorry. No I was saying I could definitely. I could definitely see that like that's that's a great example how could how it could happen and like all their messaging and all their models seem to be geared towards that yeah because like they at the end of the day they do dislike that Trump is rude.

They do not like including fans like like yes. They find it embarrassing. They watch liberal media. They are. They are they are in the stew of custom so much that they do find him embarrassing as president and then that makes them not trust him and that makes them think that he's doing a bad job. It makes it more likely to believe that he's dumb and then he did something out of incompetence and so they are like this guy and and like Biden is obviously senile but he is not. He's still he's still a politician in a way they recognize his politicians and now they realized after four years that they actually do care about that no yes. Oh like deeper than I thought I actually care about this no yeah yeah and like people the the praise of Biden from concert' like you know a Jennifer Rubin conservatives. I mean I don't even know what the - I mean she is a good servant but you know what you would just call that believe he's sold monarchist but yeah. It is like there's this mass whenever Joe Biden does something that's like it's basically a form where he like wishes condolences or something. They're like what if we had a president like this and it's like oh. That's what all this is about yeah. Literally what this is about I mean talk about like you know yeah when I hate to relate the related Vista games but Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain yes. It's about a group of people who experience a incredibly convoluted plot. They believe was engineered to betray them and they go so insane with a desire for revenge that they mere the actions of their opposing group. But they just do to like cultural shift us and you know arbitrary reasons that people use they're like no. It's good when we do it like in Chobani.

It's amazing how much he Mears Donald Trump way more than family self dealing in crookedness. Sex crimes now just pompous like not that smart trips over his own words senile and like huge history of racing in the 70s and it's like no yeah literally yeah. No no none of this mattered none of the stuff that they try to hit Trump and the left with let's be honest in 2017 with they never believed in. They just cared about the the few signifiers where they can tell themselves are not doing Trump. But it is like all things is Joe Biden. Even the victory is a tragedy yeah. The end of things coming is because like this does feel like it could be the last president whoever it is is that both Trump invite in one of the ways. One of the many ways they are very very similar is that they both perfectly embodied. They the the content and history coming up to now of their propel political parties. Yes from is the history of the modern Republican Party. You trace a straight line from Goldwater to Nixon - Reagan you thread it through George W Bush so you hook in for some Schwarzenegger.

You add some Sarah Palin and boom you're at Trump like like the movement like the creation of like white suburban base that is totally mediated and creates like a fight like a spectacle culture around itself that turns into you know by Fox News and Limbaugh and turns into a pure moment of you know agreement which has to be a body by a literal performer and famous person. Meanwhile Biden is the lead that he emerges in the moment that the Democratic Party starts turning away from the New Deal. In the 70s. He emerges is like the embodiment of the neoliberal term so he is the entire last 40 years of democratic party as neoliberalism has been says SAS everything of energy and vitality and slowly desiccated and turned into this flailing wheezing decrepit old man and he comes from a perfect place. Delaware a land without really any characteristics or anything distinct literally just it's a tax haven. It's American Switzerland. He comes from the perfect eye. I said this in the show we did today but it bears repeating you know those like awful breathless articles in 2016 by by a liberal media that were like Trump is the mirror of America. He's the he's vein and race and it's like so is Biden. He's a guy who sucks at everything his only made bad choices probably yeah.

Probably it's a sex creep and he just gets the job because he showed up the most the right people liked him that guy who is sort of like the mirror Trump. Just in that he is the guy who manipulated the media enough to like skip the line. But now he's been totally processed into that thing now like Obama's now as much of that established it as any of them and they're all like just carbon copies of each other. Different like skin like they've been reskin like Obama has like the Kaepernick skin that like pisses off white suburban ID and then Biden has like this fake patty Irish skin that like makes them kind of like her more yes. That's it and I always say I think it's very telling like I was thinking about how Warren liberals talked about Obama and they're like she way. He inspired me to get into politics. But I just I wish he I wish she you know he was stronger and it's like no he's stronger than anyone in that party. But it's not for his beliefs. It's for himself okay yeah. He is he is a cutthroat get that even though like Warren fought that a minute like the the good thing she did were fighting that administration they still don't get it yeah. He's refusing to death. He's he's like no if I'm president that's like grabbing Excalibur because no one forgets the president no as long as he wins and dies at office. He will have achieved immortality that could be the last thing he thinks is. His brain shuts down Obama like yeah. It really sucks how well Obama's gonna make out of it because like if the Empire collapses people's memory will be like that was the last great present he will be.

He'll be the cult figure. He'll be an icon. They'll be like cults around him and it's like our fallen martyr. It'll be very depressing even though he's the guy who's more responsible for it than anyone yeah. The guy who saw this company coming and was like let's get Larry Summers on the case like just a complete operator. A complete selfish prick yeah and no yeah he gets. I mean this is probably more than he even he even ever dreamed of that he gets to. He gets to be a historical. That's what people think 200 years from now the last great president he could have saved the Empire yeah god that sucks it really. Saw died Bernie will be like you know it'll be people. Some people think of him like a Deb's figure. Probably not you know bill but he'll never get the things he did to fight Obama that kept Obama from executing his worst acts of austerity and cynicism that won't be recorded. They'll just be like. He got a lot of energy in the party yeah oh yeah. Debs or like Upton Sinclair governor California and 1934 on basically like that a plan to abolish capitalism to fix the Great Depression yeah.

[60:36](https://youtu.be/bjIWKU7MsKs?t=60m36s)

I'm doing I'm gonna record a solo on it. This week oh that sounds good no yeah that's it's unfortunate. I mean none of it. No one. I mean this is a weird kind of think about because I don't think anyone's really gonna remember anything from this done. I feel like we're this is a period. It's probably the most well recorded 15 year stretch of history ever and yet know everything. No one will remember really anyone. For this time. They'll remember very little art. I'm almost because we haven't written anything down yes. That's a good point in history when the people are trying to figure out what happened in retrospect. There will be huge huge gaps because it will all have been destroyed. Yes yeah I do want to say someone in chat said what is this based on who can predict the future obviously. No one yeah. I'm just saying if things continue on this trend line. That's what I feel will happen. But I know I mean I we have no way of knowing and I'm a very big philip k dick guy and philip k dick. His thing about the future was. It is actually sort of futile to predict it because the things that will there's so much. There's you won't even understand what the factors are gonna be no. It's it's sort of futile to predict the future.

We do it anyway because it's fun even though like we say when we start thinking that it has any kind of real power. No actions like we should not be acting anything will happen. We have to act like in the moment we can't like assume. Trump is gonna lose or by yes you've got to operate for much earlier assumptions than that because you can't know that yeah. No I mean that I if I could make if I was a head of the Department of Education. The two things I would make every child read the golden Man which is the best short story of original and Ecclesiastes golden man being about how you you cannot understand you.
