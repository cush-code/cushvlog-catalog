Foreign comes let me tell you buddy and it won't be long till you find yourself. Singing Your Last Cowboy Song you became the campfire dims he shouts and he sings. When a cow portrays his Spurs four wings I hope you can hear me. I don't have my microphone. Today. It's just temporary but I'm seeing if I can be heard over the laptop mic I know it's not going to sound perfect. But it's all I have right now can anyone hear. Me can anybody hear. Me can you hear me talking all right. There. We go anybody hear me oh great all right gotta get through this one quick. This is gonna be a shorty today uh trying to ask people who know I got married this weekend and as a result it's been very busy. So I'm just trying to sneak this in because I want to get this done so we can do uh because I'm not gonna be able to do one for a bit here because I gotta I'm going on tour. We're going on tour. So I don't think there's gonna be one Friday.

It's going to be next week. So I wanna I wanna get this over with so it might it's probably going to be short but that's okay because the the this chapter is pretty concise and to the point so uh. This is so we talked in the last chapter about how America's competing Elites went from having sort of a basically unified uh uh goal around like a understanding of the American economy to a uh economy dominated by individual uh Elite structures that are so act that have access to so much uh. Power through their money are able to essentially uh create parallel structures to dominate the state independently. It can no longer generate a unified National effort and so they begin to stagnate and uh in the next chapter.

Uh rashman points to and we're talking about this book people who are always asking about the book. It's always asking about the book but that's fine uh first class passengers on a sinking ship by Richard lachman. Uh and this chapter is called America the American Military without rival and without victory which I think is a pretty great uh name and this chapter is about how the United States military has even though it's the largest in the world and it has more military dominance relative to its other powers. That is a rival to than any hegemon before there's been never been an Empire with our degree of a military Edge over any other country that might Ravel us or any any number of other Rivals problem is as this chapter points out the reality of a military. In conditions of you know a capital the headquarters of a capitalist world's Gemini. Uh is one that should be able to do the sort of insurgent brush fire Warfare that is basically the only alternative to great power uh nuclear Exchange in the post-nuclear era.

But the actual US military is incapable of actually addressing that reality uh and he starts by pointing out that uh the U.S which had a military State explode into being with World War II. It's like World War II is the Big Bang of the US military State. The US had a relatively small underpowered and underfunded military relative to other world powers up until World War II and it was that necessity that moment of necessity that creates this new massive military power and now the U.S military obviously is more powerful than ever uh. It is actually cheaper than it's ever been in terms of a percentage of GDP military spending has gone down ever since the height of World War II. But in that process it still created this incredibly powerful independent uh Power node within the gov the greater American state which is the U.S military as an independent influence and interest with its own Elites within it even though they are not capitalists. But they have access through their powers within the bureaucratic state to a great deal of capital which means that they have an influence on the direction.


The capital flows and lastman uh uses it as an example for this the Vietnam War where no matter how you argue when whenever you want to argue went wrong with the Vietnam War. The one thing you cannot argue is that at every point the generals by and large got uh what they wanted regardless of whether they didn't get as many troops as they wanted of course. But they got uh escalation. They've got commitment to this project but they were incapable of actually effectively engaging in the war that they would have needed to fight to win because the US military is made up of these fiefdoms separate for uh institutions which have their own bureaucratic structures. Their own system of career paths and those career paths are dependent what on access relationship of a given bureaucrat within the U.S military state to a given weapons system. It's not around specific tasks.

It's around the uh things that the U.S military builds to fight with and those things are the most profitable things that can be built because that is the interest of U.S capital. If they're going to spend pay money for a military. There's going to be a military that pays them back and the thing that pays them back is Big Ticket High profit military hardware. It is not grunts. It is not training. It is not anything else and that means the military is made up of people who were working within it towards the goal of U.S military domination but who cannot fight a war that must be fought to maintain military U.S military domination. Now uh there is kind of a thread running through this chapter of lakshman's sort of accepting the premise that if the U.S had effectively done a counter-insurgency struck uh uh war in Afghanistan or Iraq that it would have gone differently or Vietnam for that matter. It's actually beside the point if that's true or not. The fact is that the US military as it had been constructed especially after the contractization of the neoliberal era where uh the entire where all the money is going to these big Industries are big uh uh profit-centered uh Technologies but then profit still is seek. There's still the demand for more profit centers and so a big chunk of the military gets hollowed out and privatized so that there could be more profit distributed which means the actual military loses its ability ability to actually uh  cohere to do anything foreign before I go further.


Though I want to read what I think is one of the bitchiest uh uh one of the bitchiest footnotes or uh yeah footnotes I've ever read in a academic. Uh pseudo or you know popular academic text because Latchman was a sociologist um. He's talking about how one of the things that makes the the Army in charge and Wag the Dog is that you know the truth the troops are in the field. Politicians feel powerless to really go against the military brass. The only real exception to that is MacArthur and that is only because um he was going to at the point of nuclear war where capital is not that's not good for business. So they pulled they were willing to like let him go out and sort of they were willing to neutralize him but for the rest of time more war winning the war doesn't matter as long as it's not an existential threat like nuclear war would have been winning the war is beside the point making money is what matters but anyway so he's talking about how for a long time you needed to be a veteran in order to really be a serious candidate for presidency and he says here um of course.

Most senators in these me and indeed most veterans did not he's talking about how uh for a long time after World War II you basically had to be a veteran if you seriously wanted to compete for National politics and the majority of uh people in Congress and the Senate were veterans and that that over time that has changed now the almost no uh uh almost no they're they're far. Fewer. Veterans now than there used to be in uh the in Congress but he says of course. Most of those senators and indeed most veterans did not experience combat since in any military. A large majority of soldiers are support. Personnel nevertheless military experience at least gives veterans.

The Prestige to comment on and challenge or more often to uncritically support military commanders claims even if that service consisted of making propaganda films in Hollywood and later falsely claiming he helped liberate Auschwitz Ronald Reagan taking a single flight as an observer for which he was awarded the Army's Silver Star medal by General Douglas MacArthur Lyndon Johnson claiming his nickname was tail Gunner Joe and that he had been wounded in battle even though he never flew a combat Mission and was injured in an onboard party crossing the Equator Joseph McCarthy or supervising the loading and unloading of cargo planes while spending most of his time playing poker and winning enough to finance his First Congressional Campaign Richard Nixon conversely George McGovern who flew 35 missions on a as a bomber pilot during World War II and received a distinguished flying cross and the air medal for genuinely heroic actions rarely mentioned. His military record in public McGovern was the rare presidential candidate who was successful in combat in contrast to John F Kennedy.

Ship sank George H.W bush and John McCain shot down or Bob Dole ambushed ambushed he got shot at Monte Casino. Loser folks he's a loser I want I want candidates who won at War okay foreign back to uh this Army that can only buy stuff because your career depends on your familiarity with the key infrastructure component if you want to be a general if you want to make it up the letter and then of course. If you want a job with the weapons manufacturer actually after you retire which is a huge part of it. The last one actually kind of glosses over but the point is if you're a career army guy who is like I'm an I'm an honorable troop and I don't I wouldn't want to take a job with a contractor like some howdy.

Duty nerd if you're that or you're a total crook who's just waiting for a chance to go and cash in on K Street. You have the same incentives to Big up whatever piece of material you're connected to if it's nuclear missiles if it's bombers if it's uh. If it's aircraft carriers. Your job is to fight for it regardless of whether that's what the  with huge profit margin motive margins want so what this meant though is that when it's time to go to war in Iraq you have Donald Rumsfeld wanting this lean mean Army by which he means a privatized Army because of course there's no leanness or meanness in the weapon systems. Those are still getting more money than ever but fewer personnel. Fewer troops losers money because that's the other thing you could have spent all that money on actual troops who maybe if you want to fight a counterinsurgency war could really blanket a country and maybe like you know integrate into it and could facilitate uh the the um the spread of Aid Goods again you can argue that would never happen.


That's not that's not what America does right but one of the reason it doesn't do. That is because its structures forbid it from being done even if they could do the things they want and remember. The neocons thought that this was a springboard for the invasion of the entire Middle East there's no denying that nobody in Washington who was planning the Iraq War any more than Lenin. Any more than Lenin thought that these uh warrants and it is very funny that these guys are all extrotskyists. Everybody around Lenin assumed that the Russian Revolution was the preload to a World Revolution all of the ex-fucking trotskyists in the office of special plans. If you ask them are we just going to take over Iraq. They would have said Heavens no it wouldn't be worth it just like it wouldn't have been worth it to just overthrow the czar. They thought they were sweeping the  board clean and creating a taking America's like stewardship of a globalizing capitalism and turning it into an old-fashioned territorial Empire. But the army that capitalism had given them to fight with was incapable of the the goal couldn't do it and that's why it found it. Uh one of the things that lashford points to is that uh they're one of the big things that caused huge delays in getting um humanitarian.

Aid and security to Baghdad and the other cities of Iraq after the U.S invaded why there was such a languishing for so long a period during which a lot of people started getting pissed at the U.S because the Insurgency did not start overnight. It really did ramp up over time as the realities of being occupied sunk in the argument could be made that if those realities had had been hey here's a bunch of a here's a bunch of food here's a bunch of stuff. Here's a bunch of electricity and clean water. Maybe things would have been different even though you might not want a foreign Invader maybe you don't feel the need to go out and fight him. But the U.S was very late to get that stuff to Baghdad why because it took forever to clear the mines on the way to Baghdad technology existed to do fast quick efficient mind sweeping but minesweepers low margin cheap. Not anything anybody could build a Carrera around so they got crowded out of the budget by big flashy.

That just left them unable to win the hearts and Minds in a way that would have been necessary for their colonial fantasy to be realized. They had undermined it themselves by embracing the neoliberal military but of course they had to because capitalism said you're fighting you're gonna go fight but we are keeping our beaks wet because the U.S because while the U.S does a huge military as I said as a percentage of GDP the US military is spending has collapsed over the past 70 years and our tax rates have also collapsed over the same time period so these neocons are trying to save an American Empire that no longer has the political economy to sustain itself. These guys were thinking we're gonna do what old Empires could do and yeah the vital early Big Bang American Military state where you had an alliance of Elites and uh influential forces all pointed in the same direction yeah. But we don't have that anymore and the fantasy of the neocons is that fighting the war would make it. Happen would create that World War II Spirit but time moves forward. They forgot about the  dialectic that's very fitting yeah. I feel like I'm in a huey I'm in a helicopter while we talk about them about the military and so we want to spend less of our money on the military.

We also want fewer of our troops to die starting with Vietnam. You have this real phobia about about troops American troops dying and this transformation of uh of the notion of fighting into not this heroic sacrifice but into this awful trauma. Uh there's a funny bit where Latchman points out that the Medal of Honor was used to be given to people who killed the enemy and increasingly especially post-war on terror. It's begun for people who sacrifice themselves defending one of their friends. Saving lives because you have this new you know fantasy humanitarian military where the first person being saved is the troop but that's not how an army is supposed to work. Sacrifice is built into it.


Look. People are saying threat of I just wanted people keep talking about Italy. It's not good nothing's good everything's bad but Italy is not a functioning state. You have to take that into consideration before freaking out and so they get the so because it takes so long to sweep the mines the power is out. People are dying in the streets people are getting shot. Panicked people are getting shot at checkpoints. People are getting. No food people have no fuel. It's a disaster and then they go in and privatize everything and instead of doing what previous Empires and hegemons have done which is roll up to a new with to the local Elites and say hey let's hide. Let's wire you into our Global thing here. Let's put you as one level of like essentially onboard you as employees of the of the US military Empire. No dice all that had to be privatized. All those things had to be all those profits instead of going to as into salaries for these inefficient stake.

Workers. All had to line the pockets of the  contractors who had paid to get all these psychos in office in the first place. Someone says is P2 going to uh reactivate brother. Why do you think that why would you assume that they ever went anywhere just because they got found out who went to jail again and so local Elites are. Cashiered. Nobody has anything left to gain by collaborating with the foreigners and having something to gain by collaboration is how you keep local allies but no the state structure. These competing Elites trying to grab the last  bucket of chum out of the sinking ship. I mean that even though they're pushing forward this American sis this American state that has these people deludedly thinking that they're gonna secure. Its future through uh Empire are undermining it from within are eating. It like  termites because they're knocked into by the crisis of the 70s. This Extreme Survival mechanism which has expressed Itself by looting the military making it no longer able to fight that kind of war and so this chapter ends grimly. It says Okay so the US military cannot fight the wars though. It's supposed to be able that it would need to fight to win in a post-nuclear world where you're fighting over terrain so that you can secure.

Supply chains and spheres of influence and economic activity. Blah blah we're the dollar but the petrol dollar can rain you're trying to keep the Petro dollars radius enforced by like this the through the sinews of American military power well. Those that is a pacification campaign and the pacification campaign is not something that the U.S military can do now the argument can be made it cannot be done. Ontologically. No Army could do it but again for the purposes of talking about America's institutional Decay. Beside the point the gold the machine should be seeking cannot be sought by the actual mechanisms that it is made up of if that is how you get hegemonic decline because conditions keep changing and the Machine cannot adapt to them.

Now the scary thing is is if you ask okay. Those are the words we can't fight. What wars can we fight nuclear war is the only answer there big Big Ticket war with a big other power that by definition would have nukes which means war with them would inevitably devolve into a nuclear Exchange which is I think scarily also the teleology of the two major political parties. I think the Democrats and the Republicans are both fixed like existentially to an end point of war with China that would become nuclear which is I think why it's very. That's why I think it's extremely funny how many people on both sides are trying to squint at either the Democrats and Republicans and imagining them as a savior from our condition right. Like the right.


Wingers think the based Mega people right. They think Trump is the Vanguard of this of this. He speaks for this lump in American like aggrieved capitalist who has been robbed by these globalist forces that uh are going robbing robbing the capitalist system of the of the sinews it requires of the blood. It needs to pump its uh its organs and so it needs to basically overthrow them and then Ally with other uh rebellious lumps of uh middle class grievance from Russia to Hungary to hey. Italy come on pork maybe France if they get a Le Pen. This is the Bannon fantasy and what is the end point of it all. These cool based countries come together to go to war with China. He talks about it all the time you could look at uh Trump's Administration.

There's no argument to be made you cannot make any kind of uh meaningful harm mitigation argument about the Republicans. Uh actually Trump is uh uh compared to the neocons. Trump is a dove sure compare on the question of Russia but Russia is a side show. It's always going to be China and there are so many and not just obviously liberals. But there's so many putative leftists and you know what they're leftist it doesn't matter. It's just a it's just opinions. I'm not going to say somebody is lying about their opinions and they really don't like Biden and they really don't like the Democrats and they understand how bad they are. But they also think that they are our bulwark against something much worse. They think oh you know like if the like think about how in the Roman Empire fell and you know it fell overnight in England and a bunch of people died oh my God. What if that happened uh here that'd be so bad and the and with the idea being it's worth it keeping the Empire going to do that and that Vision extending from you know the coping leftists to the heights of the world.


Economic forum is this idea of globalized capital using existing structures like NATO and the UN building a coalition of uh yeah capitalist liberal democracies to go to war with Russia and China. But of course you could say aha that's worse because that's two countries. Once it's nukes are involved. It means nothing foreign are locked into this trajectory because neither one of them can address material conditions for other reasons. We've talked about in this book so that means things are going to get worse if we assume that and uh hostility to institutions becomes worse it either erupts into some sort of civil conflict or somebody in charge. On one side or the other decides let's put off the Civil conflict by having a good old-fashioned War and it could start off as an attempt to just you know tickle the ivories and get some natural Spirit going. It'll eventually go in even though you could say that's Madness their economies are essentially interconnected. It's like a uh going to war with yourself the European uh.

Imperial economies of the world 1914 were absolutely interconnected in a similar fashion so that's Graham but again you still have to live so who cares uh again. It's it's mostly just useful to remind yourself of how little you can control and it does remind more never really want to do a China book next somebody gave me a recommendation and my DMs I forgot what it is. But I look it up. It's like the China like the rise of China or something it can't be that that's too uh. That's too generic. I don't know but I'm gonna find one sort of Chinese Chinese book to talk about exactly where China fits in here because there if if capitalism is this like uh like space slug that moves from host to host you know starts out kind of bubbling into existence in the northern Italian city-states before being smashed out by the Italian Wars moving up into the Rhine Valley and then started settling in the estuaries of uh of the low countries and and uh Southern England uh how China shook the world shocked the world. I think is a good one I've heard I've heard is a good one um they get in there. It's by moving from polity to polity because it has to be in a nation state and uh so you go or it has to be. It's like some sort of uh.

You know some sort of medium-sized uh State structure that's in competition with other ones that's why these things are encouraged instead of destroyed because the unified uh ruling class Stomps out those sort of destabilizing of elements and did so in the rest of the world where Empire ruled but in Europe it didn't happen so it moves from host to host and it gets to the U.S because it because Europe was destroyed and destabilized critically by it. It only stands to reason that China should come up next but nukes they were never nukes before there was and nobody else goes out quietly. They all go out down fighting but going down fighting meant one thing in the pre-nuclear age. All of which to say is the future is uncertain. All we got to do is uh live through it and the thing is we will even if we don't. I know that sounds stupid and like Yoda said it but like I said I gotta get out of here pretty quickly.

Sorry I've been distracted. I get married. It's my birthday month. You can't be mad at me for sounding like a wishy-washy. I'm all romantic okay that's pretty much all I want to say on this no so next week next week. We're going to be out of town because we're going to Chicago so that show baby very happy about that. Ticket's still available though for La New York and Fort Lauderdale so please buy them uh the next week chat the I believe the last chapter before the conclusion that the uh the American economy. Financial cannibalization that that sounds about right yeah. That's the last chapter about you know hegemony and then there's the last one. After that there's two chapters left and then is there a conclusion or just two chapters yeah. There's just two chapters left so yeah sometime after we get back from since Chicago. We'll do that all right folks yes. It is the conclusion of the American economy.


That's why that's why you got to find someone to love folks. That's the only thing that can help you through whatever is going to come and whatever you're going through. Now. I know that sucks because it's a rare and uh and fragile thing. But I guess you just got to keep hope. Hope is the residue of the love that you haven't yet found all right. Bye folks peace.
