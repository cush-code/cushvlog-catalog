 show me the way to go home. I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I had a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right to my head and wherever I may roam by land or sea or phone. You can always hear me singing a song show me the way to go show me the way to go home. I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I have a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right to my head. You can always hear me singing a song show me the way to go home pump show me the way you do. I'm tired and or see your phone you will always hear me singing a song show me the way to go or phone. You'll always hear me singing. The song show me the way to. I go do it on my phone. It's taking too long on the computer. Very irritating can't spell the name of the damn website hey there oh boy. What is going on here do not auto correct that please leave it as one word thank you criminy. I walk along the city streets. We used to walk along with me don't know and every step.

I take reminds us how in love we used to be how can. I forget you when there's always something out to remind me always something here to remind me. I was born to love you but I won't and I will ever be free always be a part of me whoa. I passed a small cafe where you and I went. I would dance at night boom. Boom. Every time reminded me all. It was to kiss and hold you tight how could I forget you and there was always something that do remind me thank you yes. I'm doing the dion warwick version there.

Not the not the one from the 80s. It's amazing how many new wave songs were like 60s pop covers. It really does make you when you look back at a lot of the stuff like punk as a recapitulation of early rock and roll and then like the creation of like solon r b being recreated through new wave. You kind of see how very quickly the creative cycle breaks down and you have to start over again and now we're on like the we're at the terminal end of that. I guess tainted love is another example of that and yeah. There were some motown bands that were still performing like the The pointer sisters jump for my love. That song was huge that's an 80s song. But it's also a motown song. I gotta say if you want to compare never mind anyway. I don't really know anything about music so I shouldn't talk. I'm not going out enough on a limb on this that I should not be going beyond my embarrassed competency. I just know that I like the dion warwick version better which is It's not the only version because it was originally a bert bacharach song that was recorded by a number of pop singers.

So next week. We're going to talk about the rest the second half of black jackman. I guess the second two thirds but it reads very fast and I think it's better talked about It doesn't really require the granular focus and if you really do want to talk granular for the haitian revolution in general and luvature as a person. I highly recommend the recent three-part haitian revolution addendum to the age of napoleon podcast. That is highly recommended one of my favorite history podcasts and if you want to like get into the muck on like the what happened when that's a good way to do it but like talking specifically about what james is talking about. It's a little more abstract and I'm finding that like what I'm getting out of this is are very abstract tangents. So we don't really need to break it up into specific sections because it makes more sense to talk about them as they develop throughout the whole narrative. But anyway the last time. I tried to talk about this book. I got completely off. Track did a whole hour and a half that was not even directly that wasn't even gesturing towards the book. So I don't want to let that happen next time.

So I i was reading through and I hit a paragraph that I thought was so perfect in its description of the french revolution from which the haitian revolution emerges and which it is part of which is why it's part of the narrative of the ancient napoleon podcast It sums it up in a the the the fall of the end of the revolution. The thermadorian reaction that ends the forward progress of towards social equality that the um that the revolution was pushing towards and I felt like this paragraph would cut if people just absorb this paragraph. It would cut through a lot of the morass of of weird like emotional reactions and and investments. People have in the figures of the french revolution because you know these are. These are the titans who broke free of their chains you know so we we have this there's this charisma around them But we have they have to be understood not as protagonists. But as emo. Historical actors you know what I mean they need first and foremost to be viewed is in their historical role not through the role of what values they personally embody because then you end up having to defend things and can conceptualize things historically around those assumptions.

So anyway I wanted to just have a little bracket here to talk about robespierre and the french revolution coming off this paragraph that's on page 177 of my paperback copy of the black jacobins in the chapter. The white slave owners again which is one of my favorite chapter titles because it's after the the fall of the the slave-owning aristocracy the the declaration by even the the republic in france itself of abolition. Saw the dispossession of from power of the sort of royalists and independence scheming slave owners and by by this time they've been owned but then there's an attempted resurgence to regain power and he titles the chapter. Oh the white slave owners again god damn it. I thought we got rid of these guys so in describing what's happening in france while the while toussaint is rising to power in haiti. James writes robespierre and the mountain that's the j. The left-wing jacobin faction that ended up overthrowing the girondists robespierre in the mountain had maintained power until july 1794.

The terror had saved france but long before july robespierre had gone far enough and was now lagging behind the revolutionary masses in the streets of paris. Jacques. Varela and rue were preaching communism not in production but in distribution. A natural reaction to the profiteering of the new bourgeois robespierre however revolutionary as he was remained rub and had reached the extreme limit of the bourgeois revolution. He persecuted the workers far more workers working men than aristocrats perished in this phase of the terror. In june 1974 the revolutionary armies won a great victory in belgium and at once the continuation of the terror was seen by the public as factional ferocity and not a revolutionary necessity right wing and left in the convention combined to strike at this sinister dictator and when he sent out to the call to the people he could not get the old response. Some of the sections came but there was a delay rain fell and they went back home again. The revolutionary order which had inspired them since august 17 92 was gone killed by robespierre himself.

He seems to have been in constant fear of a split between the extreme revolutionists of frank paris and the rest of the country but destroyed his own left wing and thereby sealed his own doom and here we have a perfect encapsulation of the how the french revolution ended. It was because the the interests of the workers of paris and the bourgeois who were challenging royal prerogative in the feudal order were in alignment for a while at the start of the revolution but as the revolution took its own momentum as the window of possibility opened. The workers started demanding more pressing needs an assertion of greater democratic control of the economy so that they could feed themselves but the bourgeois revolution which only seeks to use working-class power to the degree that they have to to gain. Power essentially puts the brakes on it and that is because at this point. Historically it is not the workers of paris. It is not the sound cool out of paris who are the true revolutionary class. It is the bourgeois class because they are the ones who not only are radicalized against the status quo but have the organizational capacity and the access to power to actually push for their agenda and they used the working class of paris to that end.

But then a point came especially after the gerandus decided to try to offload this tension in a war with austria that passions grew greater. The sense of of lost liberty felt more tangible and the workers pushed for more radical demands which in the first place could be in a bourgeois. Framework only accommodated with blood because remember the bourgeois is not trying to create social equality. Here they are not trying to do a communism. They are trying to do a capitalism in their mind. Capitalism and freedom are the same thing. This is the founding birth of this is the explosion of modern capitalist the modern catalyst capitalist dominion right here. It's bursting forth from the french aristo from the french bourgeoisie and so their domination of the of the national assembly. Their domination of all of the political clubs in the city of paris and in the surrounding cities of france meant that popular popular agitation by the working class who have a different interest than the bourgeoisie. Which is hey how about we eat how about we we aren't sacrificed to the market and the bourgeois state would now in the hand or the the state mechanism now fully in the hands of the bourgeois remember there's no real working-class participation in government. In this new structure. It is lawyers basically through and through lawyers and and progressive landowners that's it so those are the ones making the decisions and are wielding these forces.

Because of the insufficient organization of the working class. It wasn't even a working class. It was a bunch of artisans who were out of work basically like it was not a working class in paris. It has to be remembered. It was a post-feudal remnant of the the craft system you had artisans. The sankhulat were artisans in paris who just didn't have enough work and we're hungry. So you don't have a working class.

You have a movement towards one. But it's not coherent. There is a coherent bourgeois class and look at that they're in charge of the power and the first group to take power are the gerondists who squeeze out the fulantis. The royalist bourgeois when it becomes untenable to support the system anymore because if you cannot change the conditions at the base which the bourgeois cannot do the redistribution of power and resources what they have to do instead is change the political structure in such a way to validate that to the people who they are aligned with keep the mob at bay with spectacles of of political in the political ritual performance of the power of the people. Let's say that like we cannot give you pure you people you cannot have real power. What we can give you is the performance of power publicly through our guiding hand. You will fill the bellows but we will be the machine because we can do that for you and that means hey you guys hate the king he's gone and so that means that the royalist the pro-royalist constitutional democrats get to get our liberals get bounced by by bernoff. Then you've got a brasso and his boys in the geron.

They're willing to go to kill. The king cut the king's head off damn right hell. You know what they'll even go to war with austria to have a good cleansing patriotic nationalist. Ritual that will make their power conceived of not as a class but as a nation-state or as members of some nation state in a in a patriotic war that they will then go and fight it and not be in the capital for that's great. But the very the fact that the war didn't go well in the first stages meant that panic exploded and fear of retribution and reassertion of royal power became greater which means that the bourgeois structure had to do more performances of worker power of of of sankulat political desire only in the form of ritual sacrifice they couldn't give them land. This. Marx said this too they couldn't give them land so they gave him heads and robespierre rose to power in that moment because he believed that this was not just some cynical appeasement of the people. He believed that this was going to create communism. Robespierre thought that he was going to turn the bourgeois state into a russoian perfected state not by changing economic relationships because he is a liberal.

The first liberal in many ways one of the first real liberals because he couldn't do it through redistribution. He would do it through the use of the state to assert a public virtue a internal motivator. This is what I'm talking about the thing you're supposed to have at the end of the process of class formation where the working class takes. The rule takes over. The machinery of capitalism puts it to social use and creates a social being right. The new man of the soviet vision like it literally is a different type of person with different relationships that are defined by their different economic conditions.

The conditions of production that they live within robespierre thought he could get that within capitalism even though capitalism is based on this exploitation at the center and this coercion at the center that rips apart consent who wants to consent to this system. The consent has to be reaffirmed and reforged culturally in the form of politics in the form of laws and and punishments. Most of all punishments and it will be by assertion of a public will to punish that you will instill in people virtue they will be scared. They will be scared of the state from sinning the same way that the medieval peasant was scared to sin because he was afraid of god sending him to hell if we now are going to have earthly institutions now that they've been brought to earth by the emergence of capitalism and the engagement and the alienating effect of the market. If that's the case are we going to let the market destroy. Us are we going to let the market dissolve our humanity and the radical bourgeois are those who because of their personal collection of of of abilities values encounters with the world. I refuse to accept that and want to defeat it and those become your liberals.

They think public application of fear will reproduce god will will will like the way. Bentham reconfigured the penitentiary to be away from imagining the penitent in god's eyes but to have them imagine themselves under the eye of a fellow person in the form of the panopticon within the The center prison spoke and so then if that happens if everyone within a system is in the system of capitalism is self-regulating. If their decisions are self-regulating towards the good in an abstract sense and not themselves then capitalism can work. No boss will exploit a worker. Nobody will will maximize profit over human values. They will be prevented from doing that by their own virtues. This is the difference between ray kroc and the mcdonald brothers and the founder ray kraft. The mcdonald brothers had enough because they were satisfied with their social endeavor. Ray.

Kroc was a bonaparte or I'm sorry jacobins and and robespierre saw coming and wanted to stop and they thought that public virtue would do it. That is why while there was mass confiscation of church lands and persecution of the church and a lot of the the future redditers. I would guess of liberalism who wanted to tear up the church rooting branch from society. Robespierre being a more humanist in a many in a meaningful sense liberal than them said no no you can't just replace god with absolutely nothing you have to consecrate their relationship to the state which is replacing god and that's why he created the cult of the supreme being which led to one of His real downfall in many ways came from his his conducting of this attempt to enshrine the this new revolutionary liberalism where the state is still under operating under the machinery of capitalism which is stripping all human bonds stripping away towards selfishness. But but and therefore people's lives are worse.

They're pissed off this guy. Robespierre says we're gonna all worship this. This concept of reason that is the collective understanding of our of our people and that that will guide us the way that god used to guide us and he had a big festival in paris and it was a cringe fest. He had this big float. He was incredibly happy and everyone around him was muttering and he got heckled at the thing and shortly after that he had a one of his many nervous breakdowns and he was off the public stage for a few weeks and then he came back talking about how he was going to finally clean house and everybody who was terrified that their corruption was going to be exposed got together to. Nerfed him and there was nobody there to defend him because this is the important thing about robespierre in his pursuit of public virtue imposed from above on the principles of the bourgeois capitalist state that meant yes cutting off the head of a bunch of royalists and the old chirondists and anybody who looked to scans at the revolution but it also meant cutting off the head of a bear cutting off the head of danton.

Cutting off the head of anyone connected to the actual streets and the actual demands of the workers from the machinery of state anybody who was even if they were crooked and danton was a crook had a public. He was. He was seen as a legitimate broker for the desires of the people so was a bear and they were also chopped up. They were also fed to the machine and doing that broke the the conveyor belt between the bourgeois state and the sankhulat. They were no longer able to within They could no longer marshal the people because the people no longer had faith in the mechanisms that they had used to pursue power and so they lost heart oh. We're no longer actually in charge of this thing because when we say things they're not heard because the people who used to hear them and take them to power and press our case are now dead. It's very similar to what happened in in the united states after the 1970s. In the less fraught. Environment of you know just the post-war cold war state liberal state.

Eventually there becomes a point where it the crisis is too great the material. Disruption of capitalism is too deeply felt in the culture that you can no longer afford to let the workers the the unorganized the proletarians in the room. The plebeians in the room you can't let them in. You got to keep it among the bourgeois to prevent them from turning them against each other and because the bourgeois class is a progressive class. At that point they were the progressive class of the moment. They were able to defeat the workers. The fact that the workers lost proves they weren't ready to win because the progressive party was the bourgeois party and what that meant is that the thermador is the system stabilizing itself away from the maximalist fantasies of robespierre which were going to keep going until they hit a reaction because he was trying to totalize something. He was trying truly as william f buckley used to say to immunitize the eschaton he was trying to transcend the the arc of history and because he's a liberal idealist he was going to do that until the system stopped him and the thing is it did. He found the limit everybody who was really truly connected to the working class anybody who had any real convictions about the revolution that transcended personal interest.

They were all dead by the fall of robespierre. Everybody who cooed robespierre on the left or the right shared one thing in common. They were essentially more interested in saving their asses than in maintaining their commitment to the revolution. Ironically. Robespierre's pursuit of virtue squeeze squeezed virtue out of the system anyone with the virtue of their convictions got their heads cut off the only people left were the non-virtuous and that is what capitalism will do over time and that's why this undermines its own social foundations. That's why it sells the root the rope for its own hanging and so what happens with robespierre is he essentially gets beyond to the point of his historical relevance and then he's He's he's removed because he is not he is not structured by the the demands of the bourgeois state which are towards stability not civil war with the bourgeois over who is most virtuous while virtue is squeezed out of the system by the machinery of capitalism giving lie to every revolutionary belief the the revolutionary faith in the in the in the in the state that the masses used to have is every day being drained as it fails to make things better to their lives and of course.

Those people who's like. I said the si when I say that they value their lives more than their principles that doesn't mean they were bad people. Most of us value our lives more than our principles. The point of having a society is to encourage people's best selves to encourage their of themselves to when given a choice between the right and the wrong thing which they can feel in their heart. They choose right and that means that they give people the social context where it doesn't cost to be good where there's actually a social benefit of being good because otherwise you only you create a system that is incentivizing sadists and martyrs. Masochists and sadists are the only people who can thrive in that situation. I meant that when the the third reaction that that took over after roamspear yes these were these people had less literally less virtue than robespierre who was filled with virtue. He thought he could impose his virtue on others but you can't that's the reality of life. No we're all built different. We all have different capacities for different things based on our individual experiences and that's why we need intervening structures to guide our day-to-day activity and to reproduce socially beneficial actions and minimize socially negative ones and that is a functioning state that distributes without or minute with while minimizing and moving towards an elimination of alienation instead of maximizing it and increasing it by the moment which is what capitalism does and in those early stages.

It's incredibly painful. That's why you have revolutions and ferment and throughout all of europe in the 17th and 1800s is because this is the moment when these societies being ripped in half and there's this big explosion but in the explosion the bourgeois party is always the progressive force because it's the most self-aware. It's the most self-conscious and they are able to use that self-consciousness to assert power. Now 1917 rolls. Around everybody involved in the russian revolution was keenly aware of everything that happened in 177 1794. They viewed they they in many ways viewed the french revolution as the first as the model for the russian one in that you were facing a similar situation where the crisis of an order had occurred and classes were now in revolt against the status quo but in and and at the very beginning of this process. Both the bourgeois and the working class have the same interests for a while but then they start to get in conflict. But in this in the what happened that time and what guys like lenin and trotsky assumed would have to happen historically is that because in the russian context the working class party. The working class was more organized and was more progressive than the bourgeois class that they would win and they did because in the specific context of russia the working class even though it was a small fraction of the population. Was more progressive than the bourgeois because not because but but and I think that there was an assumption that because this was true in russia it was true throughout capitalism. But I think that if you understand if you understand the the input the inputting of capitalism into the system as a as something that occurs in stages and across geography and time which means that development happens in different places at different rates. Even though the general trend is moving in one direction and you have capitalism moving throughout throughout the systems of different states as they all compete with one another but at different rates because of different conditions and what that meant is that the the working class which had just emerged in the late 1800s brought so many people in russia so close together so quickly and hooked them into a social network of political parties and mass media that had been created by a bourgeois that was a fraction a sliver of the size that it was in more developed historically capitalist regions like central or like western europe where you'd had this the the bourgeois had been in the cat bird seat ruling capitalism in the in in in the in the stirrups since it began basically whereas you were the the crisis of capitalism in the emergence of capitalism in late 19th century. Russia is essentially capitalism showing up on the doorstep of a funeral regime and telling an a feudal autocrat that he had to institute capitalism if he wanted to keep his country together and that meant that that it was all instituted by fiat by the state. It didn't emerge from social relations and the existing networks of trade that formed the basis of bourgeois social order in the west uneven and combined development as they say and so in the specific case of russia. Yes the protection was true. The the working class was more organized because there were more of them. They had access to basically the same social structures as the as the bourgeois class and therefore they were able to overcome you know the fact that they generally had less access to education with numbers and effective technological communication of those numbers into power. That's the important thing all the french revolutionary soundcloth had was the jacobin club or or the kaye or the 

 what the it called the club to cordelie that said so like you saw what. I said what happened in 1905 was was the closest thing they had to a bourgeois revolution but it didn't take because the working class the bourgeois while obviously running at a higher temperature than the um. The working class at that time had so few numbers that their ability to assert control was dissipated in very very quickly and was autocracy was able to reassert power because it wasn't a powerful enough current in that in that structure in that specific context of capitalist development and so a lot of the things that people predicted were going to happen in western europe in in the in the gap between the first social revolution of bourgeois power and then the second or the first revolution of the bourgeois revolution and then the social revolution that comes later in that interval. The bourgeois complete the process the bloody and horrible process of asserting this new detoratorialized humanity. Capitalism is basically supposed to uproot the human race grab it out and uproot it and then that uprooted human race through the fact that now it. Is able to interact cybernetically in a way. It wasn't before because of technology and mass. Culture and mass identity are able to build working-class counter counter hegemony that then takes over the machine. But the uprooting is to be done in that interval between the bourgeois revolution and the social revolution so that the social revolutionaries can take over a state capable of redistributing labor through the system in a way that is unalienating and prominent or less alienating and promises to decrease alienation over time. I think if you want to explain why why the cuban revolution has been so resilient. A big one is that in its immediate aftermath things got dramatically better for poor people dramatically better of course. It's it's stagnated and it hit a that progress was stopped strangled by the united states as much as it could be.

But you know there's still social progress. It's just but the initial sense of momentum coupled with social institutions that don't alienate people because they seem to be to their benefit like democratic um democratic norms hot not multi-party. Like we have but you know like the direct democracy of this. The direct like community involvement and the thing is you say oh. They're not really voting for anything but the thing is if it feels like the state is working for them. Then they feel like they had something to say they feel like they participated so they are less alienated from their democracy than we are because we know that what we want doesn't matter and yet we're still supposed to invest ourselves completely in this political contest. Far less democracy here because we believe in it less and that's because nothing has made anybody's life better in any way since the end of the free real estate bonanza of the post-war empire since they started to have to redistribute the flows and of course.

These bolsheviks were all very well aware that if they took power from the bourgeois in 1917 because they were unable to hold it which they were they were unable to hold power that it would be a monstrous counter revolution and probably some sort of genocide because if the black hundreds had gone hog wild in the pale of settlement after 1905 what would they have done after After that so that's why the bolsheviks felt they had to seize power and they had been in unseen uneasy alliance through the provisional government with the bourgeois class and then they betrayed the bourgeois the same way that bourgeois had betrayed the french proletariat in or proto-proletariat in 1794 and the way that they betrayed them in 1848. But the the tables turned because historical forces had changed but the tragedy was is that what the bolsheviks had put in ins put in to fill in the problem here because they haven't done. That means that they would have to do the uprooting and therefore delegitimize the state into mass numbers of people. They are delegitimizing the state to the people who suffer and you say oh no but that's just because they're koulox or something. It's like if you're a regular person. Some new power takes place. They say we're on your side and then things get worse for you. You don't believe in it anymore and it's like they had to do it to keep the state right but they undermined its legitimacy. What was supposed to fill that gap of legitimacy was the world revolution that's going to start in germany and allow them to uproot more slowly to ease out of the root. But you can only do that with a vastly more developed capitalist. Structure technological structure concentration of capital then post-revolutionary russia had left to themselves in the competitive state framework. They were going to have to uproot the same way the capitalists had only not in countries across the ocean to people of a different color and god to your own. People to the people the only people you're supposed to care about and that happened because not everybody was more developed and the working class never developed the in the west.

They were they were always kept too comfortable. They were kept too well fed and that's not their fault. This is the decision everybody is going to make and this is why robespierre is fundamentally wrong and why you cannot maintain virtue in a political system based on capitalism. People's definition of virtue is in not removable from their self-interest. There is not a virtue. There's not a conception of virtue that is outside when someone is imagining what the right thing is what the what they're going to do what they're gonna how they're gonna respond to the world. Around them. The good and the bad are built into and wired into self-interest personal sensual self-interest and when I say central. I don't just mean erotic bridge with your bare hand and our preference for some activities and feelings and sensations and emotions over others defines our idea of what the right and wrong in any situation is and so if we're in a social order like capitalism that prioritizes individual gain that does not allow one to have any investment emotionally in the idea. Not only that other people matter but that if I help them it would do me any. Good. I would only be punished for it. I would have to do it out of virtue. I would have to do it out of pure non- self-interested desire which is we think to be superior somehow to fleshly desire. They are in completely inseparable and the thing is is you want to say oh yeah but I'm I'm a calvinist. I'm a self-flagellating calvinist I i hate sensuality of all kinds guess what you have just erraticized your super ego you're getting pleasure out of it. The same way that a hedonist does out of their gluttony because you've rewired your pleasure center around your idea that you can represent goodness outside of yourself and therefore be be um put in the sight of god who you imagine as these abstract things un connected to flesh and earth sorry. These things are all one.

These things are all one and so even even even even the most virtue lovering liberal like robespierre look. What happened. He allowed himself to be overtaken by by cynics by by self-dealers by by the lukewarm who should be spewed out of the mouth because he couldn't read the room at the end of the day and he couldn't accept for himself that he was a presider over a bourgeois revolution which means at the end of the day. He was more committed to a prince a a a society based on exploitation than he was on trying to resist it any further he was going to have to come to terms with the limits of his interests and their coordinate and and his interest connection to a group of people that he was not connected to. He didn't live among them. He didn't live in their conditions. He didn't have their social reality. He was a country lawyer like all of them were basically and so he did not have the experience to anchor him so he fought for this unmore. Liberal virtue until reality caught up with him and he was destroyed by the cynics who then presided over a state that had been delegitimized and it could only be reconsequated in blood. But it couldn't be the the p the blood of the people. Anymore.

It would be the blood of europe in and the form of napoleon's wars that solved the social problem through colonial neocl like sort of pre-colonial like I should say like what was allowed in europe before they all decided hey. You know what we're going to do all that fighting in the in the in the colonial world. We're not we're not going to go after our own territory you can kind of see. The the congress of vienna is that is napoleon is an attempt to turn the liberal bourgeois project into a self-sustaining one through conquest but within europe and they all decided okay. No that's not gonna work. We have too much power. Basically these concentrations the british the russians the prussians the austrians they couldn't be reduced because you couldn't colonia. There's no way you can imperially dominate europe for geographic reasons and so this this stalemate occurs and so the stalemate is solved with the colonies the stale. The stalemate is solved by competing for resources in the third world to sustain the bourgeois state in the face of its mounting contradictions and so napoleon is the first one to say hey. We'll do it in-house but then was tamed by the anglo-consent. The anglo-sphere which said no no we're not doing it in-house. We're doing it colonial style and that's why if you want to point to where capitalism was doomed. It was when it was unmoored from the continent. It meant that it had because it had gone from a progressive engine of social change that was necessary to a cancer vector when the anglos beat the french because the anglos connected capitalism in europe which had been limited by the social friction that was created by its creation that was created by its its development could be soothed with the blood lubricated with the blood of other people in other places and then and then the people could just be soothed out of their angst and that's what has been happening to the western proletariat.

Ever since. I know that someone's saying oh that's smallest they're royalism you sound like jesus guy no because those people attach all of it to this wheel of of frankly liberal moralism. That says these are all. This is all a tale of who who is good and bad wrong wrong wrong wrong. This is a tale of where people end up in the dice throw of life. The point what communism does is it doesn't make people better what communism would do is. It would allow regular people who are not good or bad who would lead them to make the good choice more than the bad one because it would not just be the right thing to do abstractly it would do their lives better by doing it. It would be the logical the rational the self-interested thing to do and that is what that's what the entire marxist teleology points to because what that is is a machinery to make humanity work. As a species and not as a collection of individuated consciousness which is not it that is a lower level of development that is a lower level of consciousness. It's an alignment of incentives exactly and under capitalism. The alignment of incentives is to strip virtue out of the system and so that is why liberals within this thing cling to virtue more and more as the vice infiltrates and that is why the conservative is untroubled by these questions. Because to them gluttony vice has become the virtue because their underlying economic press is not that they deserve it because they're good people. They deserve it because they're strong people. They deserve it because they are hierarchically better. People stripped of any sort of ritualized consecrated meritocracy that is all smoke and mirrors all who do a literal social ritual for bored people sitting in offices to do to feel less bad about being in the system. They are the people who don't feel bad about it have turned vice into virtue have turned the enactment of their every selfish desire and like basically selfish like what whatever allows it so that I i have to spend the least amount of my time in like a starbucks drive-thru like absolute selfishness that to them is virtue.

They don't have a superego. It's been dissolved and now we have this civil war at the end of a extinguished liberalism. An extinguished capitalism that should have been destroyed by now and has not we have this machine that is running itself while we're all freaking out inside of it because we might have passed the point where the machine became self-aware honestly and so we're all freaking out in the hall of this is this we're all freaking out inside the the 2001 ship hal has decided to shoot us out of the airlock to make things more efficient and to make more profit in the third quarter. Even though there's nobody there's going to be nobody to spend it and our politics reflect that it's a bunch of people in a ship that's slashed. The mass has been last or the the in a big spaceship that has been pointed towards the sun. But we still have to sit around in here and like pretend that our councils of state and our political rituals matter and so we decide all right.

I am strapped to this wheel am I going to enjoy it and what way am I going to enjoy this am I going to enjoy it by pursuing indulgence give me the app platter give me give me my give me all my treats. I want to dry. I want to roll coal roll. I want to. I want to I want to use a air conditioner in every room. I want to be as physically comfortable as possible and feel good about it. So I will create a political culture around hating people who think I'm bad for doing this because I know I am and I'm trying to deny that and so. I had to have to displace my hatred of my of my revolution of myself onto others. Or are you a sicko lib who has decided that um that they are the the only people who deserve power because they're the only good people in the country and that if if bad things happen it'll be because they are willing them to happen to bad people and that's the fantasy of power that we cling to as as we're just strapped as the bourgeois should say cling to and the rest of us just have to passively watch the psycho drama play out because the working class never came together the effort to do so broke on the shoals of capital in the late 18 the late 19th century the late 20th century. That's the thing we are we are living in uncharted territory. I would say people will talk about what's late capitalism what's neoliberalism. What are these terms how are they different from the regular capitalism.

I would just say that they are chronological in the sense that they document capitalism. Once capital capitalism has ceased to fulfill a progressive social function which for a long time it did from its birth in late middle ages and europe to I would say mid the first the first half of the 20th century maybe. Later it actually did fulfill a social role that it was progressing. It was creating the structures of uprootedness and technological transmission of information and resources and labor-saving devices and techno technological sophistication of industry and cool and the ability to coordinate. I think once you get to the microchip revolution you're there. But the very forces that built this thing also created a technological structure to capitalism that is different from its political structure that is no longer in human hands in a real sense and it is that the media the superstructure basically everything that you would call a super structural process because those super structural processes have been automated. They are now the actual skeleton of of coercion because they're sending us around and everything we're doing all the politics we're creating. All all the all of our civic action is stuck in the backdraft of this. We are only able to react to the simulacrum of politics because all of the real politics is not political. It is technological. It is central banks. It is fiat currency. It's the it's the fire sector. It's the entire global marketplace. All of these are automated transactions that are carried out by the price signal being detected by technology and then distributing orders through currency across the world.

This is the kind of structure that put to social ends could create a new type of human in in a stupid lame cringe way of talk putting it a new type of person and the poc and liberalism is apocalyptic and nihilistic because it seeks to do that absent the necessary transition away from capitalism and into socialism which they resist. Because their best self-interest is still pleasure. They have of course have a ritual of wanting to deny it and some things they do deny themselves. But they will you know that you know what they don't deny themselves unalienated labor. They're not alien. They're not doing that the idea of doing work that could be unpleasant that could be exhausting that could be not creatively rewarding that could be physical that could be physically alienating. They're not giving that up and since they're not giving that up all of their politics is a performance to obscure that fact and that's all we get to watch because there is no working-class counter hegemonic culture to to transmit to people who see themselves no longer as workers but as consumers because they have been brought to that point by a system that answered every political conflict with more consumption. Every politic.

Every meaningful political conflict in england in the united states results in increased consumption. Now in europe for most of its history. All met all the really big concentrations of political conflict erupt in violence in the form of wars and attempts to conquest the united states that only happened. Once the rest of the time. It was pushed off into border wars against non-subject people that led to increased consumption decreased liberty in the way that the yeoman imagined themselves to be possessing which is that unalienated sense that the the the the sense that I can work myself on the land. Like this is the peasant mind the dream absent the the the landlord is to be my own baron because that's the only model for freedom they have is there's a baron and so they come to america and they all try to be barrens and every time the con there becomes a thing where they might not be able to be not even be the barons but imagine that they could be the barons. Somebody else dies. Somebody else is is colonized another regime falls europe blows up oh boy. That's sure convenient for us and we become the the the clock glocus the globe the striding colossus and instead of capitalism trying to meet local needs as they emerge the way it did in europe capitalism after the war develops according to the needs of this centralized system that has politically directed all the the machine of capitalism towards one aim surplus yes the extraction of surplus value but then that surplus value having some of having some percentage of it funneled into the non-productive class to keep them from gaining sufficient revolutionary class consciousness and now and that meant that there was no coherence to the working class of the world as they came into being in the the bloody exploitative colonial context of the post-war cold war which meant that their social movements became entwined with nationalism and with these like warlord political parties that that meant that they could not pers and especially in a context where the us was a total economic war with the communist bloc.

There was no hope for them to spring up because the central force was dominating and was using its resources to do so and it's technological sophistication and there was insufficient technological ins sophistication among the soviets. Because they were not supposed to be there they were supposed to be the beneficiaries of this global system. They weren't supposed to be the centers of it because they what were they supposed to direct it. Towards there was no central objective. In america. There was a central objective cap the maintenance of these structures and that meant you have a problem give them more to eat give them more to buy give them more dreams that they can become rich first.

The stock markets in the 20s then the the the good union. Then the the more importantly than anything the the second the second or the gi bill and the second homestead act basically which is what created the the suburban working class homeowner and of course things like that were happening in europe too hell. It was the american the american state that broke up the large concentrated feudal landowners in japan after world war ii and then gave everybody a little thief and gave them a chance to conduct this sort of phantom economy of exchange within a system where all the real work was being done outside of it and all of the real resource exploitation was being done outside of it. All that was really happening at the center is consumption and then the economy that has to exist to facilitate that consumption that has to circulate the capital through the system to keep all those signals up and to keep the machinery moving things through the shoots and so the tragedy of robespierre to get back to him is that he was. He embodied his moment but so much so that his belief in the moment transcended even his ability to perceive his immediate interests or his own. His own conviction in his material interests. Rob robespierre probably didn't really care if he died because he'd been hollowed out by his belief but that's a very rare dude they got thrown up by the time but the machinery.

The incentive structure that is always there under capitalism means that you're always sorting towards the most soulless the most cynical towards the top because the people who who care about something that might allow them to resist capital's encroachment are being eaten away. Literally. They're being their heads chopped off. They're failing to advance what it remains are those who have an idea of virtue that conforms to success under capitalism and we're all operating under those conditions and that's why virtue is is a is. A is a furrago and something that can't be chased because nobody's it's not about people being better than other people. It's not and and it's not like. I said it's not even to say that that subjects under socialism would socialism would be better people. They would be people who would be more likely to do good things because the system rewards it and here's.

The important second. Part of that is that having that happen over and over again changes at a fundamental level. What you would have done in a given situation gives you more pleasure to see the affirmation of this system than to get a narrow self-interested point and that is where it becomes self-generating and turning people and and and changing the conditions of life it like it's. It's the alchemy at the heart of of of the socialist vision in my opinion but it is not done because people become better. It's not done because people look inside themselves and have a transformation. It is not millennial or pentecostal. It is that the system incentivizes them to make good decisions good with a capital g not good. See we have that nudge system we have guys like cass sunstein saying oh we need to nudge people in the right direction but they're not talking about good with a big g they're talking about small g economic good which of course is bad is destructive is suicidal and it is the contract. It is the cognitive dissonance of trying to figure out the fact that we have literally labeled good for bad socially and reinforced bad behavior exclusively while still believing that we're upholding a system that generates virtue means that we have to continually create greater and greater fantasies in our mind and jump through more and more mental hurdles to justify ourselves and I really think that the hysteria of the hysteria of virtue mongering among liberals is this process playing out okay. I hope that made some sense so yeah. You can't you have to change the you're you're operated by an algorithm either way. Like it really there's no choice.

The singularity does occur like the singularity the technological singularity is real. The only question is when the two fuse which one is in the driver's seat and which one is in the back which one is which which one provides the which one provides the feedback that creates the conditions that will operate the technology. Is it us in the form of human need expressed through the social institutions and religious and civic concepts that move us through life that nudge us in a direction. As we're we follow the orders really of a technological technological neural superstructure that pushes us through a maze what's going to push us through a maze. No matter what the dream that there's not going to be a maze is the dream of the yeoman fan. It's the yeoman fantasy. It's the pre-capitalist the landed dream and that is not.

It's not compatible with humanity. As it exists. We have been uprooted come from the earth we could not re-establish ourselves in it without destroying so many of us without killing. So many of us that the structures that would be left from that would be. Monstrous and would only bring about more. Destruction would only eat up everything until it was gone. That is the that's the carcinogenic model for a human civilization and it was strapped to this social order that became eventually obsolete and it is now programming our entire technological infrastructure and if it continues to we'll get to a point where there's no people left except for some. Like duct taped some guy in a in a in a giant tower.

 strapped to some vr headset with a goddamn fleshlight on that he thinks is the in internet and he's there getting like paced fed through to him through a tube and he thinks that he's living immortally in the machine until some you know they just there's a there's a There's an energy pulse in sector four and the dies and then everything else is a machine that is still grinding off that is still where the where it's still where it still is power through. It is still moving things back and forth through still sending drones in the sky still protecting borders that are no longer acknowledged by any living thing in the year 2525 a cheesy song but if they they knew that they knew the score or we stick around and the machines the machinery fuses with us in the sense that it does what we want it to do. It becomes an extension of us not an individual person but an extension of a will and that's the that's the cap. I think that kim stanley robert. I haven't read his his books about or like ian banks.

Too this the society or the culture that kind of thing but of course. All that stuff is just purely theoretical. We'll never see any of that we'll probably see we'll probably never see any of those outcomes. But in some universe they got. They happened because in some universe everything happened probably not this one but in one universe out there that happens both of those cases. We're going to be somewhere in the spectrum and what that means is. We're going to keep collapsing breaking up in this cycle until we either run out and and are no longer viable as a species and then something else happens. We get cephalopods in another hundred thousand years and maybe they go to the boomers they go to the space they become whatever or it just cycles through low-level non-intelligent species until the sun explodes that doesn't do anything to that doesn't do anything to the human consciousness. It doesn't do anything to the to our understanding of the world because because we're here now. I know that sounds dumb but it means that I don't know. I can never really articulate it.

I just have this weird. I really should know more about astrophysics because I've heard about this stuff about like times time going backwards in some direction or time. Going backwards in some instances and like being detected is going backwards and and and like causality being reversed or breaking down in the quantum realm and I think about the idea that if the universe is like one consciousness slash substance if it is one thing and we are like within it experiencing it subjectively. Then it it really could be the fact that it is the it is consciousness. It is perception of the universe that makes it real. I'm not going to learn anything. Someone says learn civic engineering. I'm not going to learn anything dude that time has passed. I will. I mean not anything that exalted like. I'm maybe I'm going to learn some stuff that like might help me you know do a bridge and I count with my fingers who the do you think you're talking to yes.

But yeah. The universe exists because it's being observed by us. And so maybe that means that no matter how hard it imagines to believe no hard. No no matter how hard it seems to believe that this could be the world where we pull it off man maybe the only reason we're here experiencing. This is because somewhere it did get pulled off somewhere we can connect to and if that's the case then you are absolutely obligated by every sense of self-interest. Personal sensual spiritual. You are incentivized to do the to do the right thing and you'll know what that is all right yeah. I'm gonna go off. I'm gonna go off and I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go get one of those home correspondence courses to learn about astrophysics. I'm gonna like read. Some wikipedia pages good lord do the right sensual thing no yes bye.
