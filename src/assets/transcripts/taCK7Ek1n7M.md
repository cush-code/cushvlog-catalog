There's barely any sun and yet I still get this insane glare from this. I don't know why is it. I can't explain it guys. Please don't ask me why there's the shaft of light maybe. It's because. I'm god kissed it might be because I'm god kissed. I might be god kissed guys look at this. There's a shaft of light here correctly coming towards my head illuminating me dappling me.

If you will on my damn birthday. If I was one for augury. I would. I would call the suspicious libra season who's feeling themselves me and lee harvey oswald baby. The last american marxist to ever actually impact american history. Maybe the only one oh look at all. Those birthday greetings thank you guys feeling good. Although it is very. I mean. I got the shaft of light here making it feel like. I'm in some sort of identic splendor. But it's actually pretty shitty. Today. It's been very overcast and on and off drizzle which you know hey. It's like rain on your birthday. That's exactly what it's like and I haven't of course unwrapped my gift yet. That's for later we'll see what that is oh. It's raining a little bit on me right. Now. It's drizzling a little bit.

I can't believe there are people saying they're not gonna watch. These debates. I mean I get it if you don't like politics good stay away from this. But if you're one of these people who has through some device of the mind convinced themselves that politics either matter or that politics matter enough to care about not necessarily saying that you you have some sort of opinion about like the efficacy of the political system. But you care enough about it to pay attention to it to say the way that somebody cares enough about a sports team to root for them. I don't know how you care enough about politics to pay attention to it and not want to watch a potential bladder incontinence off between two clearly demented old mutants. I mean if we're going to be ruled by a geruntocratic elite of just out to touch old people who are waiting to die and then hand it off hand off reigns over to their wildly even stupider and more inco incompetent children who will you know sell the last rivets off of the hole of the ship.

As it's sinking into the ocean god damn it. I want to see them at least show some of that. Decrepitude you know just just as a way to remind yourself that you know no matter how many much money you have or power. You have those neurons start They stop firing after a while and you end up getting trapped in your own mind and how that how that feels depends on the life you've lived and where you are mentally to handle it. And if you're one of these psychos you're not you're basically designed to handle it as poorly as humanly possible.

So you got two guys one of them firmly living in 1956 to avoid the fact that his current mode is is fail and then a guy not even living on this planet a guy living in an alternative dimension where he is eternally youthful and powerful and those are our two choices and for the for the election do we resign ourselves to not not a managed decline but a catastrophic one or but one that we feel that is inevitable and unavoidable because our horizons have been so thoroughly beaten away from us by the hegemonic propaganda that we swallow every day and every single. One of our cultural and political and economic institutions pulling us all away from each other at lightning like people in america are pushed away from each other. The way that the like the galaxies are that the the shift that mysterious force that causes the the universe to expand and and send everything hurtling away from each other. That's that's what we have and so manage decline. It would be possible but it would require a degree of of citizen participation in government a degree of intervention in this extraction mechanism of exploitation that we have allowed to just reign free in the name of liberty that is beyond our not not not that we even think it would be bad to do that like we don't even have the level of thinking like no that would be socialism or whatever.

I think for most of us a 51 plus percent. They don't even think it's possible as in as impossible as imagining that you're going to live to 200 you know like our our doom is as foretold as every individual's doom is foretold by their mortal body. Even though the fact that we are you know a a bunch of people who can hypothetically like reproduce you know and change the conditions and the in the world that that our offspring would come up into means that we aren't we could we we could defeat entropy but I think for most people in this country that to to even suggest it. It just gets filtered into more political pablum because you're essentially demanding the impossible at least the way we imagine ourselves. That's that's just capitalist realism. That's why jamison said it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism because we can imagine the system eventually collapsing. We cannot imagine doing what is necessary to change the system and avert the collapse. No it wasn't zuzia because frederick jameson but then again. I think he attributes it to somebody else too. It's one of those kind of floating quotes is pretty good. I always thought that he gets he gets people make fun of him sometimes for saying that the military is like the institution in american life that could most like realistically be a potential model for socialist you know inter transformation.

I I think he's onto something honestly. I've said that before on the show oh man I cannot you know what I'll watch the vp debate for the cringe because kamala is an incredibly cringy debater. Does anyone remember when she made her last her last hail mary attempt for attention and market share in in the debates. I think it was the last debate before she dropped out was when she tried to galvanize the field by calling on all of her fellow candidates to come together to demand that twitter ban trump because he's violating the terms of service and she asked warren if she would say today to add her name to this call which is a classic thing. You do in in in primary races is a candidate will say well like lay down an ideological marker or like a and make a make a bid which then if their opponents either are they're stuck in in in a kobayashi maru situation a hobson's choice between saying no and alienating themselves from a popular position or saying yes and looking like they're taking orders from the person who should be by writes the candidate because like if I'm sorry shouldn't the person giving the commands be the one who you get the nominee give the nomination to But it didn't work because nobody gives a.

It's mommy. It's not being fair. It's not not even like that he's saying specific things. It's that he's breaking the rules and she asked warren to do it and warren said no because she correctly intuited that it was not an issue where she had to worry about being on the wrong side of majority. I mean I could see her getting totally rooked in that move by a different person in it with a different point but like kamala came in with just the absolute laziest. Tulsi gabbard of all people over her record and she had that thing and that little girl was me deal with biden which just actually. On the internet. It really is beside the point because that kamala move to hit him on segregation. Like that it hit him on bussing specifically and then connecting it to her lived experience that should be the kind of thing that wins that should be the kind of thing that works or conversely the kind of thing that like like shapes the shapes the race instead she tried it.

Everyone said ew and then nobody really did anything like that again so there's clearly no like hegemonic liberal insistence on id paul. You know that's like making it impossible to make a a populist left case like clearly that stuff is has a limited um impact on the general public. So how can it be the face of the whole thing how can it be. This like um dominant propaganda mode imposed from without when it's barely anything anyone can make hay of as a candidate. They tried and nobody succeeded who got nominated the old white guy. I know there's a theory that that's because bernie went to id paul. But I'm sorry. I paid attention to that campaign and just because aoc said in a speech after she endorsed him something about like brown bodies. You know in a in a rally. That was not what the contours of the sanders campaign were about and it sure wasn't what people were telling pollsters and telling everyone who would listen to them why they weren't supporting him.

They were saying because medicare for all is unrealistic because socialists can't win because we got to beat trump and that has to do with with you know hegemonic. Capitalist ideological um infrastructure that has captured the minds of the democratic. A significant portion of the democratic electorate coupled with the fact that the democratic primary electorate is increasingly wealthy increasingly detached from any any motivation to pursue material redistribution. Like those are the guys who those are the people those white suburbanites who who flooded the poles in virginia and in south carolina and and helped turn the tide and kind of just stifle the whole thing because they saw bernie winning and they said oh. No he was he did get it across people's mind that he was the socialist candidate. He was the candidate for radical change. Everyone bought that I do not remember anybody talking about him being the candidate of lbgt whatever or bodies and spaces. However you want to phrase it any of the any of the icky alienating id paul that is supposed to make it impossible to to make a leftist material appeal in the current moment he did it.

He did it and the forces of power. The forces of capital arrayed their their their mechanisms to defeat it for that reason aided by the fact that people can't imagine change of that. That nature we have been so fully marketized that we cannot see anything other than this and that's why when bernie showed up people were like i. I th these appeals actually directly hit me where I live and the world you're sketching is one that I know would be better than the one we live in. But it is prima facia impossible and therefore you can't go forward with that plan that's very that's sobering and terrible. But it.

It really does show that that the the the question of like the social issues that has defined this idiotic argument online for the past four years actually isn't influencing the political structures that these things are supposed to be determining at least not the way that people are claiming they are one way or the other like whether they're priorities for people and it's alienating to try to avoid them and that you have to speak about people's lived experiences for your socialism to have a chance because otherwise they're going to think it's too male centric or whatever the hell or that oh all those all that icky trans feelings. Pronoun college stuff alienates regular people who just want to grill and have health care that is only happening to the people who are focusing in through the prism of this hot house of online argumentation where they have to find something to fight about because they're paying attention every second of the day and they're requiring stimulation and they're requiring argumentation because they've made it into a subculture because these are subcultural questions. I do know that kamala's stepson is a come town fan very funny dante de blasio. The dill de blasio son also a kumtown fan. I gotta say very impressed with their reach and fan fan fandom. They're gonna the next generation of of political leaders. Like the next generation of black-pilled democratic executioners who just finish us off as a civilization will all be come town fans yeah and I'm sure they all hate us not because we're like owning their parents or something. But because we're lame because growing up around politics.

They think politics is lame and talking about politics is lame and they're right. It is lame. It's what you do when you're foreclosed other options of finding of finding meaning and and and purpose so yeah. They probably think we're absolute turbo dorks and absolutely correct and I'm not saying that you know it's it that it's dumb to care about politics. I'm saying is that in the current moment politics is so distant from from ammonitizing anyone's well-being that focusing on it requires you turning it into a part of your life. If you know what I mean like it becomes a spectacle it becomes something that you because you know it matters but you can't do anything about you fill that gap with the emotional resonance created by enjoying it on a day-to-day moment level of observation. Not engagement observation which is all we're overdoing. We only vote once every four years for president and that's the big thing right that's the big one and then every two years. If you really want to be a nerd about it.

In order to keep that focus you have to have other areas foreclosed and like that's just that that's the the hinge system that's going to bring people to class. Consciousness and marxist theory is that you have to start caring about politics because there's nowhere else to get any anything in your life and you're like my god. We have to change this and you push towards it and you need a combination of people who are sort of indolent and people who are exploited and the problem. Right now is that far too many of the people who care about politics care about politics because they're filling a void of meaning not material necessity and that is what sharpens practice into praxis is that urgency and it's not because we aren't suffering.

It's because for a huge huge percentage of americans the process of social atomization fragmentation the destruction of the monoculture the replacement of it with the the simulation of simulations the spectacle of spectacles of online and the physical breaking up of working-class communities. The breaking up of of like extended family units and any sort of social networks. Beyond you know immediate households suburbanization making that a geographic part of the like an actual part of the landscape they're still feeling that horror but they're not tacking towards politics because they're not.

It's so far away it's so far away and what's going to get them there. What's going to get them there all they engage with in the world to make sense of it is this stream is this flow is this undifferentiated amount of of stimuli that gives it an illusion of infinites. It's an illusion you give. It gives you an illusions of omnipotent or omniscient control of information in the universe like you can actually step into a stream that contains everything. Even though it's. It's like a corporatized miniaturized intentionally manipulated version of that and then you have to make sense of it and what institutions exist to have anyone make sense of it.

What lived exp what what shared experiences of class class struggle or exploitation can be shared or generated out of that and it's it's since I i it's entrapped us. It's the damn matrix. It's the dangle matrix and even those of us who think we're like more aware of of the stakes and and and what we should be doing in terms of making a political project to make things better instead of just seeking self ultimately self-destructive forms of escape from our misery. How much of that is bound ends up being lost into that same self-destructive escape because of the lack of urgency and the lack of ability to apply and I know that's you know. It's it's not great to hear because it does seem like it limits our ability to have any hope. But that's only if you adhere to certain expectations beyond the expectation to be alive on a day-to-day basis and live your life and be there for the people in it and be with them and allow that that to move you forward instead of a thing in your head a ship and a bottle that you've been building in the skinner box that we think is the universe. That's the only hope and if you feel if you can if you can keep yourself on that beam. It becomes easier to see things as they are and avoid the traps that a lot of people fall into where you decide that the work the real ruling classes that people online you don't like or that.

Voting for donald trump is actually populism and because the trumpism is the best chance we have for a like social democracy in the american political system. Those are all wild forms of cope coping like a madman. I mean thinking that thinking that there's any kind of like morality to voting at all like. I'm voting for biden because it's harm reduction what is your contribution to that harm reduction if you vote for him and he wins does that mean you're responsible for x number of people not dying because of whatever he does that trump wouldn't do which honestly has he really gotten too involved in explaining what would be different under him other than everything would be calmer and there wouldn't be rude tweets. I mean that's up to the people in charge to do that to reduce that harm you're pressing a button. These are individual votes and individual decisions and as such you have to take them in their context.

In their you. You cannot take the end result of an election you kick one domino and at the end of the domino strike down you've got the entire world being changed by an electoral contest. But you're not the only one flipping that goddamn domino everybody is. It's just all falling over at once. If you weren't. There would still happen exactly the same way exactly the same way like there is no butterfly effect thing where one your decision to vote for a candidate changes the outcome and election.

You can say a group of people did or people like you demographically or people that you identify with on the internet because you post the same memes but you had nothing to do with it which means that you're not reducing any harm or exacerbating any harm you're not doing anything so why are you arguing about it. Why are you adjudicating it that is persistent that is participating in maintaining the fiction. The delusion that there is a coherent involvement in the political system now in the in the absence of the bernie campaign to form an actual structure of like organization around issues and organization around tactics by virtue of voting for him. You know like creating an actual because what bernie did the bernie idea of bernie is that bernie would give content and structure to the voting bloc of people who vote for a democrat.

They wouldn't just be 50 million people waddling around and flapping their doodles because because his candidacy would be singular and because it would be organized around specific radical challenges to the existing political and economic structure that could not be digested by the political system. Otherwise that means that voting for him is participating in a greater project. Biden is doing the opposite of that he is. He is expanding the net to everyone by robbing his candidacy of any content. What is the biden agenda he just came out. People were talking today about his monstrously terrible health care plan that involves four-figure deductibles. That's that's supposed to be the the affordable health care that people are gonna have people there's gonna be four four digit deductibles which means you have to spend thousands of dollars before you can even see a dollar back in in insurance coverage of health care costs which makes it for a lot of people who don't have thousands of dollars. Don't have. Four digits means that it's as inaccessible to them except maybe no as accessible to them as healthcare would be if they didn't have any insurance at all. But now they have less money.

What are you doing. By participating in this election are you getting rid of donald trump. Are you preserving decency are you making america built back better nobody consequences for anybody directly after this in terms of the party structure they might lose some elections but they're still going to stay on the top of the system iron law of institutions and I'm never. I'm not telling people not to vote what I'm telling them is you got to ask yourself why you're actually voting because only until we understand what the vote is and get rid of this mystification around it. This this ritualized sacrament that we've turned it into we. These we break the spell of the vote well. People realize the massive chasm between their will and any any any accountability at the point of government and people would say oh will not do that and that is why I see anybody making any arguments about the whether you should or shouldn't vote for biden.

I feel like even as well intentioned as you could possibly be. This is by definition not only wasted energy. This is actually counterproductive because it reinforces the mystification around the vote strip it down to its essence walking into a gym pointing pressing a button and walking out you have done nothing 100 million. Other people are going to do it too. Your decision is not going to impact the outcome of any race that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. And if you're doing it in coordination with a bunch of other people like hey we're all voting for bernie right for the health care and stuff right. Now you're actually participating in something but in the current system with the current candidates you are not participating in other than a ritual a ritual of of feigned authority where we pretend to bestow we our participation honestly. Individually you can talk about like how elections have consequences. I'm saying individually our individual contribution to to elections and to the 

The who rules us is less than when the queen of england goes like hello and blesses the new prime minister. It's ceremonial. It's literally ceremonial until we do it in concert. Then it's not ceremonial anymore and in the past there have been times when it hasn't been ceremonial because of actual coordination around issues and agendas pursuing political power self-consciously instead of what we have now which is biden because he's not trump and then whenever he does. It won't be trump. So it'll be better and how bad it is. Hey do you want trump instead and you'll never ever change anything until you're like. I'm not voting unless it matters. I'm not voting unless. It's worth my time. Now. I vote because I enjoy doing it because I'm a sicko. I like going in there. I like filling out the little forms. I moved to new york right after they got rid of the old machines with the little flip buttons and I was incredibly pissed. I never got to vote in an election with the old voting machines which they also had in my home county manor to walk. But I was. I never voted there. I I moved out to you too early and so I've only ever done like scantron and that's fine. But I like doing it. I like filling in a little bubble. I like putting it in the machine. I enjoy that I enjoy as toby says in american splendor. I enjoy the ritual. It's one of those rituals that I have fun with. But I do not amuse. I do not dis.

I do not delude myself into thinking that my my my vote has moral meaning. It has no more moral meaning than me going to get dinner going deciding whether I'm going to get the arby's gyro or go with the just the roast beef and horsey sauce so. I like voting and I'm going to vote who I vote for doesn't matter doesn't matter in terms of morality doesn't matter. I could leave it blank. I could write myself in I could sketch my balls on it and you have to at treat it that way or else you're. Gonna leave that what happened obama is exhibit a of that because while he was able to marshal a broad enthusiastic voting block there was no content to it at all hope st to come stuff. Not even anything like the new deal wasn't fleshed out when fdr ran but the cons the idea that there was going to there was going to be a radical change in the relationship between the government. The economy was taken for granted this like new deal like it was gonna be new obama was stuff and so everybody left those voting booths in 2008 thinking they'd done something and then what happened. They took it from there and they they listen to their real bosses. The people who they talk to every day the people who actually participate in politics by giving money and raising money and directing money and having meetings and sending emails and funding think tanks so yeah.

That's why people want me to debate x y or z guy about voting for biden waste. Not only wasted energy misdirected energy like counterproductively misdirected because because what's the argument for ryden every argument for biden revolves around how much better a biden administration would be than a trump won for like the most marginal and I wouldn't even argue those points what I would say is okay. But what does that have to do with who I vote for because I'm not picking between those two things. One of them is going to happen but I'm not going to determine the outcome by my vote. So what difference does. This make what are you actually trying to argue and look somebody says like it's harm reduction versus accelerationism. I agree but those are just other words for cope versus cope you get to go in the booth saying I'm voting for biden and then biden's going to get in there and that's going to save lives and maybe reduce the climate apocalypse even if it's not as much as I'd want.

I feel like. I did something good. I feel like I'm a good person that's just coping it's just a way to convince yourself you're participating. Same thing is going in there like actually trump by presiding over a continuing economic crisis at the head of a still capital dominated party. Will lead to the emergence of you know. A broad hostile left that will break free of the shackles of the democratic party by engaging disenchanted members of the the trump coalition as well as energizing new swaths of of previous non-voters through grassroots efforts and the creation of like counter-hegemonic cultural forms fine. Maybe once again what does that have to do with you pressing which button you're not making that happen. I wrote in drill in 2000 in ohio in 2016. At drill I wrote voted for in ohio which ended up not really being a swing state. But yeah. I didn't make trump win ohio so somebody says so what if you do that what next. I'm just saying you have to get there. I don't actually know it next that sounds like a cop-out absolutely it is but I'm this stuff. This is things happen when they happen. You know what I mean and they cr make. Other things happen that you cannot predict. The contours of them are not predictable.

What I do know is that if people who feel that they are political feel like they have a responsibility to themselves future generations the people they love to make the world better for the people for everyone and make the planet habitable but voting is literally nothing. It's less consequential morally and and and meaningfully than jacking off. What are we gonna do what do we do about that and then we work with what we have to build from that. Foundation of what do we do about it which we're not asking or not enough of us are asking because this massive weight of of of the presidential election. This this spectacle of spectacles this grinding pyrotechnic phantasmagoria designed to completely absorb our attention. Can be blocked out a little bit and maybe part of that maybe then people say hey I got an idea how about instead of us just voting based on what we think would be like the the more moral thing to do how about we all get together figure out what we want pick somebody to run for that and then vote for them all together. If we want voting to matter if we think that there's enough there's enough juice in the in the pickle of american political system.

If it is if it actually can can connect to power if it's not completely ornamental. Then let's do that that's still a step up from where we are now and it's still something that is only going to be possible enough. People are motivated to not just in the sense of feeling the dread and horror of of alienation and and and precarity but also because they can see a thing to do with that precarity to do with that angst to do with that alienation to do with that will and drive and incentive towards action which cuts through all of the theoretical. It would be very funny if somebody asked if they're going to bring up the crime bill tonight. I don't think this this one it would be very funny though if trump brings up the crime bill and calls biden like the puppet of antifa in the same sentence that would be perfect see. This is so interesting so people are taking from this.

I'm seeing in the chat that I'm saying don't vote not saying don't vote. I'm not going to tell you what to have for dinner. I'm not going to say don't go to. Don't go to oh. Peanut butter jelly or you better have spaghetti and meatballs. It is beside the point you have to answer the question of whether you should vote or not. Every individual has to answer that question themselves. It's the only thing that matters and hopefully giving the the active the proper.

The proper proportion the proper proportion of your life that it met that it maintains that it that it reflects I mean I am. I'm a goofy enough romantic to even think that there could be either outcome of this election could bring about some sort of third-party formation. I mean it would have to be in the context of a genuine crisis which I'm still not convinced is inevitable. This is a crisis but when I say genuine crisis I mean like one that leads to some sort of seismic re shuffling cracks in the in the fissures you know or cracks in the system and and significant breaches of normality and I think I've said before on the show that I think we might end up never seeing that moment come just because all of those crisis moments that in a previous generation would have been perceived to be a a a splintering of reality would instead be immediately normalized within the greater culture. As the people directly impacted are sort of softly removed from the roles like oh oh we just lost. Florida well that's really too bad all right. I guess we'll start redrawing the maps you know what I mean and in a system like that two parties in until in two parties until the you know government is in an elysium satellite around earth.

Someone really wants to know about the elliot spitzer scandal. I don't really know. I never watched that alex give me documentary. Apparently he was very horny and he liked to spend a ton of money on call girls and it got found out. I guess mainly because wall street was mad at him for being too aggressive in regulating them so I mean. I don't know like that seems like what you could get from wikipedia. I don't know what else you want me to say oh. He also sucked liz smith's toes but that was later after he'd. Divorced his wife and left the left the governorship and all that but I think the main upshot is is that the thing he got bit nailed for is stuff that almost all of those guys do and it only brought him down because he annoyed enough people in real power in new york. I.e wall street because diaper david vitter got re-elected to the senate. After he got came out He was found in the black book of a dc madam not only that it also came out that he was a diaper fetishist. He got he got his ass got reelected and it's almost always true that if you don't resign it eventually blows over and yet somehow a sex scandal like that that you think wouldn't have been that consequential at that point became this thing that he couldn't get over so yeah. I guess that makes you think wow maybe spitzer had some metal to him but honestly. I think he He probably was just pursuing a populist political branding exercise too aggressively.

So. I don't get presents anymore that's fine. I don't really. I don't have anything. I need well every day is a gift. The debate starts at nine and I'm I'm fixing to be I am fixing to be entertained and if god damn it I'll entertain myself if they won't bother to my favorite dark tower book somebody asked is probably the wastelands blaine the mono baby oh. I'm doing a white claw tonight rip black cherry once again alcoholic or not alcoholic. It's great everyone likes wizard of glass. I just remember being really annoyed after all those years that he has a another dark tower book. And it's a chevalric ass world. I did see the dark tower movie and it is stunningly terrible.

 really impressive how shitty it is. Really reminds you that the pro the filmmaking process has basically nothing to do with art at that level of capital investment which makes the insistence of people to turn it into the soul vector not only of like culture but politics and personal cement titty oh god jesus rolls. I couldn't finish it. I might finish it at some point but I got about like not even half an hour into it. One of the worst things I've ever seen just breathtakingly terrible which of course it always was. The idea was terrible and I love the idea and john. Chatturo used to say that he would bug the the cohens about making it and you know that he asked them to write it. He said hey. I have an idea for a movie and you know they should they were as polite as possible like yeah john that sounds like a good idea.

But they were never. Gonna make that movie and so then he decides to make it himself and holy. It is it's a hell of a cultural artifact. I have to say so armenia azerbaijan who you got coys who you got who you got who takes it armenia or azerbaijan who takes it not who you're rooting for who takes it got a lot of armenia's in the chat couple eyes here by jeans. Now. It's overwhelmingly armenia looks like i.

I think that's the kardashian's responsibility for that honestly. Somebody asked what my birthday dinner is. I'm trying to decide what should it be. What would be a good dinner. Let's let's end the chat talking about food so I can get all riled up and then eat something delicious on my birthday salmon. What kind though korean fried chicken yeah. I was thinking szechuan fried chicken with the with the red peppers gyro though sounds really good too oh. One of the best fast food places unavailable um yes a hero quite somebody says donner but I got maybe it's just because I grew up because when I lived in milwaukee as a younger after college there was no donor. There were only euros there were two places oakland and apollo and they were both really good. Apollo was I think a better but oakland was much better people watching. It was a great place to go after you were drinking or something and so for me it'll always be a euro the donner's fine. But it's just not. It's not the same thing.

I gotta get that tatsuki sauce yeah. Those are even better than arby's when a chicago keeps. I will stress again for a fast food. Gyro remarkably good. The tzatziki sauce is flavorful the the like greek style meat. It actually does have like a texture and flavor and seasoning that distinguishes it from every other pile of lunch meat that arby's puts out apparently. Felix just tweeted about me oh buddy. That's so sweet felix is a mensch well. If you've people say I work. There. I any place any you don't want to see the sausage or the arby's get made okay. Oh french fries on the euro is great. Somebody say that's bad who the hell saying that's bad french oh god. That's the way they do it in france. I think I'm definitely getting a hero. Though it is. It is decided you can't call him a gyro in new york though you got to call him a gyro because it sounds too much like hero which is their stupid name for a sub. I gotta say though. I went to what's supposed to be the best euro place in astoria which I'm assuming you know that's saying something.

That's like one of the most constant fully concentrated greek neighborhoods in the country. And it was okay. It was like it was pork for one thing. It wasn't even like partially lamb and it was it was just the texture was weird. It wasn't for me. It was good but I was disappointed. I still have not had a fantastic euro here in in new york. There's one that I'm gonna try. I think I have in mind that hopefully will be good. Don't tell me how to pronounce these things. I'm not going to remember okay a hero cake. What the hell is that that sounds horrifying apparently pork euro is traditional well. I'm not a. I'm not traditional. I mean. I remember one time when I was like. I think I was in college. I went to a mexican restaurant and I asked for I saw there was a I think it was a chalupa on the menu and I was like ooh chalupa and it was not at all like the taco bell chalupa and I was disappointed. I'm a hick I didn't have. I didn't have like ethnic cuisine until I was like in college. The fanciest restaurant in my hometown was taco bell like that kind of stuff. Isn't true anymore like like you can kind. You can find varied cuisine all over the place now but like just a few decades ago if you were outside of like even a like a metro a regional metro city.

You you had you did not have a lot of ethnic diversity in your food stuffs. So I like the lamb euro thing I like the guy and the guy cutting the thing off. That's what I like al pastor is a mexican giro and also very good oh yeah. I tried patsy's pizza after we talked about pizza last week. I got patsy's and it was really good. I was very very pleased all right somebody's posting euro cake.
