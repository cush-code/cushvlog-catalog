Okay Here I am here we go I'm trying this for the first time I've got a mic. See. It got a microphone. It's connected to my computer. Can you guys hear me. This is all I'm asking for all. I really want to know is can you hear me because I got a mic so that I don't have to worry about what I was doing before sounds good fantastic. That thing was bugging the hell out of me and now I don't have to worry about it alright great guys.

So I want to start today with a quote from a Washington Post article from earlier last week. I think or last weekend or so White House officials also hope Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day according to three people familiar with the White House's thinking who requested anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. Americans will quote live with the virus being a threat in the words of one of those those people. A senior administration official now I don't want to be the type of say. I told you so but I  told you so when in April when they shut the door on the first Florentine. I said there is no way that this ends of anything other than a social in Norment to death at a higher level because we do not have the social capacity either technologically through supply chains or just the connection to one another. The social bond necessary for a scientist to say there's a virus and for more than 50% of the adult population to say okay I believe you and not say who are you working for George Soros and then I'm going to spit in your face if you tell me not to go to the traders Joe with the  without a mascot. Those things basically mean that there's no way we were going to do anything other than shrug our shoulders after we got bored sitting inside go out and give it to each other and then shout our shoulders again and the only reason they didn't do it then because think about it if they did it. Then they'd said suck it up.

Then we wouldn't have ever had the huge collapse right. We wouldn't have to be digging our way out of this hole. In the first place. All those small businesses would still be open and there were some real. You know some real jihadists for capitalism like lieutenant governor of Texas dan Patrick who said that explicitly but we needed to be needed to come to the conclusion ourselves because at that point in our in our social order in America social order that many people dying of a virus was not acceptable because it was in a vacuum of course. We don't want half a million people dying of a virus but now we know what the alternative to a half a million people dying the viruses staying at home getting really bored not being able to do anything your job lose it. Leaving. Then I guess you gotta just accept all of that now of course as we've said that was necessary. You know we could have created some sort of emergency command economy to paid people to stay home and maintain at the safest way possible our supply chains. But of course we didn't have the capacity or the inclination of our ruling class to do that and so instead we got what we all knew we were. Gonna get a new level of death that we accept in this country a new threat that you accept like how in the 19th century nobody's afraid they were gonna kick down a car crash because they didn't know what a car was now kills 50,000 people a year. Pedestrians and a bicyclist gets splattered on the regular and it's it's accepted.

You don't want it to happen to you. But it probably won't and it's the price you pay to live in it. In this free society. Now permanent lung scarring and a dead grandmother are the price you pay for a free society. So we're finally here just took us having to be inside. Get bored have nothing happen in the end. During the time we were indoors to make it worthwhile to do so and then either because we're cranky babies or because we decided we wanted to protest police injustice. We decided at some level that it was worth the risk to go outside and as soon as that happened we all are now blaming each other. But what that means is we're except Blayne and that is the ideal and necessary condition for the people in charge that we're all blending each other which we 100% are and so every viral video of some. Like tranquilized by the bear patrol and put in cages a hundred percent but the social ritual of the condemnation event that's just us expressing our powerlessness and our willing our desire to blame each other because we're in front of one another and and the people in charge are too far away to yell that yeah I cut my own hair.

Today. I just use the buzzer I did not go the full full number one. Yet I might later but right now. It's good enough good enough for still but basically being at home. All the time. Yes I got their advance copy of Reagan land and very excited nine hundred pages just on the on the 74 to 80 and apparently. It's the last one because it's about the rise to power of conservativism and that culminates with Reagan and 80 at that point his story. It's a different story. So I can't wait to finish it. I haven't really started it but thinking about Reagan specifically really does make me think of why it made me. It reminded me of how insane everyone is right like what I was talking about. People will lick lick windows and spit on each other and throw things like do things that any other generation of Americans would consider. Signs of deep. Mental disorder and people are doing them to get clout from conservatives. The kind of people who used to value a certain public decorum I mean these are the people who like to talk about how you know in the old days. Men used to wear hats and now they're cheering as some psychotic baboon does a  spear tackle of a display of masks and target that's not dignified behavior but it is inherent to the Pope. It's it's the only response we have to the moment we're in and Reagan is a big reason for that and the reason. I think that I think that this book is huge. It's by far the longest book Pearlstein is written and talking about a period that usually under discussed when you talk about the the tumultuous rise of conservativism.

I mean people think about it in terms of either Nixon or Reagan ruling not Nixon not not that in a regnum. Mr. Carter. But it's the most important period that hinge point that is that is the the transition point to the late capitalist. A curve cannibal lifeboat economy. We've been living on ever since when we just when the ruling class decided that they were going to basically deal with the crisis of stagflation and the crisis of the 70s. The crisis of oil and energy shocks and and and increased demand for real wage growth among a powerful working class was to break the power of the working class. It was explicitly put in those terms Paul Volcker Carter's appointed treasurer secretary said the standard of living the American worker will have to go down and it has been slowly and steadily for 40 years because now with that with the engine of the industrial economy clipped and America. Being just this. This this theme pig-like we're in the global economy. We are like one of those State Fair pigs that they just stuff with corn all day so that it can win in a blue ribbon for being the  fattest south west of the Mississippi. That's us on the supply chains we're just fed sure. I thought I said you fed. Sheriff I said Treasury secretary I was wrong. I've spent chair wolfing when he was appointed by Carter wolfing down just the slurry the corn slurry. It's only a matter of time forever. It's all gonna keep sinking especially if Americans keep having to keep having to spend with no commensurate rise in income but with a high debt. An increasing debt that can never get repaid. That's that's where the bubbles come in and asset bubbles have been the only driver of the American economy since then which is why we've had so much more instability. It's much more like the Gilded Age that way every 20 years like a punctuated shock and it's why it. It's why life gets worse as a material level for people over the years. Now that crisis started in the 70s and it was apparent to everyone that the earth was opening up and as much as Carr and Carter deserved every boramy. Gotten deserved lose because from his position as the ruler of the president which means he has a different set of stakeholders than he would be even as a Democratic member of Congress or a Democratic governor. Being president puts you into a deeper measurement with the very highest levels of capital and therefore it decreases any leverage on you from the party that you supposedly represent and under that conditions. Carter pursued austerity vigorously and the thing is is that that was dealing with reality but not in a way that anybody wanted to imagine not the way anybody wanted to see. Not only anybody wanted to believe they lived. In this is America. They didn't want to believe they lived in a country that had that was intentionally reducing its sights. It's its ambitions my god now of course. The other thing that could have been done is overthrowing capitalism and polishing profit and socializing production and all of a sudden. A lot of these problems would have gone away in fact permanently but there was nobody at the table with anywhere like that on the agenda.


It was entirely co-opted labor and capital at that table so since that was off the table as an austerity like real austerity for the human for the American population which has been ongoing for 40 years. Real austerity was going to happen no matter what both parties for the next 40 years until it's till Kingdom Come until the collapse until whatever there was no gonna be in there's no interrupting it. Because now it was off the table as a political question because both parties agreed on it and once both parties agree on something. It no longer has political valence and so the question of austerity is no longer a political question because who's gonna bring it up. The only people who can bring it up profitably and meaningfully are the two parties so that's off the agenda there will be nothing but austerity. So the political question comes what is our relationship to austerity how do we deal with that process.

Culturally the reality of lower standards of living for American workers now Carter with his malaise speech famously attempted to recognize this moment and bridge that gap with public morality and as much as you can say. Carter for being the spearhead of neoliberalism you could say if you wanted to be generous. You could say there really was no alternative because the working class working-class power. Although it was high. It was very very high was not high enough to overcome the hegemonic influence of the bourgeois class dictatorship that American democracy is so there was no even if he'd wanted to the support wouldn't have been there to make it happen so say he's stuck if I stared. He really is intractable now because of the political reality of the moment and you know what you could make an argument. It was then the question becomes how do we process it and Carter was correct. You process it by reassessing and redefining people's values because you could have a decent society still with a lower standard of living. If there was a greater degree of social pleasure and identity and I guess you want to you put a word around it. Spirituality. Like there is you exchange some like the Soviet Union. Like nobody ever Khrushchev wanted the Soviets to like you know outpace America's American production of consumer goods but that was misguided because the whole idea of communism was you don't mean all that. Cuz you have social solidarity and so Carter's whole notion of public sacrifice coming to terms with what we've done in Vietnam coming to terms with what our consumption.

Society had brought was an attempt to injected a moral dimension back into American life that would have replaced some of that worded material gain that Americans are going to be able to access less and less over time. If if a morality is reintroduced into public life. If if meaning meaning I guess is the word I'm really looking for if meaning is rejected into public life then reduced as long as you're not talking about reducing to penury. If you're talking about you know one car instead of two houses that are smaller honestly that would be good for everybody people would be happier. You know left Oh economically ecologically damaging fashion and that is what Crimean ISM is supposed to create. That's the goal is to create a society that it's like that like a lot of those questions of how do you get everybody.

All the stuff under communism are answered by nobody's gonna need all that stuff because it's they're not compensating for a hole in their spirit because there is a social being of social morality. So Carter was the problem was is too far out of the the the the Carter might have been well-meaning but that's technical liberal idealism. Like there is no. There is no element of our economy that's going to distribute morality that's going to distribute meaning into our social interactions. All it's going to do is what capitalism always does destroy the meaning of social interactions. Everything solid melts into air and that means everything that is meaningful off of a ledger book everything that has meaning that cannot be quantified by dollars. He's dissolved in the asset of capitalists in marketplace interactions and so it was a forlorn childish quixotic hope by Carter and people obviously said  off and what did Reagan do Reagan wrote in and said here's how we're gonna square.

This I'm not going to acknowledge that stared is real you're just going to feel it half you slowly and not realize the source. What I'm gonna do is. I'm gonna say  that you're terrified of that horrible traumatic 60s and 70s you experienced that was just that was just liberals going out getting out of hand and now we're gonna bring him. Back in America is in tip-top shape. Like that giant heart attack. You suffered that was not because of your diet that was because you got scared by a hippie yeah. You got infarcted. Let's go on full steam ahead and that's where we've been sense every political issue except for Bernie of course running who has run for president for either party for both parties. Since 1980 has been running at that same level of knowing that they will be a forcing austerity because there is an alternative but in maintaining a cultural fantasy of endless consumption. As patriotism well you can see how there's going to be a point where crisis hits and we're in the middle of it where the fantasy can no longer be sustained by the felt reality. Like that. We're no longer the frogs in the in the slowly boiling water who don't know the temperature's going up. We  know it. We're feeling scalded but the vast majority of politically minded Americans.

Anyway. People who process this stuff through a political lens have spent their entire adult lives and that is everyone almost marinating in a unstinting ideological consensus that America is perfect and america. America's institutions are perfect at america's values. Ie consumption as self-expression are or are the sum total of morality and for a lot of these Yahoo's Christian morality but they could no longer be carried out. You can't live that way because everything's getting worse you can't even go to the  bar and so what happens well the same way that those early Gnostic Christians decided that because they couldn't live as Christians in this world. Then this world must not have been created by God but by an evil subsequent Demiurge. Achill God our new materialist Christians reactionary Christians who have this as their built-in mindset like beyond ideology. Like the heuristic they view everything through they see a world now where America as it is in their head and as it has been propagated through culture to them is so at at odds with the world. They see around them that it can't be the real America.


It's a denier jury at America. It's controlled by an evil elite within the country within all these structures. So within the Republicans there are elite within the Democrats. There are elite and every level elite and these elite form. That is the new Demiurge. That's what that's the deep state that qa9 rails against. That's the that's the Jewish conspiracy that outright Peppe types are talking about and it's an it's a necessary. It's it's an inevitable necessary psychic compensation for living in a world that can no longer comport with your image of the world and that I'll start it because Reagan decided to make that bet and it paid off politically and now. It's the only game in now. And it's helped make everybody insane because the conditions have only deteriorated and we have not spent a moment reckoning with that because we're all living in cloud cuckoo-land looking at the flames on the side of the cave trapped in the demiurges fantasy and they're not the only ones I mean it's amazing and fun to watch them. You know try to square the country they're living in with someone in their head and the reality of living in this country. This shitty piece of  Italians and of course they're breaking the knives but every everyone is because the the the technology. The social and material technology exists now to allow everyone to indulge completely in their particular psychotic justification for the reality. A compensatory narrative I guess I would say that's what it is like the internet I'm talking specifically about the Internet. Yes allows you to indulge in a in a exculpatory narrative around everything that makes you feel powerless and terrified and miserable in their real life and I think one of the ones that's really dominant online naughty not among psycho right-wingers but among people who consider themselves liberals.

Now and leftists is this goddamn question of  culture cancel god damn culture cancel and such of course. There was that letter today by those guys whatever the hell I don't care didn't read. It don't have any interest don't have an interest in any of it just to say that it is not canceled culture. It's the internet culture. What you're describing every element of this that people describe because it's like an the blind man and the elephant. There's 50 million things. People mean when they say it and none of them are metal and that's half. The problem is that no one is operating off of the same definition but every single. One of these things emanates from the incentive structure of the entrepreneurial social engage on social media social media specifically because this is all in with social media right even in the people who are in regular media. This is all about how their work is received and reach trans through social media which is what keeps them employed or not. So. It's all social media and the incentives there as I've talked about are all towards building up individual identity that is separate from a group identity but also maintaining your position within that by patrolling the borders of acceptable thought everyone does it its inherent. All these questions about like are you enforcing are you enforcing acceptable opinions. Of course you are that's everyone is doing that that's what it is because it's all it's all virtual.

It's entirely defined by our opinions and so we're slicing the world around us up and we're slicing up the people around us and of course. It's infected with paranoia and of course people are always denouncing one another and of course. The people are self censoring. That's that's part of being in a self-conscious subculture like a table at a lunch room and so people talking about it. This council culture are missing the toys entirely. This is just the Internet and when you see things like the  letter saying like we need more free speech and people saying we need less free speech. The who are they adorably addressing this to like who is the letter to the Secretary General of canceled culture the king of auntie Fah. The thing about this the terrifying thing is the thing that people want to ignore as much as the cue psychos want to ignore the fact that the country they live in has decided that it will only continue operating off of the blood of the exploited worker such as them. They don't want to deal with that reality. These people don't want to deal with the reality that all these questions about the morality and veracity and usefulness of canceled culture.

Just like with statute is destroying and riots is impotent and meaningless because even if you came to a conclusion there's nothing you can do for the input the information because there's no one directing it. We are all operating spontaneously and without coordination. This is I keep banging on this because this is the foundational. An elementary fact of the American left is that is not organized and there is a fantasy of organization that you see because things you go on the internet and all those ones and zeros they coalesce into recognizable shapes and here's a shape. Over there. It looks like the left but it only looks like the left because it's online and cancel culture wanting to patrol the bounds of discourse. That's what everyone is going to be personally incentivized to do and nothing can change that incentive. No one can order them to not want to do that because they're not in a chain of command. They don't have a cadre org or even a membership or discipline. They're all operating independently and by independent motives and those motives will always be to find out the interloper cut them from the herd and then get credit for pointing it out getting a little badge for finding the black sheep and pulling them out of the herd. That's that's that that incentive structure is transcendent. It's out.

It's basically randomized in the sense that there's no on and off switch and that's what arguing about like is it good or bad who cares no one can make it happen one way or the other you're just coping like if you say actually it's good. It's cope you're coping. You don't want to deal with the the terrifying randomness of it. So you say actually. This is good you're riding on the back of a tiger and you're. Like actually this is fun. I completely control this operation because who wants to think that it's totally random but it is and that's why one of the big arguments of people who are Pro cancel culture. Whatever that means is they'll say first. It's good. The people are held to account but also it no one's ever been cancelled which are contradictory because if no if it doesn't hold people to account. What's the point you know anyone who's emphasizing and a lot of people do this how no one's ever really cancelled well. Then it's a waste of time and you should stop doing it. But you can't stop doing it because you didn't start it's just happening so.

That's why a question that on its face is beside the point becomes central because it's the only question you can answer even though it doesn't connect to the actual phenomenon but everybody wants to believe that there's someone directing this thing. There's someone behind the curtain and there isn't that's what's real terrifying truth and so people say well. What do I do that. And I think it's you try to disengage. I simply broken  record on this but at the end of the day there's only a few tenants that I'm trying to follow and everything else kind of spools around them like cotton. Candy coming out for that out of the machine and one of them is love the  off because your your your. At the end of the day. All the arguments you're doing about castle culture both in your head and online.


It's as useful as the people arguing about what date JFK jr. Is going to emerge from the middle of the. Because it's all compensatory cope for the fact that the world is going down the  drain and there are no countervailing institutions to stop it. I just dropped like 200 list viewers in like two minutes man do people get us was that to real or to insane. Somebody says these streams are theological. I agree I agree they are but I am NOT claiming that they have political value.

This is just this is a commentary on a situation happening. I know that it seems like a huge cop-out and it kind of is but at the same time it's rhetorically necessary because how else do I position myself between the phenomena and the need to discuss the phenomena especially given the fact that it's all in the same medium. I think like for me it comes down to Twitter is for having fun with your friends and whenever I see a post by someone that isn't having fun with your friends or we're having fun with your friends has turned into controlling who your friends are then you're not using it correctly and if that leaves you if that leaves you politically sorted and feeling like oh I feel. I feel like I'm not doing enough about all the things out there and that means you need to find something in your immediate vicinity that has political meaning to you. And I can't tell you that because I'm not you and I'm not in your position and that is where the unit. Because there are universal principles but then there are particular principles and I can only speak to Universal ones because particular realities are individual and aren't defined by the material circumstances which I don't have access to information about I mean you get the Twitter and Internet as information.

Carrying device is what people always come back to when you say. It's actually good right. They say I find out about so many actions and stuff on Twitter and if that was ever ex trickable that would be true but you cannot pull that part of it out and say it's good because all of the good implicit in it is an information transferring thing our marble with the bat and then so you will still have to balance. The two you can never pull the good out separately and I think I think the balance is too bad. That's me. I don't think it's something you could prove one way or the other. I'm just saying where am I my instincts say no and I I mean last. I said I don't even know I'm not an Internet guy really hilariously. I don't even know how to stream move. I don't know how to  pirate movies. I've never done. It successfully see if there is no way to power to influence the world. No there is there is it just isn't online and if that is - and here's the thing on first glance that looks like an unbridgeable gap because the world around us feels so vast and unsuitable compared to the frictionless realm online. But I'm telling you people. I swear to god if you don't give yourself the out of online if you close the door behind you.

If you burn your ships like Cortez in Mexico and you insist yourself upon moving forward. Then you will get there and that's where the grill pill thing comes in like somebody was talking what's apparently there's an urban dictionary definition of grill pill that says like logging off from politics and not caring and indulging in bushwa vacations. It's not it but it's processed like that by people for whom non political non-political or a non online unmediated political identity is inconceivable and so it's like they can't see it like not truly but kind of racist Lee and and I guess. It's. It's like urban legend. At this point the thing with the Indians who couldn't see that see the ships coming in like they couldn't see scorsese ships because they couldn't process them like that's not true. But I think for a lot of online people. The equivalent is true and that they have instant they've already in their head ruled out political action off of wine and so when you say log off and do something else. Their mind immediately fails in the gap and says oh you mean stop caring about politics. No I mean force yourself to keep looking around you until you hit something don't give up and and convince yourself actually online is more effective I'm reaching more people.

This is more value ah man I would love to go on Rogan. We tried to get Felix on Rogan a while ago and I still think Felix would do great on Rogan because they have the mm mm mm. A thing in common but now I think I would like to go to. I think we could. I think we could have a I think me and Joe could have a profitable discussion around egodeath like start from there then kind of like move out work. I think I think everyone would be good at Rogen. But I just think that a Felix certainly has the best the best cultural affinity with Rogen. A lot of inside jokes that they could make that I would have no idea about thank you that I trim this myself today yeah. This is every four months I go from polygamist compound. Guy I trim it down to associate professor of Kanye studies at Evergreen State or whatever I would love to see Virgil on Opie and Anthony or they're not at scishow anymore I've experienced ego deaths. I definitely have there's no question ah that's interesting question.

Someone asked about the assertion that marks that mark says a lot as a limited view of dialectics to Hegel because Marx believed that contradictions would be completely over come by communism and it would end contradiction sort of almost like a millennia. A what millennia way. Whereas Hegel would say it would communism would have its own contradictions. I do think communism would have its own contradictions. But I feel like they would in the end resolve towards something I can't even really picture but it would be universal enlightenment. I guess I would call it a moment whereby every human consciousness is simultaneously attuned to full awareness of their of its cosmic unity. An actual literal communion of the human race collective and simultaneous. So I think I don't know I don't know if that cuz there's kind of a technicality because I think you could argue like for Marx. He didn't think that far ahead maybe but because he couldn't he didn't have maybe the imagination to imagine what truly like a Kim Stanley Robinson style universe expanding human Empire operated along like a centrally planned communistic economic model would look like and I think the end point of that. I mean our contradictions resolving towards spiritual simultaneous spiritual ascension and at that point you've you've transcended space and time. So there's no more next. There's no more linearity. There's no more and the ban and it would be. These it would be a spiritual version of the of the universal paradise that Marx envisioned at the end of communism and you could argue there would be the next step from that earthly paradise yeah. See that's the thing like the limitations of March. Someone says marks didn't have quantum theory you know marks didn't have relativity so there are holes like there are limits to his ability to like fill an entire cosmology with his limited human perception of the world around it and like that if you want to talk to postmarks like that's that's where you integrate other thinking into Marxism by adding that element and it really it just makes everything it helps everything click into a larger understanding and you realize that individual terms like Marxism or Buddhism or dialectical materialism are insufficient because there's so much other stuff grafted onto them that it's a ship of theseus problem. Eventually you have a new thing but there's no word for it. But it is. It is a synthesis synthesis of things that are true at different times and places and at different levels of abstraction that stick together and you snap. If you snapped dialectic materialism. It's Marx understood it onto modern conceptions of astrophysics and and quantum mechanics. I don't want to get too wild here and I sure as  don't want to bring out the white board again.


I know that that was a mistake from the very early days of the streams but let me just say. It's a very profitable line of inquiry. I'm so glad. They have the microphone. This is great. This is a great I got to stand now and I got the microphone. This is God I'm trying not to ever become a youtube guy. But I'm slowly getting all of the appearances of a YouTube guy. No I'm not gonna bring back. The whiteboard come on. I don't want to scare off newbies and I want somebody who's tried to log into their first stream and see me slamming at a whiteboard like Glenn Beck. I don't think it would go well yeah that's the thing twitch is better than you - but my stuff ends up on YouTube anyway and I think more people watch it there. So I wasn't that does that technically make me a YouTube guy oh boy oh boy.

I consider myself a podcaster first and foremost. That is my that is my. If I if this if we had medieval mate naming conventions and I had a large brood they would be called the podcasts for the podcasters. The Matthew podcaster would be my last name and then I would hand my my podcasting shop down to my son. Matthias Corvinus. Podcaster I guess poster two but I never really thought but posting a sort of a it's. It's. It's a it's a subsidiary. Like a lawyer is a lawyer even if they don't ever go into a lot into court. Even if they mostly drop briefs and stuff you wouldn't call them technically a writer right you call them. A lawyer writer isn't like a subsidiary skillset. I think posting is like a base skillset that you can build a profession on to build a artisanal confession on a profession on to me and my guild of podcasters hanging out in the beer hall getting into drunken fights with the Goldsmith's waiting outside for the Cooper's to come out and kicking them all in the pantaloons ooh  him.

Right obviously. I got a I got a Mary Neru for the jackets very very cool and I mean I guess I gotta kill a Mamba call me the Belgians cuz I gotta kill the mama just cuz you know his his record is free. It's a it's a lot of he's like Len Bias Lumumba sort of like the Len Bias of left-wing revolutionary leaders that he had maybe a little more potential and then he didn't really ever get to see it mostly spent that time kind of like frantically negotiating trying to negotiate his way around the Katanga crisis not really elegantly and that's not his fault obviously but and he was probably had no way of winning against the combined might of the old European powers and the new American hegemon. But I don't know he didn't. He never fulfilled his potential. Let's say that Chrisman I had less Thompson gotta erawan is totally lit erawan. It's like if Trump I don't know I sort of like Trump and George W Bush had a baby because he has george w bush's cheap piety as a big political prop way more than trump does. Even though evangelicals love him. He doesn't really speak that language culturally only sort of with a great degree of backhanded condescension people love.

This stuff don't you look at your. Bible look at your little Bible. You love it. Everyone takes it seriously so they're gonna  turn the Hagia Sophia into a goddamn mosque again. Apparently one of the greatest tourist attractions in the world this gorgeous Byzantine Cathedral with all these amazing mosaic frescoes of the weird creepy adult looking Byzantine jesus' that they used to have in all their art. I'd have to cover all that  up because he can't have any images in a mosque and then you won't be able to like go up into the middle of the top part and suck and it's like why would you even do that. It's it's the way. It's what our W Bush would be doing right now if he was good operating under similar economic conditions like if the culture was still in its 2004 era like 50/50 combo because now it's like 60/40. Now. They've lost the culture war and that's why they don't fight that terrain anymore 2004 it was like 50/50 and you could counter mobilize and and use it to win and that's what they did in 2004. If those those cultural conditions had coincided with a deeper crisis in the economy Bush would have done the kind of  that aired Awad is doing but for Christians so there you go and that makes sense because everyone spans.


The time period he combines both those guys in one cuz. He is one guy who's been there the whole time. I don't think there is gonna be an upcoming baseball season. I don't think they're gonna do it. I think a lot of this stuff is all gonna end up falling apart. A lot of these assumes the openings you're gonna kind of collapse.

We're not gonna have a big return to a lockout. But it's just gonna be staggered and uncoordinated and and chaotic and all and all that will happen is. We will socially inure ourselves to more death than so and personal risk of bodily harm. Every time we left the house and more death of our family members and more just the social cost of knowing that human life work is less than we thought it was worse and that's why I think people are saying that like these stories about high higher crime rates since the black lives matter protest started are the cops lying to try to make it scary for people that's probably true. But I think people need to get ready for the reality that crime is gonna. Go up crime is absolutely gonna go up in the near future because we're talking about a prolonged I'm Laura fiying economic crisis on top of which you have a institutional legitimacy crisis which makes people less likely to respect the law in the first place oh and then that time of that well. I lost my train of thought goddamn. It you'll have the the material crisis of the collapse. You'll have the institutional crisis of nobody believing in any authority that they don't decide to believe in there's one more. But I can't remember it. But anyway I'm gonna go up. That's what I meant to say crime is gonna go up and people need to get ready for that because it's just a sign that society is  falling apart. We have to acknowledge that there's going to be costs to further economic immiseration. If there wasn't then why was it bad. It's bad because it have bad social impact. But I think part of it is gonna be on top of all. Those other things I said life is just gonna feel cheaper because we're making it cheaper that has a psychic cost and yeah.

The answer to that would be a war. Somebody says why can't. We do a war well that would work except who do we realistically fight. We don't even I don't think we have the capacity right. Now. I think anything too small would be beside the point because we're already at war everywhere. Any kind of medium sized intervention isn't going to move the needle either economically or culturally because we're already a war everywhere. It'll have to be big but who are the places we could credibly have a big war with that would not potentially kick our asses. Ron is always the number one but Iran I think everyone at the top who isn't completely delusional knows would kick her ass. They'd kick her ass anymore and the thing is even if we were able to hold the place any war where we had with anybody sub. China sighs it's going to be a war of endless occupation like Iraq which we hated and didn't win and we'll know that in Afghanistan it's it's just oh we're gonna have another one of those and that doesn't solve your problem. What solves your problem is an Iraq war one knockout punch but that's nothing that you could do that would have that effect Namie a political potential military engagement that could have the effect of a Gulf War One style national revulsion Venezuela yeah that would go well yeah millions of loyal shav ista people in the throughout in the in the vast majority of working-class areas all throughout the the dense urban areas and internal  jungle canopy that have held rebel or armies for generations that's just South American Vietnam.

No there's not Iran. That's a wrap that's Iraq too but worse and higher casualties because Iran is a much bigger country with a much bigger military than Iran was and a more social support for the government. Like a rock at the end of the day was a classic dictatorship where the thing that held it together was force. There was very little social adherence to baathism as such or Saddam as a person Iran is different. There's social investment at the grassroots in that system that will  fight look what they did to her Iraq so you're guaranteed something worse than Iraq. So you got Vietnam to in Venezuela. You've got a rock to only worse in like. It's like tea to like more higher stakes higher higher budget more explosions more death.

Although there were more dead in the first trend terminator so and then of course China's off the  it that we are interred. We are totally interdependent economies at this point. That's why I say if everything doesn't fall apart global capitalism if it continues will be under the auspices of some sort of joint sino. American Union so ya know China. It's either a war that neither one of us would win because it would destroy the economy of the other that we depend on either for stuff or to buy stuff which doesn't work it'll be some sort of hostile or either hostile corporate takeover or a mutual merger and it'll be whose conditions on whose side who's negotiating it is gonna what it's gonna come down to but that's pretty far in the future and I mean that's why I'm just saying is that China war is impossible. Basically. I think China was impossible Russia war. I think China honestly wouldn't allow it maybe but even if they did.

What's the percentage. They're like how would you do that especially since they have nukes and they have a lot of them. There more than us the nukes are real. It see it's all brushfire. Wars. It's all going to be brushfire. Wars again until we take everything to space and then have space Wars or we do like an robot. Jack's and all war is replaced by countries putting their money together to create giant mech suits that fight fist fight and then the winner. They win the dispute and honestly. I think we should do that Mexico would be terrible Mexico. We already we've invaded Mexico before we and it was incredibly frustrating. I think it would only be more so so yeah. I gotta say it's all headaches. It's all headaches there's no there's no knockout punches.


There's just downside and and and one of the things. One of the few real blessings of Trump is that he's hardwired with only two or three sort of big gazel. Instinctual political ideas that he just flails against the reality with. He has nothing more complicated than that and one of them is that you don't want to lose a war because he saw it happen with Bush and so we're like one of the two or three actual signal understandings of politics. He has like they're like down power lines skittering across the road that sometimes connect with something one of them is don't lose a war. Now there is no war on the agenda that looks winnable which is why he has been resistant to the Bolton's call for some sort of global war conflict.

I mean wouldn't all right. I'm trying to think of what a Russian war would even look like like going to Ukraine send sending actual armed aid to the Ukrainian government. If that happened would there be like proud boys and  who would join like the three percenters and stuff would they go over there like the blue legion from spain during World War two why not Barbarossa because there's already the Nazis in Ukraine. There's you know the as all guys so then you could hit like a union to come together or they could go to Russia grab that oil turn it all into an oil theme park and then you could have all of the lefties who want to fight or itch in. For battle. They could go and join the Russian army and then they could pretend that they were the  like joining the Bolsheviks during the Civil War and they're fighting like the whites and everyone could have fun pretending that they were fighting out American politics in a foreign country because they can't have any influence on them here because there's no actual social influence on the political process on any meaningful questions at this point. So everyone is just working out their  at the virtual level oh man if we could get a naval war going if we if we laying in the Bering Strait old-fashioned Jew russo-japanese war style broadside somebody crossing the T that'd be fun. Get C stack out there get him out of retirement revving him up to Admiral like to a full Admiral or bird admiral or whatever they call it Archduke Admiral Admiral crunch.

What's the top Admiral Rear Admiral obviously has to be the least Admiral right because it's in the rear. Commodore is that one of them whatever war with the Saudis that's cute that would never happen there. There's we're essentially part of the same refused at like the economic and even political level. There's a fusion has happened between Saudi Arabia and Israel and the United States where you can't even really call them separate. They have independent interests that are sometimes in conflict but they're almost always rendered subsidiary to the greater unanimity of interests and looks like the Saudis buying our our weapons so much is as anyone who saw network now is when Ned Beatty talks about the Saudi purchase of the the company they work for he goes. The Saudis have took billions of dollars out of this country and now they must bring it back because Evan flow tidal gravity and that's true we put a we're dumping  weapons and sending them back to us the modern-day triangle trade at the financial level. Yemen is just Iraq too but even less even more worthless because you don't even have any kind of real dramatic escalation.

It would just be more the same yeah. No I think I agree with people who say that external war is less likely than some sort of internal conflict because right now Americans are really really focused on hating each other to a point where I don't think any foreign enemy would have a unifying enough effect the way that they brought the Civil War halves of America together by the spanish-american war. I don't think there's anything they could do that now and the only thing that's gonna satisfy. It is a genuine conflict at Jenni and it's gonna happen. I think a Biden cut I in my opinion Biden winning and presiding as a Grover Cleveland style hunger Chancellor style. President ineffectual Hoover asked president of a second Great Depression. You're gonna. See regional movements of resistance to Washington. Oh all the horror of this prolonged political up. This palanca knee being explained by that Demiurge by saying America is still great. It has been captured by an evil wizard an evil spirit the Demiurge.

The george sora whoever you want to call a Biden Obama whatever you wanted. Personify him is and then your governor is now the real president and I'm not talking that I'm not saying that sense is really going to come to a head. I'm going to say that there got absolutely going to be politicians who are going to be psychotic and/or ambitious enough to see the play and cultivate it to the point of actually declaring some sort of conflict with America probably not but definitely to ride it to national prominence and to replace Trump as the next head head piece of America's social reaction. So I think you'd see more lone wolf political attacks from people like assassination attempts. Shootings of Democratic Democratic campaign offices or symbols of the regime help maybe TV movie movie theaters that are showing pedo films or something and then you're definitely going to see some sort of state-based resistance. Neo Amy own Elif ocation movement and there's gonna be somebody trying to get to be next president as being the calhoune of that movement.

But that kind of brinksmanship can go beyond your ability to control it and you might end up getting conflict that you didn't mean you just wanted to escalate things to your political advantage within the American system and in so doing you accidentally broke it. But then even if it's broken hey you get the bigger half you win like rather than reign in Hell than serve in heaven rather than to be the Grand Chancellor of the great American Cheesecake Factory Republic that being governor of Georgia in the lame old United States especially as America collapses into the ineffectual torpor in the face of persistent economic stagnation and public health catastrophe. But I'm not saying that's going to happen or anything of that is that because there can always be intervening events I might not even win and then all but all bets are off. It might not be by that could change things a little bit depending he could die at any point my god. He's a million years old and now it looks like everyone's gonna end up getting covered although it still hasn't killed any overtly evil people yet I must say molten arrow has had it seven times and so kind of thing that we can make you believe like maybe you do live in a demo today be. There is an evil interceding force that's pretending you from ascending because my god this horrible disease wrapping it through the world and it's all the consequence of our most feckless and sociopathic leaders and all of them are protected in a righteous cocoon from vengeance the Vengeance of the earth from the mask of the Red Death. It's like if the mask of the Red Death happened and the only people who died were in the servants quarters and in the little town filled with peasants at the end of the moat and everybody who was all in their finery up in the and the ballroom got to just dance forever that's what they've created. Now. That's why it's hard not sometimes not to feel. Like maybe. There is a Demiurge who's got a Dem I urge to merge and to reward all human evil whenever they see it alright guys.


I think this is good. I'm gonna do more of these now that I have music or I'm sorry a microphone that actually works because it's been really frustrating. Not knowing that people can hear me so now that I feel more confident. There'll be more of these including I'm hoping soon to do another guerrilla stream that looks like it's gonna rain all week. So I might not be able to do it this week but well there's a nice sunny day. I might bust a grille out and I don't know put some dogs on or something alright bye.
