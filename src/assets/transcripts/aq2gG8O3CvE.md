That ain't nothing but 10 cent loving hey little thing. Let me let you kinda cause I wanna know. I'm sure the handyman gets around. I can't live why. I'm a man on your scene how but you got to go home with me all right. I just sent submitted the thing that sends it out so the tweet to tweet ah ah howdy y'all back in this room back in the cube. I like to think that this is my my new posting cube my winter posting cube and we love it folks. Don't we we love to have the show man. I miss him already. I didn't think. I would. I thought. I would be sick of it. But it's just so weird. I was gone and now he says oh. I got the office of the ex-president and I'm going to be doing this that but he's not out there he's not out there.

The wind crawls maria so I wanted to talk today start today talking kind of expanding on the implications of what I've been talking about with regards to the real base of the like. Insurrectionary right in this country your not just the capital stormers but the entire swath of america that they represent electorally but more importantly culturally and the thing about it is. A lot of confusion ends up stacking up around this stuff because the object of this revolt is so clearly now not really. I mean yes. It is racist that it is right misogynist and patriarchal and all that stuff. But the target of its ire really is not just the cultural structure that creates those things that they don't like but genuinely the economic structure. That's tied to those because there is this is a conflict between a a a um national regional small bourgeois who are both who are feeling culturally attacked but are in fact in actual point of fact behind their back because they're a bunch of dumb asses and they're as lumpinized as the rest of us and lobotomized as the rest of us by the experience of living in like the in post-material america where we don't make anything.

We don't have we we we just consume and consumption is how we view all of our lives and so all of our politics and gets and the way we stack ourselves goes along that which means we're only responding to cultural stimuli. They're revolting against that that's what they think they're revolting at but the thing that's actually prodding them towards extremism not their opinions. They are reactionary people but the extremism with which they hold them not just voting for republicans but going to places with guns to protest and then and if enough of them coming to washington d.c and just generally denying the result of an election which is this and I mean the libs obviously are using it to their advantage and they're all hysterical. But we have crossed the rubicon here in terms of the way that our two-party system post-civil war has coalesced around questions of exchange of power that's true and has to be addressed and the thing that's driving that is not the opinions. They're the same opinions people held in the 60s in the 70s under reagan and newt gingrich. It's the same set of reactionary views driven by the same local local culture of you know small holder hierarchy you know a hierarchy of race and gender and then within that whose family you're with are. You are you at the top do.

You have the the the license to the fracking well or you know do you have the franchise for all of the arby's on the west side. Whatever like land-based thing you have that is fixed and is not a free flow of capital that can go one way or the other. The way that finance capital on the coast is that fixed asset creates a culture around it okay and it's and within that culture. Politics is understood as this cultural war because the the assumed basis of capitalism that's driving everything is taken for granted that can't be challenged because it's been good for everybody i.e. The people at the top who then create a culture around themselves that justifies all of their power that uses things like racism and and and gender anxiety. To maintain those structures. It is stabilizing of the local conception of capitalism there. But now we have this this ever accelerating global capitalism. This totally unfixed finance capitalism that has replaced productive economies in the west and most specifically in the united states and it has a culture around itself that by definition cannot use a lot of those old structures because they make it harder to create a marketplace for transactions to occur because the thing about that local regime of power is that it has to exclude it has it's but defined by what it excludes and for global capitalism the culture of global capitalism. The technologically driven culture of global capitalism and media that those things have to dissolve in order to create an actual comprehensive market so that you can sell to everybody not just part of a certain you know chosen racial grouping that has like the cult that deserves the ability to consume because of virtues that are inherent to either their gender or their race. No we have to create a new model so that everybody is is a citizen as in a consumer and there is a conflict there and it and that is the conflict that is understood as like the cultural war against regular americans or whatever. But what's driving that is the real material conflict between these small holders maintaining their exalted economic position and the pressure of global capitalism to strip them of their assets as we push towards total monopoly. That's the engine that's driving this whole train is monopoly and it it means that it's coming for everyone's assets first. It came for the small amount that has held together that was cobbled together by the moment in the sun that the that the working middle class was able to put out. There you know just homes and home investments and maybe some stock that all got wiped out over the course of the last 40 years. But they're still held these physical assets and those gotta go too and that's a real conflict. But that's not what we have a politics about.

We have a politics that is this spectacle of cultural grievance because we have lost class consciousness and what that means is that there are going to be tons of actual working-class people who support this counter-reaction. This reactionary battle against global capital like globalization and and they because they are declassified as americans because they do not live class. They're examining the changing culture through the lens of where they're where they are their physical environment. The actual culture the rural fixed culture or rural or observant fixed culture that they reside in and they see this as an attack and even though it has nothing to do with their material interests. It's the material interests of their bosses who have the same basic premise of totally wage destroying or totally abjecting the working class. Over time. The only difference is in my model of local hegemony. I get to stay on top and I don't have to worry about being proletarianized. The same way that the middle class has become the same way that the pmc is becoming. It can't it's going to come for me and I want to prevent that and that's the fight and it's going to list a ton of working-class people because they're responding to a cultural conflict. That is the language we process politics with and that's the actual conflict happening here driven by a material conflict between regional and global finance capital and expressed culturally and 

I think one thing that doesn't get pointed out enough is that that con that dynamic is the dominant political dynamic in every country right now in people want to talk about the big strike in india. The the the farmers strike against neo-liberalization transfer of the economy because like modi is like the neoliberal if there is such a thing as a neoliberal fascist. It's modi. He uses hindutva nationalism to propel an agenda of hyper neoliberalization of the economy and that means they're getting rid of the subsidies for a bunch of farmers in in some states in india near punjab and around there and it's a and it's led to this long strike and revolt by these farmers and so that looks like the same way a lot of the anti-establishment politics on the right in america looks like traditional working-class mobilization against capitalism. That's it looks like that a strike by farmers but you got to remember that within the context of these states and the these farmers are the local landowners. They are the landlords and they get their money out of the land by leveraging state subsidy like free electricity and water and stuff in exchange and then the hyper-exploited labor of the landless classes many of whom from poorer states and other parts of india who are brought in as essentially slave labor reproducing the old feudal system that existed before the raj and their revolt against neoliberalism. It's it is a popular revolt and it is on behalf of some version of the people but those are people who within a regional network of power are on top that is true in brexit the brexit vote and the whole politics of that in britain.

It's the exact same thing. It is a revolt of regional power against london against against london and now not even london. It's basically it actually no yeah look because london was always such a load start. Like there it doesn't have the same like regional diversity like london was always london since the beginning of capitalism but it becoming brussels or hum frankfurt that was not acceptable. That's the fight it's regional versus in the context of the eu. global like hamburg represents you know our neoliberal consensus the same way the democratic party and like the bipartisan consensus in them in our politics does. But it's on behalf of regional power not on behalf of workers. Workers might agree with it because they're expressing things through the cultural lens that they have emerged out of and it's true on continental europe.

Orbit and all of the all of the neo-fascists who are who are now creating these regimes of resistance poland. This is and and the thing that makes this so difficult to parse and the reason that there's so much conflict about what to do how to respond to this how to respond to these people like should we is it is it wrong to try to appeal to them is that acceding to white supremacy or something you know like are. They fascist is that is that and what does that mean and like is it working class or are they the pmc or is the pmc class of itself. All of these really distracting and incredibly innervating questions emerge from this category error because you have a actual expression of of class wide resistance to neoliberalism being fully articulated and globalized and the fact that that is going to and that the the cultural shape of that response is going to come from everyone who is being threatened by this. But the people who are going to be threatened by this will express their alienation in the same way generally as the people around them and so that means even though you have like the working-class people of these exurban and rural areas are responding to real material. threat the fact that like the working class has been destroyed the fact that like that the ones who even did get a college education but didn't go to the big city and tried to stay home that even theirs are getting squeezed and that the employees of a lot of these small firms who do not feel that alienated from their bosses who because of other relationships like maybe racial or something but like just cultural affinity being a bond that like overcomes their felt sense of alienation because remember they don't. They don't express it to themselves in the top terms of class conflict.

The idea that their labor is being alienated does not occur to them that the whole idea that that there that there is a fundamental violation in the very fact of the wage system. They do not accept that because where would they have heard that where would that have come to them and if they did feel that in the moment and they tried to express that what likely surrounding vocabulary is most probably going to fill the hole and shape their idea of what's happening to them. It all gets recuperated at the superstructure. All that alienation gets recuperated at the superstructure but it expresses itself in a way that's identical to people who are just these regional barons who want to maintain their fiefdoms and so that means what to do instead of being a question of how do we draw the line for people between capitalists and everybody else and away from all these other absolutely distracting and counterproductive axis that all serve to confuse the line of battle and to subvert.

The most important thing that a nascent left a non-existent left has to do which is this divide the people and orient towards them and that hasn't begun yet the sorting. The sorting has to come before you can create the thing because remember there's no army. Here there's no real left. It has to be built and the first step of building is identifying a a population and we're not even there yet and all of this argumentation. This and all this all these anxiety riddle counter arguments that are all about preening about one's own moral superiority. You're either showing everybody that you don't give in to that neoliberal. Over everybody else and I get that or you're demonstrating that I'm not like those knuckle draggers. I understand what it means to be white and I understand that to be a good person. I have to feel bad about it and I have to express that felt that felt badness and I'm that's all you're doing. But but the I think honest and good faith.

 dilemma that powers all of this bad faith argumentation is that confusion because this battle that is now waging across the world. This local baronial revolt against the boot. The the the the hyper normalizing hyper rationalizing homogen homagifying push of globalization is god damn. It I forgot where I was going oh that that that's the sum total of politics right now and and the and the working class is only incidentally involved. The working class is participating to some degree but because on the terms of the fake politics on the terms of the spectacle or are disengaged because they've made a rational choice and a rational analysis of the situation said oh politics is fake and there's no reason for me to care about it. They understand that and so they are not participating or if they are. They're participating on the terms of this baronial conflict which means they are operating not on their own behalf but on the behalf of one or the other side's ruling elite. So this is the conflict. This is the fundamental category error we have and and because it's trapped in this box.

There's no arguing your way out of it. The lines are set and cannot be moved and as politics progresses. It accelerates and as conflict progresses and accelerates the the the urgency to pick a side of these arguments because they will be more and more relevant over time as politics gets more extreme in response to continuingly accelerating crisis. The terms are going to get so the stakes are going to get so high democracy. The white supremacy you know the end of the anthropocene that your ability to break out of it is going to be impossible. You're going to be absolutely pot committed to one another side of this of this war between the king and the and the barons basically and that's why the only thing that might break. This is for a orthogonal politics of explicit class res class alienation that generates a counter culture of its own that is immune to these discussions and distinctions and to organizing around these distinctions and shatters through them. I've described this before but that really is it and as I've said before also the thing that it reminds me.

Most of is the haitian revolution how you and I said this on a previous stream. shout out again to my friend. Everett's age of napoleon podcast which is talking about it now and of course mike. Duncan had a really great series on it. In the revolutions podcast. He does but the politics of haiti on the precipice of the slave uprising after the revolution in france had kicked off a period of of political ferment there on the island.

 the politics of that I would say in the court not even over the before the revolution and then also once the revolution started but before it had like become a real before it had coalesced into a real threat to power because after the initial wave of revolts and plantation burnings and and violence the cities were still held by the french and they were able to mount expeditions into the countryside to try to reclaim them and there was a period there where it was sort of stalemated and that was the period when the french representative on mission. the jacobin sultanox emerged to coordinate the french revolutionary government response to the the violence. the politics of the island were you had the one the party of the whites. The big and small whites the regional local authority both motivated by a mixture of cultural and real interest conflict with france the cultural conflict with france after the revolution and after there was a movement in the revolutionary government to acknowledge at least colored people um as they were known as as citizens that was repulsive to the big whites as they were called because they were interested in the dominance of their government because then they could set their prices. They didn't have to stick into the merchant tile system that meant they could only trade with the french metropole.

They could get the best price on the open market. Essentially the same motivation of our patriots our sons of liberty in the american revolution which was to break the trade monopoly with the british and the revolution was their mechanism in the same way the big whites. This this racial discontent by the small whites which was powered by their resentment of the fact that even though they were they were on the island to make their lives. They did not have land they they worked jobs in as clerks. overseers the things that the things that the the kind of stuff that is alienating labor and that the big whites pay up either p paid them to do and compelled the blacks to do and the difference was color. It was literally the the wage as as dubois dubois called it. The the the skin wage was the fact that they had to pay them and that they could have their freedom and that they weren't compelled laborers but that tension between those two groups is exactly what generates political anxiety and the kind of reactionary sentiment. We see with the mega revolution as it's echoed at all.

These other places too especially all throughout europe um and whatever their even though that they they had a class conflict that underlied both. It was concealed by this racial solidarity. They were opposed by the the freed colored haitians who were because in french slavery the close custom the culture around inter intersexual intersexual interracial relationships was different so than it was like in north america. Like in the colonies you could of course sexually take advantage of your slaves and you have produced children but they were slaves in haiti. The culture was different you many of the um. Many of the plantation owners took slave wives and they generally and almost as a matter of course acknowledge their children by slaves as legitimate which meant they were heirs to land so that means that you would buy. The revolution created a good segment of land owning and and then you know associated you know cultural institutions like lawyers and stuff free collar cult population. This is very similar to how the democratic party is now the party largely of people who since the 60s have been allowed into government and what legitimized the political conflict and and generated. It was the fact that the revolution in france in order to carry out the principles of liberty that they were trying to impose was moving towards equalization of citizenship between races which led to this conflict in haiti and then after the rebel and then after 

I believe after the king is killed who should the they actually get a new french military invasion from oh. This is after the I'm sorry so in the middle of this conflict between these two the which is being of course observed by the slaves. At every moment um. There is a slave uprising an orthogonal political movement to break up this conflict because the thing these two conflicting sides have in common is that they both believe. Slavery is the only economic system and that they will defend it completely and that it is inviable and so in the and then when this revolution happens. The french send. The french revolutionary government sends a representative on mission commanding french troops. Santa knox.

His name was and he set about imposing revolutionary french virtue on the colony by backing up the free color party against the big whites going to war against the big whites but of course not for Authorizing this the freeing of slaves and so you've got the government like having to choose between these two sides choosing what the side that they think has a deeper. is more suited to the moment because you've got so many white people and so few black people on haiti that over time that that you have to have a stabilizing like influence and the way to stabilize. It is to increase the pool of people who are exempt from slavery and therefore can contribute to the economy and will have their vested interest in keeping slavery imposed and keeping slaves down being slaves exploited and um and that means that in the broader interest of the french colonial economic system recognizing free colored citizenship is in the best interest of the economy but the local interests of the of the local rulers of haiti. It is against both because it undermines their relationships with the small whites and more importantly it subordinates their economic interests to the revolutionary french government which could mean having their property confiscated or at the very least they will be prevented from freighting with the british or anybody else obviously and so the revolutionary french government backed the free colors against the whites and they probably would have won but then what happened the off and that if there's hope as george orwell said it will come from the pros in the exact same way in all these other countries and hopefully at some point organizing to bring themselves together and coordinate their actions between themselves a un mystify class conscious counterculture emerging from a organization of people at their paces of business or places of work. Places of exploitation will generate the momentum to come in from the edge of this battle and because the two are at war break. This prize now what shape that will take I of course cannot say that would be absurd but then general contours. That's what you have to put your money on and what the practical implication of that is is once again. I'm a broken record log off at least log off to these arguments. Because none of them refer to the matter at hand. They refer to this phantom war between the barons and the king and yes someone's asking about haiti's very bad situation which obviously a lot of people have pointed to to say look.

This is what happens when you let the proles take over they can't do it being in charge. Even if it is not racially mandated or even like morally mandated is pragmatically mandated by the fact that people on top have the understanding of the mechanisms of power sufficient to master their environment and that it's not that it doesn't even have to be a moral question. You can't even say it's because they're better people. They're more refined that might be the justification you use. The practical matter is that they built the machine. They know how it runs and if the people who are outside of it and by definition because they're outside of it they have not been really initiated into it. The people really initiated to it are always going to be a very small sliver of any effective and I mean you'll get a little bit of the middle class but if they're never if they're the vanguard if they take over. Then they will reproduce the exploitative relationship because they have to stay on top until you equalize labor. You cannot get rid of hierarchy in that of that and that and the separation of classes so they say that that's that's tha that's the evidence. That's that's why you can't and that's why revolution is never to be sought and it must always be avoided 

But the answer is haiti was in and the true and and and I would say that the case in almost every counter. Every example that is used in this way is that every the reason that the the record of revolutionary governments is poor in general in terms of like quality of life and stuff and political freedom which is a thing I'm sorry. I know people love to jerk off to the idea of gulags but you do need to have some freedom of expression culturally you do have to have if the like jack boots are bad whoever is wearing them because they're bad for your so your social structure. They turn you everyone into cynics they make. Ev impossible for anyone to really believe in the project and people have to believe in the project or else. It's just a skeleton of oppression that is might not be capitalist but it still cannot overcome capitalism. All of them had to be destroyed all of them had to be strangled in their crib and the ones that couldn't be had to be at every moment that there existed opposed by capital and that pressure deformed them and and in the case of haiti. It's not just that they were immediately ostracized and in fact de facto embargoed by the united states which didn't recognize haiti as an independent country until the civil war. that was that'd be one thing the french extracted billions and billions of dollars over the decades in compensation for the property that they lost in the revolution that is an incomplete revolution by definition as all of them have been and that is why the moment the real spindle point the turning wheel of the dark tower. The level of the dark tower we're on the the floor that we're on at the dark tower the one where our fate is sealed.

Maybe is 1918-1922 because they would never admitted it later because they didn't want to look wrong but none of the bolsheviks. None of the ones who actually made november 1918 happen and it was a small handful of people and this is why vanguardists love to fetishize the postfix because getting numbers has always been the left's problem. Once the new deal kicks in on the west because you buy off the working class in huge numbers. It makes it your audience is smaller your. Discontented workers by definition is a smaller audience and so you have to fetishize the effectiveness and coordination of smaller p groups because that's all you really have and the example of and the re and you can't really blame them in some respect. Because we do have a historical example. It was a handful of guys. It has been stated before and I believe it completely that if the train the sealed train derails on the way from switzerland to the finland station and like lenin gets and that whole car full of people died there is no october revolution.

There is most likely some sort of cornulov-esque military pooched that initiates a um like an early fascism but like less mechanically advanced than the the german version and less expansionary than the expansionary than the german version because it starts from a lower level of economic. complexity like it was essentially a feudal country with a with a modern facade and then the 21st the 20th century just dropped in their lap at tannenberg and they had no way of dealing with that that's why they felt they they collapsed. That's why so few people could be so decisive but anyway you would have had some sort of military counter-evolution that would have included by definition because you would have had the he would have had to really put the boot down just like after 1905 like the black hundred times 100 which would have necessitated some systematized programming of the jewish population of the russian empire and trotsky said that and he's 100 correct on that. The man was a good historian which is why he was such a shitty leader because if you know how contingent this is and you know how many variables goes into it and you know how it's very hard to pick a side you need to be a little more but anyway none of them would have gone forward. None of them would have gotten in that room with them and like yelled it out with kaminev about whether to go forward with it having to like decide at the last minute to to rescind the endorsement of the july uprising because it just didn't feel like the moment was right They did all of that assuming that their first shot would be met with a european continent-wide revolution starting in germany. They 1 000 billion percent thought that they operated from that assumption that assumption undergirded everything else you can talk about tactical stuff.

You can talk about personalities but they're all shaped by that underlying fundamental belief and for a minute there it looked like it might actually. Happen there's the there's moments when like after the keel uprising of the sailors in in germany. When when lenin is is like this is this is gonna happen and then it didn't and then that might have been when the door got shut. I'm not saying it is.

I'm also I'm speculating on a hypothesis because if that succeeds if and the thing is is that the revolutionary potential in germany to succeed existed. I 100 believe that I believe that the the organizing capacity and motivation of the working class in germany relative to the power of the old ruling class in germany after world war. Ii was such the power balance was such that a properly organized german working class successfully overthrows not just the kaiser but german capitalism and that if that happens people would say well they would be instantly attacked by germany england and france yes they would have. But if that happens there is simultaneous working-class uprisings and general strike actions in france and germany or in england and it didn't happen. There's a million reasons and you could if you got enough of them. You might find the dark beating heart of history which is that everything is fully predetermined and that nothing has any alternative that we live in a world that is fixed on its rails and that only that only the illusion of projecting forward and the fantasy of looking backward through the glass darkly both ways gives us any delusion that we have any kind of alternative. But of course we don't know that so we have to operate from the assumption at all points that that's not true because that is what it is to live and therefore that is what it is to fight and to struggle and to move towards justice how about this alternative world how about the place where benjamin butler accepts.

Abraham lincoln's offer to be his vice president in 1865 in an 1864 election because butler had been a um he had been a doe faces doe face. Before the war you want to talk about like border state credentials which is why they had to put um the democrat johnson on the ticket butler. He was from massachusetts but he was as much a doe face as franklin pierce or any of those other voted for breckenridge in 1860 not even stephen douglas. He voted for the south's candidate that is how committed he was to sucking off the slave power to maintain his corrupt influence in the democratic party. So you want to get a guy on the ticket who reaches across the aisle. My god you couldn't do better than benjamin benny butler. So it's not like you have to worry about throwing away any advantage and it doesn't matter anyway. The war or lincoln's election was won by the army and that's why the democrats nominated. Mcclellan who even though he never won.

A battle was notoriously beloved by his soldiers because he made sure that they were well kept and taken care of of course because he didn't make them do anything um oh our casualty rates are so low because you're and by 1864 james mcpherson and others have said the motivation of the the troops in the field about why they were fighting had changed significantly since the beginning of the war. Now a lot of them. These aren't obviously a lot of the same guys because very few people who were serving at the beginning of the war were still serving at the end but the army was also much bigger by the end of the war.

 who in their letters home in 1861 are talking about keeping the union together the sacred union and our beloved constitution which we love by 1864. Certainly after the breakout of chattanooga and sherman just plunging his dagger into the heart of georgia and the actual encounter between union troops and the practical reality of slavery in the south which many of them had never even really thought of had only even encountered in popular amusements led them to believe that this was a fight to end slavery that it was a moral bat and it's you can say oh that's you know you want to justify why you're knee deep in your butt friend's blood yes. Exactly you have to consecrate you have to consecrate the sacrifice and the constitution wasn't cutting it by 1864 which means that the to finish the war on the terms of ending slavery for all of time they had been radicalized. John brown's mission was moving forward and then that cracker andrew johnson. So I'm saying butler gets it as the vp because they offered it to him.

That's a killing glow. They offered it to him and he turned him down just like henry clay turned down the vp spot from william henry harrison which honestly might have averted the civil war and allowed slavery to go out peacefully the way. Like ron paul thinks so although I don't know if that's actually true or not maybe probably not but man the chance for the wigs in the aftermath of the collapse of 1837 to govern from the idea of like the national model the american system of clay which because which was possible because they won all three branches. They had the house senate which the only time they did and they had this 16 year old. When he was like 98 disgusting sator derailed the entire thing and all we got was the democracy and its hegemonic westward expansion. Its march mad march towards oblivion to govern the politics. Until of course. It collapsed because it was not viable so anyway butler gets in and let's throw another little one.

In here. Let's say lincoln doesn't even get shot by booth. Maybe butler brings a bottle of whiskey over to the white house and they play cards with grant instead of going to the booth trips on his dick whatever and then you get a lincoln butler administration moving towards social equality not out of a desire to see it done but simply as a process of seeing the assertion of black rights. The assertion of black economic demands and social equality that flows from that seeing the way that that connects to this infrastructure of you know still committed troops and the growing migration of carpetbaggers literally like going to the countryside to remake the culture of the backwoods and of these places which had no public schooling because there was essentially no public um. There was no public um provision of education or infrastructure of any kind in the southern states. Because it was governed along. They were governed along jeffersonian model of minimal government. Maximal individual freedom which means the freedom mostly of existing economic stakeholders to hyper exploit and then sit on the money and buy golden had been dethroned under the auspices of a lincoln butler administration and then let's throw one. In here some pissed off cracker because there would be revolt there.

The war would kick back up is the thing the war would kick back up the guys who had turned in their fully enraged yankee leviathan headed by benjamin butler who had been radicalized by the war along racial lines. The same way that the troops had been was the was one of the first generals to to release and emancipate slaves on his own on his own authority when he encountered them and after the war became a radical republican and eventually a greenback pres candidate for president on a populist soft money platform of like taking the real implications. The social implications of the civil war which were if they'd been taken to their logical conclusion led to the exploration of all slave owning property redistribution of it to the multi-racial peasant class of the south and the destruction the necessary destruction of the constitutional order and the u.s. Constitution itself. Butler enthroned sumner stevens not likely didn't happen could have happened like. I said we might be unstuck on this level of the tower but the tower there's another tower where this happened and it's not that different it's different. But it's not that different and the question of how much of that is mere.

Chance really does stick in your brain but anyway so that country then emerges and then as conflict with capital which maybe has been tamed by this new emergent authority and and would have resisted this but would have been able to resist it only marginally because of how overwhelming the political unity of the The common american like you can't say working class at this point but you know the small holdings slash mechanic class. Their unification around this means that they would have to take it the same way they had to take the new deal like they had they didn't want the new deal. They had to take it same thing as this they would have had to take it. But that fight wouldn't have stopped and I'd say that like maybe you don't have an american revolution but maybe by world war. One you have a eugene debs-led socialist america in a constitutional order or in a like a parliamentary system and in that context the united states does not enter world war one and that doesn't stop the russian revolution but maybe it accelerates the german revolution or accelerates the french or english into revolt and then you have a revolution that starts in europe spreads across the continent. Now of course the question of the The colonies the self-expression of the colonies that's the wild card but that dynamic was arrested like that's best case scenario what I'm describing this is like the people who when the people were doing this stuff.

This is the stuff that they were hoping would happen. This is why they were sacrificing you know like you have to have a vision. You have to have an articulated vision that you can move towards and when enough people are moving towards it then it has to be plausible but anyway it's just. It's just a thought experiment. Obviously it just i. I think the only reason that I do this kind of thing is not because it's fun and it is. I'm a turtle dove dork the idea of like oh man imagine like it's the same but different like when he read that he wrote that book where it's like hey what if world war one had happened in america oh man. That's cool. I like that. It's just. I have that dorky enjoyment of the of just the the novelty of it. Like I like history.

What if it's like this ooh that's intriguing that's fun but also because by articulating what didn't happen in its fullness you can see where the real hinge points are where the spokes of the wheel show up where the light like where the aperture opens up and you can see some light and then that allows you to be able to recognize that when it emerges around you and to recognize the contours and recognize where the stakes are and where the stakeholders are and where the real power and where the real momentum and the real chance lies in any given moment ah anyway. Where's the spoke now. I don't know this is why I'm looking backward because my current my vision my glass is very foggy. I'm trying to I'm trying to get it cleaner. I gotta look back so I can look forward. I'm sorry and and I i I beg your patience at this time while I try to do this because it's the only way. I know because I'm not in the economics guy. I'm not really a politics guy first and foremost. I am a history guy. That's what it all flows from. It's that it's the it's the I can't do numbers. They make my brain hurt. I have to use my fingers. I I can't symbols other than words are difficult and those symbols translated into scenes into scenes of drama that is how I make anything make sense.

And that is why like I try not to criticize people beyond my area of like confidence and why like seeing people get mad at somebody like matt. Bruning is so frustrating. People who want to impugn that brooding over his motives are mostly It's like okay you're just trying to justify why you don't like this guy. But so many people don't like him because of his presumed air of like well no because he assumes things that they don't assume like. He essentially assumes look how what how how we're gonna get the socialism. I don't know what what that. I don't like matt hates history. He talks about how he hates reading history. He doesn't care about it like he doesn't create the scenes in his head so he's like. I don't know about that stuff don't really care about that stuff so why would I what would I why would I invest my time on these questions the questions that do resolve into into brightness for me because he thinks I think numerically and symbolically in the way. I don't is what would be the shape what would be the actual functioning mechanism of a realistic alternative to what we have now and so he tries to build that and then people get mad at him for like.

No no you have cap. This is still there's capitalism and colonialism and stuff in there. It's like. I'm sorry man. I'm. I don't that's not part of the formula that I can build things from like you're wanting me to make like. I said it's like he makes stradivarius and they're mad that he doesn't do a piano. He doesn't make pianos and it's like if you have a critique of the actual like information and and and the analysis go for it. But if you're mad at him because he's not assuming a cashless utopian space communism. I'm sorry that's not that's not what interests him about the socialist project. You need the grand romantic vision he does not and so if it's a good idea hey maybe use it. Like there hey maybe there is a jump ball in the democratic party right now and like there has to be some sort of soothing the base in the sense of injecting liquidity at the bottom. I mean honestly it might bomb down to that like.

I don't know what we're gonna get. I have no idea what the democrats are gonna do. It's probably going to suck but it might not be as bad as some people think and what it boils down to is going to be. It's going to be up to things. I don't know at all because I have not. I don't have my hands on like the nitty-gritty of the of the power dynamics in the senate like it looks one way for the outside but I don't know what it's like from the inside. So. I cannot speculate to that point but if whatever if it does make some sort of if we do get like a real change like a lot of people are saying oh the democrats are serious about keynesianism. Now. It's like. It's not because if that happens it will not be because they have been convinced by all the smart arguments and all the people's op-eds it'll be because oh shutter to halt and that means we got to give it to him. But so the decision is made not morally not at the level of politics or ideology. It's made at the level of material necessity but then the shape it takes now you're at the policy you're at the politics level and a thing like an actual alternative. An actual better alternative might get you something better. The thing people who may state the debt. What democrats specifically mistake here is that they mistake that for progress that is not progress towards a goal that is ad hoc like pathfinding by a system and the probably another stupid sterile argument in politics happens because two groups of people look at that look at that decision and see it as a progress. The democrat sees in his progress and says look this is how it works. The leftist sees it as progress and says but it's either insufficient or it's designed to undermine progress broader. You know what I mean like they see it as yes. This is a thing that moves us towards another thing. It isn't. These are all contingent policy decisions. They might add up to something but that is decided at a deeper level but I don't know like. I said that requires the like specific political state of play analysis information that I don't have.

I am as brezhnev said a big picture guy and of course that also means. I don't have a lot of specialized intelligence. I don't have a very It's mostly that makes sense and helps them in some way and enough of them do that. Then it has to be useful at least that's what I tell myself. People are trying to hold me to account for saying that kellyanne conway is a dime. I'm sorry people you're not going to get me off the block on that one. Even if it impeaches me in all other areas and I understand that she's turned into sort of a good desiccated gargoyle. But when she was on for the old heads out there when she was on bill maher in the 90s he would always have like a perky young blonde conservative. On. There she was foxy and when I see her I see her sort of through the lens of me being horny for her while watching politically incorrect with bill maher because remember I was watching politically and correct with bill maher.

The precise moment that my gonads were first being fired with. Hephaestus's hammer look don't hate the player hate the game posting bonk. What is this. I saw that. I saw a meme about that it was. It was the doge dog as the terminator with the gatling gun and he was firing baseball bats and they said bomb. What does that mean what does bonk mean bonk is horny please. Is it your. I'm assuming. It's you get hit with it like they have a a baseball bat and they hit you for being horny. So. It's the sound of getting hit for being horny okay. I get it does that mean that I am that I am officially bunk pilled because I know this munch pilled and bonk pill. That's what we are out here. That's what we out here doing. We're being munch filled and bonk built. I'm going to answer one more question on here. People say that it's bad chat. I'm sorry I never really read it when I'm on a roll. I can't really see. I can't. I cannot get distracted. So. I miss a big chunk of it. Apparently it's all terrible you people need to bring. It come on at least not for me for each other.

I watched backer. I was okay. It was good. I don't think a war with china is going to happen. I think that everybody is going to be compelled to get things a little closer to the vest now. I think we might see a retrenchment but again. I don't know for sure. There's a lot of things up in the air iran being a big one because you know the pompeo and mohammed bin. Salman and netanyahu were making real sure at the very end there to keep the momentum really against any kind of rapprochement and there's obviously gonna be forces within the bind. Administration who are gonna be totally happy with that. So we'll see we'll see will.

I get a vaccine. I mean at this point. It doesn't feel like. I have to even worry about it like what when would I be able to get a vaccine how many months from now and at that point honestly it'll either be so obviously the good thing to do because it's like working or it'll be so had covet so why would I even bother. I probably wouldn't I mean. I have made no rush. I've made no inquiries. I haven't checked to see what my number is so. I'm not in a hurry to get it. I will say that and being a podcaster means. I don't have to worry too much about exposure in the public. So. I feel like it's a safe risk and at this point a safer risk than just taking the thing. I'm sorry. I know I know. I know he was 86 but when jab and then he's dead two weeks later. I mean yes yes. Yes. He's 86. I get it but I'm just asking questions. I'm jacking off right now. But I'm not going to lie when I saw that. I did a little. I did a little when I saw that it's like damn.

The the guy was spry enough to be walking around and getting publicly taken to the hospital to get a shot and then third party the way of the future one way or the other. I doubt it'll be any of the existing third parties and it might not even be and i. I think it's probably not going to be a conventional american style popular political party. I think it might be more like a real um a real. I don't want to say vanguardist but like some something that is That is maybe incorporates an electoral element but is not entirely electoral. I guess that's the way I would say and the reason I say that but some people say oh. That's That's like the psl or that if they exist now they're just mutants.

I'm sorry. Any small third party that exists now is made up entirely of mutants. Don't get mad at me for saying that and if you are a mutant. I'm not blaming you for that. We're all we're all mutants. I'm saying that there are not enough mutants and that the way mutants talk about politics is alienating to non-mutants and so it will not be like. People aren't going to go into this org. There's no transition belt they're going to make something themselves and you can be part of it. You just have to be able to be at the moment and be able to recognize it. All. Right folks peace out.
