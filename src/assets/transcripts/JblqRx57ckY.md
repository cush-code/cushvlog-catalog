Ugh okay there's me hey. I'm on tv that's fun h . Hey everybody. How's everybody doing oh yeah baby's lovecraft country. No good no good very bad obviously first minute of it. There's cgi blood thumbs down. It's all cgi so that's already you have to get over a very large bar to just deal with it. Because you're a genre show that means your effects have to be good. They have to be immersive.

They're not but bye but maybe they could have salvaged that if there was something on top of it that was like textually dense and interesting enough to to make it worthwhile. But in my mind. Any chance of that happening went out the window when a montage of of racial ins abuse in the 40s of of white people being racist to black people as they travel across the country was scored to a james baldwin speech. I believe his debate with buckley maybe. It might have been I mean for one thing that's anachronistic obviously that happened much later than the events of the film. Secondly. I mean who are they imagining is watching this how small how what kind of guppy-brained children are they pitching this to where they have to. It's like even though the text of every scene is racism. Like the text of every scene is a racial disparity in racial abuse and I'm not saying that's necessarily bad but you have to with that with being that limited a palette.

You have to like keep it interesting and innovative and just saying like oh you know. I usually use music to you know sort of evoke a subtextual thing. We're just going to add more text on top of the text. I mean what the it's just to me. I'm just going to assume that you don't think that. I have a brain at that point as a viewer and so why the hell would. I want to watch that you you you don't think I'm very bright and that probably means you're not too smart either. You don't have enough to say yeah like being kinda because that's the thing it's not like the level of art on the show is really great being condescended to by a dummy is one of the most infuriating things in life and that's what that show does so thumbs down to that. But it also so it what but I'll give a credit that show helped spark a real a real revelation to me and that was. I was. I did a tweet about oh the show's got cgi squibs. This and of course a lot of people were like well yes but the show itself is great.

No wrong incorrect not great or they'll say well. It's a dream sequence. It's it's it's kitschy. It's stuff. They're all. It's all cgi so nope. That's clearly just the style. That's the aesthetic so out with that and then but someone god bless them linked a a montage of squib a squib hits from movies that's on youtube and I watched it. It was like eight minutes long and I'd seen a bunch of those movies and I was it was kind of fun like picking them out like oh no. I know that one I know that one but just watching this.

This the the drama of an actual explosion happening on screen and the unpredictable and viscous physicality of fake blood coming out of a wound and I was like god damn that really is like why else have someone to get shot in the movie as an aesthetic experience which is of course. What 99 of the time is you're not really moving. The plot along you're showing that because you want to see it and so that's what shooting is for and I realized my god like the the gun fight. The gun fight in movies is doomed like who'll ever want to watch. People get shot if that's gone because that's what makes it interesting that's what makes it visceral as I've said and the movies that don't have that they just lose. It's like oh okay. This is fake. These are kids playing with fake guns. I don't care anymore and the and that was a real challenge. I think to hollywood in general.

How are we going to make gun based action which is one of our bread and butter events still exciting and visually interesting and aesthetically pleasing when one of the main elements of the aesthetics of gunfights on movies is gone and the answer was we're going to replace it with physical dexterity smoothness of motion elegance grace basically human grace to replace the missing visceral impact of of real squibs and that's what the john wick movies were did and the first john wick movie one of the reasons everyone loved it. I think is because it appeared to solve the problem it said here we're going to give you gun fights that aren't going to have the visceral impact of squibs but are still going to be amazing because of how fast and elegant they are how how how quickly they happen. You won't even notice that there's no real blood. You won't even notice that they're not really shooting the guns because it's going to move so fast and you know what it worked. I liked the first john wick a lot. I think everybody did holy crap look at this thing. It was like now we have a solution but the thing was like with any kind of any answer. Like this any sort of attempt to patch over a key artistic you know deficit of of accelerated capitalist cinema. It ends up becoming a cure-all and then it no longer works and I realize this is that now every one of these movies every one of these gun-based action movies has decided oh that's how we're going to trick people into thinking. This doesn't look bad by having them do kickflips and grab guys by the head and flip them around and then shoot them real close and then have it be very like very kinetic. And it's now that that's every movie the horror of it comes into realization like oh god.

[07:06](https://youtu.be/JblqRx57ckY?t=07m06s)

This sucks like by the time I watch jada with three. It's like not only is it just repetitive you and having now seen john wick three. And like when you see john wick that was just that movie you know yes people say oh well what about equilibrium. It's like equilibrium was like 20 years ago and it was an isolated movie that a lot of people made fun of. At the time gunkata. It was sort of a joke and it became a cult classic later. But it did not. It was not the beginner of a totalizing trend. The way that john wick is and now since every movie is john wick. You see john wick 3 and you're like oh god more of this and now there's going to be two more.

At least every one is going to be oh in the in the flour because you want to make more bread than you than you have flour for that's what they're doing. It's it's. It's sawdust in the flour. It's It's anti-freeze in the wine. It's another way to obscure the just the the the the spiriting reality of having every everything that we thought of as like the compensatory cultural superstructure that we can enjoy even as our lives are sort of drilled drained of any kind of power over our destinies. No you don't that's not even good.

That's bad we can't afford those real bullets. We can't oh what a gun that actually fires you mean real blanks. What okay you gonna pay for that who's gonna pay for it. It's like universal healthcare for movies and so now it's like oh yeah another. But at every level you can't just take something away. You can't just take something away. You have to offer something that's shittier but still better than without having the thing that's being taken away and all the flip john wick. Is the is the lesser thing now so. I gotta say that I'm now anti-john wake gotta be a thumbs down for me for the entire franchise and you know what hey. That's the way the cookie crumbles you gotta accept things changing over time.

No action movies are done as a genre where there's like they're not really horror movies in my opinion but like they they kind of ride around with horror movies and like maintain sort of an artistic credibility around them that allows them people to do things like insist on real effects because horror film hasn't been totally like has totally lost any kind of artistic credibility as a genre. The way action has so that means there's still a few good horror movies and they'll still like you know invest the extra for for real effects but now that's going to be gone too and the only thing the only good horror movies will be the a24 things where it's like you watch. It. You go was that really a horror movie or was it just sort of a just sort of a very like a a a dark drama or a thriller. It seems almost like a thriller would be more accurate a term than a horror movie blumhouse is totally like first of all. They make the purge movies and they use cgi bullets in them. So they already are on my list because the purge in my opinion is a great idea for especially a a exploitation style series of films and they really they really undercut the enjoyability of their of of the trashiness of everything when some guy goes down in a bunch of pixels yeah no hereditary. For example that's a horror movie but mid-summer. I don't really think it's a horror movie light see lighthouse is another one. I don't even know if that's a horror movie. I don't really think the lighthouse is a horror movie either yeah. The the the lighthouse is as it's a dude's rock. The the lighthouse is guys being dudes yeah. There's a real horror movie. It's called the news speaking of horror movies.

We're going to be streaming the the dnc second night tonight at 9 00 or 8 30. I think we're going on but we're gonna be there for the opening gavel. The opening zoom gavel for the opening monster That we're gonna get to see does clinton go tonight. I hope clinton gets tonight at the day after the picture or the day yes the day the picture of him getting massaged by an epstein victim on the flight to africa gets revealed good that'll be fun oh we're going to have some riffing to do on that one oh boy god damn. We might have to empty the notebooks for that one. They're putting him on stage just the insanity of this a guy who is a close personal friend to a serial pedophile a world a world-spanning human trafficker with connections to the highest levels of power including by the way the evil president that we all hate donald trump and this hangs around with him. There's pictures of them yucking it up on the private planes been to the the island and zorro by the way let's not forget zorro ranch where apparently they went for christmas or something every year and brought chelsea one time sickos and this guy still the big dog that these guys panther over and are just enraptured to because he happened he managed to win two elections wow well amazing he was able to basically show up at the right moment to ride the credit. The nascent tech bubble of the 90s to two terms and just watch watch the tide of history turn towards reaction and just go hey what if we did that too. That's his brilliant innovation to politics.

That means we have to worship him for the rest of our lives. Hey what if we just did what the republicans do because that's what people seem to like. That's the easiest solution you could possibly give to an answer in any kind of like brainstorming session. It's like these guys are kicking our ass what to do well. Why don't we just do what they do and usually. That's the wrong answer because doing that kind of undermines everything else. But he didn't give a power and he did it and I think that's something that gets under looked when we talk about the way these guys like reckon politics when they're talking about what's pragmatic to get things done. What they what the the unstated assumption is not is that they are the ones getting the things done. The the the assumption is that no matter what they will be in power they assume the position of centrality to the process because for them politics is an expression of their their ego that's why they're in that position that's what motivated them to get into politics.

Someone has to take that job. It gets taken by people who self-select towards that that psychological structure that need and what that means is that if they get into a situation where oh the the the you know the democrats before me made this pact with the devil to balance to end inflation on the backs of the american working class and not no longer be able to offer them any kind of meaningful economic intervention. We've essentially seeded the economic ground of politics completely and we're going to have to completely depend on culture war and like identity based influences and and corporate money to maintain relevance oh boy that's shitty. What do. I do well most people when they're asking that question are trying to do it from the perspective of a country like what could we do together to like move. This ship away from the iceberg. And a person who is psychologically fixated on assuming power does not think that they think what do. I have to do to use the level of power in front of me the democratic party in this case in order to gain power in this situation and so for the people who were in charge of the democratic party in the early 90s.

They when they tell you. This is what we had to do they're not lying. This is what they had to do if they were going to wield power. It was going to be under those conditions but the thing is that's not there's there's a greater interest that they're not considering which is what most people who don't imagine themselves in those positions are imagining when they imagine the we or who like making decisions. That's the problem with a representative structure is that is that you're concentrating the the will of whatever organized political coalition that can exert power in the ballot on one individual or or a bunch of individuals but concentrated into individuals like the president specifically and you know members of the specifically the federal government and those people are going to be motivated by an underlying assumption that they have to be in the room and that means compromise is always going to be what they say because anything else might involve them losing and that certainly can't happen king hobo. Dnc.

What's that who's king hobo. I didn't see that. I saw I saw the The steven stills billy porter thing about where they did some weird like rem funk remix of for what it's worth with him voguing wearing some sort of dracula cape. Oh king hobo is kasich okay. I didn't watch it. I just saw he looked like he was at a baseball field oh my god that was amazing because it really reminds.

[18:12](https://youtu.be/JblqRx57ckY?t=18m12s)

You is that politics now. It's just like the lev at the level of the spectacle of our little rock'em socket robot puppet show that we love so much the people actually in charge of the controls. The literal channel changers for what we get to fight over are just a bunch of old people a bunch of senior citizens who lived through the 60s litigating whether or not they were groovy. That's it. It's all just re-arguing the 60s cultural split because they they because all else has been foreclosed. First by you know the the changing of the the party structures relationship to the market in the 70s. The introduction of what they call neoliberalism and then of course they're just aging and reactive brains like no longer being able to to process reality as it happens being much happier to live in their past like joe biden. All of these people they're thinking back joe biden's that's how you know joe. Biden's brain is really gone because he's in the 50s. These people are in the 60s because you know that's how progressed the the the collective senility is but biden is of course because he is their tribune. He is their concentrated will.

He is the most senile and so he's already back in the 50s. He's already back banging the the razors to get them rusty in the in the rain barrels so once again we get steven steel's 900-year ass. Vietnam war movies just get to get the blood stirring in these people who just want to have one more chance to go to the polls and say in the in the face of a society falling apart around them through through through. There could I direct connivance and absolute blithe indifference for the most part that actually no man the 60s it was about peace dude. It was about peace and love.

I'm gonna go out there and vote for joe biden who thinks that it's actually about hep cats being able to take their main squeeze to the soda shop. No neoliberalism is is is tina I in my opinion. Neoliberalism is the full is the full logic of the market unleashed on all society which is only possible in a context where there is no alternative to it where its energies can are no longer constrained by having to battle like an a a different system to compete it. No longer has to compete and so like in the in the in in the economy that leads to monopoly and they're they're in the monopoly stage. Now. It's it's and they're and as such they can move inward and and take that like market logic and apply to everything and that's and and carter carter. Carter was the guy who in terms of if you want to talk about like one figure who embodies the whole process. He was the guy who on behalf of a democratic party that had lost its connection to the working class in any meaningful way and the working class had lost their ability to influence and direct the the first the democratic party and then. A large enough section of the american people willing to vote for that party. We're no longer able to exercise enough power and the big economic questions that used to dominate politics universal health like direct government provision of resources.

The extension of government provision of resources into other areas of life nationalization is a real priority of the state. The creeping the creeping socialism that really does happen or or can happen anyway. Is or is is theorized to happen in social democracies to keep making these you know non-reformist reforms to keep pressing things until a point of crisis at which point if you've assembled sufficient. State capacity expressed through sufficient organizational capacity as the class project you can then push it over the coke machine like sweden looked like they were getting to that point when the meidner plan was introduced as a possible road map towards the state consolidation of of the economy in sweden through the the direct what the miner plan basically said is that instead of paying cash taxes corporations are going to have to have give a percentage of their stock to the state every year and it's and that's not going to be like you give it once. And it's ever every year so that means the state gains stock over time and eventually contrarians has complete control. That's the kind of thing that was potential and the us of course was not in any position to to do anything that dramatic because of how relatively.

Our social democratic path was relative to europe but especially relative to the scandinavians but there was still stuff like like nixon was talking. Nixon proposed a universal health care plan that is to the left of anything we have now or proposed by democrats shy of bernie and and teddy. Kennedy rejected it because they thought they could get the real thing that's how close they felt they were universal. Free. College was a real thing on the possibility on possibilities and in every country the crisis moment came and because the because of the arrangement of forces because the insufficientness of the working class to exercise political authority through the closest instrument it had whatever that might be led to capital taking over now you could argue that that was inevitable that you can never get get there through the electoral process and that's proof of it I'm not. I don't know. I'm kind of agnostic on that point But I do know that a crisis moment the crisis point came emerged which was theorized the the the victory of capital being inevitable the victory of capital being inevitable.

That is what I'm not sure of. I don't know if it necessarily had to go that way But of course then you get into counterfactuals. I do I would say plainly that obviously given the conditions we had it couldn't go any other way but the question is to what degree were there. People and forces that could have changed the direction at what point could. The river have been flowed like changed its its course and I'm not sure.

[25:11](https://youtu.be/JblqRx57ckY?t=25m11s)

I that's why I feel I do. I do enjoy. That's why I feel basically agnostic and I feel like that's kind of like that's where like history even if you have a dialectical understanding of the you know materialism. It none of it is is that doesn't make everything self-evident it still has to be investigated. I would say like whether anybody could have punched through that that log jam in the west anyway through the electoral process. I don't know but I would say that the 70s were the moment when the contest was definitively won by capital which has means that the neoliberal area is the era of hegemonic capitalist victory over the political process like if you wanna that's. I think that's as good a definition of any it is when it is when it is when like the the libertarian conception of the state. The the the yeah becomes the undergirding political principle. The governing ideology as it were of both parties meaning that there is no longer a meaningful political vector for alternatives to libertarian state notion emerging.

So that's what. I would say. It's kind of sunny on me here oh. This brings me to something that I wanted to talk about. I hope. It doesn't get too goopy and abstract so bear with me and tell me if. I'm sounding a little too out to lunch.

But I wanted to talk there more about the concept that we know and love and no no call it ideology yes of course. What do we speak of when we speak of ideology and there's a bunch of different definitions because there's ideology in different contexts and there's ideology as like the undergirding system that generates that's generated by a material relationship and that structures the politics and the culture. Then there's self-conscious ideology is in what we think of as our politics that's different too But I want to start at the basic level with what what ideology what purpose ideology ideology serves in this in the mind. What what what bridge does it what what function does it carry out in the establishment of the self out of just the the the data that our bodies perceive because that's all we are. It was just a big thing absorbing at least as far as we know. Our brains are just the thing that absorbs what is given what it. What's what is what its sensor organs pick up in the thing around it and then that is then turned into an understanding of the world that includes an understanding of the self and relationship to the world and ideology is.

I would say the way that we bridge the gap between two different but but distinct but linked and and and completely codependent concepts of self-interest. So there's two types of self-interest in in in social species like humans specific more humans more than anyone and that is one you have the perceived interest. The narrow interests physical and then you know like basal id related interests of the self. Like first. There's you know pure self-preservation in terms of preventing death and injury and then the satisfaction of urges that arise from the task of staying alive like that. That's like that's the id. But even though our understanding of humans is that is the sum total of human of the human self is that id and then the stuff that we wrap around it and that's us and it's independent and we're all independent. That's not true 

You can talk all you want about survival of the fittest but once once an animal in a species gains a certain degree of complexity of its its its social arrangement and its ability to communicate communicate to itself and then communicate outward to other members of the species. The more. It creates a new vec a complementary vector of evolution which is social evolution and it it there there is an equilibrium point at which even though everyone has an individual id with an individual self-interest that all interests are mutually advanced by cooperation and ideology is negotiating the gap. How do we square having an individualized desire which could be you know that guy's got a chicken. I want that chicken you know that guy's got a wife. I want that wife the hobbsian state of nature how do we how do we. Assimilate this abstract notion of self-interest which we can recognize through trial and error. We will recognize that there is a necessary social component to life and then we have to pursue it. But how do we convince ourselves.

How do we put the I into the we in such a way that we can subordinate to it and ideology is is the is the structure of that relationship and I would say that the dominant western ideology the the ideology. The undergirding of the capitalism or our response to living in capitalism rather and steadily taking over the world is one where the relationship is is that there is only the the I there's only the id and then there is this social stream of otherness which we contract to engage with strictly to our advancement and then any kind of social question like how does that how does that allow everyone else to advance. Because remember there has to be a social component to existence. They would say no if everybody is self-interested the collection of that self-interest by negotiating it through a frictionless market without with no latency of transmission of information will rise all boats at once of course. That's absurd because we are not one. Even though we perceive the social dimension of our persistence more abstractly than our id. It is in reality as important. It's it's co-equal and it and what that means is that society is co-constitutive of what we think of as ourselves like think about language think about how much our thoughts and our minds and our conceptions are our deep. Deep. Dreams are structured by the language we we are born with. We don't have any choice in that that literally structures our entire mind and it comes from outside and it comes from the collective decisions of people. We've never met before and it is co-constitutive of our perceptions our individualized perceptions which are filtered through these structures that are socially formed.

[33:02](https://youtu.be/JblqRx57ckY?t=33m02s)

It's co-equal and ideol and and that is why I think like socialism properly understood the ideology of socialism. You know as I'm saying is an abstract concept not as as something that is generated something you act to create with the create in the world. But whatever you create. It's not going to be quite what you wanted. But it might move you in that direction and it will create a new ideology. I'm saying the abstract ideology that you operate from of should in my opinion. Be one that acknowledges the self as socially constructed like and not just constructed constitutive like society is me at a fundamental level and I think if you actually absorb that reality as opposed to just as something you mouth it. It reduces a lot of the inherent conflict in in our notions of what socialism could be the things that say like well. You know people are always going to want to get ahead. People are always going to want to you know have more money than their neighbor and stuff. It's like yeah but that is because we operate from an ideology that assumes we are individuated. That that is the fundamental capitalist ideology and it is.

It is essentially psychosis if you want to get like specific if you want to get dramatic again. I don't know I mean. I don't. I think you could argue that in the in the sense that it is radically fractured away from the reality that they're living it like and a real reality a fundamental reality that under like that's why we're here obvious. The only reason human existence exists is because of that and capitalism is us trying to chop our arms off that's what we're doing. It's insane social suicide caused by a deluded psychotic sense of self. That's the ideology of capitalism. That's the ideology that is generated by turning every relationship into a transaction between strangers. Eventually you lose all social forms as you lose investment in social forms as having meaning and pile all meaning into personal indulgence. It turns you into a little psychopath. It turns you into an instrument of pure desire which means pure competition with those around you which means eventually destruction of all common ruin of the contending classes.

That's and that is the social animal that is man gnawing at itself because it's basically got a infection that's overheating its brain and the thing is is. The capitalism serves a role you know. Capitalism is a healthy bacteria at one point in that it facilitated the the the concentration of capital that was necessary to allow humankind to come into awareness of itself. The problem with humankind is that over time it spreads and stretches and the possibility of tr of transcending the abstraction of space and time to imagine that we are all part of one species. A true species with a species being and a spirit a collective spirit that necessitates a degree of technological transmission and ease of life.

Most of all a yeah a a a ease of um of social exchange where labor and ex labor and subsistence The the linkage has been severed allowing for like the full flowering and development of human consciousness and that's only that's only possible under a socialist conception of society because over time the need for those distinguishing indulgences goes away because you can there's there's actual worth. There's value that is not to be found literally. There's not there's there's non-market value which we don't have right now without if there's if the only value should be found on the market that the only the only worth of self the only in the only pleasures of the life. The only pleasures of a spiritless world life in a world where god is dead and we replaced him with nothing except fear of the devil like nobody believes in god.

But we're all afraid of dying which means we're afraid of hell. Essentially so we killed god and left the devil and so in that world what is to be done but piling up luker for yourself distracting pleasures of self and then see everyone else is competing for those you know in a world of dwindling resources. If you believe that there's a value to social to social life. You create structures that allow social life to thrive that get that don't require people to to flee to self-indulgence as a sucker because there's no lack there's no hole to be filled. The way that we have created a whole and I think there has to be some place for religion to help in the in terms of if you're going to create like an ideological bridge like a self-conscious ideology that could that could break this this suicidal log jam. It's going to have to involves the language of religion and spirituality because that's what people organize their minds and and identities around and you can define. It depends on how you define ideology. There's one way you can divide ideology where yeah like what I'm describing that's not ideology because that's just that's a social life as it should exist you know it's it's act the actual harmonious existence of humans. The problem is you have to burrow through. You know the the millennium of human development to get there and maybe you won't because of the intervening reality of ideology emerging and reifying pathological mistakes pathological accruing errors created by a a a rapidly expanding world of in Just a de-sacralization of of life.

[39:55](https://youtu.be/JblqRx57ckY?t=39m55s)

I guess. I would just say because the things the processes are contained. I mean in the sense that they don't kill everybody but they're clearly unstable. The process has to be regulated and that's why as much as like the trad nazi types think oh no I've solved it. I've solved this. I've recognized the problems of capitalism but I've just replaced the self with the people the volk. I've replaced the self as the locus of all you know meaning with my fantasy idea of a people. But what a coincidence I'm picking the people who are most like me because I am using the concept of a social life to just recreate the individual self on a larger scale like hitler was not trying to subsume himself into the social reality of german existence. He was trying to suborn german existence to him to become an expression of him and that's that's the that's that's what fascism angles towards because even if you create your your beautiful corporate corporate state. It's going to have to define itself against others internal and external who have to be destroyed and that process continues over time regardless of whatever happens you win the war you have to start another one. You will destroy yourself because you are at the end of the day not engaging in a in a move towards the sort of degradation of ego away from individual market expression of self towards a social relationship with others a contextualized self if you're not doing that you are steering it towards eventual mutual annihilation. Leaving none couldn't you know you're somewhat doing the same thing what's same thing as what same thing as who I would like to know because I'm trying to figure out what you mean like the way. I the thing that really made me reminded me about the reality of that like how ethnonationalism can never stabilize. It will always destroy itself and it's not because you could argue because like the libertarian the fantasy the the fantasy the ideological fantasy that undergirds the libertarian sense of self is if everybody works towards their own advantage over time and you remove you remove barriers to to to exchange everyone will advance now that's not true but that's what they think it's ideological. It's deeper than thought you know. It's just. It's. It's a motivator that they don't even know is there um. But we know that that's destructive and like the fascist notion is that you recognize that but then you say oh. No we can all get together. If we are operating out of 

You know the self-interest is ourselves conceived as part of some volk well. In that case the only competition at that level has to be war which is what they saw it and even if you win all the wars you have to define yourself against another so another emerges from within depending on whatever crisis are being created by your unstable economic model which is capitalism which is going to drill through the world's resources eventually and leave you in a position of unsustainable crisis of distribution. And the one thing that made me think of that. Most recently is john cornyn the senator from texas early on in the coven was asked about. You know hey what about this covet thing seems pretty serious because he was talking about. It you know open up. We got to save the economy and he was saying well. You know. The people who are dying are people who are older people with heart disease and stuff. And he's not necessarily talking at that point. About oh you know they're poor black people or they're poor mexicans. He's just talking about like his constituents and in a state like texas where everybody has heart disease. I think it's like the state flowers arterial sclerosis and he's talking about people who are unlucky enough to get the thing because at a certain level you have to like break off from.

A group and determine it other in order to redefine the self. It's the only it's the only way thing that keeps you in a vacuum. Conscious of yourself is by recognizing distinction. That's why the idea of like essentially deprivation is so terrifying to people because it's you alone but eventually you lose the sense of self because you're not comparing it to anything and that means that the the the ethno state will eventually destroy itself either by over exertion or by turning inward. That's the death drive that undergirds undergirds fascism and because they both and there's a death drive that undergirds capitalism more broadly and both of them are embedded in this notion that you can be an individual person on this planet that you that there's something called an individual human being that there is a meaningful that's a meaningful category like to distinguish a person at a level beyond. Just to note that this is a distinguishing feature of a greater you know social organ. That's what I thought was good about the book man in the high castle which it has the nazis and the japanese as world spanning empires with no enemies to see in the 60s and they're still going to have a nuclear war. It's inevitable they will destroy each other they have to I on the on the fashion thing.

I remember. I saw a map some nazi it made of europe and it showed it where all the countries were under the rule of whatever like weird you know Crypto nazi party is in that country you know like the true finns or whatever well what if they ran every country and it was supposed to be like oh. This is a dream oh if that happened every one of those countries will go to war with every other one over like irredentist. Territorial claims sure yes of course. They would cleanse all the muslims but what do you think they would do after they did that or as they did that you don't think that al sas lorraine comes back into play if like the national front and it wouldn't even be the afd and probably be farther left right than that in germany take over fall out of here.

 someone wants to know about the death drive. I would say that the death drive is the brain's way of just coping with the irreconcilable phenomena of being an individual consciousness that is both the sum total of existence and also find aware of its own finitude. Mortal self-consciously moral is that and that is that the closer you clean to your individuated being the more The more fraught and horrific life becomes the more the more the more the the the experience of life is undermined. Like pleasure is is is literally sapped out of the world by due to the overweening anxiety of you. The consciousness of of time progressing and your awareness coming toward an end a thing that a mind cannot conceive of because you cannot conceive of anything. That is it's. It's the opposite of everything it's ever experienced. It can't handle that and so life becomes misery and so but because what makes us miserable is that we can't hold on to life.

We don't want to kill ourselves but deeper where we can't even get at. We want to die. We want to end this but we don't want to know it's coming. We want it. We want to end it and so we act in ways that will bring about the end reasonable interp. Oh is that something else man somebody's really mad at gnosticism are there any gnostics around in terms of people who are doing the practice of it.

Weird people to get mad at oh. Somebody asked me this on twitter and now they're repeating it the most cringe vp vice president. That's an interesting question because all vice presidents the ones who didn't become president. Anyway are inherently cringe because what look at you look how close you came you schmuck you. Freaking drool losers you got so close couldn't get it so they're all cringed like ooh and then especially the ones who ran and lost so guys like gore mega cringe. Mega cringe al gore is highly cringe so I'd say anybody who ran and lost any vp who ran and lost his cringe which is why one of the things that makes nixon cringe. Even though he was president is that he was also somehow one of those losers even though he eventually won John nance garner is pretty cringe. The guy was two terms under vp under fdr hated it every minute. He's the guy who famously said the president the vice president ain't worth a bucket of war piss and worst of all. It was because he represented the southern reactionary segment of the democratic party and he was just watched in horror as those east coast. Fancy lad new dealers ran roughshod over the place and he was going to go in there and clean house because he was assuming like everybody that you only do two terms but franklin ef good old fdr got in that the end of that convention he didn't trust any of those other horses to carry carry. You know the the ferry across the river so he he did it and after telling garner he wouldn't and he was pretty pissed. So he got owned. There was a guy named richard mentor. Johnson who was van buren's vp who was wildly scandalous mainly because he I mean. This isn't cringe in the present moment of course but it certainly would have been cringe. At the time. He like many slave owners of the day. He had a relationship of one kind or another with a slave and children by her but unlike those guys who kept it on the down low you know taking the candle to the back room or whatever he had he. I don't think he married her but he had her like as a public consort and it was scandalous I would say that henry wallace is pretty cringe definitely one because god he got so close if they if if fdr died a little earlier or the right wingers hadn't foisted truman onto fdr. At the convention he could have been president but the thing is he was kind of a goofus. I mean. It's known now that the entire progressive party that he ran on that they kind of like spun up out of nowhere for him to run on. The the platform of was just entirely shot through with communists and you know a lot of course. You go that's epic that's cool that's epically cool But the thing is the one guy on earth who didn't know that was henry wallace. He was. He was a genuine like good government progressive type from the midwest like he was a farm expert. Just the.

He was a he was a nerd. He didn't even know that he was sort of being moved around by by moscow which again hey. If he got into the presidency. Have you gone into the presidency and like set the course the cold war differently. You know that's a real counterfactual that might have genuine valence in terms of changing the larger direction of of history. Cheney is based as hell. Janey's not cringe come on the guy ran the entire show by himself. He took his house off of google satellite views. He had a man's size safe. At his office. He suggested himself for his job and then took over the other guy's job. Nothing cringe about cheney evil yes but but not cringe. William rufus devane king died two months he never even got sworn in he died in an in cuba of yellow fever malaria or something the other thing about william rufus devayne king is that he was noted in washington for his flamboyant appearance dress and affect and when you read the way people talk about him It's pretty clear. If you read between the lines that he was a he was kind of a. He was a fancy man. I guess you'd say it he was. He was fabulous. I guess you you'd pau you'd call it his nic. His his nickname in washington was miss nancy that'll give you an idea andrew. Jackson called him miss nancy and james buchanan who was a good friend of his aunt fancy. So they were They were boying. They were boyfriends. William rufus devane king and james and cannon were probably boyfriend a girl boyfriend and boyfriend so that's not cringe in 20th century standards by by night 21st century standards. But it was probably pretty cringe at the time and then he died before even really taking office. Also cringe hubert humphrey is pretty cringe oh yeah yeah. Ooh that's gotta be high on the list so hubert humphrey was a guy who super ambitious sort of a northern northern lbj. At least in like his his his clear craving for high office. He was the boy mayor of minneapolis. He famously got the dixiecrats to walk out of the dnc in 1948 for giving a speech about putting a civil rights plank into the into the party platform Then he became a senator from minnesota. He was a favorite of the afl-cio and he ran for president in 60 against kennedy and he just got blown off the stage by the glamour. There's a great documentary called primary about the wisconsin primary 1960 which a lot of people thought was going to definitely be humphreys because he was considered like the third senator from wisconsin because he was always a guaranteed vote on all of the dairy price support legislation that wisconsinites cared about very very much back. Then they still do but not as much as they used to. We had a guy herb cole who was that the milk stayed above a certain price so and then lb and then kennedy is. This you know jet-setting east coast catholic guy in a state that even though you've got catholics obviously in milwaukee. Has a large you know rural protestant population. And there's this footage of poor hubert humphrey and like a vfw hall in rural wisconsin going. I'll tell you about this kennedy.

He doesn't know an era corn from a ukulele but then you see kennedy in was in milwaukee. You know surrounded by a bunch of bavarians and then and polox just like losing their and and he won he won even and they went in west virginia which was huge of course. The teamsters helped him out there but so he was an ambitious guy got to be. Lbj's vp got bullied by lbj the whole four years basically forced by lbj to take his and run for president with his vietnam policy. Like that was the condition of johnson's support to humphrey for the nomination which of course he had to rest from the dead grip of of rfk at the take my my position even though he didn't really believe in it and so he had to flog he had to flog that dead dog of lbj's vietnam policy until the fall. When he finally last month ago. He stopped supporting it and called for a moratorium on bombing and like you know a peace pursuit like being being prioritized and he's he actually had been way in the in the back in the polls and he kind of climbed and then the election itself was very very close if you look at it. Nixon won the the electoral college pretty convincingly but the actual vote total was was. It was almost a tie I mean it was not. It was in 1960 but it was very very close and it could have gone the other way very easily especially if humphrey had gotten autom out of lbj's pocket a little earlier so by virtue of just being a cringing toady who ended up going down a guy who really was a very principled dude. His early career was like a civil rights stalwart and also a labor like a labor first guy who's like for providing his presiding um political obsession was to create full employment in america through like a guaranteed federal jobs program which was something that the right fought tooth and nail until it was finally passed in during the carter administration but by that point had its entire actual enforceability and meaning drained from it so loser big old loser and nixon. It's funny nixon actually Lbj actually played ftse with nixon during the campaign because he worried about humphrey stabbing in the back on vietnam because at that point he was like psychopathically obsessed with protecting his legacy in vietnam and his position. So he was willing to campaign trail until he finally was able to get out from under but it was too late absolute cringe pence is incredibly cringe. I mean come on to just be such a colorless cipher known mostly for being an absolute supre repressed.

Christian freak well. This guy's president come on pathetic dan quayle is very cringe. He ran for president too just not after that he ran in 2000 and got no votes so dan quayle. He was an actual just punchline. He was only known ashley for being just a dumb goofus and for spelling potato wrong. So he's definitely very high on the list. The first guy I think of really is quail quail and pence both from indiana man what a dire presidential state so they've got two of the most cringed vice presidents ever and their one president william william henry harrison a wasn't from indiana and b out his doodoo ass can you believe it there's only one answer to the question most cringe presidential candidate. There are many contenders george romney mitt's dad very high on that list mitt. Romney also high on that list adley stevenson of course anybody who ran more than once they get the stink of loser on them like the buffalo bills of the or the vikings so adley stevenson henry clay william jennings brian losers bob dole guy ran his whole life but I don't think any of them compared to number one on with a bullet oh hillary's on the list of course. Hillary's highly cringe hillary may be number two number one with a bullet and an exclamation point jeb george john ellis bush just please clap you can't can't beat it can't beat it and when you consider how much money he spent per delegate in that which is I think by far the largest amount ever he spent like he spent like he got like two delegates. I think and he spent over a hundred million dollars. I believe that's like the quick math there so it's something like 15 million dollars a delegate after coming from the pole position after and being like not being like some crank millionaire who spends his own money being the inside track guy and he was the young he was the loved brother son. He was the good guy he was the one who followed the rules well. George was out gallivanting and snorting coke in the a-10 war dog. This guy was studying the blade he learned spanish he went to camp. He went to puerto rico with his with his with his mexican wife to like campaign for his dad when he was running against reagan in 1980 well. George did nothing and who got to be president for everything up and all because he lost his first race. Lawton childs is who we have to thank for that. Lawton childs beat him er for governor in his first run which threw off the timetable and he was in his first term but in florida. It took him that long to get back in which was not enough time whereas george had already had two terms in texas because he went like two years later if he'd gotten it then if he got in the florida presidency then or the florida. The florida governorship. Then he would have been the candidate in 2000. Now maybe he doesn't win in 2000. There's an interesting counterfactual because there is something to george bush's just frat boy.

But that's an archetype that a lot of people like jeb is sort of absolutely without character. He's he's drained. He doesn't even have sort of the towering. No blessed bleach of his dad like his dad is obviously was obviously a weenie you know they call him a wimp and everything this is this blue blood but he also just had this imperious authority that meant that it didn't matter that you thought he was a nerd. He was still judging you and that made you kind of feel. Some sort of respect for him. Jeb had nothing jeb is just this cringing and obsequious toad. Boy yes the cringiest of the cringe all right. So you guys got one more question oh all right. I found it most cringe civil war general well. Obviously you got basically everybody in the army of potomac before grant. Joe hooker cringe mcclellan huge cringe might be number one right there. Just this pompous little turd scared scared of his own shadow burnside obviously hugely cringe on the confederate side. Braxton bragg wildly cringe john bell hood amazingly cringe. I do think it's funny that everyone got mad the the two of these huge. Military bases are named after confederates and it is kind of up but it almost feels like they were trolling when they did that because they're two of the biggest fuck-ups of the confederate army bel hood. I mean hood himself personally destroyed his own army by just heedlessly smashing it against against the army of the cumberland. Like at franklin. They just had to post up and just watch these. March across the field without even doing an artillery cover the way lee did before picks charge and just rinse their asses oh. Jeb jeb stewart was amazingly cringed just this ridiculous fauntleroy who thought he was thinking fight. He thought he was fighting in the english civil war. He thought he was prince rupert of the rhine goes on a galavant around gettysburg while they're while they're fighting and has no idea isn't able to provide any reconnaissance and then gets gets scattered when attempting to attack the reader by custer of all people and then gets owned at yellow tavern. So jebs are crid cringe generally how would I win with the war for the confederates.

I wouldn't why would I do that that's absurd you're crazy. No the only way they had a chance of winning was with european recognition. That's that's the only way so you start from that premise and then work outward. I don't really know. I'd have to think about it all right. I'm going.
