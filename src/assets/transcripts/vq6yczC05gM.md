Last night I was dressed in Tails. Pretended I was on the town as long as I Can Dream. It's hard to slow this swinger down. So those don't give a thought to me. I'm really doing fine. You can always find me here. I'm having quite a Time popcorn followers on the wall that don't bother me at all play in Solitaire Till Dawn with the deco 51. Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo now don't tell me I have nothing to do. It's good to see you. I must go I know I look up right and I know my eyes are not accustomed to this light and my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete. So I must go back to my room and make my day complete mountain flowers on the wall that don't bother me at all I in Solitaire tilled on with the deck of 51. The smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo now don't tell me I have nothing to do howdy howdy howdy. What's up how's everybody's Friday.

How's it going ah thank you thank you for the compliment about my hair. I know that uh it's only a few years before I have to face the reality of possibility of sides which I really don't think I could pull off. But I also know I'm never going to shave my head. But for now I still got this little this little Brave uh Peninsula holding out although it is very much like the Florida Seacoast. It is eroding uh under conditions but that's fine whatever I will never shave it. I don't want to be one of those guys because I'm committed to the beard and the beard bald head thing for a White. Guy is just a look especially a gentleman who is large as I am I mean I am I am tall at the very least you know and kind of wide to put it charitably. It's just not a look that I think uh is me so I'm just gonna just gonna hang on to the dregs. I really do feel like.

That's the bravest option feel like there is something of a surrender to shaving your head. I mean you can divide Bruce Willis's career in half between when he cared and when he stopped caring and the dividing line is when he started shaving his head. Uh Pulp Fiction is the first movie where he shaved his head and that doesn't count because that is related to the character and it is. It is a it is a accurate Choice. It clearly is an actor's choice but once he shaved it. I think he looked in the mirror and it's like I'm just gonna stick with this and every movie he made. Once he started just shaving his head as a look as his signature look sucks. I mean look at the Die Hard movies. I mean obviously they're gonna get worse as they go along. But it's also striking first three die die hards. He's got that tenacious little strip in the front and it's slowly going away by Die Hard 3. He's just like holding on to by bear life and then the the last ones Drac. But that's not and it's they're direct for other reasons. But that doesn't help that is not John McLean and I mean God bless. The guy you know.

He's given us hundreds of hours of entertainment and now he's apparently uh got dementia after being abused Elder abused by a bunch of unscrupulous scumbags in Hollywood and having him churn Out DVD movies in a factory setting where they just get uh some over 60 actor who's got to make payment I like alimony payments or he's trying to buy an island which I bet a lot of these guys are uh. Uh 12 Monkeys is another one where it's a  choice like you. The bald head in 12 Monkeys is a choice. He is an Institutional. Uh he's like what are the guys they have in this future jail like he's a pot he's like a guy in uh any other sci-fi movie where it's a number not a name like THX or whatever the  uh George Lucas movie with Robert Duvall who by the way never shaved his head otherwise. Even though his his hair was just going away and I really think you could pinpoint exactly with with Willis why and when he stopped caring with a lot of these guys you can generally just see entropy check-in where it's like you know the The Thrill Is Gone. But they still have expensive tastes to fill the hole that the lack of thrill has left within where there's no room for spirituality for any of us not blaming them. I'm talking about everybody so you got to fill it with something and so they get more expensive tastes. But they got to keep acting and they stop giving a  De Niro for God's sakes. But with Willis something broke in him. I think like the spark went out like back as opposed to just him getting bored with acting as a creative Pursuit.

It was in the early 90s at the after he had burst into Mega stardom because of Die Hard after being a TV regular before that in Moonlighting he is one of those guys who immediately went to his head and he's like I'm a God. On Earth. He he was Notorious uh for bad behavior on sets. Uh Die Hard 2 was apparently a huge pain in the ass because of all of Willis's demands uh which I think I only know about because it was in the Mad Magazines uh parody of uh Die Hard 2 that I remember reading as a kid but one way or another I found out later it was true and in addition to that he has his own artistic ambitions. He's got this movie Hudson Hawk that is his baby that is going to be his uh full product because he he thought of the idea he developed a script with uh with uh Daniel waters. The writer of uh Heather's I don't know if it was his idea but he was there at every level massaging that script into being and it was his baby. It was his passion project what they call it in Hollywood.

At the very same time he was putting out blues music and an album called The Return of Bruno. He had the harmonica. Those two things came out the return of Bruno. His Blues album and Hudson Hawk his big passion project that had been taken a very long time and gone way over budget. They come out at the same time and they are both huge moms and he is a  laughing stock for a little. Bit. Pulp Fiction helps bring him back but his big grasp for artistic relevance. Uh explodes in his face. Leaving only you know the hollowness and so he really went deep into not caring anymore it probably because it hurt him too much to care.


I feel sad poor guy very tragic another thing that tells you when that you can use to pinpoint when a uh an actor has checked out. It's when they start playing cops. Now you can give the early days in an actor's career when you kind of have to play a cop to be noticed in a film but once they get into stardom how often do they have a badge in their movie. How often are they a detective the more that they're a cop. The more they've checked out because those roles aren't movies that don't ask anything of them and I Gotta Give a tip of the cap to uh Leonardo DiCaprio who has almost never played a cop in his career. He's he's duly designated Federal Marshal in Shutter Island and of course. He's an undercover uh State Troopa in The Departed but where there's no movie where he's just like an on the duty cop. Another guy like that is George Clooney. I think the closest thing to a cop. Clooney's ever played was uh the Marshall character in Burn After Reading and of course that movie that isn't about him doing his job. Obviously.

It's about him not doing his job. Right like Jay Edgar is the closest thing to DiCaprio in a cop movie and that is obviously not a traditional. Uh uh depiction of police officers I mean Pacino right who are the cops he played early in his career Serpico Ian then in his middle age. Vincent Hannah and the rest of his uh output is a bunch of different movies and like even his cop movies are interesting like Sea of Love but then boom boom boom boom boom. He's just a cop and it was really over for De Niro and DeNiro starts playing cops because he's got there's a reason. He didn't play cops until he was in his 50s. It's because he just does not have a cop Vibe except when he's the uh the internal affairs cop in Copland which is a wonderful cop performance. You got a chance to be a cop and you blew it. Uh Eastwood doesn't count obviously because Eastwood's in an entirely different plane he's playing a different. He's doing a different thing than actors are like denier. Uh Eastwood is embodying an American archetype and it doesn't really make sense without a gun in its hand and the movies that he is in where he is not a cop or a cowboy or a someone who shoots people for a living. It's weird like. It's still wild to me that he was. He was who Spielberg or was it. No it wasn't Spielberg. No he directed it. Um Bridges of Madison County which is just an amazing piece of uh miscasting and yeah. I think he directed that which explains how he got the part and I think maybe he was trying to challenge himself. There. I don't know but yeah like Eastwood is. Eastwood is the embodiment of D.H Lawrence's quote about Americans where he says uh.

The essential American is a killer hard and desolate. I think that's the quote cold desolate and a killer. That is what Lawrence said about American and uh that's obviously not true anymore. We've turned our machine. We've let our machines take over for that. We are we are not hard at all. We are soft butterballs all of us. Even the people who claim to be hard are in fact the softest of all because their hardness is built upon uh worship for a National project that is pure hedonistic Indulgence like even people who will fight for America and and have that desolate stare they're doing it for and they're consciously doing it.

For TGI Friday's coupons you know the hardness has been bleached out but like the 19th century American was Eastwood and of course. That's who we try to imagine that we are. That's why one of his best films he's ever made is. Uh is one of his most recent not crimacho which is an embarrassment in many ways. Although very funny in its own right uh Richard Jewell Richard Jewell is an amazing movie because it it's trying to superimpose the reality of American Life through the lens of uh people who have grown up believing that guys like Eastwood are the iconic American ideal. Richard Jewell is a guy who grew up believing like every one of his generation that Clint Eastwood was what America was uh was the embodiment of an American but he is just this is backwardly describing this Conquest process that by the time of Richard Jewel has been ended he's now at the end of History so what what is he left to do throw his weight around pathetically and then when he tries and then when he actually accidentally embodies the role of heroism. Nobody believes him and they say you must have done this you Butterball. That's why Eastwood is for a guy who is came into the scene like one dimensional. He's done it for so long and he's clearly thought about it. While he's doing it. You know he was but he's directed so many movies that he is aware of how these things go and like his later movies. Once he retired from like being a big star like was starting to look back more on like his legacy and to comment on it.

They all are this it's like the American ideal during the action the American ideal in the minds of people living through the end of History American snipers like that too. American Sniper is much less successful because uh Eastwood has ideological blinders to the reality of the war in Iraq that like keep him uh uh from seeing like the essential sadness of a character like Chris Kyle. Because the real Chris Kyle was more like that Matt Damon in the informant then Vasily zaitsev or the white death he killed a lot of people yes but from relative safety in in in in in an instance of overwhelming technical uh superiority uh and got so bored doing it that he admitted that he started killing people to pad his stats so because he so that he had more kills than others other snipers that's in his book he talked. He said the outlandish lies about sniping looters from the roof of the Superdome and shooting carjackers in Colorado and having the local police cover it up. He was a  wacko because she took guns too seriously as a religious uh Institution sell coffee and sell a brand. Like none of these guys are Eastwood either but they have Eastwood in their mind and in American Sniper. He's not able to really see the essential absurdity of Kyle but because Richard jewel is just this uh very funny goofball who who Eastwood can't register as like a kindred spirit. The way he could a hard-eyed sniper. Like Kyle.

He can see right through it and it makes it just it makes puts all America out there on a vivisection table under fluorescent lights and this is another reason that Richard jewel is such a great movie. When I his later Eastwood's later over is I gotta say very mixed. There's not a there's some good movies but there's a lot of chaff in his last 30 years of filmmaking. I'm sorry. It's just a fact but and but like honestly seeing Richard Jewel made me look at his of some of his previous movement movies differently and I kind of raised my appreciation but like if I'm honest a lot of those later movies are not very good and one of the things that makes them hard to watch is they're stultifyingly dark. Uh Sheen Tien Lex G Onna I I I I want my thing about the Eastwood movies was always they look like they're shot in a coffin and like that works in some contexts but over and over again it becomes deadly but the the Bland uh like light of uh office fluorescence that are somehow like darkened and like dimmed by Eastwood's uh composition. So that like it's never really light anywhere that's a perfect visual expression of the America that Richard Jewell lived in about wanting to be in his head. This icon of an America that doesn't exist anymore but which made this one that's the important thing the dialectical relationship and the people who fetishize Eastwood and want to go back to them. Don't realize that that is a mechanism of the very machine that you're horrified by the eastwoods can only work for the maintenance of this. New machine that they built.


I would love to have Lex G on our show. But I really don't think he would come on is the thing I think he would not want to do it and I wouldn't want to make him anxious and I feel like I would I've always wanted him to have him on a show. I feel bad that we haven't. But I really I don't want to send him off because I know it's is. He's very fragile. I love the guy though he's he's one of my absolute favorite followers on Twitter yeah. He's honestly if he stopped posting. I would probably get off that side.

Somebody asked if I've seen the Devils. Yes. I'm really kicking myself that I forgot to mention the Devils on the unspooled podcast that we me and will did I I should have done that instead of the last Valley which I saw more recently but didn't really like the Devils though which happens during the 30 Years War involves rishlu and Louis XII as characters would have been perfect for the slot. It's uh. It's an awesome movie and it does a great job of materially connecting uh uh which Christ which frenzies and stuff to their environments like and and and identifying where power flows because unlike most depictions of which uh crazes in films which are very contained and psychological and always and put everything in the context of the uh individual psyches of the people uh involved and and make it into like essentially a question of you know a contagious group group think and sadism hysteria all this stuff but and they have that perfectly in uh the witches they've got. Uh I think is it Charlotte rampling somebody plays a repressed young uh nun who beguts the hots for this horny. Priest and her repressed Lust For Him drives her to this uh fantasy but the reason the movie is very good to show that the reason that it becomes uh a real accusation that leads to trial and execution is that uh rishalu is trying to uh undermine the huguenots in France by uh dismantling the fortifications that they've thrown out during the wars of religion and which they've been allowed to keep as part of the piece that came afterwards. So there was this cold war in France after the end of the wars of religion between the huguenots and the state and because they fought this long and bloody Civil War. There had been a number of uh Urban fortifications thrown up or taken over by huguenots and used this base of military operations and when the war ended it was agreed that to keep the peace both sides would also keep their forts so that if anybody tried anything they wouldn't be unmanned unhanded but in the lead up to uh the lotto shell Showdown. When Richelieu is trying to go the huguenots into a response that he can respond to in turn they start moving to dismantle these. Uh castles and the movie shows that the real reason that that they take this accusation seriously against this priest and it becomes a witch. Craze is because this guy is sticking up for local huguenots and uh resisting their the state's effort to dismantle their fortifications so love that I also uh in the uh horny non-category. Uh Paul.

Verhoven's latest film benedetta great wonderful film I probably need to see it again for several reasons. One of which that I want to kind of uh see if I can find more with it. I liked it a lot but I don't know if I it doesn't connect with me with other verhoven. But it's very very uh good fun to watch. It's a little hours was okay. I feel like there has to be a uh. There has to be a way to balance in between. The two extremes that you see in movies about the medieval or early modern era. Do you try to recreate period dialogue or do you intentionally modernize it. I'm wondering if there's a way to get in the middle. There you know because I feel like either one of them becomes alienating I always thought that Deadwood handled uh ornate period dialogue better than almost anything. Yes. It's kind you could say it's show offy. But uh it really does conform to the written media of the 19th century which is very important right because we're not trying we're never trying to show what really happened. Nobody can do that we're trying to recreate a uh a vision of of the past that is plausible and legible to a modern audience and that means conveying something of the formality of speech something of it so you don't have the way people didn't talk that fancy in real life at that time. But they've talked like that in their newspapers in their books and so recreate that to recreate how they saw themselves culturally because that's what's being reflected in a in a show in a piece of art. Like it's a modern version of that vocabulary and one of the things that's funny is obviously milch wanted to get across just how vulgar things were there right because this is the place with no laws.

Deadwood's got no law it's a legal. It's an illegal uh squat in Indian land that has not been seated by treaty yet. Although uh Custer uh is on behalf of the railroads literally being paid to make that happen uh at the same time um that's an interesting thing they don't tell you about. Little. Bighorn is that Little Bighorn was the result of George Custer going on uh what was essentially a mercenary raid of the Black Hills to start a war with the Sioux that would lead to the cessation of the Black Hills so they could run a railroad through it. Railroad interests supported that filibuster and they got what they wanted it just cost Custer and the entire seventh Cavalry their lives and also they also usually forget to mention that before they got to Little Bighorn. The seventh Capitol. We fell on a Sioux camp that wasn't defended called Washita Creek and committed a massacre of unarmed civilians and those are the guys.

Like this is the thing we look back. We look at the characters of the dead-eyed Steely man of destiny that exists Amplified by guys like Eastwood on the Silver Screen and we respond to Eternal truths. Eternal values of like strength decency competence uh stoicism. Like these are actual positive values. They are not toxic masculinity. There's a reason we respond to them on the Silver Screen and it's not just propaganda. The reason the the purpose it's put to is propagandistic but the archetype itself represents something that's good in US and the way we remember the settlement of America is guys applying those principles to the world and getting uh the results. But the fact is no all. Those values were squandered in the name of Imperial  bloodlust and and twisted to the will of this uh capitalist machine. This literal machine of a railroad but people like that existed people with Val. Those values lived and they told themselves that that's why we're there acting and that is that's what we're sifting through to find when we look at our cultural artifacts of that era and then we identify and the people we identify with the values we identify with that. We try to exemplify but now look at us. Then we could only do horrible blood less with that.

If we if we used it for good we were destroyed or at the very least our message or our lives were warped against us forgotten or lied. About that is you can be Valiant. You can be the Eastwood guy with a moral Center but your actions would have been washed away by history or perverted if remembered yeah like a guy like John Brown exemplifies a lot of the Clint Eastwood values but at the time he was not a hero. He was executed by the state instead of being the state's hand. The people who are the state's hand guys like uh Robert E Lee were slave whipping Psychopaths who are committed to building the world into a giant abattoir as are our ruling class now but the churn of History has created a new new people who have not experienced the violence of those people. The trauma of fighting for a continent and building it the soft babies at the end of History and when we try to be Eastwood we end up just squandering our efforts one way or the other because the tragedy at the heart of American Psycho Psycho or psycho yeah it would have been better named that the problem with American Sniper is that Eastwood was implying it to be a critique of America critique of the current world and from a position of you know not just raving reactionary bloodlust. But from you know a a uh. A response to what he imagines he embodied as a character and that he saw in Chris Kyle. There are guys efforts were put to a worthless cause because the pitch of American Sniper is Iraq. Disgusting Iraq was not worth the sacrifice of a guy like Chris Kyle that's what American sniper's critique is but that is Warped by Eastwood's ideological blinders because he can't see through Kyle the way he could see through uh Richard Jewell and he has huge sympathy for Richard Jewell. But he does not believe that Richard Jewell could ever be a hero the way that Chris Kyle could but Chris Kyle is not a hero. Not like Richard Jewell. Richard Jewell is an actual hero. Eastwood isn't I'm sorry uh. Kyle isn't but Eastwood because of the same ideological process that mystifies all of our relationships to the world around us and that propaganda propagandizes every thing that we experience uh in a media context. He can't see that I've been recommended.


Queen Margot. I should see it. It's about uh Catherine or no yeah. It's about the Medici Court in France. I think I hear you got to see the the director's cutter. It doesn't count so that's got to be a pain. The best moment in um Richard Jewell is when FBI agents Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde who it plays a real piece of work who was a real reporter who who broke broke the Richard Jewel suspect story in Atlanta and who had died after that she's not alive anymore to defend herself. The movie is very mean to her. There's no question about that there's probably some dramatic license there. But at the same time you know he's serving a greater uh purpose which is to show how all the institutions that people like uh Richard Jewell think they're defending because remember he wants to be a cop. He wants to be a defender of this what's right as represented by these institutions law media uh uh Academia government like he is an age. Another state he wants to be and he wants to zealously pursue that but that state is a RAID against him and so you have to show the reporter as like this awful person. But the way he he shows the disgust that people like this college graduates uh and and first front of the class. Smarties like this reporter lady and this FBI agent because remember FBI agents have to be like for a long time they had to be either lawyers or accountants. I don't know I don't know if they need legal degrees anymore. But they're usually they have to have a college degree um and they're standing there.

While these Rubes the good people of Atlanta are doing the Macarena because remember these are people with tickets to this to the Olympics. These are people at the concerts around the Olympic grounds. These  catty thing to say oh I'm bored uh and then she says everybody's bored and then he looks around and he says they aren't but yeah that is that's and he he identified the cultural fissure that will Define all politics for the next 30 Years right there. Like in the one that we now live with we have two two Americas now living in one media bubble consuming media through one side of a of a mirror and it turns everything into a reflection of their own aggrieved state within a culture. War. That's all that we can see and then we live our lives in that bubble looking at our fellow Americans through this thing with essential distrust that then generates this political.

This politics of grievance and sadism where all we can hope to do with our vote and our participation in Civic Society is to see our opponents suffer. So when Like Richard Jewell is a hero they look at this guy and he's like this no College hillbilly this this Goofus that's not a hero it cannot be and of course you could say. Like. This is a two-way street you know like there is an entire hegemonic American power system in our nation's Rural and exorbitant areas dominated by local political uh Capital extraction regimes that are connected to local power structures of Economic and political power. The mini the mini uh Barons of America that we've talked about many times and they generate their own cultural Matrix and they see everybody else through their own dark glass and and use their power to  with them. And so we have these twin narratives about living under the fascist dictatorships of one of the two parties that are both describing a true condition of suppression a true condition of of capital of totalitarianism where the market has literally overthrown Democratic participation at every level of society but we can only describe it culturally through one or two lenses. It's the only way that everyone will recognize what we're talking about and it will be repeated through.

The system money will be placed around repeating it to the system. It will there will be investment of capital allotted to reproducing the message if it can be put out onto the Into The Ether with any kind of uh resonance. It has to be legible through one of these two Frameworks so saying. No this is one totalitarian just uh system. This is one structure of domination that can only be confronted by like a direct attack on its economic basis that nothing else will do. No other effort will be useful than that effort nothing that says that will resonate forget. If it can be said. It will be smothered and turned over and deluded because what incidents and output cultural output are what Define this space. It's incidents that are the result of random chance plus government action and then spectacles in the in the form of uh. Both things that just randomly occur like trending topics around specific events or media representations of events and media representations of events require money capital and the need for money the need for Capital the need for it to appeal to a market that is already been divided. Along these lines. You don't have to be a propagandist to want to keep this stuff off of television and put money behind it. It is a bad investment.

No matter how much people say they want it and not enough of them will pay the money necessary to make it worthwhile to pay to produce anything that does tells them something that depressing because that tells them oh. If we don't have a completely different politics. We will never be free of this who wants to hear that no one wants to hear that it is not something that is Pleasant to associate yourself with and what are you paying attention to Media for if not for pleasure. The hedonic calculus of the uh atomized American subject is the thing that makes pop uh the thing that actually imposes a uh rigid authoritarian structure of speech. We talk about how there's free speech no money does that money does the job of a anti-free speech regime that everyone's so scared of being imposed. It already exists in the form of money and people recognize that they're like oh this thing isn't fair but they never recognize that the thing that Stacks it is preferences people's preferences multiplied over a whole society everyone acting in their best interest and what that is is pleasure Indulgence because that is what is available. The the fruits of living a life committed to connection and love are militated against. We have them but in in a bedraggled formant what we can engage in and what we can pursue heedlessly and with full. Vigor is self-pleasure that means our media.

Consumption is going to be that which pleases us and being told that there's no hope and being given a story that does not have a convincing moment of Triumph for Humanity is not going to be something that we want to listen to. I know I don't so because we are given freedom to choose whatever we want and what we want has been determined. Oh. We choose the same thing over and over again and because we don't think things are going well. We're chafing against that and we want a vocabulary of resistance but all the meaningful ways to resist cannot be accommodated. Now you have the true reflection hey class domination is what's doing this economic relations are what's doing this. These must be attacked. There is another answer you can come to that the media will not accept for its own reasons that boil down to nobody wants to hear that in large enough money in the large enough numbers to make it worth the while that's the important part. It's not. There's no Market. It's that over time this Market costs me more money than it makes me and that is to see this horrible situation and say the unsayable which is it's because of uh the racial distinction between people. The the racial distinct racially distinct class uh groups of people cannot accommodate each other and therefore one group or another of them.


Uh must be made much must win inevitably and we have to pick which one we want to win. Are we going to pick the one that we are we going to root for the other side that's going to kill us if that's the mindset please don't cap any of this. I'm saying I don't believe this I'm saying this is a message that you. This is an answer to the question of why what is this thing that we find ourselves in that gives us only misery no matter how democratically it's a line. But this is the thing that you can't get out there and you can't concentrate Capital around and people point to that and say well that means it's true and no it's not true what it is is. It's not profitable in the long run.

Like they they really do think that because I am uh saying uh these based racial truths and I'm getting banned that means that I am a threat to this capitalist World Order well that is really like thinking that if I if they call the cops when I jack off in a Bank lobby. It's because I'm going to be a threat to capitalism like for much deeper reason. No appeal to race is going to get anything other than what's that oh one faction or the other of cat of the Bourgeois to take over and what are they going to do death cult ship because that's all they can do. They cannot address any root problem. They cannot address any of your based complaints about the capitalist order. I'm sorry. They cannot do it. They are of it. They are inextricably linked from it. They're they're  um psychic uh uh. Uh they're psychically fused to capitalism the petty bourgeois as a group and they're the ones who are going to exercise political Authority in any system that we live in no matter how Democratic we think it's going to be unless again. We change that system the Constitutional order can only produce a dictatorship of one segment or the other of an insane deranged schizophrenic Penny bourgeois. So if you want to if your idea is I'm gonna we can't save everybody but we can save the whites. All you're saying is I will supply Supply critical support to the Republican Party just as at the end of the day if you're saying we're going to defend the Democrats or we're going to fight like an electoral battle through institutions. You are saying I am an adjunct of the Democratic Party they are they do have that in common now you can say given the outlay of social forces.

The Democrats are least bad and give us more time to uh organize against like the snapping of the of The Mousetrap and there's an argument for that. What there's no argument for though is that the Republican party in power will only be the mental breakdown of the lower Bourgeois which means capitalism which these people are psychically fused to will be defended till its Extinction so that is the final answer that I have to any based nationalist  your headlong racing towards rooting for a nuclear war with China and of course the joke is so are people who associate with the Democrats psychically and like think that the vote matters in some way I mean Trump is Trump's agenda if he gets reelected uh yeah re for the third time re-elected. Uh is genuinely stunning. I'm going to talk about this on the show on Monday uh or at some point it's blowing my mind. Uh he's trying to do like the full American System protectionist tariffs develop like uh uh War like it's the Civil War. The the U.S Civil War economy but directed against China basically break off trade ties to China build everything that they used to build in China in the United States.

I mean that is trying to create like a a mid 20th century style war economy and then who is this machine pointed toward because it has to be pointed towards somewhere. There is a teleological structure to one of these emergency. War economies like say the one that uh Hitler built it is that you eventually have to start destroying. Some of this polit. This uh military uh Capital because you get as in any other type of capitalism. Capital over production you got to start destroying some capital and expropriating capital with uh and turning Imperial domination into profits super profits and so Trump's idea of creating like Freedom cities full of like breeding young people who all work. In like a super deregulated giant wework space and they're paid to have kids this like do it. The uh um the seastad brought home because remember. In the 90s. The Libertarians started trying to create independent cities floating in international waters and there have been several attempts at this and Peter Thiel. Let's begin to this but you know that is a long shot. They have a lot of money. They're not going to spend it all on that backing. Trump has now back asked them into proposing seasteads in America.

These are going to you know they're going to be special. Enterprise Zone type deals where with no minimum wage uh and are going to be like physically divided segregated between knowledge workers and service providers and this will be a a imposition. This would be an imposition of mid-20th century effective racial segregation. It wouldn't be actual racial segregation. There would be no formal segregation. There would be no uh covenants in fact segregation would probably be illegal. You wouldn't be able to uh to uh refuse to hop to rent to somebody but the underlying income requirements to live in SpaceX versus Space y would filter things towards a racial cast with you know blurry borders at the edge any and even if you think that's a good idea and there are plenty of based socialists who think it is because hey at least he's talking about building things in the United States.

Again what does that leave us with China the big reason we can't have our war with China realistically is because of our degree of of economic. Uh interlocking structure like we are economically inextricable from China. It is in many senses in many ways one market and so it is a political unit in in a real sense and that it makes it difficult to imagine a real escalation of violence. But if those sinews are broken the problem is the patient will start bleeding on the table out on the table. Immediately so it will strike out because to do what Trump is talking about means you would have to be in like a catastrophic economic free fall to allow for that degree of federal expenditure and maybe that'll happen maybe between now and Election Day 2020. To four. There is finally that economic Ragnarok that guys like Jerome Powell seem to be pining for and if that happens maybe you can actually start trying to build these  cities if he gets in and maybe if things are that bad and Brandon is that incapable of doing anything about it which we know he would be because it can't be anything else well. Then Sonny maybe you get your chance to see it happen and the first ribbon cutting coincides with the first launching of the nukes and it's assuming you don't have a total nuclear war with China and maybe you would maybe the reality of pressing the button would prevent a button from being pressed as long as we have it aiified the command chain too much and let Skynet take over. Let's just say that we are for argument's sake able to stop an escalation to nuclear war. But we carry out like a heavy duty land war in the Pacific that would have the benefit of destroying a lot of capital and if you destroy.


Capital then you create the conditions for that real business cycle to kick in because that is the model of uh Oscar. The Austrian model of the uh of the economy is that capitalism the markets are a natural force because these guys have basically assimilated uh capitalism to its fullest extent. They've they've taken the imaginative capacity of capitalism as the extension of uh medieval Christianity. If they've taken that seriously they can wrap it around this structure and turn it into the natural world as such and they can divide the economy from the government in a manichean fashion and say this is a parasite on that as opposed to the fact that they are inextricable and the same thing and any distinctions you want to draw between them are temporary and uh basically just to get a better look. At it. They cannot be taken as real things. The Austrian School takes that to its full conclusion and of course it can because it's a fantasy nobody ever is acting like that's real but people are motivated by. It's activist logic which is accelerate capitalist uh rates of uh profit. Basically uh get away from the because remember capitalism throws up these structures to allow it to work the governing structures like the the post-civil war state that we've inherited the the administrative State. Built in the during the Gilded Age. Uh was the situation where the capital that had built up over the Civil War and then was then uh invested in the construction of our rail infrastructure built the American administrative state. It essentially hired people to carry out the role of government and that has been what the government has done ever since that's why they started taking a document the Constitution which already enshrined private property and extending that logic to the personhood of Corporations. This is metaphysical stuff and it's all grounded in what the austrians are able to because they are mentals of this. They are able to meld my mouth with capitalism and see it from capitalism's point of view which is the economy goes up.

It goes down the Beast consumes and it is consumed you start building a bunch of stuff people stop buying it causes a crisis. There is a deflation then it's built back up. Having learned and every step is an evolution towards a perfection. How the human toll of that which is every one of those collapses is thousands of people committing suicide people losing their homes people starving how it gets worse. The farther back. You go obviously like you get to the point where this is causing people to kill each other in origins of violence.

In some cases that outcome is to the Austrian beside the point. It doesn't matter if that happens or not that's what what God has decreed and for you to try to mitigate. It is to commit sacrilege in a real sense like that is the that's what the austrians think. But that's because it is and it is a schizophrenic delusion of the middle class mind created by the contradictions inherited trying to turn the market into a God that by its definition was the uh social. Uh expression God in the Middle Ages was a social expression of the dream for uh Universal Harmony. That is what Christianity expressed but that and it it had and it was uh you know on top of that abrahamic literary tradition. If we will like read ourselves into the belief in a god collectively and then we will live our belief together that will harmonize everything between all people that strained under it was always under the stress of the reality of living in Europe and then that stress caught up to it and was exacerbated and it's and that structure was destroyed in the 17th century. But a new God was born but its social logic is still Christian which means that everybody who has that in them is basically a schizo and that schizophrenia is going to manifest itself depending on how much pressure it's put under. There. You go got some light back in here and of course.

Liberal keynesianism has its own fantasies at the heart of it that can't confront the deeper reality that the austrians will like keynesianisms are austrians in denial uh as long as you have accepted the inviability and Eternity of the market. Then you will be constrained Marxism though is is the extension of that vision of universal Harmony. The survival of it within the heart of capitalism and in fact built by capitalism to supersede capitalism. You really can look at it as like Moses Christ Marx and then Lenin but honestly really trafficking and the fact that Trotsky did end up getting ax through the head and his name sort of tarnished by his legacy turned into sort of a joke. It kind of shows you you know what happened. We were the spark was put out socially reproducibly but not individually.

We all still hold the spark within us and it's our job to reignite it and a new profit will emerge. Because the Russian Revolution was trotsky's. It was really it was Lenin's and it couldn't have happened without Lenin but Lenin as Avatar and accelerant but as a idea the rush and as a executable plan. The Russian Revolution was trotsky's. This is not something I think that can be argued when you look at the fact that in 1905 Lenin wasn't even in St Petersburg During the Revolution but Trotsky is there literally building the petrograph Soviet that will be the model of social organizing that overcomes the Cyrus state in 1917. Like he is there to building the model which is a Soviet the committee and it's his frankly uh Supernatural Charisma that holds it together. He's there at the petrograde Soviet speaking every day holding giant crowds together fusing experience into a ball of action people who trust one another who have been forged by having heard the  sake. But he was embodied in Lenin who showed up in St Petersburg and while everybody else is going um. I don't know what said no we're doing this. It's happening now. This is our chance and shotsky did execute the St Petersburg Revolution too. He was uh the guy whose planet was who coordinated it among the military organizations and then literally he commanded the Red Army. During the  Civil War. He won the war he was the revolution Lenin coordinated. Lenin suppressed the egos of the rest. Lenin embodied the project but it was trotsky's.

He was the soul of the machine problem is that after they win they don't get the promised land because remember he's a prophet. He's here to tell you that the day of the day has come just like Jesus did but what happened it didn't didn't happen. Prophecy failed and prophecy will fail and continue to fail until it doesn't but that does not invalidate the profit because we live in the world. They build doesn't matter if they were charlatans or anything it doesn't matter if their words were lies. It doesn't matter if their miracles were frauds. We live in the world where those are real but they make because they made them real through their actions and Trotsky did that until he couldn't anymore because once you don't get the World Revolution that they all depended on there's tons of quotes you don't have to argue with me on this. This is not no one I don't understand the people if you understand that this Bolsheviks themselves thought that the Russian German Revolution had to follow the Russian to validate. The Russian Revolution had to in their minds. The Russian Revolution as a project would fail if there was no German Revolution which means everybody who came after to defend the Soviet Union is a revisionist which makes it hilarious when unrestricted like uh. Uh internet stalinists call people revisionism revisionists as soon as you have a situation where there's a  Soviet Soviet power in the absence of a German Revolution you don't have what the Bolsheviks imagine but what do you do do you how do you climb off the horse and there were several answers to this question that were available at the time. The two main ones were uh do the job of capitalism and uh pull the peasants from their land for the job of uprooting the peasantry which all capitalist states have to do and which is the crime crime of the capitalist states that all the other crimes are built on top. We got to do it that was the view of the left that was the view of uh Trotsky among others with uh Zenovia and uh then you had bakarin the right. Deviationists who say that's not our job historically doing that job invalidates the rest of our job. We can no longer be the thing that we were trying to bring into being if we do that. So we have to buy off The Peasants even at the cost of us becoming capitalist which you know what maybe we won't so let's keep it give it a try now. I don't think bukharan would have gotten what he wanted.


I don't think it would have stepped down peacefully. The thing would have collapsed under the weight of the contradictions and Heron in trying to do that especially with outside pressure on the Soviets but who knows maybe that means that the headquarters of opposition to capitalism can be manifested. Somebody better than the  asset of the Soviet goddamn Russian Union maybe the German uh uh response to the Great Depression isn't the Nazis. It's the unified working class of Germany taking power. Now you can't blame the Russians for doing that because they didn't know it was going to happen but you also can't take these things and remove them from context of each other. Now that was a big controversy in Germany. In the 80s the the history War uh and it was about what did to what degree the the Nazis were response to the rise of the Bolsheviks uh and it was coded through this. This reactionary lens where everybody was saying that was a reactionary who was at the very least sympathetic to the fascists and probably just crypto Nazis but that's because you're trying to filter this through some moral lens instead of looking at it just as a matter of action and reaction and physics. There's nobody's fault that didn't mean that the the the Nazis were good to do what they did the deformed workers.

State of the Soviet Union was still Superior in every way to the capitalist West. It was but maybe without that boogeyman. There's no split in the working class of the rest of Europe and again the Bolsheviks thought it was going to happen. They thought that they assumed it was going to happen because why they were fired by trotsky's prophetic vision and you need a prophetic Vision to get across the finish line but then history takes over and you have to respond to history and the response that you could have predicted. Happening is that people in power don't give it up and the thing is though Trotsky could never have carried out what Stalin did because it would have broken his vision of what communism was and so instead he just froze and he waited to be removed from Power because he didn't have the will to go through with what he knew had to happen. If the Bolshevik state was to persist and that's the big if that we can talk about he wasn't psycho enough at the end of the day. It it just so happened that while this bunch of uh enthusiastic prophecy addled honestly Mystic Christians the Bolsheviks. These are Messianic Jews. However you want to want to put it like first century. Christian type guys anabaptists that's who the Bolsheviks were of course. Protestants. Socialism is the continuation of protestantism but Catholics first or Orthodox whatever grounded Church abstract Church.

Eventually the market becomes your God one way or the other. He is either God or he's Satan and he has to be grappled with or submitted to. Those are the choices and we live now at the end of History where everyone at every level of power has made the choice against their own will in many cases to worship the god of capital. So instead of allying with bukharan and backing the peasantry which she should have probably done. He just waited for the one the serpent in the garden. This Thug. This guy who was not some uh uh belief filled uh vessel who had experienced some combination of uh of in ingest treatment by the state either as a dissident or as a worker because there weren't workers at the top level of the Bolsheviks uh and also just fire and all of that fired by like a shared religious view of humanity. Stalin was a a lumpin proletarian Thug. He was a gang leader but again if Trotsky the only guy who could have maybe steered the thing away from the Bloodshed that was to come if Trotsky can't do it and he's going to help eliminate bukharin and then stand there with a bunch of people who he can't lead. If that's the only guy left at that point. Of course you picked Stalin of course you do socialism in one country. What's there's at this point.

There's no alternative and this is why traffic is to this day split off all the time because they are waiting for deliverance to save them from having to make to having to go against their beliefs and he did it. He the Mad lad did it. He created a deformed worker state to use trotsky's terms that was in the capitalist World system that extracted Surplus but really did that through a State mechanism that socialized profit for the most part. It was a genuine alternative to Western capitalism but instead of as it was envisioned by Marx and Trotsky and Lenin which would be a capitalist a state capable of industrially producing and capturing Surplus would have been on top of a sophisticated Machinery of capitalist capitalist production that had been built up over generations of dispossession of peasantry both in Europe and outside of it primitive accumulation. But we didn't get that we got this other thing this this machine belching blood but what else was going to be able to fight off the annihilating threat of fascism. That's why I think that retrospectively everybody who was in the Communist Party in the United States and who stuck with them through the through World War II was correct to do so. I don't think that any amount of Horrors that you can list about stalinism can change the basic fact that by that point in world history you had a Global the first Global cat crisis within an economic system because there had never been a truly global economy before you'd had a global trade networks but nothing like what we had by the mid 20th century. Global economic crisis and two social structures exit one settler. Colonial capitalism in North America and Imperial Finance capitalism injury in Europe extended all over the world dominating and warping every other surface of the globe spreading everywhere opening everywhere defaming everything melting everything solid into oil into uh air and then you had the Soviet Union built on bloodshed but not fundamentally enthralled to Capital and uh profit private profit Capital as a social life because that is what builds what that what maintains capitalism is people going to jobs filling holes in a machine and pressing buttons connecting relays and they do that because of the social context that pushes them in that direction it animates people and they had stomped that out in the Soviet Union but they. Still had to extract profits.

They still have to exploit labor because they were in a capitalist World system and competing with other capitalist powers that meant that they were bound eventually to be destroyed. It would never be able to win because it could never defeat capitalism on those terms for a few years after the Soviet Union. After the second world war it kind of looked like Khrushchev was going to do it. People hate him now because look what happened but uh that push the switch from production to consumption in the Soviet economy that people blame Khrushchev for and call them. A revisionist for doing was inevitable because they had built this system and were now part of a global economic order headquartered in the West. That was in the process of de-politicizing its working class through the distribution of uh Surplus taking profit that had been profit and public and giving it uh publicly in the form of subsidies for uh homes uh. High union wages whatever are they going to do with that money they were given products to buy with it and that can replace the Lost political power. You had in your workplace well if you if you allow more workers in the Soviet Union to have workplace power they're going to want to work less they're going to want to be spend less time doing stuff. They don't want to do as any human would that is how they will um. That's one of the ways that they will Factor their self-interest in running their economic activity. But the state can't afford that because that could reduce profits just as it would under capitalism now in the Soviet Union. Those cap those profits are being put towards the war effort are being put towards the the the the people's business. But they are still they still deny the possibility of creating real workplace democracy in the Soviet Union. So what do they have to the only thing they can do is match match the Western powers on their own terms and provide an exchange for workplace control.

The ability to enjoy consumer goods and once you do that you take conf uh real military conflict off the table which you have to do because of the bomb which is why the bomb is what Dooms us I think David Lynch has got that one nailed the bomb is what Dooms us as soon as the bomb is built in a capitalist state. It ensures that capitalism will never be defeated from within because somebody will push the button to destroy it uh to prevent it from coming into public hands before that happens because capitalism is fundamentally a death drive to try to to try to uh deal with that fundamental contradiction of a uh belief in God Market uh that is divorced from sociology of sociality of any kind and that means that if you've gotten rid of Sociology as a concept you've gotten rid of reconciliation and so that means death Cannot Be Imagined so it must be sublimated and so the prospect of of uh of Communism even if it would liberate you in real way and transform you in Revolutionary Ways towards love that would mean the annihilation of your ego self which you Worship in place of the god. That is absent that's as worse than death that is submission to another that can only destroy us it can only torture us. It can only send us to hell because look what we've done we cannot be reconciled so we must be destroyed so that when it comes it comes from the aside and it comes in the in the fight and it comes without a chance to reflect upon it. Which is what we really fear is is reflection and capitalists. People who actually do capitalism every day are further from the light than anybody so this Prospect of of losing their uh. The centrality of their personhood is to annihilate their sense of self and that is so scary that they would rather be annihilated from without because the reason that we the Cold War ended without a exchange of nukes is because as hor as horrible as the Soviets were portrayed for what they did.


In the 30s. It was still too Humane of a system two countenance nuking anybody like when they when they launched when they when they detonated the uh this uh Soviet h-bomb Khrushchev was beside himself for like a week he was nauseous and if you look during the course of the of the uh of the Cold War. There are three or four occasions uh at least two that I know of where the discretion of a single Soviet officer prevented nuclear war from happening during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The political commissar Who You'd think would be the most like the Soviet version of a doctor Strangelove uh Buck turgidson Jack D Ripper type on a Soviet sub. Uh uh over ruled the order to launch a launch a missile during the blockade Showdown during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The political officer imagine what the political officer if we'd had one in the 1950s and early 60s would have done in that case watch. The film uh Crimson Tide for any idea he'd be dying to launch the nukes blast off and then in the 80s there was a a case of a so. There was a reflection from snow or or a thunderstorm into the lens of a Soviet satellite that made it look like there was a inner incoming pod of nuclear missiles that were going to hit the Moscow and he just said nope. It was his call whether or not to report those and he said nope. Stanislav Petrov I believe his name was there's I don't think there are any American cases any that have been revealed. Maybe there are but in the long run I just don't trust the American system to put people next to the button as things get worse who aren't more and more psychotically dedicated to worshiping this death. Machine MacArthur did want to Nuke China that is correct. He made it his business to try to to nudge the American government into doing that and uh Nixon both mooded the idea of nuking China or nuking uh okay. So Nixon is is really. It is a miracle. We survived him being president because when he was vice president he recommended giving the French a nuke to save them at bien. Bianfu I don't know how you drop a nuke on a Siege line and not kill everybody in the within the season lines but that was his suggestion to Eisenhower. Then when he was president he both talked to Kissinger about nuking North Vietnam or if not doing that bombing all of the dams which would have flooded the countryside and killed millions of people. He said I you got to understand Henry. I don't give a goddamn about civilian casualties. He also during Watergate got shit-faced and thanks to a incident with an American plane in North Korea. I think he actually gave the order to Nuke North Korea but they just didn't pay attention to it. They just ignored it. That's why I always imagined the what if if he had actually been elected president 1960.

How does he not end up pressing the button over the Cuban Missile Crisis or at the very least authorizing an invasion of Cuba that brings the Vietnam War uh half World closer to the to America's doorstep right to America's doorstep and accelerates the the uh the timeline of the 60s by like four years and MacArthur was very bullish on nuking uh China during the Korean War Curtis LeMay who was a head of Strategic Air Command for a long time bombed the hell out of Japan during World War during World War II. He was George Wallace's running mate in 1968 and the third party American Independent ticket and he recommended nuking China to win the Vietnam War hadn't lost that one which is very funny because the Chinese really didn't trust the Vietnamese at all because the Nationalist conflict between Vietnam and China trumped their Cold War alliances which happened basically everywhere and proved that that the model that emerged out of the mid-century the the compromise between uh nationalism and capitalism was was the curtains for World socialism. But by the mid 60s the Chinese were pretty. Simple were pretty uh skeptical of Vietnamese. They were getting most of their support from Russia and in fact China invaded Vietnam. In 1970 uh nine I believe after they invaded uh Cambodia and over through the Khmer Rouge which is one of the most one of the very few uh like black and white good guy bad guys Wars in world history. It's like up there with the American Civil War the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia because yes the cambodians kept bombing the border and making incursions into Vietnam and and poking at him with a stick but they also did stop them from doing The Killing Fields you know and it made China decide to punish them by invading North Vietnam or the northern Vietnam. At that point it was one country and they did take a big chunk of Northern of like 40 mile Corridor North North Vietnam Northern Vietnam and they destroyed a lot of the infrastructure. There that you know Vietnam took a long time to repair but they absolutely did not get what they thought they were going to get. It was very similar to 2006 when the Israelis invaded Lebanon like they were able to blow some stuff up and make some incursion but they could not end up holding anything or changing the dynamic. Fundamentally the Chinese got humbled. There. They got their they got punched in the nose and it's funny. That's the last war that China has fought too. We talk about how America's military is soy China's base like they haven't fought a war in 40 years what was the calculus behind the CIA supporting the Khmer Rouge. They were against the Vietnamese and therefore the Russians and at that point china was following DC's uh foreign policy line uh. It's actually pretty embarrassing the maoists don't like talking about at least they shouldn't. But in the 70s the Chinese supported the American side in all of the main Cold War hot spots and they actually were one of the first governments to recognize Pinochet in Chile after the coup and so the Chinese are supporting Khmer Rouge along with the United States against the regional Rivals of Vietnam and China or China or Vietnam and Russia yeah. The  Chinese were on the apartheid side in all the African wars.

They were supporting South Africa against Cuba and the Russians pretty bad not good. I mean the United States supported Pakistan over India because India was committed to doing a a state socialist developmentalist project and they had the ability to actually carry it off so they were of course not going to support America and the American line uh. Universally they were going to have to be negotiated with whereas Pakistan could be much more easily overrun. Because India was not it was. It was softly Soviet aligned but of course and that of course also fed into the conflict between the Soviet Union and China because China and India had a border dispute and still do those guys will fight each other up in the  so they were close so the India was close to the uh the Soviets and also was doing wanted to do developmentalism. You know and uh didn't. They didn't do great and why because they didn't do what the Soviets did they did not uproot their peasantry. They arrived to Western capitalists. Nation state status too late to Avail themselves of that possibility that was a 19th century thing if you tried doing it in the 20th in Asia or in Europe uh or you got your. You got checked if two other people than your own of course is what I'm saying the the Russians were able to do what they did. Because they had this massive nation-state they could act act within it independently but you can't upset the apple cart by invading other countries and taking their. By the 19th by the 20th century that's off the table and so since India gets this you know soft democracy instead of a Marxist leninist. Uh a state machine and it's fueled by you know millions and millions of votes to these clientist networks that are all connected to rural Village. Life. You're never going to upgrade the peasantry because they got Gandhi instead of uh Lennon or rather. I guess there wasn't a Lenin to go with Gandhi. Like uh like Trotsky had Lennon and of course there was still horrifying violence like the the partition of India is is this and Pakistan is a blood curdlingly horrible historical moment with mass violence. Millions killed pogroms across the border as as people moved in huge populations one way or the other but that was a nationalist imposition that was not internal conflict. Internal conflict soothed outward which meant uh not developing which meant allowing rural networks to sustain themselves and not uprooting that  passenger because the Marxist Vision that that was the continuation of Christianity and and was and guys like Trotsky thought they had perfected was a situation where capitalism concentrates in one place the machines for human Liberation. It builds a technological State structure connected to a regime of actual labor-saving technology and and energy technology capable of uh spreading about allowing uh physical labor basically to be democratically decided upon which you otherwise can't do because everyone's going to vote not to work because work sucks but that's not going to be developed you know uh it's not gonna. Every place in the world isn't gonna get that at the same time one specific point in on Earth is going to get that first and when it does its internal politics will become so crisis written that the numerically Superior working class at uh. Numerically the superior working class wielding mechanisms of power built within the system takes it over but then there's got the rest of the world.

What is that what happens there in the in the communist Horizon. There is that you get a European Revolution that then finishes the work started by imperialism but with the aim of developing peripheral parts of the world economy without exploitation redirecting Surplus created at the center outward democratically starting with Rush Germany taking its capacity sending it over to Russia because we had sort of something like a peasantry but we never had to. I mean they weren't really peasants. They were you know this American Yeoman thing whatever but they were landowners small landowners and there were tons of them in this country and they now mostly been replaced by agriculture agribusiness conglomerates but they went peacefully because they were mostly kicked off The Land by uh advances in tractor technology. Like the one of the biggest things that caused the Great Migration of Southern blacks to American in America to Northern cities was the introduction of uh machine harvesting of cotton yeah. It was racist but it had been racist there. For Generations. It's never not been racist. In the 20s it was racist and there were less jobs to go for people to work the fields now under capitalism. Those people are dispossessed under communist development. Those tractors come in and they allow people who still live on the land and live with each other communally to enjoy the fruits of that and to allow the social structures that exist to remain as they are and to be integrated into socialism not having to be rendered into pieces by capitalism.

But we missed that chance we're not in the world where that happens I do kind of think. There is one where it does. But this doesn't really mean anything it's just gibberish. It's all in our heads but what is it. But I do think there is one we're not in it. Though instead the entire world had to be uprooted and now we have to reforge Civic bonds and ideas of what harmonious relationship to the world around us is and then live those values. It's a very tall order but it's essentially meaningful. Maybe. We respond to the the crisis of the 21st century by burying these archaic social forms and rebuilding in a collaborative fashion taking the machines that are left the capacity that remains uh and democratically wielding them. The only problem is is that there's no way you get that without huge huge huge horrifying loss of life and collapse of social structures in huge parts of the world but for me. If you imagine there is a horizon beyond that possibility which is all we can ever fear right. That's as much as we can fear. We can't always we can't go to the world blows up. That's easy collapse is as far as we can take our imaginations and even if we accept what that means if we look at history. People have lived in those conditions before live through those conditions. Before that is what human existence has been. We're only horrified Beyond mind of it because we cannot conceptualize it. Because we are protected from it. We haven't lived close enough to the Bone those of us who tell our cultural stories again and move the cultural Wheels and so the prospect of that becomes oh I gotta roll up into a ball. Now we Han and Phil lived through more you have to have faith in ourselves and if you have an idea that this what I've been talking about is possible. Then you have to have a faith that it can happen at any point you're stuck with that and the problem with that is that it it implies hey I have to direct my actions in one way or the other. I have to do something that conforms to these beliefs. And I know that my I struggle and I get despondent because I don't know what to do. But I also have enough in my life that tethers me to uh safety and and warmth and conviction that I can keep going so yeah.

I'm going to choose to love as lame as that is. It's. It's a punt but we're all punting. We're all punting here. It's all punting here. The real action is not going to be and can't be processed that way and we can only come to terms with what that means we have to cut a lot of connections. We have a lot of labidinal connections. We have between our consumption and our lives and it's painful and it. It feels like an existential threat to who we are as people but there's something on the other side of it that's better. There's a person on the other side of that that is still you but capable of much more than you could ever imagine that you could be that sounds incredibly. Cheesy and I'm very sorry. It sounds like some Tony Robbins  shoulder to the door jamb when time comes that's it bye.
