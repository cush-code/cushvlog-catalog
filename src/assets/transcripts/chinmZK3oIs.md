Someone's sweeping. I think next door hey there. We are the people are here they're coming. I'm exiting host mode once again. That's the trick of the twitch trade when you end when you start one of these. It says enter exiting host mode at least what does when I do it. I think that means we're no longer hosting someone else's channel and we're now doing our own. It feels kind of weird though because I mean I am entering host mode like this is me being the host of my little backyard. tent revival. It tells me that I'm exiting host mode so it's very counter-intuitive. So now. I have entered the host mode. I have entered and exited. The host mode simultaneously thank you.

I did this myself. I cut my own hair. It was because of the last episode we did in the office. I saw that it looked like. I was getting some sort of horrifying mullet. I had to take care of that can't have it can't have a henry can't have it yes. I just. I have a clipper and I just do it myself. It doesn't have to be perfect. Now. I grew up. I grew up at a time when the mullet was was the archetypally terrible haircut. It was a symbol of of epic fail. So I still have that instinctive response to it when I see it curving out in the back. Oh god no gotta stop. Maybe. It's you could argue that it's buried like classism you know because it was. It's of course coated around whiskey tango white trash as it were you know wife peter and mullet that kind of thing. Achy breaky heart ronnie dobbs who missed your show so yeah maybe I should just get a mullet in solidarity with the white working class. Although does anybody really wear them anymore. I mean now it's kind of ironic right do people wear mullets anymore not ironically.

I don't even know. I haven't watched enough tic tocs to know what's really going on in the heartland which is what it's good which is what's good for tick-tock just getting a put it being able to dip a ladle into the american primordial ooze and see what's cooking so tomorrow is going to be a hell of a day. I think. I'm going to stream on my birthday. Hey birthday boy maybe I'll wear a little hat and then me and I think at least brendan will see if someone all shows up are going to be in the in here for our portion of the debate commentary and I will be I'm not sure yet we'll see what I'll do. I am very very very ready to be wildly disappointed to there to be nothing enjoyable about this thing to find that we have reached a point where reality is at the worst possible point where it is so drained of of metaphor. We're so we're so accelerated towards pure representation of reality or purer anyway than we previously had in terms of our culture that the unexpected can't happen anymore the the truly unhyper-normalizable thing.

The thing that can't be digested instantly into the stream is impenetrable essentially impossible and um. I would say that and when say you say hey what does that mean you know because I'm basically saying well yeah. Trump and biden could have some epic hilarious fails but how does that change from any we've seen before. It's just we're getting more of the same. I think the dream the secret dream of people when they imagined like a thing like a biden trump debate. An abstract was something that breaks the wall like one of them having their teeth fall out of their head entirely maybe and fall onto the into their lap. One of them actually themselves jerry nadler style but we're not going to get that and even if we get some amazing brain front moments. Another thing we're not going to get is like a ron paul moment which would be again amazing or if they just made out that would also work ron paul's fine.

I had the spicy mcnuggets they were okay. They were a little brittle. They didn't they weren't quite as tender. I mean that's a funny word to say for you know chicken slurry but there's like a more kind of crispness beyond the point where it was like a separation between the coating and the and the almost dehydrated seeming nugget. It was okay that's fine. I think I would just stick with the regular nuggets honestly. I did not use the mighty hot sauce. I used my my beloved korean sauce honestly. I prefer like the morning star heights. Chicken nugs the veg. The veg vegetarian ones to the to the taco to the to the um to the spicy nugget. Not to the original. The original nugget has its own beauty to it. It's one of those perfect perfect products. It's like a flavored nugget like a flavor puck designed to hit your no in your mouth in such a way to cause everything to just shut down.

I do hope that I do hope that biden strikes the thing I'm hoping happens and think might. Happen is that biden tries to get epic tries to tries to obviously tee up a john's conceived viral moment. But of course he will probably botch it which will be pretty funny. It is amazing to hear that biden paid three million dollars in taxes especially considering that he's he was always one of the less wealthy members of the senate. It really does go to the to the just the sick reality that he is selling out. He's tore himself out. He's cored himself from within and turned himself into a a puppet of the fire sector but not even in exchange for extravagant riches. Like other people have like mitch mcconnell. He's made like a hundred million dollars since joining the senate he's got stacks. he's like moving weight. Biden got a amtrak windbreaker and and he got jobs for his otherwise unemployable kid which that's not nothing.

But he just has such a low asking price and he's paying all those taxes like a damn sucker. I mean. I guess it's because he's a politician and he doesn't know the ways of of the real estate game where it's all smoke and mirrors and trickery and a lot of people are going to think like trump not paying. Taxes does make him smart and he's using his smarts for my benefit which is of course that's the stupid part but all cons involve like exploiting the greed of the mark. In this case it's thinking hey trump got rich by screwing people over and avoiding taxes and playing cutthroat. He's gonna do it on my behalf now and if you believe that you're a sucker but the reasoning is still there and most importantly the reason. He doesn't have a lot of competing claims other than the democrats saying I'll hear you I'll listen to you. I'll hold your hand while you are administered. The euthanasia shot which is all the democrats offer. I mean. I think the real the real thing to point out is how he just has used being president to like bail out his business which is pretty funny just total corruption on behalf of himself while being president and of course.

His base isn't going to care about that and it is really weird to me how every time there's a big thing about trump people feel the need they're compelled by powers beyond even their own understanding to say his base won't care ah yeah. They're they're his base that's that's axiomatic that's you don't need to even say that obviously they won't care they're his base and maybe it's because they don't realize what that means now because you know the last republican president who oversaw a huge economic disaster left office with like a 25 approval rating and I think people believe that implying that there was some sort of crack which in within like the greater republican base of like you know 42 43 percent of the voters and I don't think that's possible anymore because the collapse of legitimacy of institutions like the media is so complete now has been replaced by this. This choose your own adventure. Game of social media means that to be a base is to by definition never believe anything bad about the person you're the base of because it's all the product of the media lying that's the that's a prefab guarantee that they will nev. Nothing will ever me reach them and so it's weird when people just insist on reminding everyone that and I think it's because they have some traumatized belief that base like that means a governing majority of voters or like a governing. I guess you'd say a governing minority voters that would be able to like hold power. And I don't think that that's the case the election is going to be decided as it always is in the margins and those people are by definition not trump's base.

The question really is just how many of them are still carrying the vote and that'll be the difference between trump winning again and biden of course. Accepting things like electoral shenanigans and bush v gore style soft coos soft kooz. Ku's so soft that nobody even calls them that and nothing changes and the political system is not rent asunder. In some sort of apocalyptic confrontation.

I've never visited harper's ferry. I think I would like to like to see the pump house hope. It's still there but like I said if it's if. It's if it's bush v gore two.

That's not the that's not the suspension of democracy people are imagining. It will be you might say that now but I guarantee you if it as it happens. Is it winds its way through the courts as outrageous as it's going to be and as much as you would say that this is a coup. In september you would like lay this out as a nightmare abrogation of democracy step by step. It is going to be stage managed by the two parties to maintain a veneer of legitimacy which means we'll never reach that point where there is a popular consensus. If such a thing could even be mustered around the idea that democratic real democratic principles of and constitutional governance had been abrogated the same way that it did with bush versus gore which most people took to be the legitimate outcome of a legitimate electoral process as laid out in the constitution and interpreted by the judicial branch and it would be a similar thing here now it would be more resistance than bush versus gore had certainly and there'd be a lot of protests but considering how many protests we've had this year it'll get swallowed in that larger narrative and we will just have another trump term and it will not be. It will not be the the tearing of the veil of maya that people are kind of fantasizing about funniest jfk. The funniest conspiracy theory jfk was killed by a secret service agent tripping and his rifle going off that's a funny conspiracy theory. It's also one of the more forensically convincing theories of the case of course that doesn't change any of the other questions. Like there could have been a man on the grassy knoll and the bill that killed kennedy was fired accidentally by a secret service agent.

You know. I have not read read mars not. I've heard a lot of good things about kim stanley robinson. But I have not listened. I've never really been a huge sci-fi literature fan. I'm trying to think.

I'm thinking about maybe changing that but it's it's a it's definitely a gap shakespeare authorship shakespeare. What come on get out of here. Shakespeare wrote the plays. I prefer the the argument about whether shakespeare was secretly catholic which I think might be the case because it's hard to imagine protestant england that time creating a shakespeare. I've heard that the theory that beethoven is black comes from the fact that he was from the netherlands or like belgium at a time when it was under spanish dominion. So he was a moor because I think that's it which I don't think is even accurate. That's not even true like the dutch had already gotten independence by the time he was he was born oh. This is a good one who's better berthoven or carpenter oh boy that's a tough one they're both like obviously very just perfect. Kind of stylists like auteurs were able to shape like that content expertly without making a big show about it or even necessarily having like a trademark look which is hard to do like like escape from new york. I don't really like that one I think I might go for hoven. I think I go for a hoven. A carpenter is is close.

I gotta watch darkstar thank you for reminding me. I need to watch darkstar. I have not watched the coming rule yet we're gonna watch it the whole thing for midweek from the patreon episode. So tune in for that virgil watched it live and he had some amazing posts. There's. They actually have a line of dialogue about about like general flynn going to a an event sitting next to jill stein like a russian guy talking about that it's pretty funny. It's it's purely like a pure lib delusional fantasy which will be fun to see the and I'm there's gonna be a lot of a lot of paint huffing going on because in the near future because sorkin's coming out with a movie about the chicago seven trial which will of course be awesome make a lot of good points about the need for being mature and realistic when dealing with political issues and not indulgent and childish like certain over-enthusiastic leftists. Perhaps apparently though. Sorkin was pitched this movie by spielberg and he had not heard of it. He had not heard of the case which is amazing like he's. He's a fetishist for that whole era and yet he didn't even know about it that means that he's just approaching the material with no like previous conception. So that means it's going to be purely based on his reaction to the current moment. So it's going to be just a perfect old man yelling at cloud type deal. It's going to be great. Abby.

Hoffman is going to be the face of the bernie bros and poor put upon straight-laced effective. Tom hayden is going to be hillary or something oh. Apparently they've been making this movie for 20 years holy. Yeah jeff daniels being like sorkin's ideal version of himself is pretty funny the guy from dunn and dummer who pooped all over the toilet. That's that's his embodiment of his own like best delusional version of himself and the sad thing is jeff. Daniels is a good actor who I generally enjoy in his work. I'm usually pleased to see him in things having to watch him. Just spit out that sorkin dialogue all the time it's brutal joel or mike. I'm always joel because he's who I started with so mike seemed like an interloper. I could never judge them honestly because it's the same way that like trace bilio is the voice of crow like there's like three voices of crow and and and like kevin. I know kevin murphy was the second tom servo but to me. He's the only thompson hero. Just because that's the configuration I i was introduced to at the most formative period so everything is going to be. Everything else is going to feel slightly off because there's a very early imprinting show. This is very. I mean I'm not alone in that obviously that show is very very important to my. I don't know sensibility developing it's getting dark out.

Here. I might have to bring out the christmas tree lights again that's an interesting question somebody says why don't german americans have the same weird fixation on their their their heritage. The way that irish people do. I think a lot of it is where they settled the irish clung to the coast I mean obviously not only but because they were because of when they showed up they They ended up clogging up the northeast and staying in the in these like ethnic ghettos. Basically whereas the germans kind of spread themselves more thinly across the midwest. where you know there was.

There was german like cultural identity around things like beer halls and stuff but and you know german language. Media persisted for a long time but there was less of a sort of a self-reinforcing ethnic identity that you that you get in like an urban setting I'm gonna plug in the light. Here it's getting dark. Also there was world war one and world war ii which had their own effects on on german identity. Like there was a genuine ginned up ethnic hysteria against germans during world war. One not only did they change the name of sauerkraut to liberty cabbage. But there were attacks hate crimes lynchings even of germans during that period which and a lot of places changed a lot of german name. Places in the midwest changed the from to something else. There's a suburb of milwaukee called new berlin and I'm almost positive that used to be pronounced new berlin and that's I think world war. One. Maybe they decided to change the pronunciation although if anyone knows that that's not true. I'd like to know it if anyone has a more history on that because I always think it's interesting that it's always everyone calls it new berlin. No not a single person calls it new berlin. Even though that's obviously what it was and then of course world war. Ii doesn't help you know you do the holocaust.

It's a little harder to walk around in later housing and there were a bunch of very self-aware. German americans whose contribution to the culture in the 40s wasn't in 30s and 40s was not st patrick's day parades. It was booned rallies so once again not good. Also you have the fact that there isn't a unified german and part of that thing of them. Leaning to coast is that there's more of a unified like irish or at least self-perceived notion of an irish immigrant experience you know coming into the city not getting a job. No irish need apply going to fight world war.

You know like gangs in new york going to fight the civil war and then becoming a cop or a ward healer or or yeah. the whole like passion play of the immigrant experience which italians have a similar version of jews. Also all those all the east coast culture makers whereas out in the hinterlands. The germans are just kind of around and coming from different environments you know like there were the germans make up like the biggest I think single ethnic group in the 19th century of immigration but you know at that point for most of it. Germany wasn't even one country and there were different religious divisions and linguistic and and cultural that meant that there was not that you know the thing of getting kicked off of you know the plantation because you there are no more potatoes and having to get in a coffin ship and all that the religious thing is big.

You know. It's saint patrick's day after all and like a lot of the germans where I'm from from the upper midwest specifically like the triangle or I mean the middle midwest. I guess. I mean the upper tier but like the lower half of the upper tier and the middle tier from like cincinnati to to milwaukee to st louis. There's a lot of those are like german catholics but they're not. They weren't. All there's differences between bavaria and you know the prussian palatine or whatever but that is one advantage. One thing that makes german americans on a whole better than irish is because they don't have that for the most part at least not as much and it's really really annoying all these fake irishmen running around oh man aaron sorkin's john brown that would be amazing. I would see that he just uses he does a biblical breakdown with a southerner about why slavery is not supported in the in the new old testament or whatever the guy just kills himself. He doesn't even he chops himself up with a broadsword because he got owned so bad yes the nuenstas massacre. german immigrants in texas lynched for opposing secession and it was german americans who mobilized a militia to prevent missouri from joining the confederacy and of course you got guys like willit and joseph wedemeyer and franz siegel becoming members of the of the high levels of the union army.

Oh man struggle sessions doing a whole thing on lovecraft country. I stopped watching they showed they st there was an episode that I started watching and it was. All it was about people in korea as like a flashback or something and I just thought oh no where what does this have to do with anything. Now like is there. Even any kind of coherent approach to this is or is it just like whack-a-mole like i. I don't even care about the characters you already have introduced me to you're going to introduce me to new ones who are like in a totally different context. No thanks I've not watched raised by wolves. It's on that hbo max. With that also really scott no thank you and I don't care how good. His moods are people say oh he's such a great soap director. He said great creates such great moods. I don't get that either it's not it's not just that he like narratively isn't terribly competent. It's that his whole vibe curation thing also leaves me cold and I feel like some movies like gladiator were just absolutely butchered. I don't I'm sorry. I don't think there's a good action scene in gladiator which is just crazy when you consider the material you had in that thing. I did like the counselor and I'm annoyed that really. Scott made that movie although you know it's just. It's a core mccarthy script.

So it's going to rise or fall on that and I think that movie is maligned. But I think it's. It's got good stuff in it. It's very alienating and depressing and kind of like watching it sort of like chewing on tin foil. But I think that's good. That's what it's supposed to be I love. I just love the fact that that movie ends with cameron diaz saying the line there is no one crueler than a coward and the slaughter to come will probably be beyond our imagining. I haven't seen black hat. Yet. People said it was kind of bad. I never really stumbled upon it anywhere if I find it. I'll watch it. Never really digital man to me is not. It's not as good. I like early man more. I guess so. I never really had a a huge desire to see that one. I can't believe he's still making a movie about enzo ferrari. I thought for sure that that had ended up turning into ford versus ferrari through the development process which happens a lot apparently that awful robin hood movie that ridley scott made speaking of him with russell crowe that originally started off as a alternative take on robin hood that was from the sheriff of nottingham's point of view and over the time it just turned into It turned into robin hood origins even though the last big robin hood movie not the the like in america. Anyway the kevin costner one was already a origin story. It was it's like they're trying to they were trying to shake up the material and they didn't even do it terrible. So I always assumed oh yeah. They want to make this movie about enzo ferrari and over time they said you know there aren't enough americans in this could we bring in those ford guys. Oh this carol shelby character. He seems pretty interesting but apparently they're still making it oh man.

The brewers are in the playoff it's going to be. It's not going to be pretty folks. It's it's a. It's a sham this whole season is a sham honestly like. I said. I don't even know who would want to win this year. That's gotta have an asterisk on it forever oh yeah. The year everyone was getting sick and they were playing in rolling clouds of ash moving across the outfield just the full dystopian hell season who wants to win that. I guess she'll always be You'll always be the answer to a trivia question unless all the seasons are like that from now on because hey who can tell who knows people everyone loved the bubble. Apparently everyone loved. The nba bubble does this season have the same thing because like all right they were they were pretty far along in the season when they when coveted hit and they had to cancel it right. So did they how many games did they even lose so it seems like that one is closer whereas this baseball season where it's like this incredibly this incredibly truncated season where they weren't able even to manage to avoid people getting sick which at least and nba has basically been able to do.

I always knew the nfl would definitely still play. There was no way in hell that the nfl wasn't going to happen that was never on the table we could have like We could have a genuine covert emergency right. Now like the kind of thing people were worried about happening earlier in the year with shortage of ventilators and football happening oh hell yeah. I could imagine them like you know zombie apocalypse playing nf playing nfl games on like aircraft carriers beamed to people and thing you can't dominate in your. I understand why you know it's because the money goes. It's money goes where the center of gravity is not sure. Stanley cup. It's got to be 20 years and then losing and then having cities in kidding me. I remember when the like the closest anyone's come is when the canucks loss to the bruins in my recent memory lane. I really don't think there should be hockey if there's not snow honestly. It's dumb.

Someone asks what ketamine feels like I only have my own experience to go by. But it's basically the opposite of It's essentially the opposite of lsd. Lsd makes you hypersensitive to your surroundings to all that is outside of you makes it incredibly riveting because it like it it boosts your reuptake of of stimuli. Externally. Catamine basically does the opposite and that it makes you hyper focused on your body. way. I can describe it as it feels like you're kind of made of glass or like fiberglass insulation or something and that's why one of the ways you can get ego death and the way that john lily figured out he was going to talk to aliens by. Dolphins is that if you do both it essentially leaves you with nowhere for your brain to go. It's like we are always editing down to a manageable amount the stimuli that we have in our bodies and outside of it because otherwise we would overwhelm literally our sensory apparatus and I think that's. I think that's the reason it's not my stuff really. But it can be. It can be interesting. I can also be therapeutic. I know they use it for They use it in depression cases as they do psychedelics. I don't know what I'm having for dinner tonight not sure all right. We have about 20 minutes left. Here it is for horses. It's hilarious it's a literal horse tranquilizer.

Human beings will do anything. I haven't read that much phil okay dick. I need to correct that like I said sci-fi is a blind spot for me. I usually just like okay. I get the point yeah what if everyone's a robot yeah oh. I get it yeah. They're on mars okay. I have read man in high castle. I read ubiq. I read the short stories which were really poorly written. I thought like very stilted but had really cool ideas in them. All the the the novels are better. I have I might have some of those chicken nuggets.

Those those morning star farms fake chicken nuggets any debate predictions or drinking games. I mean you've got to have a command man in there because he gets very exasperated and honestly the best hope for real entertainment is if biden gets mad if he gets true elder rage which I think would um could really lead to some interesting territory could lead him to start improving which will be of course disastrous. I don't care what drug combo they got him on and of course they have him blitzed out of his goddamn gourd there's no question. I do think though that there's a chance that biden sews up the election with this thing I if he's out there and he is as as zooted as he was in the last debate with bernie. I think the people who are paying attention who aren't there just waving pennants for one side or the other. I think if they if they get reassured that he is. He's not the pick the caricature of a senile doddering out to lunch old guy that he he appears to be they'll vote for him because I do think people want think not just democrats. I think there is a there is a yearning for things to be normal and people might very well associate normality with biden even if it has no content and his campaign has no content. I mean his lead is durable and it hasn't really shifted and it's bigger than hillary's was at this point and it makes me think that this whole thing might end in the most hilariously anticlimactic way possible which is biden winning with relative smoothness which will just leave everybody pinioning their feet after running off the cliff like wiley coyote and I think a good performance of the debate by him in terms of appearing cogent getting off a few good zingers will do it will will be the final like sign off. I mean obviously he has to do it for all three debates but I think it could work.

Consequently. He could do bad enough to blow it like I hate to break up something that is essentially a sterile spectacle. But I kind of think that the the specifics of this race mean that because like obviously the challenger should win this that is not a question given the ejected conditions the challenger should win this race but biden poses specific obstacles. Now the democratic party offers its own set of obstacles namely its inability and unwillingness to provide any reason to vote for them. That's bad that's heart that's like that's one hand high behind their back but that might be enough. It should be enough even with that because just okay you're not you might you're not promising anything. But you're not this guy. You're not the guy who everything up which is how non-base voters cease things usually because remember. It doesn't matter what his base thinks they're the base by definition.

They're not going anywhere and I think that they might sign up for door number two just because hey you know maybe people will stop yelling so much because I really don't think they've succeeded in making biden stand in for antifa or blm or anything. I mean sure biden runs like hell away from the left at any opportunity and I think that also just his presentation of self. This geriatric white guy just who's been around forever and was obama's vp. It makes it very hard for that stick and so the problem is that he is still a guy who barely campaigned a guy who when he comes out in public says embarrassing senile ass. It you know better the devil you know and as a result this might be a consequential debate for once we know for a fact that the debates in 2016 were meaningless because whatever revisionist history you hear at the time it was widely considered and not just by the liberal fake news media that hillary won those debates trump showed up.

He was irratible erratic went on insane tangents. She was mostly on message and I feel like like. There are things pulled out from that later on that formed like a part of a narrative about why he won like when he when she says you know she said something and he replied with you. It's like something about like if I was president if I was president something and he goes if I was president. You'd be in jail and that's a good line. But I think more than anything.

The debates just didn't change the dynamic one way or the other like we were on a glide path. The clinton campaign the candidacy. Her person was such that they were in a terminal decline towards the mountain. They were ignoring all the signals blaring on the side of the mountain and the debates were just another signpost along that way and the media response to the debate saying how good she did was just another thing that helped blind them towards the reality in front of their face. But I think that oh wrong also was very good but wrong and she had a couple of absolute cringe lines and you know she had no answer to his basic accusation of how come everything is bad. You've been in charge for 30 years and that ended up being the only thing that mattered. But that wasn't the debate that made that it was the 30 years you know what I mean whereas this campaign the way it's shaping up.

I think that the people are what the biden needs to close. I hate to sound like one of those schmucks. One of those one of those horse race. But this is I think like the archetypal situation where you have a challenger in a position to win. But there is this fluctuating there's this wateriness to the support and that there's reasons that can't be changed like the platform and like the party they're not going anywhere they're still not going to be offering any alternative to trump. But there's the ones around trump or the runs around biden specifically that can be allayed because way.

More people are going to be watching these debates than any of the stuff that comes after any any any press conferences or or public statements or rallies. I has has it been confirmed that they're going to be in the same room because I haven't been paying attention and my big worry is there's going to be some zoom. Yes they're going to be in the same room okay that just upped the percentage possibility that this thing is really good. That's just I'm a little more optimistic knowing that they're going to be in the same room. That's exciting okay that makes me feel a little better happy birthday to me maybe don't want to get my expectations up. But the thing that really was just killing me was the thought of just a couple of zoom heads waiting for like audio delay or something awful and I really do hope there's a drug test.

Although of course they're not going to agree to do that it's funny like the hillar elizabeth warren kind of proved everybody do not take trump's bait ever and her taking the dna test was idiotic but at the same time god wouldn't you love to see biden say hell yeah. I'll take a piss test. You it is chad versus chad because whatever you want to say about biden. He is in a certain sense chattish in the same way. Trump is you know they're both. These glorious senile decrepit monuments and they have the similar charisma because of that. I'm not saying it's going to make biden win. I'm going to say. It's more likely that sparks will fly that that'll be entertaining like. I told you. I don't. Know who's gonna win and I'm saying biden could do well or poorly and have it affect the outcome. But my only real interest is the entertainment of the thing and them in the same room is more entertaining than them in different rooms who is the most cringe european monarch.

How do you go with anyone other than carlos the bewitched of spain. The guy who's was so inbred that he couldn't chew his food because his jaw was too narrow. He was impotent and had like the iq of a dormouse. They said his heart was the size of a walnut when they did. They they autopsy didn't at like at like 32 when he died. He had just like this high squealy voice. You get very agitated just the perfect final outcome of of of the la of the the finest lines of european royalty maintaining their purity. charles charles the 12th of speeden the guy who would not take no no for an answer against russia and just kept fighting until he just got. He just ruined sweden's position as like a baltic hegemon. I I haven't studied the 30 years war. I read. I've read a few books about it. I can highly recommend stevie wedgwood's book which is was written in the 30s and has a great great style. It's a good one volume. I think the funniest european accent is dutch because she's got that that like sh in there although the castilian lisp is also very funny like an entire language that has a lisp. Swedish accents are very funny especially if you grew up with a swedish chef as a as a key influence. I like to get at the ice cream truck is just the old-fashioned the ice cream with the on a stick with vanilla ice cream on a stick with the with the chocolate shell.

What do you call that that's the my thing maybe a fudgical a dilly bar. That's only a dairy queen. I think although I do like dilly bars someone's asked fdr assassination theories. I are you referring to the to the shooting the attempted assassination of presumably of roosevelt that happened in miami before his inauguration when giuseppe zangara fired on his presidential car and succeeded in killing anton cermak the mayor of chicago because I think there is a There is a theory that rather than it being a failed assassination of fdr. That it was an intentional assassination of cermak under the cover of an assassination of fdr. Because cermak had provoked the ire of the chicago mafia that's the only fdr related conspiracy theory. I'm aware of if there's any others let me know favorite fdr portrayal. In film. There aren't any really iconic ones are there like what what like john lithgow played him in that really cheesy tv movie series. From the early 90s. I remember seeing as a kid. It was lithgow as fdr. It was michael kane as stalin which was the best part and bob. Hoskins is churchill which was fine.

But michael kane is stalin was so good I am stolen or bloody stolen mate night. I'm stolen. I did like edward herman and annie that might be my favorite one oy. I'm stolen all right. I'm going to ask one question. John voight in pearl harbor oh man terrible. I do love that that he stands up. He's to give a dress not to the like the people but to the guys in the room. His cabinet gets up just to be like we're gonna kick the out of these japanese. It's really funny. I don't know if fdr is a good subject for a movie because he is he's so inaccessible like he was not a personality who like he was not a president who like wore his He didn't wear his his complexes on his sleeve. Like a guy like nixon or lbj did he was very cool. He was very reserved. Nobody ever really knew what he was thinking and although people say things about dumb guys like trump and bush that they agreed with the last person they talked to. Fdr was the opposite everybody left a meeting with fdr. Thinking that he agreed with them because he always kept his cards completely close to the vest so that makes him an inscrutable protagonist eleanor roosevelt more interesting than from a narrative perspective than fdr.

Certainly oh macarthur. I'll end on this someone asked about the notion of macarthur as america's caesar is so funny and such a perfect example of how like we are as every way is always seeking to create these pathetic cookie cutter poor. Facsimile copies of roman archetypes in america like macarthur was a was an absolute a prissy little. How about that he did not have anything like the The acumen will intelligence character even of a of a caesar or a napoleon. If he's anybody he's charles bolangier the guy who briefly threatened to pull off a sort of bonapartus bonapartist outsider coup on. I think the second french republic before he lost his nerve fled france and killed himself at the grave of his mistress in belgium. All right guys I'm gonna sign off hope.

Everybody's excited I'm going to go take. I'm going to take a lot of nutrients and I'm going to say my prayers. I need my vitamins because tomorrow's going to be either the worst birthday present. I ever got because at this point any chance for transcendent comedy that it doesn't manifest is is one less we're ever going to see because it just seems like we're getting to the point where nothing can be funny because the the the the gap between exaggeration and reality is non-existent so. I will be mourning it if it's not fun. But if it is if it's a good one it'll be my best birthday present ever all right bye-bye.
