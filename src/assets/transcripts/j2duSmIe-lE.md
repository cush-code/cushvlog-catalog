Boston shipping up to Boston now ship it up to Boston near me Austin ship. It up to find my wood and leg remember the drop. Kick Murphys I saw them they got viral recently because uh the guy a guy the guy the lead singer went on a rant about uh the dang trumpers and about Maga and uh. It's this righteous like you know remnant of of uh of you know white ethnic instinctive proletarian. Uh solidarity that used to be a thing in this country but now really only exists as uh as the ornament to you know the identities of otherwise successful. Uh musicians. Artisans you know people who don't have to really work for a living because having to really work for a living. At this day and age. It really grinds you down and one thing it does is. It really strips your ability to think in solituristic terms. At least in this country give it our uh given the cultural context we live in and what we're really allowed to how we're allowed to let our feelings resonate like what we can say around others that will be returned and like in uh and uh elaborated upon and you know that kind of feeling just kind of gets dissolved into nothing and and the real problem is like he's doing this epic rant. Then he's got to say election denying and it's like look yes. The election denial stuff is it's. It is definitely a raising of the stakes for the conservative like reactionary uh uh like baronial Revolt. We have in this country but are any elections not  country and how can you address that you can't you end up just sounding like a Trumper and that leaves anybody else having to stand for the Democratic party which is just to anyone's  snow job. A giant Artistry Factory just like the Republicans are but Republicans are a benefit from the fact that they get to point out that the thing doesn't work. They get to point out that media is crooked. They get to point out that elections are not non-partisan and uh impartial they get to point out the truth they get to look. At this. They get to uh identify the specific nudeness of our institutions and the Democrats cannot. There cannot they because the institutions defend them and not and it leads to this like absolutely incoherent thing now where you see people saying like uh. Putin is this monster that is like a threat that we as a as a country have to defeat and just and in Nazis are a threat in this country that are so big that we have to defeat them.

How do we defeat them by rallying behind the United States government. The thing that conjures these enemies in the first place the the structure of structures that determine all of its resistance all the form of its of its resistance. It gets to determine that that's what being a hegemon means it means that you don't have to face some sort of proletarian resistance as your hegemony falls apart. No you get to fight on the terrain of national bourgeois. The groups of elite  rentiers and predators and vampires grabbing control of whatever resources they can in order to fend off the total proletarianization that's it no solidarity. Beyond just a national projects of national Bourgeois domination resistance to not capitalism but to the financialization. The final. The global homo that they're resisting is not on behalf of the people. It's on behalf of the nation as conceived by the Bourgeois dictatorship that runs it and I'm sorry that cannot ever Encompass socialism. It can never produce socialism. It can never bring work workers who go along for the ride will never get socialism out of it. The answers to Huff gasoline and wait for the end well wait. I mean we're all waiting every day right like we'd live our lives in anticipation of something right. You can't say that's not true so the question is what is your gas. Huffing look like I argue that rooting for one of these parties is huffing gasoline getting it into your head that one of these parties or the other is going to save you from what's coming is the huffing of the  gasoline thinking that Mega communism is going to somehow oh what you don't like the Deep State well. I don't like the Deep State either oh. Let's get together. What does the Deep state mean by the way who defines what the Deep state is not you or some other. Capital you dullards I I don't debate and I would not debate these people because I wouldn't want to raise them up because they are marginal. It doesn't matter it's just people trying to make some money find some group of people who want a story told to them that'll feel good that'll be delicious good smelling gasoline so who am I to stop them. But I also don't want to help them and debating them would only help them.

But I just I don't understand how anyone can make any argument that they are Marxist that they understand things as a uh politics is an expression of material class interests and class conflict and not see that the party structure that not just the party structure. But the entire cultural superstructure that produces Mega cannot be uh uh conquered because what you agree on some abstract issue because that's not what it's composed of. It's composed of cultural affinities produced culturally. The actual spine of policy is determined by money and it's like I'm sorry that's basic narcissist analysis. How do you overthrow that how do you argue. No no no you see we're gonna like Unite with them and just talk to them you're all just voting for Republicans. Any electoral political project means voting and rooting voting for a party and then going online every day to reaffirm your vote that you haven't taken. Yet it won't take for six months or ten months or whatever the  reaffirming it with your expressions of political identity online and fantasizing that you're you're uh engagement in that contest is somehow moving the needle somewhere. So if all you're doing is voting then you're done you're uh your precious ideas about well actually uh in order uh capitalism is what's undermining our ability to create uh. Uh the sort of uh traditional family structures that the that the humble working class of America truly prefer uh. Oh. That's very nice that's a very interesting analysis. What are you going to do with it. You're going to piss it into the ether. Meanwhile the party is going to do what the party does and it's going to frame every resultant misery in culture War terms and all you will end up doing is rooting along for some one flavor of techno uh Craddock uh uh genocide and the thing is. It's like it doesn't.

It doesn't matter if those people the Maga people would be reachable if you sat them all down and got to talk to them or you like worked with them towards a common goal like if you were in a workplace together with them. Now now we're talking now if you're talking about hey. Let's get everybody who works at this Amazon recruitment facility uh or fulfillment fulfillment center uh this Walmart. If we got all these people together to work to better their uh working conditions. My God all of a sudden they're understanding of politics is going to change by doing but that's not what this is a rest. That's not what that's about this is uh. This says uh all that stuff's a distraction the labor movement. The the new thing the new hotness by the way for these people is to say that the uh like the Bolshevik party and uh was never actually driven by uh Union uh uh uh Union organizing in Russia that that it never tailed the labor movement. That's the argument that it was always this like Precious Vanguard. It's like yeah.

The leadership was this like little Diamond of of uh of a doctrinal. Perfection created in these uh you know in in the Oyster Oyster is made in the in the in the uh. I'm sorry. The pearls made in the oysters mouths of London and Geneva or whatever the  we're only ever able to get to do anything because when the war started they were able to address vast swans of Bolshevik party members who were members of the Armed Forces people. Uh Factory workers in large concerns where thousands of people worked and they all lived in neighborhoods right next to each other and that created a network of of idealized like are ideologically um ideologically aligned politically conscious workers. Now yeah the Bolsheviks came along and were able to basically like direct this flow. Not completely uh the July days shows pretty definitively that the the Bolsheviks were only ever like lightly in the saddle of the workers and uh uh troop soldiers movement in in mosque in St Petersburg because in July when Lenin was like it is not time for a  that it's time to go to the streets and the bullshits essentially had to post facto validate that movement in order to maintain their credibility with the workers. It was only after that uh that enter that pulse was beaten back that like the the working class got the message that Lennon and his people had already been able to figure out that it wasn't time yet one time was right they were both ready for it. They were coming at it from either other ends but neither would have been possible without the other. But the crucial thing is is that the party itself would have been powerless without them and the and Maga communism is not about that. The new argument is is that uh X Y and Z don't count as working class therefore should not they're organizing organizing should not be uh considered meaningful.

Uh it should be uh. It's a distraction. No what isn't a distraction is waiting for is rooting for uh. Do they're gonna post the Epic Maca communism uh Act of 2023 where we all get Medicare for all. But there's only two two pronouns and you get one like issued for you by the government and all the Liberals are owned. You think they're gonna pass that you. Not getting some uh attendant Mega communist social welfare system because there's nothing pushing for that. This is all happening in the political realm the two parties that are not driven. From Below they're driven from above but I mean people but I still appreciate and sympathize with that instinct. A little bit because looking at the people who have especially the people who supported Bernie and the primaries who are now grasping to the  Hull of the democratic party desperately trying to turn it into some vehicle for uh for uh working class aspirations. Socialist vision is so sad that I could understand wanting to get as far away from that sort of thing as possible because it is a grotesque spectacle to watch people being like look. Why can't the left take a win okay. We're getting what we want they're doing what they want. They're doing what they think works for them. If there's some  crumbs that fall that you get to pick up congratulations but you had nothing to do with it. You are at the mercy of this party as just a spectator and Rooter for it which is what your politics are your argument explicitly in every page of every. Magazine is this Democratic party and its left side are in some sort of con some sort of uh negotiating position with one another and that means that we're Partners the same way that the ownership and labor unions were.


Partners in the  manufacturing jobs to Mexico what are you going to do about it and because they didn't want to lose their jobs as labor leaders. The labor union said fine we'll talk them into that and they did because by that point the working class was no longer uh asserting their own interests and why this is a perfect segue. Why weren't they able to do that in chapter. Five I believe seven I don't know I'll look it up when we get there in the next chapter of Richard. Lachman's first last passengers on a sinking ship Elite politics and the decline of great Powers. He talks specifically about this question and the world that at the end of this chapter the political realm that he sketches the one we live in the post 90s. One we live in because it was really Clinton who created the bipartisan consensus around neoliberalism and made it an a a a a uh a closed loop foreign by according to lakshman's structural factors within the elite ruler ruling class of America. The array of forces that had sustained uh the post-war American Utopia were compromised were destabilized and constant power concentrated away from sort of a consensus stalemate between different stakeholders and a complete Domination by one group of Elites. These specific Finance Capital Elites within what had been before a more uh unified or uh unified and purpose because of stalemated balance of powers. So this chapter answers the question how did we get that because what happened we've talked about a million times on this show. The big 70 shift but why is the thing that's harder to get at and that Latchman tries to hear sketch out and it's all building on what he had already established in the first all these earlier chapters because it seems weird. He's talking about  the Dutch Republic and he's talking about the English British Empire what's going on it's because he's trying to show in previous iterations of hegemony. How over time. Elite power structures go from uh everyone being sort of aligned in a general uh direction of policy with a a a understanding that it's towards everyone's benefit to a situation where Elites are competing against one another and not for like The Spoils of a system and not trying to keep it moving and that happens during this period as soon as it's born like or as soon as it's burst into being this post-war.

Uh Utopia begins to collapse like I think that's the thing people don't understand is that by the time uh the 60s even blow up. That is the moment when you see economic uh like the economic boom hit its apex but that's just it that is the moment of Apex that that is the that is the high water mark and that's why it's such a combustible era because it's a liquid moment. It's like oh. We're breaking towards something. How are we going to array ourselves as this declension begins because that's what everyone was feeling was feeling sort of the air go out of things and be like oh. This is it how are we going to manage now if they had maintained this Alliance of powers that had the working class represented within it. Then you get something that is a decline but not uh but not away from a uh like good not not away from health of the nation state. It's it's uh but away from the concentration of capital as the as the the sole uh the soul programming the sole motive uh prerogative of the system which is what we got. But it's already the contradictions in the 50s already already uh starting to to uh accelerate. But this but the early 60s Kennedy's presidency really is this moment when it's like a new frontier right that was his uh that was the slogan and that literally is what we were looking at a new Frontier to save what would otherwise be a uh. A elite structure doomed to eventual destruction right because that's what happens as we discussed in all these other chapters. Hegemonys begin to decline when there is no longer a shared sense of purpose at the top uh and that starts to blow up in the 60s uh and when the con when the uh rate of profit starts going down uh it pretty much doomed our Democratic aspirations unless we were able to create a new frontier and a new frontier would have been I think in the eyes of ideas of Kennedy and I think in the idea of most educated Americans and the the folk belief of like the working class who made up the labor movement was that yes we would see crisis and we would see a difficulty but we would work together to abolish poverty basically to end vast disparities uh between wealthy and the poor but that is against the exact Drive of the of the engine with within and it's the friction between them that defines the frictions of our era and then one wins over the other and it happens in that uh. Crucible point that late 60s uh crucial era when popular energy is everywhere but it is not concentrated. It's everywhere. It's a  fire hose because the uh the structures that have sustained mass action and been able to articulate a political power from mass action had been uh destroyed but you kind of have to say if there's a reason that we got one outcome out of the other. There. Maybe it's because the system fought back I mean Kennedy. The guy who said hey there's a new frontier of socialized of socializing the means of life and not making consumption and Conquest the only Mark of uh satisfaction advancement righteousness.

The entire hierarchy is the definer of value and of course that is the Socialist dream. Like the the incantate the Incarnation of the Christian uh dream. The universal dream honestly of uh of life in harmony with the full uh biological gamut of life that we're all part of but one of the big reasons that we didn't get that is because at the bottom the working class organizations are being dissolved and at the top a lot of the people who really most emphatically believe that there was a there was a socializing of Amer of the world of course because they were at the top. They could not think that it would involve any kind of class war. They have to pretend that class war isn't real. They have to pretend in their minds to stay where they are. The class war is not the engine of all social conflict and it's not the defining character of class Society.

They cannot accept that that means that they could not address what's around them clear-eyedly and that's why Kennedy got owned why Johnson got owned by Nixon in his own. Twisted way got owned why Carter got owned why everybody got  owned because they thought they were dealing with a technical problem when they were really dealing with the intensification of class conflict class war that required mobilization to win a class war. But no the people who inherited that new tech Frontier there were a bunch of  uh. You know kids who had gotten drunk on Werner Von Braun on uh on the Disney Channel telling him that all of the problems had been solved and only had to be uh expressed technologically and so his chapter here chapter six from consensus to paralysis in the United States 1960 to 2016 starts with a quote from a speech from President Kennedy from 1962. Most of us are conditioned from NES to have a political Viewpoint Republican or Democrat liberal conservative moderate. The fact of the matter is that most of the problems or at least many of them that we now face are technical problems. Our administrative problems. They have very sophisticated judgments which do not lend themselves to the great sort of passionate movements which have stared this country. So often in the past now they deal with questions which are beyond the comprehension of most men and of course. This is a accurate acknowledgment that oh man we have reached a degree of cultural technological uh social sophistication that belies group management. We do need a class of technocrats. The thing is is that those technocrats have to be dominated by a political hegemony a political identity a political force expressing its will through political institutions guiding that technology and look what happened with Kennedy. He thought that's what he was dealing with and then it turns out oh.

No the CIA has its own interests they align with yours only along some axis and if you decide to uh increase conflict with them well they will increase conflict with you and then the more one with more power wins and oh yeah. It turns out that the figurehead leader of a fake democracy that's been completely hollowed out by the last 10 years of CIA uh and uh Republican party machinations to to gut the labor movement to just to cast to the winds. The the uh the products of the social solidarity of the of the New Deal generation replace it with television and suburbs and carry out a a stealth third world war in the rest of the of the of on the rest of the planet to kill millions of people. It's not just and then the political part of that is is just along for the ride and that's what we've been dealing with is that this is really when the system becomes self-aware. Uh when it's we realizes it can pick and choose the specific people in every one of the seats of its power. It does not have to worry about being having its institutions uh overtaken by concentrations of class aligned people because those uh structures those organs of State have atrophied and new ones have grown up. So this chapter is about how we got from uh these the New Deal social contract to the neoliberal one uh and so it starts off with a very succinct and accurate uh laying out of the story that we've told on this show.

A million times about what specifically happens you have this this broadly shared Prosperity. This uh this High profit environment in the post-war World keynesians consensus structures then in the 70s a u-turn towards deregulation tax cuts uh the destruction of Labor power. The whole the whole nine yards the whole Mount parallel Society Playbook we've seen this a million times and so the question becomes why did this occur. Why did these specific uh new challenges get these new Solutions because the government was acting differently like it was applying different rubrics to the challenges. It was. It was behaving from a different ideological Playbook. How did that happen how did everybody decide to change so. There's a few different uh theories that get batted about it. He of course like he usually does goes through all of them to point out either how they're wrong or they're incomplete and how his Elite con his Elite. There is Elite conflict theory fills in the gaps. It's very effective I have to say so he says the five factors that usually go into. This are one that there is just this secular decline in the American economy. Uh where you get the economic competitors rise up. They're able to chat to compete on the world stage now that they've been made into industrial economies. Uh the globalization does just reduce the American share of profit uh and so that heightens social conflict uh within the uh. Elites in between classes and that's like a World System Theory idea.


That's uh you know I'm sorry like. But that's just a description of what's happened. It doesn't tell you why they responded the way they did. Because yes there was a neoliberal turn but it manifested itself differently in different places. Like some places deregulated. Some places cut taxes some places privatized and it was different in the different uh capitalist Central States which was determined politically so why did we get the specific type of rearrangements of structures that we got. It's a that is the first one only raises that question can't answer it uh. So then there is uh. In addition to that the world systemic observation of the crisis caused by this secular stagnation creating a uh a more efficient structure basically that uh for the system to sustain itself it required neoliberal institutions because neoliberal institutions if made um increased profits by increasing efficiency that is increasing Market penetration into otherwise public goods that creates more avenues for profit. It makes up for profit that is lost in the other systems right as rates of profit go down oh no we. Have this rate of profit problem how do we solve it we create new profit in New Markets. We literally have to public privatize Elements of Life to create these new profit streams that can prop up an otherwise uh secularly declining profit picture and that is again 100 True a description of how things go but it does not again again answer. The question why did we get the specific constellation of neoliberal responses in the United States. Versus other places.

We got to look elsewhere for that then there is the end of the Cold War. There's no more uh Soviet threat. There's no more need to keep the working class happy. So they don't defect to Communism or socialism uh and then that goes away and so they're able to uh operate with a Freer hand and again true as far as it goes. But it leaves out the question why now why specifically now because this happens in the 70s when the Soviet Union is still around so something else is going on even though like the end of the Soviet Union is why the 90s are able to be the moment when it like totally globalizes. But it's born in America. Before that. It's born in the western Capital. It's before that when the Soviet Union is still a going concern and then you have the fact that mobilizations from the left and right of Politics the the new left anti-war uh uh civil rights or uh black civil rights. Feminist movements of the left uh against the uh new right radicalism that emerges in response to it and those forces do put huge pressure on the political system and Destroy previous electoral coalitions. But it doesn't answer the question of uh uh why governments are choosing specific ways to deal with this new reality because at a certain point you're assuming away the uh the actual like motive and just going with the idea that like it was all going to happen anyway and the thing is it was. But it was made to happen in Moments by people who thought there was another way. At the time. You know thought that there was some live live wire and it was their free action that like animates history and what they didn't know is that their hand had been pulled. Their hand had been uh. Tied by much grander forces that they could ever know uh shaping them and what how so what happened what structurally changes to push directions push our politics so specifically partisanly reactionary like to embody this specific. It's not just neoliberal politics policies. It is this new right politics why does that become the product of this crisis that emerges and uh the answer that he comes up with is pretty interesting.

I hadn't actually seen it put this specific way before so we talk about how the the 50s early 60s saw this arrangement of uh Powers Elite structures of Power with different uh popular bases behind them right all in alignment so you have Finance Capital. You have local uh extractive. Capital you have uh manufacturing you have a retail economy and all of these have uh oh and you have the people who work for all of these people who largely thanks to the new dealera have some sort of uh uh collective bargaining rights that get transferred into political power. So the thing that holds all this together is always money and it's concentrations of capital and everything else flows flows out of that. It's the black hole that everything else revolves around and you have these big concentrations in the big cities. But because this is the United States you also have our distinctive Federalist Arrangement and you have these local concentrations of capital spread across the country as the Legacy really of our Jeffersonian Yeoman. Uh uh tradition the thing that animated uh us building this thing in the first place against our will. We didn't want to be under the Yoke of capitalism. We did it accidentally because we thought we were keeping our freedom by us accessing land instead of putting ourselves under the Yoke of governance. But the governance was still there. It still became a behemoth just behind your back and without your consent. It's a tragedy really. It's the final tragedy of mankind if you think about it.

So that means Banks right so across the center of this country. You had a situation where they had these small Regional small and medium-sized Regional banks that would lend money out to the networks of capitalists who would then give the money back to them. Those capitalists would uh uh support different people running for office and the people who worked for these capitalists would also vote for people who would go up for political office and they would represent these political coalitions and they would argue amongst themselves and the uh. The well-being of the electorate was taken care of by this local network of patronages where you'd have these the local political parties dispensing patronage from a central Kitty you know the old um the old pork barrel system that everyone is always railing against and they made illegal under Obama right oh no they're writing in their pork. Bell projects that's literally why you would vote for someone. That's the only reason you should really realistically be voting for somebody to go to  District. What sorry what else could are they they're going to make some speeches. They're gonna like uh. They're gonna. Uh they're going to declare National fetus rights day. They're going to do some. They're not going to help you and the thing is is that that is something that every interest group within an area has an agreement. Everybody wants that money the capitalists want that money the employees want that money. The unions want that money everybody wants that money and this alignment of interests. It excludes socialism and it excludes uh uh communism and it at that and and therefore it with every moment. It passes it further alienates and depoliticizes the working class. But in that moment the working class is still represented through its uh through its unions and through its political uh contributions and the political parties that are beholden to them but what happens in the 60s and the 70s is there's a huge explosion in mergers at the regional level in banking and I got to give lashman credit. I've never seen this pointed to as a Cause for us like a proximal cause for the 70s neoliberal term like when you're describing it. Moment by moment uh and according to Latchman this is the idea here and it corresponds to the way that you know like the the Amsterdam Burgers hijacked the Dutch state to their interests that which ran counter to the interests of the Dutch state. Uh once this happens this merger uh Network. This creates this network of uh much bigger. Regional behemoths who now are able to dominate a large Geographic space and therefore uh are much are are uh able to dwarf all the local interests that they used to compete amongst oh banking was just one seat at a table well. Now that seat is a seven million pound gorilla composed of a multi-state banking. Uh Empire.

All of a sudden you have a veto over everybody you have a veto over the mere politicians and you certainly have a veto over the  uh workers and what this did was. It wiped out the old political machines and not even talking about like East Coast machines just the Machinery that that is your understanding of oh I vote for this candidate and they then bring money to the district it got replaced by. The district give me specifically money and it's been doing that ever since and every warping. Distortion of our politics that seems to undermine its fundamental legitimacy comes from that action which is been incredibly successful at keeping money at the top hoovering up Capital to the top but has been at the expense of every social institution of the legitimacy of of uh. This felt sense of of safety and and uh peace anything that like the American dream is supposed to be has just sucked out of the marrow of the bones of society. But it may but it is to the narrow interest of these new capital. Concentrations so like getting money to districts is now a non-political question right like those those Powers got broken up and they got replaced by the NGO Network. Some some somebody asked why the hell we talked about that awful Hillary Clinton show and yeah yeah Hillary is meaningless. Uh Hillary is obviously totally uh irrelevant like this is sort of just you know playing the hits really. But one I think it was a genuinely funny show but two the way that they like address any question of like hey. What what what what is you know. What is where could any relief from our suffering come from the answer is in the form of these non-governmental non-political organizations that do things for the sake of Good by good people doing good things for good reasons this secular priesthood that's going to just dispense uh largeste whether it's going to solve LBGTQ uh discrimination. It's going to end systemic racism. It's going to stop global warming government's not going to do.

Any of that government is is so that means well then who's voting what who's voting and why are they voting who's voting uh. Not very many people who used to who've nobody who still thinks politics should be about getting stuff oh. This is just a  fraud you're not gonna vote. If you're normal. It's a scr increasingly just gonna be freaks freaks of one stripe or another who just can't get stopped getting off on the spectacle of politics. So now you start. The only reason people turn out to vote at the local level is to send somebody to Washington to be part of a freak Show for them. So what what difference does it make if they can't get anything for you. Like these are no longer questions that are dealt with politically so all it becomes is what's a more entertaining story and we all know who's got the  Sizzle who's doing this because you have this spectacle that used to be a unified psyche that we were all part of right. Like there was a uh. There is a consensus reality conveyed in a mainstream media that we were all participants in and within that there's like a constant battle between uh forces good and evil that are blade out in the political in the uh um the cultural firmament the the television the movies that we use. Am I is that stop am I good so who fills in the gap because these guys can't govern who fills in the Gap money. Money fills the Gap everywhere. Everybody else is left to just root from the sidelines in a political contest where they have been neutered and not don't aren't even aware of it. So that's that chapter and I think uh it does a very good job of laying out this this idea because once you see it that way it makes everything else come into Focus because like the right wing just takes over the Republican party and turns it into this. This horrifying uh Juggernaut that is at fundamental odds with the long-term sustenance of the system which is another reason that people want it because people are like break. It up just break this thing up and that is why the Democrat boosters are so uh sad because they're propping up the monster. They're Alec Guinness in The Bridge on the River Kwai. They the thing that is destroying them is they've turned into their savior because they're too afraid of the alternative. They're too afraid of falling because they are by and large incredibly comfortable. Middle class. People and revolution is to then to is to them would be not a explosion not not a uh erotic Symphony. It would be a terrifying decline. It would be a horror. It would be a it would be a nightmare. They'd have no faith that it would be able to be anything other than a failure that they would be immiserated by because they don't really believe in it. Because their politics are based on their guilt. They don't really want to see things change why would they they're turning they're going okay for them you can't blame them for this this is where we all go wrong. We want to turn this into moralism. This is just basic self-interest. Everyone is basically self-interested. We've been made that way. Everyone everywhere is basically self-interested but definitions of self vary culturally and we have a very very very very narrow psychotically narrow psychopathically narrow deficient of definition of self that's been created by Capital because when we look at this and we say okay it was.


Bank. Mergers well that if we're going to do Latchman style thinking we think hold on a minute then why were there Bank mergers and the answer is very simply. Capital had sufficiently concentrated that it had nowhere else to go. It was spilling its banks and all it could do was absorbed outside. It would be it would absorb uh. It would it would absorb outward as far as it would be allowed to by the organism by the social organism. It was part of by the elite structure it had been a part of it becomes malignant becomes uh uncontrollable. It becomes the blob that is why if there's going to be anything like a meaningful Revolution an altern an opportunity for people to act righteously which is what I would Define a revolution as a moment when righteous action flows from uh just the our basic sense of uh identity you know like uh I hate to get hippie about it. But you know like a Consciousness shifting which is a real phenomenon. But it happens as a result of struggle. It doesn't bring struggle into being. That is what we all get wrong. That is what our culture teaches us that's why we're all suffocating in the garage because we've been taught since we were  born that we all think a thing and then it pops something into being that we can then participate in. No we have to do the thing that spectation and spectacle won't allow us to do which is act.

We must act and that is the hardest thing because action in the current context feels like it could not be the beginning of some uh uh some perfect summation of like libidinal and spiritual desires. No uh some horrible uh destruction and only if you're like in the throes of religious ecstasy would you want to become a martyr and most of us are not in the throes of religious ecstasy like I think David Graber proves this liberalism because he is fundamentally incapable of recognizing that it is the actions that create the kind of uh breathtaking uh plasticity within human social forms that he rightly notes. But he thinks no they had to have all wanted to do it. It's like no people do things out of necessity man and it's what necessity shapes us into and that means we can't have any hope for the system. But we can have absolute hope in each other and for each other that even no matter what happens we all have the ability to act and we don't have to blame ourselves. If we think we've I've acted badly before I've been frozen in the spotlight. You don't know what moments are going to mean things you don't know when the uh the aperture of action opens. None of us can do that all we can do is try to be ready for it and that means cleansing ourselves. A pointless guilt cleansing ourselves of the neurotic need to be uh righteous and and filling instead with some sense of of a of a we have to essentially fundamentally have faith in ourselves in our intentions. I guess I would say we have to have faith in our intentions and when I say R not each others I mean r individually like you have to you personally have to accept your own good intentions. But then you have to not wed them to a a cosmic psychic brain drain. A libidinal dance where you get to build up guilt and then discharge it instead of dealing with the feeling dealing with the feeling that comes from Our intention and what is that God damn it. I'm a cheese ball.

I hate it. Love stupid it's dumb to have to say it. It feels cringed. They've made it so that the only way to really Express the like the four dimensionality. The real fourth dimensional aspect of life that affects us all and that we can recognize and we can articulate but we are just not programmed to. We are we are pushed away from it every moment. It's very cheesy. I'm I know I'm I'm cringing my balls off over here. But that's just to say that fixating on hopelessness. The the the lack of like a realistic vision of a Breaking of the Dawn in like large-scale terms. Social terms needs to be disengaged from an idea that we must subjectively experience that in a pure state of of annihilation and immiseration where we are finally punished or we are finally uh destroyed by that which we feared because I think if you really begin from that premise so many of the of the little like Sato masochistic whips that can just get snapped on you to like keep you away from like a clear understanding of like what where you are in the world and like what surrounds you is uh that the fear of of being punished. Basically. I think the fear that that we all have that our mistakes must be in some commensurate way reply responded on us and that's because we can only imagine Our Lives as like these finite moments series of moments when we are always only failing right because we're only Looking Backward like we're always when we're not in very specific moments of like very concentrated action. We are in the in our past and so the idea that it one there will be a point when that pass just is never reconciled. Uh it's to it. We can't conceive of it and so we're only disquieted by it when we should really remember that like oh we can't conceive of it. So it's not something that can ever be in we can ever have to like if we're afraid of it and it can never be experienced. Then what are we actually afraid of and I think what we are afraid of is that our mistakes will never be remedied. I think that's what we're actually afraid of uh but that's but the mistakes only have proximate ramifications. They only exist because they're they have been given uh meaning by your experience of them. But once that track has gone the the uh. The consequences also disappear so there is no need to fear judgment other than your own judgment of what you've done because I think what we all fear is that we will get to a point when we understand what really mattered. Then we looked at what we actually did and have a moment an a a  Rod Sterling ass ironic punishment moment of realizing oh my God.

What did I do and then just going out ending with like that Eternal scream against like what could have been but again that's only if you you were half the like be forced to live eternally with uh the failures. But I think you live eternally with the  experiences. The real connected experiences of love that you had that's what actually endures. That's what actually persists after action has ended that's the residue that actually lives on and so mistakes will always be redeemed and people say you can't believe that because then why wouldn't you want to do evil to people. But if you really believe that then you would never have any need and any desire to be do evil to people. Why would you ever seek to do evil to someone you know where it goes ends up. Foreign. You know that you will just have to deal with it that it will eventually come back at you that you will not be able to face it. The longer you go without facing it. The worse it will be because we can't control the future which means the sum of our our actions are morally neutral no matter what we do. But the love is not that comes from actions within specific moments that reflect higher States Of Consciousness that persist that ring throughout the universe all right. This is getting very uh very space cadet sorry sorry guys we love it don't. We folks. We love it when Matt uh goes off his knot because I spent a lot of my life deeply judging myself every every moral decision I made and finding myself disgusting. I felt like I was a bad I was doing the wrong thing and it was because and I I what I realized later is that I was just unhappy. I was stuck in an unhappy State static situation for a bunch of reasons and all I could focus on was my contribution to it like the things I did wrong but every time I made the wrong choice. It was because I was paralyzed by my indecision about what to do and so every decision I made became freighted with this huge moral consequence like if I make the wrong one I'm going to live with something awful now of course. The joke is because I only experienced stuff that was like still bad.

I only I never felt like anything I was getting anywhere much better. What do you know every decision was wrong. So I was ruled by this fear of doing the wrong thing in every sense of that which then made me do the really wrong thing because one thing I fought it for a while. But once I truly like stopped uh judging myself that way like I forgave myself in a way that I always used to think was was cheap and was the way to like uh get uh get out of having to pay some like real moral uh debt. The thing I've noticed though is that the way I treat people now is way way better. I am much better to the people in my life than I was before so and that's the thing that it I don't have to Wonder. Oh are you just trying that are you are you just want that to be true no because it's it's self-generating based on a a lower level of anxiety. Like I was just I I used to get madder I used to get a lot more angry. I would fly off the handle and I would I would say things that I did not mean and then I would afterwards completely like ask myself.

What the  did you say that why did you do that and I would like boy how would and I don't do that anymore like those moments don't happen like I don't. I don't get mad like one thing um just little things like so I I've always I've always been a sweater. I'm very. I'm very sweaty. I don't know if I technically would have that hydroponica. They have uh I mean yes of course. I've apologized a million times. My God I don't know if it's been accepted but I'm not in charge of. That is the thing and I'm making restitution the way I can but yeah I kind of have to go there because so I'm a sweaty man. I've always hated sweating like I would feel the things running down my face that would be made. Angry by it and it would I would feel short.


I would make short be uh snippy because of it. I would it would affect my mood and uh I just we I went and saw uh the Elvis movie uh in August and the movie theater was hot as. There was no AC and we watched the movie and I'm sweating and I'm like rubbing my forehead and uh the movie is okay. It drags in the middle I like the Tom Hanks stuff. Uh but you know I'd say you know mediocre like uh like a three and a half Stars I give most movies I see three. And a half stars because that's most movies are about three and a half Stars I I my when I did letterbox. I had like a perfect Parabola like a perfectly rational distribution because like hey I'm not I'm not a sicko who only watches sicko. You know I I have a broad palette so I'm gonna get the normal distribution and my distribution be normal as hell. But anyway so we finished this movie and uh we're getting up and somebody's like damn. It's hot in here. It's like like that and I realized like yeah I've been sweating my balls off in this movie theater.

This entire thing and I didn't even really notice like even when I was like wiping blood sweat off my body like I was not agitated and I was like that is just a different that is a thing that I could look at be like oh. That is a physical like uh sensed subjective experience that cannot be reasoned away logiced away. It's just a thing that's real and I can either believe my senses or I can do what I always used to do which is try to pry around reality to find the seam to escape the horrible present. But I feel like now. I don't sweat the presence not as much. But we'll see you know like we all we all know that we're on the precipice of something we all feel like oh. Things could get very different very quickly and we don't know if we can deal with that. We're barely dealing with what we have now right. That's what makes things so fearful but like what my belief is that all of us are going to be forced to if there is some sort of Crisis which we all are both afraid of and also set like yearning for which is why we cannot say we think no it's coming or not. This is why we have to give up our throw up our hands at the big prognosticative questions because we are both equally. We have an equal interest in it both being true and not true. I know that was true when I was racked by uh hypochondria. For years. I was always in the cycle of like oh I got a tumor. I could feel it growing here's where it is.

I can feel it. It's going there and there and there and then I would feel like oh. Maybe I have I'm having a heart attack. I think I might I might be having a heart attack. There's a chest pain there. What's going on oh. I'd have a pain in my leg for a while. Oh. You know what it could be a bone cancer or something like that and it would be this thing of like I didn't want it to be true. The worst thing in the world would be for it to be true horribly horrible but at the same time I did sort of want everything to end you know I wanted my life relationship. The relationship I had to my life to change and hey if you have actually have cancer that would be different but also the only way I could conceive of things being different is if I was going to die punished finally for my bad decisions that have all been turned into moral decisions and it was only when I kind of got rid of the idea that I would be punished that I could feel because I still feel the hypochondriac stuff. I still have those Sensations but I just don't get into the cycle of just okay. It could be this this but then being like well realistically. No. It's probably not and you know and basically getting myself to the point where I never have to go to the doctor which would end my little cycle and make me have to start a new one foreign yes.

I'm the only one holding myself to these standards which is why I can use them as I as their because you need moral. Guide posts you need ideas of what's right and wrong the transcend that like are turned into some sort of ideology some sort of way of looking at the world that you do have a conscious element of but that conscious element is only the tip of an iceberg of connection and that's how you can Orient yourself towards right action. But it's also arbitrary and you fail it all the time and it's overcome a lot of the time by self-interest by by narrow self-defeating self-interest just like our greater political system is dominated by the narrow self-defeating self-interest of just concentrated Capital trying to eat the  guts foreign will be redeemed as the thing I believe because I really do believe that every hierarchy of Salvation that exists and exists in pretty much all religions of any sign of significant social. Uh uh fixedness our I'm sorry remnants of class culture of class rule. They are super structural that's the part where you can say oh. This is what distinguishes a religion as an expression of like the deepest truths that really can soothe us towards our full alignment our best our deepest uh sense of our self-interest in full alignment with the people around us and the in the environment around us uh like that is all within our grasp and why because there will be a Redemption at every end because there will be a felt reunion it will not be without suffering but that suffering will be towards an end. Not as the Buddhists say no no individually you it is. It is it is this recursion of misery and then individuals are able to synthesize towards a point of absolute. Uh Transcendence no that's just a justification for class.

Heart hands cut off like there's a lot like epic uh epic. Uh LARPing Chinese Communists love to talk about how you know uh. Mao actually like liberated the serfs but that isn't a lie. They they did have  feudal relations why well you know where you are is where you are and uh it's all gonna come up because Society has to exist right in order to justify everyone's social position. Like that's why Luther discarded The Peasant to condemn The Peasants War condemn The Peasants said no no. You guys.

This isn't what I meant because he thought that they would end the social structure which you needed to be able to distinguish the sand the Damned from the saved if there is no hierarchy there. Then there is no need to maintain unjust social structures because they're all supposed to enforce some human nature that does not exist because we are not sinful by Nature. We are not sinful by Nature because we cannot sin if we cannot sin. We would not sin and of course that is what Christianity is most fiercely opposed to because it was  created first as a tool by the uh the Jewish Zealot resistance to uh Roman imperialism Like I Do by that argument that Jesus was essentially trying to unify the Jewish people to effective resistance to Imperial Colonial uh domination and then when that failed it became this new uh structure to refound the social basis for a declining precipitously declining Roman Imperial order classic I mean classic capture and and processing and into the the greater structure any free-floating challenges to uh systemic power which is why they all end in collapse and why capitalism will end in collapse but why we're also still  here because the thing that animated in the beginning is still among all of us and those words have resonances that make us believe that certain symbols reflect certain feelings. Even though our actual actions only undermine them. We don't know it is a false consciousness but it's everyone everyone has a false consciousness but if there is salvation for all that means that everyone has a breaking point that is not to be feared because it is only when we imagine that the break is towards Annihilation decline miseration that we are stuck because then we're stuck trying to find the best action and when you know it there is no good action. All action is. Everything leads to the same ruin. Then why do you act you can only act at that point. I submit out of love.


Foreign was a attempt at asserting uh political control of the Jewish subjects of the Roman Empire. Jesus thought that EV could get them to believe he was the Messiah that they would be able to together create heaven on Earth by overthrowing the Romans. That is I think what Christianity was. It was an attempt to uh reforge a stagnant Judaism that had out lasted its uh energy that it had gained as a as a survival strategy for Desert Nomads and had become this like permanent structure within the greater economy of the Roman Empire. But it didn't work the Pharisees said no Jesus went to the cross. I think kind of convinced that God would intervene in the form of the people would like rise up to save him or the uh. A Pontius pilot would be uh like intimidated that there would be some ignition of a popular revolt and then when that didn't happen he had the guts that he instead of saying actually  me up. He instead took it upon himself and said my God why have you forsaken me like honestly. I think people are good because what it is to be a person is good the idea of the person that we all live is good. It's just we can't live that way. We're not allowed to. But we have to all pretend that we are those people because otherwise we would realize we were amongst monsters and that we would become monsters ourselves and then we would have to stop and fight and that could not be allowed to happen and so then the resistance to the Roman Empire that was localized to the the periphery.

To these uh these recalcitrant Hebrews becomes much more generalized as the Empire starts to come apart and that in Christianity once again emerges as a Potential Threat now not just confined to Jews though can find everybody in the Empire and it was neutralize but not by being destroyed because it had gotten too far deeply entrenched but rather redirected and reconsecrated towards the existing order and the apocalypse becoming a uh not a political Horizon that everyone should be seeking but a a a a fat accompli from God that we should await patiently and in the waiting submit to our roles and originally that worked because everyone thought it would be within their lifetime Christianity Christianity. At its beginning it cannot be argued. I think persuasively that that there was nothing that um Christianity was not fully invested with the millenniary expectation of imminent apocalypse and of course there was an apocalypse the  fiefdoms and and becoming uh Bishops and arguing about the about donatism and and killing all the Heretics oh. No what are you you're uh well you're uh um don't you get out of here donatists you. Because the political potential had been neutralized by that point and then Protestant protestantism emerges first of all resistance emerged immediately because Christianity did still have this revolutionary potential and it was expressed by a bunch of uh uh res uh resistance like the neapolitans against the byzantines uh the I'm sorry neapolitians against the byzantines the uh the bogamills in in the Baltic. The cathars to an extent in France where the First Crusade was launched where the bishop said kill them. All God will know his own when they went in to slaughter them. The uh um who else we got the lollards of England with our boy uh Wesley and you guys so they're all popping off and then you get like. Then you get the Nationalist tinged ones like the uh the um the hussites in Bohemia where yes you have this religious expression but it's being welded to nascent nationalism. The these National this uh this czech-speaking Urban population that's not resisting their feudal German overlords. So what do you know they actually get a settlement out of it. They don't all get killed. They get to maintain their Ultra quest to church because they're connected to real uh Power as opposed to Peasant revolts which are always neutralized and uh defeated because the peasants are less socially organized than the urbanites and then protestantism finally emerges and you get the revolution revolutionary potential there. In the form of the peasants Wars which of course Luther condemns because we need a state. We need the he hated the he hated the the princes he thought they were all swine.

He thought they were all going to hell but you know what he needed them to hold up the system so that people could find their salvation. The people could read the book so people could go to church because what's the alternative living amongst the animals like Savages. It's like you mean finding a way to socially share production so that you don't have to so that you don't get to sit on your. Fat ass all day your Franciscan hey maybe the reason you're so worried about going to hell all the time that you needed to Post 95. Theses is that you're just sitting around all the time you're not doing any work how about you get a real job you. Job maybe he wouldn't have to have his precious perfectly uh aligned religious doctrines so that means oh I can only determine who gets saved and damned if I'm able to have my little. Uh my little house paid for by this wonderful beneficent uh elector of uh of uh was no it wasn't the it was the Duke. No he was the elector of Saxony yes the elector Saxony Frederick. The wise Sac yes Luther's dad was a uh was a contract Miner. He took out he he made. He said he's a prep go-getter ABS. Grind set the kind of guys who made protestantism what uh he was too nervous to sit around all day and like chew on a hay seat and just stare at the sun. Vibe out which is what you should be doing when you're not working vibing out can't Vibe out saves a bunch of his. Money goes to the city leases out. Some mines uses new mining technology to mine for silver Rob or like a coal something like that. I don't know maybe both and he becomes a big shot in the town. He becomes a burger he becomes a town counselor but he's borrowing money his entire career he barely he pays it off like right before he dies and so that currency into like a  neurotic and then you have a little neurotic freak kid who's gets scared by a lightning storm and besides to become a priest so he can he can worry about his salvation because he's guilty because he's sitting on top of  Francis because uh the the monk orders that he was part of were just day care centers for overgrown Royal and uh uh um Urban children like jumped up peasants and and uh and like slow-witted uh Noble children.

They're just hanging out drinking beer but a sensitive Soul like Luther has to worry about of that. Oh. This doesn't seem right well how do we let rationalize it because I don't want to be the one going to hell but what if there isn't a hell you dumbass what if the what if the what if any suffering you fear is a cleansing one what if any anything that you bring to yourself because you think you deserve it. You will inevitably find yourself forgiving because you are connected to something so far greater than you that you couldn't maintain the wrath of centuries. The sort of Mind obliterating horror that we fear because at the end we're all holding each other and yeah. This is all like hippie  and it's certainly self exculpating like oh wow look at you you get to keep doing what you were doing yes true. I am I do. It's awesome. But I was always free to do whatever I wanted to do. But what that felt like before is different than how it feels now and I feel like that is the justification I need anything. Other is the yellow wallpaper. It is the liberal desire to to deny reality which is that the only way this works is if you Pare down significantly your. Uh personal. Uh adherence to I don't know existence. Now. I'm kind of trailing off. Just like you're not the center of the universe and again there is a difference. There is a way to experience life outside of your own head fully and you know what those things are if you can experience them but that means taking action and specifically taking action that goes against what your narrowest self-interests are and the only way you can distinguish. Those is looking at in the past what has caused one thing to happen and when it's caused another and then applying that to the moment and what I have found is that the one thing that like unclenches all hands that are like around my neck about decisions is getting rid of the fear of uh consequence like okay if there is if it doesn't matter either way if it has no if it's not going to have a good or a bad outcome on you. If there's no long-term punishment for the wrong decision then what do you want to do and those things.

The answer to those questions tends to be how a certain thing would feel and it's only people acting from those moments that are going to build meaningful alternatives to capitalism. But the reason that that is not idealism when I say that though is that they're going to be forced into acting. It is not going to be people making a choice to do it. That's what that that's the order of operations that I think people assume and that gets them tripped up. They're go. Everyone is going to have to move. Everyone is going to have to put one foot in front of the other because we are not going to be able to protect ourselves cocoon ourselves from the consequences of our actions. The way we have before things are going to get tighter one way or the other psychologically or materially and that means that we are going to be pushed in directions and if we trust our cut our in our intentions that should push us in the right direction shouldn't it because remember. We're getting pushed the stuff that we think we're making decisions to do that's all the stuff that uh that we're choosing to do and we end up just choosing to ignore something. That is otherwise inconceivable which is what the enormity of of the end of Consciousness the enormity of the surrender of life and so that is why we can make a practice of huffing gasoline and waiting for the end because well instead of having gasoline huffing uh trusolene. I don't know but no like if you are waiting if we are all every day waiting then what should we do while we wait and I think ideally we would concentrate ourselves fully on like addressing every problem in our life.

But that's not realistic. We we need to uh not burn out because we would because we are wired towards a very narrow understanding of physical pleasure of of of uh of the satisfaction of relief. We have to expand that and the only way to do that is to let that discomfort wash over us rather than uh avoid it. But we're going to have to to some extent avoid it just to prevent us from feeling the need well. Okay. We have to extinguish this right now but once you get to that point. Now you're just trying to end this bad feeling that's going to drive you in the wrong direction. You have to let those bad feelings sit too have I heard of DBT dick and balls torture yes no it's it's very frustrating because everything really does lead in one like general direction like I mean I'm really not saying anything different I guess than the people who who decided to tell people that it's colonialists to tell people not to eat  hot ice cream or something you know like Oreos are are uh are indigenous social practice. But I guess the difference is they're doing it. You know to get people to eat Oreos and I'm doing it essentially as Oreos. So I would say that my Oreos are probably not as bad for you as real Oreos. So if that's the case then hey I have less bad before the Oreos zero trans fats. Foreign always get back to the insufficiency of of entertainment and a a very expansive definition of the word entertainment. But of course. I'm trapped in that box and I live that contradiction. But you know it's doing this that allows me to be with people. I love and it'd be harder to love them and I'd be harder to love me if I was struggling some other way and why would I want myself for that. Why would I want that for myself if it's not to punish myself. I don't know what you know but again.


It's these. It's a poll that's always shifting and you just have to ride it. It doesn't  matter thank you very much doesn't matter. I think we are going to see a drop in American life expectancy. I think that's what's already starting and it's I think it's going to accelerate for sure. But I think we'll all meet each other in the sweet buy and buy which again. I think is an incentive to action to meaningful action because there's nothing left to do but love. Then you know do what that commands you and I think it it aligns every one of your polls the right way. But it has to be. It has to be consecrated uh in some sort of social structure. It has to be reflected socially so it seeks community six collaboration. It's like a it's like a tuning fork yeah.

We're all we're all dinosaurs. We're all gonna be very cool skeletons. We're all going to look really cool in the in the firmament when they're when the tentacle creatures come to to excavate our our great sites yeah. My money is on the uh hybrid. My money is on the evolutionary uh convergence of lobsters and uh um octopus. That's where I got my money. But the thing we have to remember is that there is no direct uh relationship between our individual sins and the likelihood of uh like bad things happening in the near future or put in another way. Uh like bad things happening are not uh accruing because of our actions. Individually I mean of course you know collectively yes but individually not individually. We are not contributing anything just our presence basically uh like our part in the circuit. We're not independent actors. So therefore we can't judge ourselves morally which means it can never be a direct one-to-one relationship. You're never going to be directly punished.

You're going to just exist and then something's going to happen to you to end that and it's not going to be any judgment put on you and that I think is what wires a lot of us to hypochondria in my case and then also broadly social hypochondria. An obsession with the end coming of course that doesn't mean it's not going to happen but it means that there is a psychic pull towards that goal. There's a reason that you want that to be true the reason that it's deeper than thought at least I think that's true in my case. I think I've found a lot of it for me. I know I mean my experience is not Universal. But I feel like I am very I'm a very bad and and like end stage Puritan brain. Like I think I I inherited the final level of like that um the modern like liberal subjectivity that persisted until it started to break apart with the technological revolution of the uh internet because I have no belief in this for most of my life. I had zero belief in a supernatural didn't believe in God didn't feel his presence its presence. Her presence their presence I had no connection to a theory plane to twelfth it. Was all fake um but I still had a deeply crippling moral. Uh thermometer because was wired to this secular evolution of uh Protestant ethics yeah.

I might have a brain tumor who knows you know. I just think that I uh I I started doing more acids and that did it but you know those two things are probably connected. But it's fine. That's the thing I might be having a brain tumor. It's fine right. Now. It doesn't feel. It doesn't hurt. I'm not going to go in every six weeks and have them check my brain that once again is I'm trying to impose some pattern oh yeah. I am him oh yes I am. Uh you know uh. I have to pay for my wisdom somehow so but if it is cool then I'm literally creating reality myself. I'm building my own narrative. That means I get to write my own ending oh my God I get to write my own ending which means I get to just high-five Jesus and stroll through the Pearly Gates. So what am I worried about so that means they don't have a brain tumor. So then what am I going to do not gonna. I'm gonna chill. I think all this stuff is like in all of our brains. You know. It's just.

It's inaccessible to us most of the time because we are live. We Live lives that deny us the opportunities for those things to get stimulated like group religious ritual used to do that and we got rid of it and now it's just. We have these these Dusty circuits that are just drying up and that's why we're all determinally depressed because we can't imagine. We cannot feel connected to one another. We can have abstract political beliefs like I did oh. I think you know it's good for. It's good for more people to be have things good to them than bad things. Happening people are basically good. They should be. Uh we should protect them but it had no connection to anything. It had no connection to the world like and why should it be well. You know hey you know the best for the most over time. But that's so it's so thin it doesn't really it doesn't sustain. It's thin gruel.


You need to connect that stuff to feelings feelings of connection to forces realities. Truths that cannot be uh spoken of cannot be communicated can only be experienced. It has to be a vocabulary. Society needs a vocabulary for that and we are cracking up in part because we don't have one anymore. What sacred games would we have to invent and it's like basically the skid game. That's the sacred game we invented after killing God and I think that like mental illness obviously is not. A huge is is rampant right now and and we talk about it largely in terms of depression. But I think that like you know schizophrenia is popping and it's all because our minds are trying to process this world where we are being judged where our actions have consequences where we're supposed to have this moral construction of the universe where virtue and vice accrue to the character of a person towards an ultimate judgment but also that every other person is a monster and an enemy that is not you that can't be you. They can never be United to you that always must be judged uh fundamentally as a threat because you will only be judged in comparison to them yeah. Like we have things like football games exactly like we we do we still have the stuff but it's been stripped of an ability to sustain us it only sustain us in these short bursts because it doesn't build anything else doesn't connect to any other project like the final culmination of all of our our religious countercurrence to capitalism from the neopolitions to the  anabaptists to socialism is to make heaven on Earth is to bring about the end now. Of course. There's plenty of people in America in America who think they want thing to bring that about but they mean the actual apocalypse because they have totally secularized their religion with and materialize their religion without realizing it. Like they know they have turned. They have turned the world like we did get left behind like it happened and now that it is happening. They're gonna. Carry they're going to cosplay their version of uh The Book of Revelation on Earth because that is what an enthroned demonic capitalist reflecting Christianity comes it turns into but that's nurtured by all of our worst our best still nurture. Notions of religion and and and uh and social action that can be brought into alliance and forged into new structures with new symbols that can focus and direct human energy from Love and against this mindless destructive. Machinery that the other side is just along for the ride for or is turning into monstrous side products of we have to be given that we have to fight for the time to like believe the time to build belief the time to be spending when we're not being directed like puppets where we don't feel like. We are now have no guiding hand in our own lives and then we have to vent that feeling elsewhere. I'm gonna beat up on the other side of the culture divide.

I'm going to use the state to make them uncomfortable. I'm gonna assert my power there. That's thin  gruel if you actually want to act out of love it will not be satisfying at all. It only satisfies you if you just want you just want sadism. It's like well good luck because guess what it all comes back and you're going to end up in the pain box coming down from this one way or the other because this is all going to end up falling away to nothing in front of you and you're only going to have the Reckoning with what you did and until that very moment it will be just monstrosity. You're not going to have time to  reckon with that before you are overwhelmed by your own body fighting back to punish you but again eventually that burns itself out and the reunion is still experienced. It has to be that is why hell is real to the degree that we conjure it and we all will to some degree or another but then at the end is the same thing at which point all of those incredibly important moral decisions deflate as if it in a dream and all of our actions go to building something else that we will continue to be a part of and that we cannot conceive of now and that's facts and I'm frankly still doing this you know oh why are you spending time. Doing this stuff well. It feels really good like in every way like the the the hand you know that clenching hand that we all have wrapped around us at all times that we are the ones it's our hand. It's like a phantom limb. It's like when the hand gets cut off and then it's still clenching and you can feel it. It's still it's but we're the one doing it and we can we can not totally release it. If we totally released it. We would just die and some people could probably do that if they're like mind Jedi is at the end of some you know Taoist uh uh pursuit of immortality. But if you're just a regular person you're never going to have the ability to focus enough time enough energy to actually get in charge of that hand but you can certainly over time. Let. It get more relaxed instead of get more and more tight which is what happens if you have no recognition of the reality of death the reality of of extinguishment as a felt physical sensation which we all have already within us because we already experienced it. We our body is tensing for it its entire time but we can align that tension along an axis of serenity or one where we're endlessly winding up towards ecstatic release which is the Death Drive but those pushes towards ecstatic relief. Those are good if they're pushed by love if they're the final outcome of a love-driven. Next thought conscious Nexus of thought and not the indulgent actions of self-destruction that are otherwise warring with us in our minds and that's the thing like we are all good in the end. But we're not in the end now are we. We are now stuck in bodies that are driven by contradiction and create. Shadow selves that we have to reckon with. But they they rap they unravel with time and they're unraveling is pain. It's the suffering that we call Consciousness but then it is unraveled and the hand unclenches. Nietzsche says great problems require great love hot damn that is true love is going to come from struggle. The struggle is happening now but where in what capacity we cannot say not in this ether because we're only communicating our stove piped isolated existences because that's the only language we understand that's the lingua. Franca of the internet is our neurotic uh plugged in uh. Enchanted libido because if we're online it means we've decided to enchant ourselves. A little bit haven't we we're going to boost into the Matrix right. We're gonna get in there and we're gonna. We're gonna let all of our contradictions go away for a minute and that's fine. We have to do that or we'll snap. We'll try to align ourselves along an ecstatic uh axis but guess what you can't do that you try to be ecstatic.

The cops will shoot you pretty quickly. You will annihilate yourself like a  exploding star and you know what it'll be fine for you but not for the people. Around. You so don't do that because it all comes back it has to be absorbed and dealt with even if you go towards ecstasy. It's going to have to come back snap back before final reunion. Foreign people are going to fight for their lives and in the fighting they're going to be brought together. That is why uh the zombies genre is such an important site of ideological Warfare and why the Walking Dead is one of the most important shows of the last 20 years. Probably the defining show of the  post. Uh 911 era people say 24 but 24 is too specifically tied to the war on terror. The Walking Dead has a more uh uh. It's the Next Generation. It has absorbed the failures of the war on terror to provide resolution to our fear. The fear is broken containment oh no what comes next our punishment and so it is this other coming to consume us this other that will destroy us and then of course. We all turn on ourselves turn on each other turn man being wolf to man of course but that's not it man. There's no zombies. They're human beings and yeah there's plenty that's going to put us at each other's throats and make us Massacre each other. But there's also plenty that's going to make us work together and the question is where do. Those lines break up where do those borders become porous. That is the great challenge before us rhyme and that is why I think labor is the only real side of struggle. It's going to determine everything else because those are the relationships that can have a greater political structure placed on top of them that could resist the otherwise inevitable drift towards National uh fat authoritarian blood ritual yeah.

Like the reason I do this at the end of the day is I this this does feel like. My God helped me my therapy and I know you're supposed to do that with someone who you pay to hear you. But honestly I could never believe in that because I'm paying you to hear me which means you have an incentive to uh go along with. Basically anything I say our relationship is Switched. You have absolutely no reason to continue to listen to me so if I come out here and start trying to like work things out in my head and the invoke of people who hear it are like that makes sense and they don't say which they absolutely could that's crazy. I'm able to use just good old Bayesian analysis to say say hey maybe I'm on the right track maybe. This is working because maybe my feeling better is not just on top of another uh neuroses because the physical sensation of doing this does feel like that sort of unburdening that you are associate with his like traditional Notions of religious Rapture uh spiritual visions social ritual. So I have faith in myself as reflected through others and I have faith in my ability to respond to what's to the world. I live in will continue to to direct me towards a golden path. I guess that maximizes my own understanding of the world my own ability to act out of uh out of love with with with little of the the friction of neurotic self questioning that you get when you are paralyzed by your uh Pleasure Principle dominating your mind and therefore driving you towards death. Then I think most of us I believe in most of us too I believe in I Believe in Us because we're all the same basically and we are dented by trauma in one or another Direction and then we're collected demographically into trenches and yes we have vastly conflicting interests. But the thing that holds us apart from one another is this network of institutional. Uh uh reciprocatory structures a treat Nexus that is breaking down. That's the other side of the coin that we have to consider is it. Everything that we're afraid of should also make us giddy with anticipation but we should not try to bring anything about that's the thing if you act in this context you're reaching too far you're firing before the whites of their eyes because it is the local action. It is the drudgery that is made meaningful through its performance. Not the thing that is chosen to be done consciously. Let the meaningful work is done so yeah. It's uh. It's it's. It's a it's a fat Rich comfortable media guy justifying his own position correct. But my position. I think is okay I of the options that seem realistic and I know what chooses those. But what else am I going to do is start blowing up. My consciousness why to bring so something can save me from a contradiction that we all have to live every day of Our Lives. No you got to live with it the desire to purify our beliefs by rushing towards a head-long final confrontation that's a mark of fear that we won't be able to sustain our beliefs in the long run. It's like I have to do this now or I won't be able to do it later well. I have faith that I will I know that that's easy for me to say. But again it is easy for me to say which is why I say it. We're all doing what's easiest for us the easiest thing for me to do is say but I don't think that's true of everyone in every case. The easiest thing for a lot of us to do is say things to people in our lives. I just imagine it. I just imagine a network of people oh making a leap of faith and if it doesn't happen if it doesn't fall that way. It's not because it's not those aren't still there that we all start still don't have these feelings that we all still aren't in the end. Just the residue of uh the love that we have for one another we individually are so it doesn't matter. We all have to prepare in the way that makes sense to us but only if we understand what our long-term goals are yes. The leap of faith good old Kierkegaard. It's true so yeah we'll all find it and I think we've all found it to some degree or another or we have we've laid the groundwork. I think we're all now looking around us. We're building the pediment that it will be built on I I the work is gone going. We just can't recognize until it's been completed what went into it and that's where the the faith comes in and the faith comes from the consecration of the act and that's of course what made uh protestantism. So monstrous is because it took uh it took love and made it a sin. It said pleasure itself which flows from Love and its fault is bad. That's what imposes original sin is that specific propaganda regime meant to build up this specific class structure. The feudal order the rule by a bunch of disgusting gout-ridden  inbred mutants sitting on a horseback. So I want to I want to end this if this has gone on too long but so a good example of like this is a a good I can't I don't even have a real answer here.

But I guess just a good example of the kind of um dilemmas that we're facing right. Now. So the Patagonia family announced that they are going to give their entire billions of dollars of Fortune like six billion dollars to uh fight climate change and there's a bunch of Articles saying this is how you do it billionaires and then of course there's the people who respond uh. This saves them 700 million dollars on taxes and they get to distribute the money. So this is essentially just an end around the taxation system for them to use this Force this money as independent political force. An economic Force without tax uh without even being taxable now which is something that zuckerbergs did with their Fortune a few years ago. They made it basically to a giant uh uh non-profit which of course makes sense because non-profits are the new structure as we talked about earlier of uh of distribution uh of social distribution. Now so that's what they're doing. But I did have to think though all right if I'm the Patagonia guy of course. It's like well you wouldn't be because you're not a scum sucking billionaire. It's like okay say the Patagonia guy has gotten to a point in his life where he is smart enough observant enough to take seriously global warming. He is an independent guy. He's his own family. They they're not. He's not part. He's not just like an employer or something he has total freedom. He is total nobly sublease. He can act independently of any other class position and class interest to go oh man. This stuff's really bad my money doesn't mean anything if I gotta like live in a  Underground bunker for the rest of Eternity. No thank you like guys like Peter Thiel have decided that the bunker is preferable to continuing to try to live among the lower order that it is better to purify our Elite in a techno bubble than to let them keep mugging about with the hoi polloi but guys like this guy's a limb and he has gone to a point where I want to do something meaningful with this money and he means it no. Of course. We could say he's still a billionaire. He's still yes but money does have influence right. I mean the billions of dollars that's something. It's a it's a center of gravity of money. You could presumably put it to some good use if I'm him would. I think that the best use of my money would be for the United States government to take 700 million dollars worth of it the United States government Brandon's government. They would take that money and say thank you very much we're going to send solar powered drones to Ukraine. We're going to give we're gonna. We're gonna this. All this money is going to the gold pens that we handed out to all the oil company Executives when we signed uh unlimited  drilling for oil and natural gas if that money is going in a hole so it would be right for him to do that. But he's still in a broader sense bad. He's still a rich bad guy controlling his money. The important thing is that whether he's good or bad beside the point does this represent an independent influencing node within capitalism not not enough but from his point of view. Probably the right thing to do now of course that money is probably just going to go to the same NCO horseshit that we already have but again what else is he gonna do. He's gonna he's gonna arm.

The naxalites is that a would that be a good use of the billions of dollars. This is actually an interesting question this but I think it comes down to tactics. Then what do you think would be the better use of the billions of dollars go towards trying to invent carbon capture take it seriously um or like uh just go all in on uh by Geo. Uh engineering which I know a lot of people are horrified about but there's a lot of evidence that we are past the point where we can really imagine any stable future that does not include some significant geoengineering. People don't want to say that but it's true some kind of snow piercer  basically recreating the Pinatubo earthquake of 1993 in terms of filling the atmosphere with reflective shards to bounce back uh solar energy. So there is some sort of technological part of that in like are our institutions so captured that they can't do good. Research could that money be put towards good actual useful geoengineering. They could just be a stop Gap towards the worst outcome that is not good for anybody Maybe or would it be like yeah. I'm the global proletarian arm. The global a joint dictatorship of the third world and I gotta say if that's the one you're bringing you're bringing a p  shooter to a night to a nuclear warfare. Let what you're bringing a t p shooter. You're bringing a pea shooter to nuclear Holocaust. Six billion dollars is a fart in the Wind of course. The fourth the uh the option. The the other option of course is a little more refined where you create like a global assassin Network to start killing oil. Executives and political figures of course. That's so far off the table like that's one of those things where well. These Guys these billionaires they would never do that because they'd think it's morally wrong but of course that's built on top of their desire not to do that not to go that far because again we're all operating out of our self-conception of these things. Like there are lines. These people won't cross which is why their money could never be enough without it being taken from below seized. But it's going to be a lot of weird. Strange bedfellows emergent things. All I know is anybody who who's got their money on any of the political parties turning into anything other than than the the uh. The labels on the different chassis of Ed 209 killbots that Patrol your. Uh uh your archipelago of uh techno dominions your little feudal. Uh enclaves foreign but there will be life outside the the wire is the thing there's going to be life outside the wire and I think we're all I know I am afraid of like I'm already in the wire aren't I and it's like well yeah kinda always. But there are Graves. There are inflection points. There are branches in our lives where where sort of ambient realities uh intensify their their domination of your conscious life and those are. The those branching moments are what we fear and cringe away from. But they're where I think we should put our faith that we will do the right thing. No we'll we'll all meet together in the Great by and by I think we're just all trying to to relax into a giant. Universal hug. A universal mind hug and we're fighting it and we're fighting it but then eventually we get hugged. We get the hug so yeah prepare your mind prepare your butt prepare yourself prepare yourself. You know. It's a must you got to have a friend in Jesus. So you know that when you die so you gotta recommend you to the spirit of the sky bye.
