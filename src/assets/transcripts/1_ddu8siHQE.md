Hey mama do you h please. Don't dcca me please. I've got in my hand. The polar black cherry oh black cherry bang-a-lang oh black cherry bang lang. She's from alabama. It's good. It's in my opinion the best of the seltzers. I've had. It's got the most flavor combined with the most carbonation. it's the closest thing to actual soda. You can have in terms of tasting kind of sweet and having the powerful kick of carbonation oh man. Everyone's talking about that election.

Still h no one's sick of it. Really after all that time. No one's sick of it. You don't think anywhere near the end. People just get a little exhausted right beforehand but nope now. The the news today is after everyone was basically solidifying around the idea. That biden was inevitable actually hold on a minute. not only are a bunch of write-in votes likely to be not counted. But what's this oh my god. The democrats are neglecting latino and black outreach and turnout just like they did in 2016. Is it happening again as the big guy from twin peaks said I mean it could be. It could be. It could be but I don't think so. I think the shift. The white shift in the electorate towards trump is so significant. I think it swamps all other considerations coupled with higher turnout than last time to me. that feels like all of the 2016 ash and esque and reminiscent stuff. is gonna be backwash compared to that but we'll say but that's it no more talking about the double action. Oh see. I already said. I already said it. I'm not talking. I don't know what's gonna happen. I said I think what might happen but beyond that. It's all a ouija board who the hell knows hanging around in the garage hanging out in my house yeah.

 could lincoln have won without johnson in 1864. Of course he could have that was one of the worst political calculations made by a political party ever and you got to give lincoln some blame for that. Although I don't think it was solely his decision but the decision it was a very very very project. Lincoln move ironically enough it was a gesture towards the I guess you'd call them never trump republicans of their day which were the unionists southerners and border state slave owners and the republicans are so desperate to appear to be this transcendent party that was not looking to declare war on Its border states so that they could be kept in the union not spooked them out. Not only did they try to do compensated manumission in delaware which the delaware slave owners rejected. Even as the war was ending which really proves that there was no way they were ever going to buy out slaveocracy that was never on the table and anybody who says it is like rand. Paul's ron paul is a dumbass and so they not only did they not run as the republican ticket. They ran on the national union ticket. They got as the vp instead of one of these scary northern abolitionists they get andrew. Johnson the only elected a federal elected official from a seceded state to have stayed loyal. He was a senator from tennessee and so they put him on there as a gesture of of olive branch when it came down to it. He was he won thanks in large part to the military vote. The guy the boys in the field voted for lincoln the yard. The union army supplied a huge percentage of the votes for lincoln and they. I don't think they gave a about some cultish border staters or butternuts.

But I gotta say even if there'd been a radical republican in the as svp. I think anybody other than lincoln in that spot is going to lead make it hard much harder for reconstruction to have any chance of of of a greater impact or success. You really needed lincoln. There. We really that's a real keyhole spot in my opinion when you consider the flex. The the liquidity of the moment and the stature of the ban is whatever you want to say about lincoln. It's impossible to imagine the south. The war happening the same way without him and I know a lot of that is retrospective. But his mastery of the moment was such that you can imagine him in a situation that fluid in the aftermath of a war that he had steered the country through being a a lightning pole for like progressive mobilization and concept and and like the awakening notion of like class orientation over race race orientation and he was the only one who could have done it. He really needed that guy we only had four spots in the fail bracket. There were a lot of fails people we missed. I mean my god. The entire bush family is a bunch of failed people. I mean george w bush is somehow a two-term president and fail son.

At the same time. How the hell do you manage that and of course you've got jeb who's one of the failest failest of all. But there's only so much room and I honestly feel like even if you put them in there. Dj tj wins just because of this the sheer desperate sad nakedness of it. I would feel better. I would feel worse for don jr if he didn't take out his pathetic insecurities on endangered species and like some of the most majestic creatures on earth. Any one of whom's life was worth that of 10 don jrs and look at him. He's trying to build a political career around his. likes. I mean how much more naked can the desperation be.

The government needs to make people like me more. That's what it comes down to. That's what that whole strain of conservative grievances. It's the government's fault that people don't like me and they'll say no no no. It's because they're throttling my content and they're shadow banning me. And if it wasn't for those things blah blah blah. It all boils down to you're not as popular as you think you should be pathetic that's not a political concern.

It's just a pure pathology and that is why I think and that is why um. Somebody threw me off like people are talking about nick land in the comments. I'm like what why are we doing the neil reaction. I mean we're a little beyond that aren't we are. We are we wearing bell bottoms but now the reason that donald trump will never be. President is because the naked need is too great. He doesn't even have the ability to give it a patina of like policy gloss like trump's trump had built a wall and while I think that there is a core to the republican base that does care more than anything about their facebook likes. I don't know maybe we'll get there maybe we'll get there. If the if the snowman keeps melting the way that it is. The republican party is going to be more housebound and more delusional and more convinced that the only thing that matters is whether or not people like them on the internet and therefore will be more responsive to a naked little mole rat.

Like don. Jr. We really need baron to become the quinsacada rock. It's really our only hope he needs to marry one of the obama's daughters and create the god emperor. It's it's it has to happen. It's the only way. America's destiny can be salvaged from oblivion because the the the the sire of that union would in fact be clearly the either antichrist. or messiah. Either way this story is over and we will either get a thousand years of peace or or darkness. It would be really funny if kimberly. Guilfoyle is the one who was able to have a successful political career and donald trump. Jr had to be go from being a presidential son to like a senatorial husband that would be very fitting no bear no bristle palin. The palin's are second class. The palin's are not one of the pure bloodlines are you. reality tv show and instagram tummy tea ads out of it are you kidding me obama the last two presidents the people who were able to will themselves to power through sheer craven need to be liked. The only difference is that obama wanted the like of the specific cartier of elite power brokers whereas trump wanted the like of his dead father in the form of the mass of american public. I.e everyone who could possibly see him and they both were driven to power one through just a focused ambition and cold-blooded pursuit of power. The other threw a focused ambition on being famous and then oh what's this. The fecklessness of one of these guys contributed to the degradation of the political process so that it becomes merely a question of entertainment and what's this the guy who's best at being famous is now also president oh.

So you've got the two strains of ambition the two str. The two bloodlines of of will of power their the first born of the the the The firstborn product of their bloodlines coming together will be the napoleonic figure who embraces embodies and subsumes the contradictions of american and in fact global life within himself or herself. So yeah. I'm gonna say sasha. She's the older one right or malia. The older one and baron shall mary. I guess the younger one they're closer in age. All right melea then malia obama and baron trump will produce the god emperor of warhammer.

Somebody says who directs the donald trump. Jr. Biopic that's a very good question somebody were making a biopic or biopic as some weirdo say about donald trump jr. Who would play it well. All the cocaine and twitchy energy makes you immediately think safeties and certainly they do good stuff about people who are in over their heads which donald trump jr definitely is. But the thing is is that there isn't really an urgency underlining it because donald trump jr is never in physical or financial danger. He is always going to be ignored from anything other than just public humiliation so you need somebody with less of an existential edge and urgency to their work um. I don't think that cohen's now no. I don't think so that donald trump. Jr is such a pat character and such a path a a fair character of pathos that you need a director who is able to provide more of a clear transparent screen between themselves as creators and the character like what I mean is that if they if not if the cohen's did djtj it wouldn't be dj tj.

It would be some cohen brothers like riff on it which is it would be interesting but not what I would imagine in the ideal dj tj biopic because he feels like a character who could not who cannot be parodied. It is just like a pure embodiment. He's a literary character alexander payne maybe he does like that on we very well but verhoeven verhoeven would be funny but once again. I don't think I want people who are going to heighten it too much. I want people are going to play it relatively. Straight like you guys are all thinking of these fun riffs and it's like okay that's an interesting idea. But it's then if that's the question you're not really answering who's making a dj tj movie. It's who is making a movie that's going to feature that as like a side character or something like who is making the this person himself as close as we can understand him the subject of a film. there has to be todd solons todd solons good choice adam. Mckay could do good with like this like the absurdity of his character and stuff.

But I worry that he would forget. The pathos heidiker is not a bad idea well. Heidecker is such a great channeler of trump energy. In general heidecker of course would be very good. Hey what if it was tim heidegger wouldn't that be funny tim heidegger and eric eric whitkins-steinheim scorsese. No they're not catholic nope. They're not catholic are you. Kidding me harmony corinne's not a bad idea but it feels a little basic kundun is a catholic movie are you kidding me of course condones a catholic movie now. I know martin scorsese can make movies about about non-catholics. But I just don't think that the specific architecture of the this character's angst is too orthogonal to his his instinctive understanding of of sin and and self-hatred and like mortification danny mcbride and jody hill yeah. I guess also seems like one to one zack snyder okay. We found it actually michael bay in pain and gain mode would do well. I think in fact if donald trump jr could write a movie about himself and then have it directed by michael bay. I think that might be the greatest film ever made has anybody ever said this about twitter before that.

It's essentially tech support for like the american experiment like people are essentially typing in their complaints about living in america. The way you go to you know amazon or something if your package doesn't show up. But there's no one manning it like we're all manning it. We're we're just manning it. There's no one actually like picking up the the message and responding to it. That's kind of funny safety brothers hunter biden on the other hand. Now we're talking because you can see a death wish in hunter biden's behavior that kind of you know that kind of thing where that they excel at where you create this situation where in most movies the character. The main character is like presumed alive and all and the joy is just following him through the things that pop up like their movies are. The opposite is that the characters are doomed and the the tension is just seeing how they're going to be annihilated and like that's why I don't think dj tj would work because that guy he's a soft boy. He's he. He doesn't have that he does not have like the ambition of spirit. That hunter does to be that tormented by what a loser he is. He can get it all through. Getting coked up and going to cpac and and swapping knock. Knock jokes about the deficit with jerry falwell jr. He's never going to be in a situation where he destroys himself. I was thinking of lars von trier. I think von sure could do donald trump jr for sure. I think he could do hunter too honestly 

I'm actually going as halloween tomorrow. I'm going to an outdoor gathering and it's going to be a little cold. So. I'm wearing i. I've got a combination. It's it's pretty. I think it's pretty brilliant. I'm going to wear my red track suit but with my hawaiian button-up shirt and then so I'll look exactly like teddy kgb basically but then on top of that to get meta. I'm going to wear my official crew member jacket from the film conair then. I will be john malkovich. So I'll be going as john malkovich if I can find any other stuff in and around my house that I could relate to another john malkovich role That's what I would do. I hope to do your based on the favorite. I'd say yeah yo-yos could pull it off. Although I'm not a huge fan of his honestly. I haven't really been blown away by any of his movies yeah. I know the tracksuit is rounders. He's john malkovich. He's dressed up like one character from who he he's wearing his jacket from a different movie that he was in like he's on set maybe and it's chilly dog tooth's okay. I never got what everyone loved about dog. Tooth didn't really like the the deer movie was colin farrell lobster. I actually actively disliked and the favorite was was just all right for me dawg.

It was like three and a half. I'm actually excited for if if biden does win. I'm actually excited for the show for chapo afterwards because we're finally going to get to do what we had wanted to do. Originally when we thought hillary was going to win which was to provide a like counter-cultural critique of a ruling democratic party from the left that refused to be absorbed into a coalition of government against the republicans because they're you know hey they're doing what they can or whatever. This like resistance coalition this popular front and biden gets in there. Especially during this. Massive crisis we're. Gonna actually get to do what we always wanted to do which was to to peril to polarize the relationship between the democratic party and the punitive people who make it up as voters and the fact that like I think there will for a while anyway be like a a reduction in cultural like. Just as people take a breath a breath that's going to be nice too to just not have everything be. Just this frenzied culture war at all times. But of course we don't think we influence national politics. I'm saying as an artistic enterprise that has value to me. I don't think it's gonna. We're gonna like destroy. The democrats just gonna hopefully.

The people who listen to the show can self-identify in such a way that can they can be a poll that other people are pulled towards and if they aren't they aren't they are to some extent. It's a question of how much and I don't know. I know. It's not a lot but the democrats must be destroyed. I mean that was true in 2016. It's way more true now democrats delinda s. I mean the party must be annihilated.

Belden program could help with that hopefully. I think everyone should. I think anybody with a podcast should be cynical about their impact because to do otherwise is to I think lose perspective because I'm trying to pull away every day from the idea that the that the discourse represents a real project that the people engaging in it. Even though it makes them feel like they're part of a political project are actually part of one and I don't want to in any way indulge that idea. It's outside god. Why is everybody freaking out all the time.

I know that we're all in We're in corona apocalypse which who could have predicted but does. I mean. I don't know is trump right. A little bit like he keeps saying that the deaths are down and the thing is deaths are down and it also doesn't seem like anyone seems to really care that we're way over the left. Like the records for transmissions. No one cares like people are saying about another lockdown. I'm not even hearing even a glimmer of of a suggestion anywhere that they're gonna lock anything down like it does seem like we are without anyone being the one who's doing it. Everyone with our eyes closed like foot on the gas but not holding the holding. The steering wheel going we're just gonna normalize this. It's just gonna normalize. It's gonna be a thing that you have to factor into public life and existence working and going out you might catch the dang rhona until the vaccine shows up yeah. Spain's in lockdown but we're not gonna do it. I will not get the rona. I've already. I've i. I have. I've. I'm fairly. I'm fairly certain until I get it and then I will have always been destined to get it.

It is pretty astounding how badly we're doing but the thing is is that europe's doing bad too. It's not just the united states you know there's something else going on than just america's specific frontier stupidity and honestly that makes me wonder could like people say that trump is responsible for all these deaths and I'm sure he's responsible for some because they did make a lot of terrible terrible decisions but what if you think that maybe like it not being contained and therefore the waves just kind of echoing off one another instead of ever recessive receding because you can't get it. The lid on the thing is tightly enough doesn't that mean that eventually you get to like the same level of infection regardless of who would have been in charge. I kind of suspect that we would be around this number no matter who is president because like the europeans are basically like there's they've got a bet. They've got they're They're the slightly less advanced version of us. They're the less neoliberalized less marketized version of us like they still have cultural 

 you know they still have cultural resistance to full marketization. They still have institutions that reflect that but and I mean obviously they are happy having that stripped away by the marketization of life. But it's in a less advanced process than ours. But the overall framework is the same because the results speak for themselves. Europe is once again completely. If they wear a mask it honestly makes you think that sweden because they are the country of blank-eyed lutheran zombies for whom life is a walking shadow. Neither good nor bad just the the neutral planet from from futurama. They could look through all the baffling obfuscations of cultural denial. No no no we're a country that can value life and we can have it both ways. We can keep the economy and keep people alive and we because we care about human lives. All this frenzy lock down lock up unlock and then no they didn't lock down and it goes through you. All you got to do is not care if you die. You just have to get to the end of the the denial cycle the denial to acceptance and I'm not saying like that would that's like better than a successful project. But clearly nobody had the capacity in the western world to pull off a successful. project of containment because nobody did china did very well obviously. Vietnam did very well and is still doing well.

New zealand does not get to brag. There are two tiny ass islands in the middle of nowhere. Islands honestly don't get to brag too much any island where you can just shut off The border to me does not get to brag too much during the 30 years war. It was often commented that the swedish soldiers were terrifying to the catholic armies that faced them because they marched into battle with completely slack expressions they didn't appear to be alive. It was like an army of the dead and people were freaked out by it all. Those lusty bohemians and bavarians those those those beer garden and and vineyard decadent catholics terrified. I gotta say the fact that new zealand legalized euthanasia but not weed that one has got me performed because like there are certain social issues that kind of bundle together. The kind of people who worry about the sanctity of life being violated by allowing people to opt out of life themselves. are generally also hostile to the notion of bringing another intoxicant into the realm of the possible so first because they are concerned about social cohesion.

Like that's their conservative principle that is animating that you can talk about how it's all actually racism or whatever and it there's a lot of that too but that's like the the logic of it. So they often run in parallel and yet people are like yeah. You should get to kill yourself but marijuana. It's no good. I mean what do they think what do. They think we does did. They just get reefer madness over. There. They just watched it if you've already got because honestly like there are arguments to be made to you know in a functioning society. have restrictions on certain drugs. I think once again not in this social order but in a functioning society to have a social taboo that maybe must be enforced in some way against certain substances just because of the the the way that they could you know be socially dangerous But if you say any argument you make any drug you'd make make that argument for. If you agree that alcohol is is not one of them. Then you have no leg to stand on on weed. I'm sorry if you've got legal alcohol. Then there is no standing to ban wheat because alcohol is by far more socially corrosive than marijuana could ever hope to be in any access you choose so while I agree that there are theoretical places where the law should prescribe certain dangerous indulgences because of their socially destabilizing nature if we have metabolized alcohol at a social level and accepted that amount of Then this is not a society that is actually caring about social cohesion when they ban a drug and therefore weed should 100 not be banned so yeah like the alcohol line for me means that basically everything we call on the illegal drug in this country should be legal you're telling on yourself as a society about why you actually have.

These things banned that it has nothing to do with preserving a social order because you allow in this thing and yes they tried to ban it and actually the experience of prohibition helped reform the american relationship to alcohol. American alcohol consumption plunged after prohibition and there's a number of reasons for that of course. The the shift from you know people working on farms living in cities is one of the big reasons honestly because you couldn't be shit-faced at work all day but part of it was the experience of prohibition like made made like the social relationship with alcohol fraught and made people reassert it because you know one of the big driving forces of prohibition was the woman's suffrage movement and it was considered a a feminist issue because women thought that men were beating the hell out of their wives because they were drunk all the time and even if you might say well that's just treating a symptom not the cause. It was a pretty blaring symptom but what I'm saying is that coming out of prohibition. We had metabolized alcohol as a social ill that means anything less than alcohol. We can metabolize and when you consider how much less than alcohol many of the ones that are still banned are like any hallucinogen certainly.

 marijuana certainly kratom. I mean my god get me out of here katie bar. The door we love our kratom folks. Don't we love it. I could never. I could the the the the ephemeral pleasure of ingesting kratom for me would never outweigh the visceral disgust of consuming it.

People keep asking me about me maradona why would i. I mean. He's a left-wing soccer guy from argentina who cheated argentina to a world cup in the 80s and is allegedly a big fan of cocaine. However hallucinogens have not been absorbed into capitalism outside of the black market. I mean in that sense everything's absorbed in account. Every every every commodity is absorbed into capitalism and that is true. I mean the the black market like drug money undergirds is the is the liquid engine of global capitalism like one of the things that saved the global economy from a complete. shutdown in 2008 was the liquidity the system that was injected in the form of massive amounts of laundry drug money that existed in the global banking system oh if you mean like like guys taking acid to like be better capitalists california man. The california ideology does this that that the the post-60s turn after the cultural shift the after cultural change had had exhausted its capacity to change the political structure in the 70s people will look inward and in california. A bunch of people came together and said the system is immovable. The system is corrosive. The system is soul destroying.

We must transcend it by essentially seceding from the system and creating our own systems not as a class of course but as individuals and the internet became the way that they did that and they are so tunneled into their notion of like innovation and technological advancement. Being the cynic of human consciousness raising like they basically looked at the failed structures of american life and said the only way we're out getting. Out of this is a technological solution because the political is is foreclosed. There is a technological solution to our social ailments our social sickness that we all experience during vietnam and the civil rights movement. The sickness we knew was in the heart of the system and we tried to change it and it didn't work. We're going to change it technologically and then they are so fully in. They're so at base convinced of this fact that they are pursuing this hyper capitalism that is dissolving the world into liquid goo into a. you know nanobots of of exchange they're accelerating.

They're hyper accelerating towards this point because it's the only thing that they think can transcend our dying system our dying social order and so when they take mushrooms when they take acid. They do the mind expansion when they like commune with the collective unconscious and the eternal you know moment. They're doing it through the lens of technology through the lens of applying the thin wedge of reality to like pry open the actual atoms of existence. As opposed to you know the broader questions of why you would be doing that in the first place and that means that they're so far from that that and they're so baffled and self-deceived by the fact that what they think they're moving towards what they think that they're cooperating off of this road map towards utopia is actually just the algorithm of the value form and of profit extraction. That's it. They are some of them know that but many of them.

I I don't think no at least or they don't want to know and it allows them to to yeah. They've. They're they're captured and that's why you can never do the thung hey man. They should just spike the water or whatever people bring to the experience of hallucinogens their own minds and that can be changed and the fact that you get hit orthogonally to your life can make that productive but it doesn't have to be productive. If you hit the wrong thing it clangs and then oh boy like if anyone's seen mandy. The guy who leads the the the cult that kills mandy and provokes the rage of nicholas cage. Jeremiah sand who's sort of a a man inspired man a manson-esque figure. He's a guy who leads an acid cult and he's a former and failed. musician which is like. Manson was and there's a part where he has mandy kidnapped and he's dosed her with lsd and he's on lsd and he explains to her how in a moment of of transcendent you know highness of of of of tripping.

He felt like the universal forgiveness you know for all and that's a real component of any like spiritual experience is is that that touching on a knowledge of like how everything that ever happened had to happen the way that it did and therefore there is no blame and therefore you can be forgiven. That is always there and he says. I had that but then he said and that told me that that means that anything in the world is for me and I can take it and it's and then then I can do anything wrong and it's like no no no no no that you you took a right wrong turn there and that's because he was coming at it from the head he had everything is just it's an incredible human human evolution of any kind. Individual or or species-wide or or anything is dependent on just this random stochastic banging together of elements of of the collision that is mostly usually either empty or harmful and occasionally good sparks flying in the darkness. But the other thing that happens when you get really like in a moment of of 

If you're really tripping and feeling like you're really locked in somewhere you get access to something that is a universal knowledge and you get this realization that oh. I actually do kind of know everything because like I literally am everything in a certain way and so wait a minute am. I god am I the sole repository of consciousness in the universe. If so I have to live forever and I'm going to subordinate the lives of everyone around me and the future of my planet to a fantasy of me turning into some sort of eternal robot. Yes y'all fire all right. I'm going 

I'm gonna be signing off in a moment here. So. I'll see if there's maybe one question. Anyone wants to ask which president. The most well as much as you want to say jfk since he died when he was 45 He probably wasn't him so I got to go lbj. He lived about 20 years longer and as he once said I have my. I had more women on accident than jack. Kennedy had on purpose bill. Clinton might be up there though bill clinton seems to be pretty compulsive about it more so even than Johnson was all right guys peace.
