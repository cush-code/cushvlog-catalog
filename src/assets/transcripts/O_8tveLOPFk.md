1914 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson. Now the mighty Mississippi we took a little bucket and we took a little beans and we caught a bloody. British. In the town of New Orleans fired our guns and the British kept it coming but there wasn't as many as there was a while ago. We've hired once more and they began to run it down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. We looked down the river and received the British common. There must have been a hundred of them beating on the drunk they stepped so high and they made the bugles ring. We stood behind the cotton Bales and didn't say a thing we fired our guns and the British kept it coming. But there wasn't as many as there was a while ago fired once more and they began to run it and now the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico oh my old liquor sale. We go take them by surprise. It didn't fire must concealed. We saw them in the eyes hell in the fire too. We see the face as well. Then we opened up the squirrel guns and gave them well can't say hell couldn't say hell back then could not say it number one album like that they would have executed you immediately. I am the other bars on the ran through the Brussels.

There they ran through the brick away the rabbit wouldn't go grants moved past that the house couldn't catch him down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. The firing our Cannondale. The barrel melted down so we grabbed an alligator around. We fought another round. We filled this every cannonballs and battered his behind and when we touched the powder off the gate or lost his mind fired our gun celebrated occupant and there wasn't as many as there was a while ago fired once more and they began to run it down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. It's happening folks the banks are failing. It's all beginning the thing we've been waiting for oh the Glorious release from these gilded cages that we've constructed in our minds. No I don't know probably not they'll probably just bail it out. They learned their lesson from 08. They can't keep any pretense that that any of these big con machines these big concerns you could ever face liquidation because to do that is to just see the whole thing shutter to a halt. We've already seen that so they'll just bail them out everybody else gets microplastics and lead lead water and steadily declining life expectancy. But Banks gotta protect those babies got to protect them. Gotta protect their cute preciousness of the bankies.

Our little Banky boys we love them although I think it is interesting how it's Silicon Valley Bank right because if we've seen it it has really gone away that you could have predicted and they start raising rates right because that's the only tool that they have to deal with inflation. Even if it doesn't actually address the root cause inflation. It doesn't matter all those other things you could do to manage. Inflation are no longer capacities that the government has you can't do those things all it can do is have the Federal Reserve guy press the button to raise rates. That's the only thing we did like that was what the the 70s economic Revolution was really about. It was about creating a state that was no longer capable of doing the sort of Keynesian management that the post-war New Deal state did and that was replaced with one that just had the central bank that tried to keep inflation here and unemployment here and just moves the number up and down to get a number somewhere between your goals. That's it so that's all they go and as soon as they started doing it.

This huge speculative fake money economy that had sprouted up since 2008 and then was supercharged by the bailout. At the beginning of covid. It starts shrinking and of course the place that shrinks first is in the most fictitious part. The the furthest edge of this which is crypto so crypto starts have against crises and you get the breakdown of the banks there. and then the big exchanges start collapsing and now it's moved closer to the the font of that investment which was Silicon Valley. So now we have a literal Bank in Silicon Valley with hundreds of billions of dollars. In un FDIC backed Investments now Up In Smoke and why because they keep raising the rates because the cheap money is being bled out of the system and that means that all of these fictional Financial entities are finding their their foundations eroded away. The question is and the question has always been how far does it go and how much are the other elements of government which as I said can't do anything about inflation but can do things to staunch panics when they emerge and to keep liquidity going keep people. Lending how much are they able to sort of soften the blow and and prevent a free fall and I mean I remember when when what the is.

It even called the sambachman fraud thing FTX ffcc. FTB I literally don't even know the name of the stupid thing when that thing collapsed I was like okay when's the next shoe going to drop and it didn't happen. Then it didn't happen okay so how long has it been since that thing went went belly up. It was last year right so it's been months and so now we've got a furthering getting closer to like actual organs of the economy here so how long before the next shoe drops. After this I don't know and that's the thing I'm I'm a econ. I have no idea people have been telling me for a while. This whole thing is going to collapse and I have kept waiting for it and it keeps not happening My real suspicion is that it just never comes is that you just get this yeah. This attenuated decline that is now managed by the Fed because yeah it's obvious that the FED is trying to introduce a recession to bring down wages but where how do you prevent a recession from metastasizing if all these things are connected to one another and pulling away one of them triggers Domino effects I don't know don't know It would be very funny though if we get like a 29 style collapse of the economy and then rfdr is second term Grover Cleveland Donald Trump with his insane vision of Industrial autarky in America but he'll never get that because he doesn't have what FDR did which was a mass organized working class at his back.

All he has is Republican voters and their discrete opinions being filtered through a party apparatus that is dominated by the very Capital that has no interest in seeing that happen so probably just get spectacle. Carnage spectacles of carnage to alleviate our sense of pain and disquiet and cognitive dissonance. But yes if we actually get mega communism out of it. You know I'll tip the cap but I'm not holding my bro. So since I have no idea what's going on. I'll just look backward like Benjamin's angel of History because that's all I could do.

I I don't know anything about this stuff and I have no agency over it. So I'll just float like a leaf in the breeze and Ponder what got us here. That's that's all I can do. That's all I ever have done. It's probably not enough to to Stave off the worst. But it's enough to get me through the day.

So I've been thinking about the Apocalypse. Obviously it's on everyone's mind. It's in everyone's on everyone's lips regardless of their political beliefs. The one thing that unifies everybody of any political persuasion is that something is going to bring about some horrifying Reckoning and they they see the the rough Beast approaching and they approach it like the Bland man and the Elephant everybody is describing some element of it through their own demographic profile and they're evincing their revulsion at some externalized and sublimated component of their participation in this malfunctioning social machine and then claiming that is what's going to bring it down and everyone is describing some like real phenomenon. Some of them are totally epiphenomenal.

Some of them are more Central but what matters is what they're really doing is expressing their desire their religious yearning for a break for a breach with the reality that we find ourselves in in which we are. deracinated spiritually deadened automatons and where all we can do is hurl towards an annihilation hurl towards death a death that can bring No Redemption that can bring no reconciliation because we are all eternally alone and separate no matter what religious beliefs we skill we skin on top of that lived experience. That is the world that we live in and we want to not live in that anymore. It is it is hell and and then death is the final annihilation the casting into fire that the Jehovah's Witnesses talk about because the Jehovah's Witnesses say you don't go to hell you don't burn in hell that's not right.

They say you cast into the Lake of Fire into the lake of fire. If you throw something in a fire it doesn't burn forever. It burns up and I will give them a Jehovah's Witnesses credit on that for the most part their approach to biblical exegesis is very autistic and kind of funny but that interpretation of hell I think is is for a modern audience much more legible and I think spiritually it makes more sense the idea that your soul is gonna be eternally burning. Eternally. Anything goes against the idea that God is eternal you're not there alongside God separated. Eternally you are either reconciled with God saved or you are unobliterated because God is all then you are nothing. Now. I don't think that that's how it works because I think that that straightening of the mandala that Western religion does is is a is further away from the subjective ex reality of life and and and the the subjective phenomenon of death. Then previous cyclical models are but if you're going to premise there's Souls that are saved and souls that are damned then the Jehovah's Witness vision of it. I think is more theologically sound and by the by the token that means that heaven is not hanging around in a Halo driving around a cloud car and going to see Hendrix. It is the end of the self. It is the annihilation of the South but in ecstatic reunion with the godhead.

Now I think that happens to everybody because we are not separate from them. We are not separate from anything. It is a subjective illusion that death obliterates that is when the seal is opened but none of us experience that and get to talk about it none of us get to live as living beings. With that experience. We only live with the fear of the unknown and that is why we yearn for a collective opening which is what apocalypse means Revelation it is a revelation of something. It is a curtain being pulled back. That is we want it collectively because we do not want to experience it alone because if we are alone we are alone with our sins. We are alone with our failures and our regrets and what we have done in our lives to harm others for our own narrow illusory benefit and without a figure like Christ to intercede on our behalf. In that moment. Then we will send ourselves away. We will deny our own our minds will deny and reject our are relationship to the to God because we will only have the memories of a life lived as an isolated individual self-grasping narcissistic not through any of our own faults.

But because that is the sis that is the life that was bestowed To Us by the system that we were born into so even if we're Believers we fear death but if it all happened at the same time if the system fell apart and revealed us to each other as no longer strangers. Then. Even if that was the end it would be an ecstatic reunion rather than a despairing annihilation. That is what Christianity brought to the world stage the idea that we could bring about a collective reunion with Christ with with the universe with God well well. This is the important part being alive. We could make the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth are we imagine when we imagine like what is heaven like we could live it as our lives on Earth and then when we die there would literally be nothing to fear because we would not have had a life of regrets and selfishness and violence and and denial we would have a life of communion and connection and and fellow feeling and and advancement our personal. Drive our our engine of libido would be hooked to a social mechanism that would reinforce our desires and and resonate them across a community rather than have this fundamental contradiction between our our best interest as an individual and the best interests of people around us. we can make families in the current order and align those things but we cannot be extend beyond.

The family and psychos like Margaret Thatcher want to turn that into an eternal reality of human life which is of course what you say when you are a archon of the devil when you are hollowed out and filled with the prophet motive when you have surrendered your soul and replaced it with an algorithm. All of us are now cybernetic. In that sense. We have this algorithm algorithm lodged within us but we're not all demons. We're not all archons. We're still human beings. We do good and bad in our lives. We struggle to build um a coherent self that that allies that self-interest with the interests of others because that's the only way we can be comfortable and that's the only way we can imagine ourselves dying without pain and fear because if we're in direct physical hostility with people around us then death to us is always the shadow of being exterminated by someone else literally like run through the sword or a machine gun to head cut off by ISIS. Something like that. Some nemesis representing our imagined enemy among the rest of humanity will get us if we're more comfortable though and we're successful and we live in a society far from the edges of the violence of its of its maintenance. Then we fear being alone with our actions we feel we feel being alone with what we have done either way. Death is terrifying and we are annihilating the Earth because this the what we have built to accommodate. That fear is a machine that doubles down and in fact consecrates the individual. personal narrow Freudian understanding of like satisfaction and and comfort and well-being as the only value and then create and then uses a technological state economic military machine to perpetuate that but everybody at every level of this is alienated and horrified and and and death stalked by this and they deal with that death stalking in different ways. At the very top of this thing. These psychos are trying to live forever. These type of these psychos who claim to be scientifically minded who claim unlike the aristocrats of old who said I I I killed enough. 

 I killed enough picks to claim this land you know like I went I drove down there and I cut the head off of every Magyar. I sought and I made and I made all their children my slaves. That's why I get to run this area our new Gods our new aristocratic Lords. They went on the computer good that is their claim to dominance. That's their claim to godhood is. They went on the computer and did a good job with the ones and zeros. They have surrendered themselves to an empirical understanding of the world which should tell them that their dream of immortality or even pseudo immortality is a fantasy. It cannot be done. It is it is a It is a it is what we have instead of Heaven since we just extinguished the possibility of building it here on Earth. Individual personal subjectivity eternally extended through technology because the only way we can imagine surrendering. The self is towards annihilation which is as good as hell and thinking about it. Even if I'm at the top of the pyramid is hell look at I hate to talk about this but look at Elon Musk.

The guy yes he is partially doing everything he's doing because he knows that his scam at Tesla has got a has a expiration date on it. I think that does motivate a lot of his actions in the last year and you can make sense of a lot of his weird stuff through the rhythm of knowing that through the prism of knowing that his entire bet was on self-driving cars and it failed now look. At this. This is a perfect example. This guy convinced himself like all good con artists do and then convince the world that we can do self-driving cars that technology exists to allow me that much closer to my eternal. Robot World Robot break because self-driving cars is a necessary Link in the chain that gets you to these guys. fantastic fantasized about singularity and he has seen it fail now what does he do does. He say oh the the the foundation of my World which was an understanding of the world that I thought was scientific but was actually religious the whole time which means I looked past every problem and I adhered to everything that validated my worldview. And I got the money and power to surround myself with people who would only reflect back to me. What I already believed and therefore destroyed the scientific basis of my world and replaced it entirely with a pre-modern religious Fae I've seen it fail and we know it's Faith because we're confronted with that he doubled down actually. The fault is wokeness on the social media and I'd only had enough engagements and I don't have enough posts. All. This is is the fear of the reality of death encroaching upon him not right. He's gonna die in the next even 40 30 years. He's a he's a very rich white male.

He the the life expectancy is like 90. Now. They're they're Georgetown. In Washington. DC has a life expectancy in the 90s by the way across the Anacostia River in in DC It is something it's I believe below 50. So you see this like equilibrium point where you get to about 50 and then you either have the rest of it taken from you by the exploitation you suffer under capitalism or you get. It extended to your life by the amount of exploitation that you get to enjoy but the thing is both. Ends of this are people by socially by spiritually tormented individuals and the higher up you get. The more tormented. They are so the musk isn't going to die anytime soon but he's gonna die that is as good as dying every day until that happens because it's all you can think about because you can't do anything about it. You cannot fix anything you've done you cannot climb down because there is no intercessity did my mic go out. Someone says that I'm muted there's no one to intercede on your behalf right because you live in a spiritual void. These guys all believe in God but they call it the simulation because they need to get away from the concept of God but they still have to. They step to gesture towards what they understand which is that this world is obviously not everything that this that there is no real material that we are gazing through and processing a subjective experience and the collection of those is what we are that there's no real material undergirding that we know that but we can't live that way and the only way out of that boat is we. We get a a car that drives itself and then we get computers that are people and then if computers are people. Then. Maybe we can trade and I get to be a computer but what they're longing for exists in the natural world. They don't have to spend seven trillion dollars. They don't have to burn the world to get it.

It exists in all of us. It's just the biological fact that we are made up of everything else the universe is made up of and that our death is not a meaningful end of anything that we are enmeshed in a a collective conscious endeavor that is objectified as God but is subjectivized as us and if you know that then you can just be a guy and that goes for everybody and if you can just be a guy oh man. My God maybe we can get rid of exploitation as the basis for human relationships. Maybe we can have a positive some social world where what's good for me in the very narrowest sense is good for everybody else. That's not going to get rid of sin that's the kind of rid of people being mean to each other and doing pathologies to one another. We're human beings. We're defined by our traumas which are all individual and can never really be translated outside of the personal experience. So we're going to bounce against each other and that's going to create Sparks but within a manageable homeostatic relationship that ensures that as long as you're on Earth you'll be around friends but who will shovel.

Now you'd have to have some jobs that would accrue around cert like expertise and people wouldn't be able to do those for a short period of time. But they would love to do them. It's fulfilling for people everybody wants a job where what they do makes them feel good and and one of the biggest jokes of capitalism is saying. We only have like medical especially Medical Technology advancing because of the profit motive and so the people who really do medical research do it for profit. No most people who have huge scientific breakthroughs make almost no money from it. Many of them explicitly deny their ability to make money from it like Linus. Pauling the inventor of the the smallpox vac. No not smallpox. What is it polio vaccine the guy who synthesized.

But nobody has to do that that long the reason we imagine that like shoveling grungy and waste management and and and grunt work has to be a career and lifestyle that dominates you is because we can't imagine people having all that free time because if you spread it out amongst enough people everybody shovels. For like two hours a week and they have the rest of the time to live. But we can't have that in the current system because if you just live you will eventually destroy yourself or someone else because you can't just live. This is a machine that puts us all against one another and against ourselves so you can't have that like David Graber was very good on this one of the reasons that we didn't get that keynes's 20-hour work week is because you can't just have people in an alienated capitalist Society where everybody is alienated and everybody has access to high technology. This is the real thing Mass Society is a emerges in the early 20th century as a inflection point between the number of people you have and the sophistication of the technology that you're that they have access to because that creates a force multiplier for the for the exploited half of the human equation that means Capital has to play ball to keep the game going and that conflict was what defined the 19th and 20th centuries and we live in the aftermath of the domination and victory of capital. But we still have all this technology but anyway at the height of of the Cold War you couldn't have a bunch of people working 10 hours look at what happened to their kids look what happened what did all the students do and they didn't have to work in the 60s 40 hours a week a week. They became the they their energy was unorganized and it was based around personal pleasure because they were Americans and that they weren't workers but like there was a drive towards justice. There it got it got defeated because it was not connected to the laboring classes as such who were working for a living and it was that 40-hour work week that kept them there because it doesn't just keep you in one place.

At one time. It organizes your mind around a certain number of tasks that you then carry with you through the rest of your day and it leaves you depleted at the end of The Experience spiritually physically depleted so you are not going to have the energy the literal energy to fight like someone who has more time on their hamsters that's why the people who are on the streets first are almost always students. overproduced Elites or maybe some. Sometimes the the unemployed and in the 30s the reason that you had this huge threat to Capital that cohered into the New Deal state is because FDR came into office with this mobilized highly motivated cross-section of people who'd been affected by the depression. Unemployed workers who now had time on their hands but also unemployed intellectual workers. Students also and who they they created structures to reinforce and express their power.

Those have all been destroyed by the way in France which is the closest place you see the 60s rebellions connecting youth to labor. It's because the French work Factory workers worked less than Factory workers anywhere else in Western hemisphere or the the NATO whatever they weren't even in they doing that but you know what I'm talking about the winners of World War II. There you see the response of the workers to the students. Uprising is we will in solidarity lay down our tools whereas in America even if they did oppose the Vietnam War. Like there's a myth that the working class supported the Vietnam War they did not if you look at polls. It's consistent throughout the war. The greatest support was in college educated professionals. They always supported the war. The most working-class people were against Vietnam but they did not regard the Student Response to it. Favorably. They were alienated from it to one degree or another and you see that by the fact that they didn't.

Join hands at any point and when it though that difference expressed itself in the political realm. You had the conflict of 1972 between the new Democratic party of students and and lifestyle liberals around McGovern and the old crudescence labor union movement around um around Hubert Humphrey and what happens working class. The the organized working class in the form of the AFL-CIO. They turn their back on the Democratic party. They went from having single-handedly funded and organized the Humphrey campaign in 68 and almost getting him elected by the end of that campaign. The only money coming in for Humphrey was from the AFL-CIO and the Sargento Frozen cheese family in Minnesota who were like his pet local oligarchs you know who we had a client relationship with so you got the old so the old party itself. The organized interests that control the Democratic party organized labor through its business aligned institutions and local Elites who were part of a patriot Network that directed money one way and favorable regulation in the other and they cut the throat of the McGovern campaign and why because they were working for a living they had a fact they had. They had a house to keep keep up that they had a stake in it too because they were homeowners. So all these things come together to strangle the hopes of a challenging capitalism. Once it gets into real terminal crisis which happens in starts in the 70s and which we're still in the crisis hit in the 70s but the force capable of challenging for power. The organized working class globally had been defeated and with it.

This is where this is my big argument that I'm trying to flesh out in other things. I'm starting to write again. I want to write about this and I wanna. I also want to do another history series soon about the Spanish Civil War. It won't be as long as hell of a hell on Earth. it'll but it'll be written like hell on Earth was I don't know if Chris is and I are going to do it. It depends on whether he wants to do one again because I know he's. He did a lot more work on Hell on Earth and he's he's tuckered out so we'll see. But I'm gonna start working on it soon. But the argument is is that we had the battle of Armageddon. We've fought the bottom Armageddon on an earth when we think of the battle of Armageddon as the final conflict between Christianity as a expression of our Collective Union like the the real Divine truth that underlie every religious tradition. I'm sorry they all spring from this reality.

They're all attempts culturally specific geographically fixed attempts to describe the truth of universal human Brotherhood a God as as a universal encompassing that we are components of that's because that is the deepest expression of what it is to be alive on Earth. Over time. Alienation drives us away from one another and buries this reality. But it is the fundamental truth of all religions and every religious tradition comes from some specific person whose brain had the right structure to receive a signal and transmit. It not perfectly because they can't we're individuals. We cannot hold it all even even our prophets can't hold it all. So we hope that we can and then we express it. Everyone's trying to do that all prophets try to do that how good you are at. It is how much you're able to communicate by your presence and the words you choose the Charisma. In other words a guy like Christ is this charismatic being who looks around his social condition which is I'm a member of a tribe. The Jews bound together by a book and a belief in one God. Unlike all the other people around us and who dominate us who believe that there's basically as many gods as there are peoples and they all just fight against one another all the time and the best and the the one that's stronger wins.

This is the hobbesian state of nature. The closest we've ever seen really and it's expressed in It's not a Hobson state of nature because it's actually a decline from a previous human model of interdependence and and spiritual consciousness that declines over time as fixed Agricultural Society dominates so you can't really call it a natural state but Hobbes is describing a certain State and what that is is the the being at the ascent of Eurasia. the part where you had a huge early explosion of humanity and then a collapse of the biome. So you've got a lot of people living on relatively scarce resources you're living in river valleys surrounded by deserts as opposed to the deeper thicker concentrations of settled peoples farther to the Southwest who live among verdant plenty where you have the development of these overlying.

Dom relatively cyclically cyclically stable political organs like Empires and you have a cyclical relationship to our the essential truth that we hold we're all going to be living dominated under regimes of alienation that cannot be helped by an individual so therefore it must be lived with and the way you live with. It is you graft that we are all part of one experience and that whatever we're living in in this life is some connection to what we had lived previously and that our actions on this life will affect where we end up but none of it is worth sweating because it's all one thing and it will inevitably be knit together and if it's inevitably knit together then you really don't have to worry about anything because why are we afraid of dying we're afraid of an inevitable Oblivion. No the inevitable Oblivion is experienced subjectively because we can't experience death. It is experienced subjectively as reunion so we don't have to sweat it I'm I'm Shoveling.

In this life maybe I'll be riding a horse in the next life and then when it's all over. We could all look back at what happened and laugh so that's the stable relationship that you have in this verdant reality but in the ascend of Central Asia where what had been fertile. Fields become deserts and you still have though these well-established agricultural communities that leave a demographic um footprint that has to be socially related. How is it socially related by people gaining into tribes and then fighting it out until an Empire is formed.

It falls apart the parts fight each other and amongst these tribes one of the most marginal established this written tradition around the idea of a transcendental God that they can be in constant communion with through cooperation with their neighbors as one organ in a way that these regimes of Imperial Dominion in the center do which is to just reinforce these narrow parochial filial ties. Individual families connected root-like to a central nerve a social engine but a rate against each other you have a social organism and but it finds Itself by the time of Christ dominated by these pagans by these the the Iran the Romans who who take the red and tooth and Claw world of dominion as right over and stamp. It across the entire area and and stamp the Jews with it too because the Jews exist as a patron state to the Roman Empire and as such are subject to it and are influenced by it and it's not it's experienced as like a cultural Clash. But it is also an imposition of the Roman economic model and Christ sees this and how how can he address his specific political reality to tell the people hey you know the Messiah we keep talking about that's me if we all accept that I'm the Messiah then anything we do if it's fight the Romans to the death or it's beat. The Romans establish a stable social order and then live as real brothers within it. Because I am now the god you don't have to read the Torah and sit with the question.

The question has been answered. It's me let's go because whatever happens this is the important part. We will all experience it together. At the same time it'll either be a Masada Collective Masada which is still going to heaven or it will be building heaven on Earth. Now given the conditions he was facing. It wasn't a bad plan but it was a long shot and it failed. I do think I've said this before. I think when Christ showed up before Pilate. He expected himself to be saved by the intercession of God in the form of the citizens of the city. Rising as one he thought that was going to be the trigger point but they say now give us Barabbas. You're actually kind of weird because of course he's a weird guy. He's he's a weird guy talking to some weirdos and so then his sacrifice okay. This is the point because at no point is is Christ not still feeling this connection like he's still wired in. He can't unwire even as he's being flayed. Like maybe. He did live for three more days after after he got taken off the cross because like it's not like shooting somebody in the head or cutting or getting decapitated you die by asphyxiation. When you're up on a cross you could lose. Signs of Life be pulled down and then regain it later. It's totally especially if you go into some sort of spiritual trance to say so you use breathing to focus your your Consciousness and overcome sensations of personal of of pain and like basically glitch out of existence and then you can come back into your body.

You have been resurrected they've seen it now. It would have stayed though a cult except for the fact that Christianity solved a real social problem for the expanding Roman Empire. As the Roman Empire grabs more and more territory it starts administering more and more alien polities and that means that social conflict between parts of the Empire build up like dirt in the engine and then of course you have the fact there's constant churning class. Conflict at the very heart of the Roman Empire between the slaves on one hand and the and the free population but then also between the landed free population and the landless the the plebs and the patricians. And this is this is this churning always and it needs to be dealt with the Roman Empire for a while deals with it through expansion. Like all Empires do. It claims more and more territory and buys off social conflict while creating setting the stage for future conflict. It reaches a point of Maximum expansion under trajan and starts to retract and you see. These cyclical conflicts emerge at the heart of the Roman Empire and it keeps falling and Rising really but dynastically. The polity remains for a while because it was so long enduring. It's hard to get rid of that thing overnight that means that the the the regimes the Mandate of Heaven. The regime's social legitimacy is every day undermined.

How do you replace that Christianity is essentially a software patch and as soon as you get that as soon as you get the adoption by the Roman Empire of Christianity and these this new Christian context for sublimating all of these social conflict within the Roman Empire as it collapses. Then you need some new stanchions. Some new social structures and Christianity does the job but not by promising as Christ did that we would all be redeemed on Earth. Together we would live in the we would live in heaven. On Earth. We would live we would build it here which was the promise of Christianity and why early Christians lived in common in a state of apocalyptic anticipation is this good enough is this good enough is this it but they were of course competing with a structure that couldn't accommodate that and they were obliterated. They were driven back into the the social relations that dominated the empire and then the Empire takes that message and says there is There is this land but it is not here and it will not be experienced by all of us at once well. Maybe we'll see it might happen but we're not really working towards it so much as waiting for it and in the meantime you got to do what you got to do. But we'll all be brought together at the end because early Christianity and into the Middle Ages we really don't get this reversed until modern Evangelical Christianity emerges which is really self-worship. By that point It's understood that you don't go to heaven when you die you are Resurrected at the end time judged and then. Brought into the bosom of Christ if you follow the rules so it's it's it is apology.

It is a promise of social harmony but on the installment plan you're gonna have to trust us and their ability to wield that is determined by their ability to build social legitimacy which they do because when the Roman Empire even as the Roman Empire is collapsing Christianity has built such strong structures of social reproduction around in the church that it survives and it's reached and it structures the new regimes of control that come up so once when Anarchy is delayed by the establishment of feudalism from these Germanic Warlords. Basically doing a protection racket on Roman merchants you have the church to sanctify the entire process and to say look we had chaos. Now we have order and it is them to thank we have priests who will say that and you basically just reconsecrated the old hobsian pre-christian social world because you're fighting against each other immediately. But there's still an apocalyptic heart in Christianity that keeps beating and at times of Crisis it expresses itself spontaneously as this cultural cry. This yop this this this yearning to escape this prison and the knowledge that if enough of us did believe we could do it if enough of us believed by God we could do it. Now they said about trying to create Believers by doing it at the sword but the whole time they're making sure that real Christian Fellow feeling can never emerge because regimes of Labor exploitation of of serfs working for Nobles rips them away from each other. So nobody's really working towards Christ. They're working towards themselves already already. We don't have the full liberal social self yet. But it's a it is a fossil in the process that takes us from one social reality to another and of course. Now.

The Jews are along the people who created this thing and who because they live they keep the tribe. Together. They're able to keep the the written heart of the thing alive and beating and extend it outward. They become the vent. These are the people responsible. This is why we're not happy. This is why we don't all have Christian institutions really. This is why we have we don't have Heaven on Earth and they're suffering. It's because the Jews even though what they're doing is trying to preserve what they'd had which the pagans who got converted to Christianity had never had and there's an interesting reading of The Book of Revelation that which is the Evangelical Christian's favorite book of the Bible the the ever since the Millennium. It's been the one they focus on the Left Behind series. All that stuff is actually written by a Jew a Jewish Christian as a warning about what would happen if the religion got consumed by the new influx of former Pagan Christians who didn't have a social rooting in Judaism. What would they do to the church that's why they needed Armageddon to happen as soon as possible to stop that from happening and so the very people that Jonah Patmos was worried about are now the people who are most fetishistically devoted to carrying out the Book of Revelation. They are the because Judaism it gives birth to the Christian tradition but it is also defined by its rupture with it. So you're saying nothing by saying judeo-christian Christian is the Pagan world of red and tooth and Claw by this.

By this sign of the sword I conquer God gives me not because God gives me favor not because I am a member of a group that has obligations to one another not that I have carried out his will and fulfilled his His commands of me but because I won the fight with this new Christian notion that there's a heaven somewhere that believing in Christ will get you there and it's divorced from the social reality but social the social reality that that caused early Christians to start appearing among the pagans among the slaves and among the guilty Nobles and Merchants who were stuck between the two. Merchants first of all always Merchants first of all the one stuck between the land and the palace they aren't adhering to it because hey this I could live this life if you're if you're if you're an ER if you're a a merchant. In second century Roman Empire the Levant and you're struggling to live and struggling to survive and seeing horrible violence carried out in the name of the Sovereign. All the time you want an escape from that and if you're a merchant and you're not tied into a relationship where you are either working for someone or you are dominating and supervising and controlling another. Then you can feel the autonomy to try to build that and they did. The early Christians did try to live communally but it was not possible competing with self-interest because it is a superior survival machine but the thing is we're all on this Earth.

Together we can all say when you live among Plenty when you live in super abundance which you don't have where these religions emerge so in the apocalyptic Vision comes to Christianity that is it does at the turn of the Millennium as it does in the 1500s when the Reformation occurs It is this swelling yearning to align our understanding our social understanding our emotional understanding of what Christ is with the world that we find ourselves living in and that is all the millennial movements. The anapaptists. The the hussites they're all powered by this but they can only be expressed through social structures which are dominated by the owning class so it all gets institutionally captured and if there's a rebellion to go along with it. It's put down politically and it's eventually extinguished around the 1700s and that God dies but God is going to bring us all together in a supernatural reunion in a huge God just showing up one day and giving everybody a big hug like that as a imagined social reality like a horizon that we describe to ourselves imagine in our minds depict in our art and reflect back to us. Aesthetically we're trying to get that and then the the Reformation is a grasp for that the 30 Years War. The the early modern era all those revolutions and revolts. It's all grasping towards it. But it's all failing because there is not cohered a working class capable of really controlling technology. They are still at the ass end of this relationship. They are they are geographically and mentally too far from power to do anything other than provide fuel for an inter ruling class conflict or rather between one element of the one. one element of the ruling class and another the holders of capital and the holders of land.

I'm not a repressed believer. I'm a Believer. I didn't used to be. But I am now it's cool but that dies and it's replaced by this Collective materialism. We think we still have Christianity but we really don't We have this Enlightenment conception that suffuses everything and which by the way the fact that it's diffuses. Everything is exactly what makes all the morons who want to erase the enlightenment so tedious they don't they don't realize time is Moves In One Direction and that it builds social realities in One Direction and once you've gotten to that level of abstraction. You can't go back unless you have a complete collapse of social conditions and wiping away of the of the of the board. Now that is what reactionaries want because they want to die in battle like there's two types of people under capitalism at the top and their religions their World Views. They might have different vocabularies given time or place but under undergirding them is a central difference. One group wants to die in battle and the other group wants to die in their bed. One group wants to be annihilated in righteous combat with a foe. The other group wants to be surrounded by loved ones and told that they were a good person.

I should write the orange Catholic Bible honestly. I might do that um but the urge doesn't go anywhere. It's the Christianity is now captured by the ruling power. Christianity means rule by an elite because we have to rule in order to decide who goes to heaven and who goes to hell and all this. It's all packed up in the church they built and they own it completely because there's no more social reproduction of it because the the relationship between the peasantry. The land-based people and their local religious Authority has been annihilated one way or the other it's been alienated. People have been pulled up tore out thrown into the cities where they don't have that relationship. So they cannot reproduce God in a religious sense but because they are the bottom half they can imagine it in a physical sense. Like oh we can have heaven on Earth not because Jesus is going to show up but because we are going to overthrow those who rule us and then treat each other. The way we want to be treated which we've learned from the experience of being mutually exploited and so the continuation of Christianity as it unfolds in an attempt to deal with the the increasing technological regime of accumulation that overalls life on the planet.

 the Socialist movement broadly stated with Marxism is the approximation of a holy book at its heart because you need a book. It becomes the next phase of a materialized Christianity that has given up on the hope of going to heaven because I can't believe that that world exists anymore because they can't feel it. They can't taste it. They now live in their head in a way that they didn't before. But we can come together because we believe in each other enough we love each other enough and what is love but not an expression of this very thing that we're trying to embody and in that love we can overthrow these people destroy their old gods and build on Earth. A life that will allow us even if we don't believe there's anything after death but a big black curtain allow us to die easily Elias Elias to live and then die peacefully now again. There's still going to be people who want to die in battle but that can be socially productive that the urge can be sublimated into something productive if you're surrounded by a positive social feedback loop and so that is how you get a society where you've knitted together.

All these seemingly deep like this is human nature contradictions you can knit them all together but only if you collectively as a working class seize control of this machinery and the 20th century and the 19th and 20th Century from 18 I would say 18 1789 yes. 1789 to 1945. Is Armageddon. It is a series of battles between Christianity which is actually satanism the worship of the South against Christianity. These socially embedded religious tradition coming from the bottom. No. I'm not some people say 91 not 91 because as soon as the Yanks get the bomb the war is over. It's just a question of how long it will take for the Armistice to be signed and it took until 1991 but as soon as the Yankees have the nukes it's over. Because this is a real battle. This is not a war of positions. I think this is how you have to understand this this is a life and death blood fight. This is a literal holy war and it's fought everywhere and after 1945 they keep fighting it.

But they keep they start fighting it outside of Europe. Outside of Asia spread it out and and dominate the rest of the world and capitalize the rest of the world. But because those countries those parts of the world are not. United not knitted together have no activated working class. Their response to this is wholly asymmetrical and they are in peace defeated except for the Chinese who come a little late to the party because they've had this dominating Imperial structure and the cyclical spiritual relationship but by the 19th century that starts coming under pressure too and first you get the taiping revolution. An attempt to bring Christianity to the fore and use the Christian Millennium to get people to act but by 1945 that's gone too that's been extinguished by A Century of talk of conflict and it's replaced by by communism. Another European import another teleological import because you have to have a straightening of the manala to in the modern context direct social forces but the late 19th and early 20th century is when the real battle begins because you have organized working class in the Amer in the cities of the West politically expressive mobilized to one degree or another in this on the shop floor at The Ballot Box and on the military parade ground to one degree or another throughout Western Europe and the United States. They're in conflict with the state.

In every case some places it's more violent than others. The U.S very violent the most violent of outside of South America of course which is just America but you know because there was less of a a European settlement and the more of a maintaining a domination over fixed Colonial agricultural relationships that are not really overturned. It expressed itself more violently but it's violent everywhere and that violence gets to a point where these capital states start having to reform around the turn of the century and allow for Mass politics but but this gives the mass access to Technologies. Like oh now oh now workers can make their own militias and have the same guns that that the Army has they can use the technology like the printing press and later radio to reach people that they can use social mechanisms of organization like the labor union and the political party to express their interest. This is a conflict. This is stress that stress has to go somewhere so it goes out to the Empire. We can solve this problem at the center by soothing it with Colonial exploitation and it works for a while but eventually once you have enough competition and the late comers like Germany show up at the trough. That's the important thing you've got countries like Germany emerging on the world scene late because they came together as single polities late and coming to the to try to solve their social problems with the same Colonial. expansion that the other ones had they come into conflict over those things. You have a global war. That is the expression of this sublimated class war at the center of capitalism and this should have emerged all of the leading socialists thought it would once the because first you have the attempt to have the working class parties and unions of Europe. refused to go to war but of course that fails because while they haven't built up they haven't built up long enough or durably enough to make that challenge the time isn't right yet the mo. The the degree of militancy doesn't meet the moment because it's one thing to fight at War positions in peacetime. But when it's hey there's a war we're going to fight the other powers of Europe that raises the stakes very fast and the state is able to match that bet in a way that the labor-based Civil Society can't and so they folded their hand where didn't. They fold their hand in the United States and in Russia the farthest the places where the working class was farthest from power but for two different reasons in America because we've developed this Frontier of free real estate. We had this Yeoman society that it abolished the the The Peasant relationship and then we have Russia which is never got developed. They had the 19th century. They had the 20th century dropped on their doorstep in 1900 on on a feudal doorstep. They are almost completely defined by The Peasant relationship either way socialism. The the creation of a socialist machine is absent because that working-class engine is is much weaker so their Stakes are lower.

They can say no to the war are you closer to power. You feel more responsibility well for the German social Democrats that we don't vote for war credits. They're going to kick us out of power because the people are also nationalistic. Well shouldn't we stay in power isn't that better than giving up these controls yes and then they do it and there you go. It's over then. The war ends with revolutions with real social conflict. In almost all these countries which was inevitably going to happen because there had to be it was going to return to the Metropole and to the countries that lost it was going to return harder and it did.

The thing is the country that Lost World War One the worst was Russia. They've lost so bad that they were effectively out of the War a year early because they're because their working class was so We feeble so was there bourgeois so they couldn't make a Bourgeois Revolution. They could try and they had a paneer veneer of one but it could not hold power which is why the Bolsheviks were correct to rise. In October there was no what what everybody else thought the mensheviks and the SR thought is well let them cook. But the thing is they were not going to cook. They were going to be overthrown by the military because the Puja was not strong enough to do it. But the thing that got them going out out and seizing was not just that the Tactical thing because the tactics only get you so far. The Bolsheviks were religious believers. They believed in this extension of the cosmic conflict between good and evil that is going to be resolved at Armageddon.

The the thing that fueled Christian eschatology the the heart in the heartless world that Marx talks about when he talks about religion. The thing that made them bullshits in the first place and able to recognize the moment and able to act so decisively is because they thought we're going to trigger a World Revolution that is going to even if we die fighting we will die building something we will not surrender to capitalism which means we will die together either in par. Either Paradise we built on Earth or a paradise of action where we are building something Marxist Lutheran's Lutheran's bolsheviks's Calvinists anarchists to zanapaptists ah perfect. This is all very facile but I think it is true and meaningful to point out because God didn't go away and it's just not. God isn't where the language of God is. That's what I mean because the working class was defeated in 1945 and the institutions that would have propelled working class towards a conflict with capital in the 70s which was which is what happened or it becomes a world system becomes self-enclosed. It can no longer expand outward and therefore will begin to eat itself the thing that happened with trajan the thing that happened with the Ottomans. The thing that's now happening to the United States and we have these we had institutions that could articulate a social vision of of Apocalypse to go with the religious fire and brimstone nihilistic fantasy of Oblivion that Christians believe in but now that's gone and we live in in the world where Satan won the battle of Armageddon.

Now that doesn't mean we're damned though that's the beauty part of it. It just means that the World As We Know It will never be reconciled to us. But we will all as people be reconciled Maybe I'll talk about this next week. But this is the gist of what I'm trying to talk about I I I want to get this across Stay Free. People bye.
