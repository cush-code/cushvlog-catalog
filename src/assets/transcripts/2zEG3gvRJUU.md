If there's a spot I can make a desk or something here oh well. I guess. I'm gonna have to hold it. I could put it in here. Maybe I don't know they got away. Hello hello everybody oh.

Hello friends trying to get this a little bit comfortable hello friends. So yesterday I don't know if anybody watched the stream I did last night uh. I was kind of tripping balls and at the end of it I had at the after I finished recording. I sat in my little back area. A little fenced in area and I looked up at the sky for a while and when you know it I ended up having one of those legitimate like full-blown Satori moments. Actual enlightenment actual transcendence like one second one with the universe wherever you want to call it ego death bah bah. Bah I was there and then oh  just can't hear me can you guys hear me so so there's no sound okay. I guess there's sound I don't know why people are trying to trying to guess like pork crush and trying to talk to you guys please. So anyway I had a moment of complete identification oneness with the universe and then of course. The second it was over. I came back into my body. It became reincarnated rebodied as me and of course. I started falling away from that moment.

You know as the role the rock started rolling back down the hill and I was Sisyphus and I got to walk down it and the thing about Sisyphus is. Camus says you must imagine Sisyphus happy that's one of those things that just sounds like a Zen koan or something I understand it now because happy Sisyphus is one of gifts the top of the hill as often as possible because being on the top of the hill is fun and walking down the hill. It's not as fun as being on the top of the hill. But it's a lot more fun than pushing the goddamn rock up the hill so you just got to increase the the circuits you can't keep pushing the hill the Bull Boulder up one long gradient which is what most people do and what's recurse to do because of our material realities that constrain us and and and chain us so as I was coming back to my body and I was going down the hill and falling away the first word that came into my mind after because obviously in that time in space. There's no words because language is obliterator that's not needed because you are one you don't need to translate as soon as I come back to my body the first word it was. It was a image in the sky of a crashing wave and the word yes and I realized that a lot of the like stuff I've been trying to get my head around in terms of like spirituality and theology and questions of light body and mind and all these things that have been kind of I've been working on my head. I feel like I'm making progress but I've been struggling with cut through the word yes cut through a lot of it and it created a symbolic order that allowed me to make sense of everything I've been trying to get my head around and so since of since my specific orientation as age race gender class background language culture all that stuff.

When I heard yes. The first thing I thought was the end of Ulysses and I got and all of a sudden I had one moment. I'm thinking oh. That's what it's like to have read Ulysses and then I was like oh wait a minute and then I thought oh great. Now. I don't have to read Ulysses. But then I realized I have to read Ulysses now even if it's bad even if it's a slaw good even if it's whatever because it will remind me of that moment and doing it everyday will remind me of that moment and kick me living in a way that gets me there or gets me closer to it and it will inform my actions and it will inform my behavior towards the people around me and it will make them turn towards that sound. So I'm gonna start reading Ulysses and I'm thinking I might do it. Maybe chapter by chapter on here. Like I said it doesn't matter if it's good or not but doesn't matter if it's worth it. What matters is reading it see look. This is what I'm thinking and this is the reason that I'm thinking in these terms is.

I did a tweet that got a lot of people mad about better call Saul because I said better call Saul in my opinion suffers for trying to be a prestige show. Given the ingredients it has you've got you've got Saul Goodman here played by Bob Odenkirk. A great character. We all love and we've got these great people behind the cast the great cinematography and they but and they meant and it ended up being the show. It is with its you know basically copying the rhythms of Breaking Bad and becoming a Breaking Bad of six Blissett prequel filling in all these gaps of well. Where'd Hector get his bail and things like that that's inevitable as soon as it had to fit the format of a prestige show and the thing is is that as a prestige show it probably is great I've watched enough of it. Yes. It fits all of the terms that we discuss when we talk about prestige television.

Yes. It is as good you want to argue. I will say it's as good as Mad Men. It's as good as break. It's as good as Breaking Bad or even better. It's as good as Sopranos whatever you want to say fine. It's good but it's good in the context of a television show and the fact is and I've written about prestige TV and I've talked a lot about it and I just keep trying to act ikkyu late something that I've never actually been able to explicitly say in a way that felt to me like it even got what Mike I felt like I was even saying when I met let alone if other people understood it and what I realized. After with this you know mental Ginsu now to chop everything up that I encounter is my problem. A better call Saul is that it is a product of the Demiurge better call.


Saul. Like all prestige TV is a product of the Demiurge art is an attempt to reach the etheric plane. Art is always an attempt to strike at the heart of the universe is to strike God and become God. Every piece of every attempt at art is that in some small way the way that the person making it can do or try to do its the urge to do it. But then there's the reality the embodied reality of being a person being in a body that has needs and if there's no material needs that shape the world and limit us. That's what the Gnostics talked about. That's what uh that's what the Demiurge the evil God who creates this material world that's illusion below the the the spiritual realm like in this case if we're talking about art specifically in the context of art you know in an objective sense.

Television is a more degraded form of art than literature by the very simple fact that it is more commercial and you might say well you know Stephen King makes a lot of money and blah blah know what I mean. By that is a book. A the writing of a book and the publication of a book are relatively capital on intensive. Making a television show is kept much more by like attic by by exponential numbers more capital-intensive than a book which means that whatever art is in it has been constrained by being a product of a commercial enterprise and so that means that television will be. It can be good. Every show could be fun every show you should enjoy every program you watch either stop watching it. If you can't find yourself enjoying it or find something about it that speaks to you. Everything should be enjoyable artistically and if it isn't then you just don't you shouldn't find something that will something that you can work with.

It's because some things aren't gonna work because the the talent of the people involved the amount of resources put to it the amount of commercialism left and within it that it's gonna hit you and it's gonna make it hard that is why I see I see better call Saul and I go look because it just reminds me that we're all praying to this like degraded version of art and the reason we are is because we have been immiseration like culturally thought. Capitalism has done that to us. That's not a con. It's not something you can argue like our tastes are more broad and people popped up. It's like to say oh you're being a snob. But I'm recognizing a goddamn reality here which is that there's a structural difference between art depending on how much there they are required to make money the degree to which a piece of art needs to make money to be worth the endeavor. Levin's its artistic per its individual artistic expression because it has to be translatable to the largest possible group and the art in translation gets lost and so that's fine you could find the sparks you can find. The things you like in anything including Breaking Bad but what happened is is because we have been we've lost free time. We've lost energy. We've what we've we've we've lost the ability to take a small moment and treasure something and really dig into it that we need our entertainments to be go down easier.

They have to be absorbable because we don't have the energy the mental or spiritual energy to sit with anything because of where we are because of how degraded our conditions are because of our bodies. Essentially all these institutions capitalism feudalism before it was a slave labor. Every every class order created was created to to manage the issue of getting bodies. Keeping bodies alive basically and that creates our structures. It creates our economic structures. It creates our art. Its art creates our culture. It creates our personalities. It creates our religions. It creates our ideologies. It requires creates everything it creates this computer. It creates this phone. It creates this shirt and it creates the systems that create the exploitation a hyper exploitation that go into making this shirts and the-the-the-the gunpoint slave coltan mining that makes this this foam and those things are all necessary to the degree to which they allow for the body's human bodies to be restored.


But then there's the temptation to seek pleasure and pleasure always comes at the expense of someone else and pleasure also always comes at the expense of us. Always. All pleasure is at the expense of others and at the expense of ourself karma and so these institutions get warped the Crowder. The Crooked Timber of humanity. No straight thing was ever made what that means is. The crookedness is the fact that we have bodies and that's not a sin. It's not bad you need to get the Christian. The Christian thing is another a mother mistranslation from the initial uh from the initial true divining of like reality. The material world gets in the way and it gets baffled and so Christianity gets muddled up with all this stuff and so when you say the but that like the body creates this world that's like well that's bad no. It's not bad.

It's a national bullets and its inherent we have to deal with it. We have to create a society that minimizes a suffering by spreading pleasure out as broadly as possible not concentrating on any individual because that doing so creates a situation where you cause misery to all the people whose exploitation goes into the pleasure of that one person and then that person's pleasure guess what it's fleeting. It's going away. They're gonna face the flames of judgement which is the coming of death with the terror of Hell. In their heart. There's no stopping it and so no one has gotten any kind of benefit out of that arrangement. We've we have to have some suffering and pleasure just to keep the bodies going but it should be spread out that's where the dialect comes in. And that is why like somebody said go back to Marxism I'm sorry but this moment made me realize that like these are nesting series of thoughts and ideologies and like structures and guess.

What nesting in here is dialectical materialism because that is how these this truth is like certains just like maybe Gnosticism or Buddhism or something or the Dark Tower or  I was talking about infant Jess the other day and maybe Ulysses. Those things help structure like your thoughts and make it make it easier for you to behave in a way that that reduces suffering. But then you need structures within other people amongst people in the social realm of economic production political economy that need to serve those ends as well. A dialectal materialism is the drive towards that it is the drive towards a world where everyone is free of the bodily. A needs bodily temptations and distractions is the word to reach full enlightenment and like when people talk about fully actually fully automated luxury space communism.

There's a lot wrong with that notion but the true thing it's reading with is that the only way for a universal human enlightenment which if enlightenment is the individual goal. As it well should be then presumably. It is the universal goal for all humans. Then you need some sort of taming and an instrumentalizing of technology toward the goal of human enlightenment as opposed to the dark singularity. We're moving toward where the machine takes over and totally annihilates human spirituality completely and turns us into machines and so we don't want that and so how do we stop one or the other. How do we get to this and now how do we push how do we push that yeah. But you require zal a kit so you get to the top and you don't get there and stay there. It's a process you go back. You go back and you come back and you go back and you come back. It's pushing the  boulder up the hill. That's why it's compatible goddamn. Gotta get never mind but um so if we want that version where all Universal enlightenment.

Then it requires in my view and I might be and the thing is I am wrong at some point in time in the future I am wrong. I think I'm right now and I think I am right. Now. I have enough history around me and I think I'm smart enough and compassionate enough together to figure out like broadly what's right more specifically as it gets drilled down. I don't have the information or the intelligence to specifically answer questions of Technol technological like technological questions. Social questions whatever but broadly I think I'm right but I'm not right forever at some point. My what I am at some point the future at some point space-time what everything I think is going to be wrong every single thing and that's true of you to every human being every single thing you have ever thought every decision you have ever made has been wrong and we are all in fact that the the the the sum total of our wrong choices.


So this is all the way of saying that you can enjoy better call Saul to enjoy better call. Saul. Of course it makes doesn't make sense to watch it if you're not going to enjoy watching it to get mad at it. You're getting pleasure somewhere else and at the end of the day the pleasures another's expense because what are you gonna do you're gonna go online like I have a million times and like kick people in the dick and say hi. You. This shows stupid and you're dumb for liking it. That's the pleasure I get out of it and that's it someone else's expense. It's all pleasure is see what makes a decision right or wrong buddy exactly. It's not defined until afterwards. It's only retrospectively known because all time has already happened. Everything has already happened. Everything has already happened and when I say everything I mean not just in your life I mean the lives of all beings to exist or ever will exist but so you can enjoy better call Saul but you see the way people are defensive about the show and to see the way they get mad about it and the way they write and even if they're not mad the way they insist on its greatness. It's because they have decided that instead of acknowledging that lack at the heart of prestige TV is a concept instead of saying oh. This is sad that now we have to get our real like artistic nourishment from something this just bond all eyes. It's banal eyes. It has to be because it's commercial. It has to be banal eyes and I'm and I'm this is I have to squeeze I have to try so hard to squeeze meaning out of it not up for this not for my enjoyment show but to convince other people and myself. That watching. This is actually good and that's where that's why that's the sad. That's why your love of.

If your say yeah bring bet. It's like it's not necessarily bad. It's not. It's not going to doom you to like it in that way but it it implies a attachment to something that is degraded without acknowledging and recognizing the degradation and without the ability to recognize the degradation. You cannot act in a way in your life to move away from degradation both in your interpersonal relationships in your preferences. What you do with your time and what you think politics should be and how you should activate act on political beliefs. If prestige TV is good enough then what out by do you need to change anything see here we go somebody says so commercial art is bad. No no art is bad. The goodness of a every individuals. Relationship to a piece of art is completely individualized and it's in.

It's a result of translations because all artists translation. All existence is translation your brain literally translating to you through language what is happening to it first and symbols. First and senses then in symbols then in words words to yourself and then words to others at every level. The translation breaks down. There is loss between every level of translation and by the time you're trying to express an idea through art. You're way down here you're so degraded. But there's still if you're talented enough and enough people see it and if you're collaborating with others and you make something together which because collaboration is. That's what like that's depending on the art form helps in the project. It helps signal boost like and in bring together. A you know individual insights and individual talents and it creates something so there's something to it. There's a spark to all art. It's just either the talent was not there to to express it fully or or it was a piece of cynical  with the right frame of mind and enjoy it.

The danger is when you mistake the shadows for the figures and that is what prestige television does if we just accepted ya TV. It's it's the idiot box. The shows could be. The same have the same stuff and and it would be fine but a a culture that requires television to be good is one that has not acknowledged its barriers. Exactly the map is not the territory ya. See like this is all this stuff.


Like the Plato stuff I never really got now. I get it. Gnosticism. I never really got I feel like I get it and of course. I get it less now than I did yesterday and I will get it less tomorrow than I do. Today my task is to get back is to remember that moment remember what I knew then and try to find it again and the way to do that is by daily acts by the Eightfold Path by the path of the beam. What that really means is not just. I'm gonna say epic pact of the beam when I see like a  Stephen King reference. It means doing my relationships with other people at my every action informed by the knowledge of what is there the imminence. Beyond behind reality the real. The real universe beyond the Demiurge achill one and then trying to get there and so that means I've got a that means these reading projects. It's not about learning something it's about relearning something because you don't know anything you only have echoing clanging notions in your head.

A lot of them contradict each other and the only way to thread them together in a way to make them useful is to sit with them and that is not something that anything we do encourages not something anything in our culture. Encourages is sitting with these questions yes existential materialism whatever you want to call it Gnosticism whatever you guys want to say well. We're gonna put these if you've missed anything you can go back these these now update to my. They don't go to the stories. Anymore. I guess ask Instagram why but now they go to the time the grid I guess they're called so if you miss anything you can check that and all this while the cheeto in the right house what are the health because like Gnosticism says we. This is a degraded Shadow Realm. It is it's a greater chatter realm of material reality but we have to work with it.

How do we work with it. How do we put how do. We thread it. How do we push it in a direction that leads towards the chance for Moore's as many people as possible to achieve transcendence and direct it back to themselves in the future and to everyone else who can hear them in their lives and people's around them. It's by by the dialect it's by earth. It's by by resolving contradiction because contradiction is at the heart of existence. No and yes the universe. The universe is yes and it's always there and it is outside of space and time. The world is now and it is and we are all every person every being in the universe every memory photon every chain of chemicals. Every every anything those things are all knows. Those are different levels of rejecting and the thing is there aren't that many of them but there doesn't need to be because yes it exists outside of space and time. It is the accumulation of knows. Over this endless pants. They are accumulated in actual reality that in this world and you got to get back to yes and the thing is I say that and you hear it.

It's like what does that mean and for me these words getting back to yes. They're freight 'add with my memory of this experience. You are only hearing my words retell it which is fraudulence. This nietzsche points out all language is a lie. All I can do is use my talents that's such as existed they to such extent that they exist and and my will my morality to I intellect to to try to push in the direction of the good. So that's better call Saul like I said. I'm sure half of this is totally incoherent. It makes sense to me but that's because I experienced it and my hope is is that by like trying to take this seriously as a practice of mind.

I will stay close enough to this that I can occasionally get back there and when I come back hopefully I'll have an even better vocabulary because I've had these moments before they're all drug related because I'm a cheater because I'm a lazy. Because I have bad morality I have I mean now bad morality. See once again the judgmental I my my bad and good traits all my bad and good traits intellectually and morally whatever were fixed in time by the mistakes of others. It is still my duty then to live with them and and proceed with them and try to use what I have. That's good minimize what I have. What's bad that is my task that is why both we are both totally determined all activities. All all actions are fully determined physically absolutely and yet you still have free will ya know I'm hoping to meditate more as well.

The sublime exactly that's what we're talking about and like people come at that from different ways. Like and different things contribute to your ability to get there and like my specific combination of abilities and and my character traits was positive and negative that had been fixed but by others got me a spot to see a couple. These moments and every time I came back with a little more of it that made sense and then it would go away and the fact that. I was only able to articulate it somewhat is part of what made it go away because I couldn't convince myself to keep trying because I couldn't even I couldn't even keep translating it to myself because I kept forgetting it because I was not in that present moment of mind and now that I have an even more like coherent vocabulary for it that actually makes sense I'm hoping that I can express that everyday I can already feel it like right. Now it feels different but like I said it goes away with time and that's the thing remember nobody really believes all beliefs are acted upon and if you don't act on your beliefs. You don't really believe them and like the thing is that doesn't just mean big lofty out like ideological blows like literally down to you know true/false like objective same as fact if you don't believe something you don't act on it. And I need to believe this in order to act on it which means I have to keep in that mind space because in that mind space I know with full certainty that I am correct and the thing is. It doesn't matter. If I'm not because there is no there's no one to check. It's my body. It's my consciousness.


It's gonna end. At some point I want it to end. I want to be able to greet death with a smile by having at least come close enough to the ineffable that maybe I can grab for the ring. You know what I mean or get there. Whenever I want I mean obviously that's the Buddhist like end state which is very difficult to achieve why because you have to actually have. Material conditions met like you have relationships with people. You are meshed in a social network that has to be nourished so that means that it doesn't matter. If I there is no right or wrong. There is no there's no one's gonna check. The score. After I die no one is gonna look at my test results. It's all about what happens in the interim. Between those two cosmic does mistakes my life my birth which is the result of the accumulated mistakes of everyone leading up to that moment and my death which will be caused by the accumulated mistakes of everyone else and myself. But of course those mistakes were caused by other people's mistakes because as I said all acts are fully determined see this person saying oh you can do things without thinking about your actions exactly exactly.

You're not thinking about your actions so you are carrying out a belief that's the actual belief. The thing you think you don't really think you think you think it but you don't really think it if you really did you'd act that way it's not. It's like. I really believe it no you don't and it's like if it gets up at there. Like if you guys are talking about political stuff like Marxism or like socialism or something. Those are so huge and amorphous that like it's impossible to tie them to enough direct actions to say one way or the other. But they trickle down into specific premises and if you do not really believe the premise you will not act on it. It's unconscious but it's real and the thing is is that people are so  afraid of being wrong and I think I realize is that you must always know how that you are wrong you're wrong something deeply something that you believe in the soul is wrong. It might not be wrong.

Now you might live your entire life and that thing you believe is true but at some point it won't be true anymore every fact statement ever was true. At some point. There's a famous Bertrand Russell philosophical like proposition where he he's talking about like he's talking about language as like order how like a sentence that's that's correct without being correct in his presence and his example was the sentence. The present King of France is bald right that was his that was his hip pocket example and of course. That is the the words in that sentence makes sense they're in the right order and it gives you meaning but there is no present King of France so his hair were its non-existence is but the thing is there was a preppin bald King of France. The one of the Carolinians was  Charles the bald and every and and if you think outside of your life if you think outside of this world and think of the nested nested nested tests or acting expanding multiple versions of you multiple versions of Earth that exists then it's happened somewhere all that all of them have happened somewhere so every statement.

Every belief is true at some point and it's your job in life to to in good faith seek truth knowing that you will fail knowing that you will fail knowing that the vast majority of us will 99.999% of us die in fear and horror and and knowing that all you can do is try and see it like. Somebody said unfalsifiable how could you falsify anything you can't falsify. I don't know man. I build this pretty sure. He said that yeah Bertrand Russell the present King of France. Why do you people gasp like me or are you like trying to make up. I don't know I shouldn't care see. This is the thing I need to remember. It doesn't matter if it's correct or not doesn't matter. If I'm right or not.


I just need to try to communicate to people and if I'm good enough at doing it and I try long enough and hard enough. It's a real important thing. Then hopefully somebody will get something out of it and it will help them and will help me exactly many don't try because they don't know how to and that's why this has to be divorced from judgment. You do you have to divorce this from judgment like the person who is unable to choose due to like a child soldier in Liberia. There they are fixed by others mistakes and others weaknesses a  Donald Trump. Jr. Is fixed by the in Donald Trump himself. The Hitler all fixed. They still had a responsibility to to to seek truth and they failed.

But they failed because of specific limitations imposed on them from outside and so all we could do is try to live in accordance with beliefs as close to enlightenment as possible so that we can speak them and live them to others so that they can live them to others. It's like a  multi-level marketing scheme. It's it's a Ponzi scheme that ends with the world being universally enlightened and the universe winking out of existence because the Demiurge spoiler alert the evil god who created this material fake world guess what it's me spoiler alert. It's also you every one of us is God and every one of us is the Demiurge and the Demiurge. In material form is the accumulated bad decisions of every human being and then within us. The damage is that which accepts that reality of face value so and see like I was thinking about this the other night like well I was thinking about I thought about Jordan Peterson and Jordan Peterson.

About about like dragons of chaos like he is getting at real things real dialectical dialectical engagements. Real binaries but his premise is elsewhere are wrong so he reached his bad conclusions from an essentially based correct and then you get people who and the thing is like. The most of people who get mad at Peterson have not gotten as deep as him. They are treading in shallow water. They are more trapped by the material restraints than him. But they're there right there more right than him. In other ways they have a understand like the implications and reality of like social structures and politics and economics better than him. Maybe so they are he is wrong and they are right even though he is right and they are wrong just at different times in two different places and it's about twisting all of these into an arrangement where all of the  finger trapper.

Like one of those what the hell is that codex and there's all these different arrays. These binaries these interlacing binaries and you have to get all the yeses on one side and all the nose on the but figuring that out is the work of life and it's a collaborative work and as you might be right down here in one part of the puzzle and you're wrong up here and guess what your. To somebody who's wrong up here and right down there which is what you see with these awful just dispiriting battles between ID Paul people and and the outright Nazis or whatever and like TRADD cats versus you know sex workers. It's like they have all gotten something correct but there are things that they are accepting certain thesis that are wrong that are set expecting certain fundamental thesis. They're accepting features of this superstructure of culture and expectation and value that are generated by capitalism at face value.

It's just different now the reason you behave morally is because if you ain't morally it other people respond to it. That's why and if you maintain morality even if they don't you acknowledge and recognize why they aren't. It's collaborative. Yes. It's being mostly right but not just on a like. There's that less wrong subreddit where they all want to  like put a USB cord in their dick or whatever they're thinking in terms entirely of intellect like we're going to split time and I'm gonna live forever and a robot body. No you're not now you live for another  robot body and even if you did guess what there is not fine it. There's a finite amount of energy in the universe so after what you get to be a floating robot body for what five million years how is your brain. How is your buddy. What is your life like what is your. What is how is your heaven its hell. Its eternal hell until death congratulations. But it's less wrong on the axis of intellect and rationality and insight but also in feeling and empathy and social coordination and social life because the end is coming either way the end of your life. The end of the universe the end of lurve life on earth the end of everything it will come to an end and then it will start again. It will start over again and you'll get it wrong again. Everyone will get it running in but slightly differently and then eventually somewhere and it's already happened to get it right which is why we even have consciousness was why this world even exists because at some point we closed the loop.


I'm actually not on any drugs right. Now. I'm not. I haven't even smoked weed today. Having to add in the alcohol. I gotta say I don't know I mean I'm probably the still gonna smoke weed once in a while as you know as as my weakness overwhelms me and as I fail as I will but right now I don't need it. I'll need it in the future but the thing is and this is one thing that defeats so many people's attempts to seek. Enlightenment is that if they fail once in like I guess I didn't get it. I guess I didn't do it. But it's not you're never fixed. You're you're you're you aren't you don't you aren't anything you aren't a Marxist. You are an American. You aren't a Christian. You aren't. Any of that you are you are in a quantum state at all times until you act until your brain thinks a thought and then you act on it. You're not anything and that is the mark of mistakes on the world. How do you close the loop as I described universal consciousness and on a long enough timeline and with enough universes that will happen as all things will. Yes I do therefore I am because I remember reading at derekjjensen and he's like Ann Ann creme whatever. But he made a good point about that. At the time I thought was stupid he was talking about like the the awful list of Cartesian dualism and saying like to see. Descartes. Say I think therefore I am and he wrote I want to go to Descartes. Say Rene do you not also feel and I was like a 19 year old like I thought I was read. It didn't exist but I would have been on it going like that's stupid but now I understand what that means you need both. They are literally the same thing they are. They are both. They are both conditions of consciousness that operate independently and also between each other. It's not an action is flawed read about your delay shut up. It doesn't matter if it's right or not.

It doesn't matter it cuz like of course. I don't know the specifics I haven't done the reading. I don't know how to do math complex. Math I can't even count on my. Fingers does it matter what matters is whether it makes me act right and the reading gets you to act right you don't learn anything. You don't become something by reading it the act of reading it and thinking it in flex your behavior right because no is the other no is recognizing the other yeah. I don't see how that contradicts what I said that yes your but your your autonomic system acts before you. But that's that's physiological and that's just the same translation system and there's a delay because of that. But you still then something that comes into your mind and it's determined by what you've interacted with like what I'm saying is. This is all determined. It's all determined but you still have to act but the thing is you. You know you always recognize the other. Even if you say you don't you are of whether it's to to try to embrace or to destroy. It's a recognition of the other. No matter what like the other is not just like a minority or another claim the other is your. Mom you know the other is literally every other conscious being that you encounter whose will reminds you of your subjectivity or your objectivity rather because being an object and a subject is essentially contradiction and it freaks out your brain and we've been trying to like get back to to harmony it and it's very difficult because of the conditions that our bodies require to to maintain them alright well. It looks like everyone's mad at me I'm sorry. They're just trying to work some stuff out. I'm not gonna try to argue with anybody especially over the thing but especially like I said I'm probably describing a lot of this incorrectly because I'm not a genius. I just know what I felt and I know what is the closest human words to what it felt like and like I said it can't be wrong because I know it was right and it's like if I act on it and it results in people getting mad at me and every like a like as Raylan Givens said you run into an  and that's the thing it's totally subjective. But it also confronts reality because you have to practice it and then what does it get you. That's the question what does it get you and it's like oh yeah. You could be a piece of  and acquire all this money and wealth oh yeah okay but you're still at base miserable. You pleasures are fleeting and very few. People can even and you're hoarding of pleasure means that others can't even are other people are denied basic pleasures like the ones that all humans require not not that baroque disgusting ones that our machinery of exploitation offer up to us in lieu of freedom.

The cat is being locked in here with me because she's causing too much shenanigans in the other room. There's nothing I can do there's I'm sorry all right. I'm gonna try to get the cat over here. So you should stop being so sad yeah. See I wanted to be. I wanted to pet the cat but the thing is I have I have I've taught the cat to treat me poorly by scorning him by by not being there in a moment and like acknowledging his needs and now he doesn't trust me and nor should he that's Karma. That's literally what karma is good or bad. So now he won't come over here maybe over time if I behave differently now he will come over to me. But I have to earn it and he has to respond to my attempts to earn it and some people are compatible that way and some people aren't and there's no judging it. You just have to acknowledge and understand that's what it is. It's all understanding. That is the task of all humans and I don't mean it's what you can't understand like not like like these. These enlightenment says. Oh understand your reason. It's like that is insufficient. We've seen what just a just tempering your blade of Reason gets you. It gets you a planet that is dying. It gets you a population that is miserable and eviscerated and sick and and and unfree everywhere. No clue absolutely howling in the  cages like a bike like experimental rhesus monkeys. That's what that's what pure. But it's like you can't not have it because that's how you bill old capacity to allow material satiation of needs by industry by by technology by the application of human reason to the material world. But by itself it gives you an isle ation. It gives you the Holocaust. Exactly it gives you it gives you nuclear war. It gives you climate change it needs. It needs to be tempered and it's tempered by cooperation like like when I say morality and I say a moral sense when I say my virtues. Those are all produced by my relationship with other people. They're entirely are not within me. None of them are they're entirely outside intellect is interior. You get information from outside you and then your intellect is basically the sum total of your experience of other people's information. But but your morality is entirely the product of your interaction with other people and it's entirely since in--this of other people's treatment of you and your response to that and I don't gonna try to be nice through the cat. The other night she was yowling and instead of getting mad at her. I just said well what do you need. Usually she hasn't food water should I scoop the box and say oh yeah. I scoop the box she went in there and now she's not meowing right. Now she wants to go in the other room sadly so and that's what Ralston Saul talks about with.

Voltaire's bastards is pure rationality instrumentalized as humans to the degree that human civilization is no longer viable because we're not people. Anymore were instruments and that's what we're headed towards doesn't have to be and we're all working on what way and some of us are right and some of us are wrong none of us no. I'm sorry some of us are less wrong than others and if enough of the less wrong are able to cooperate. They can make in the world the proof of their correctness in the world until it becomes. It overtakes the structures that are created by dead mechanistic rationality all right so that felt nice I don't hope. I don't sound completely insane because I don't want to because you know like this kind of as I said like I said I said I know it's right to me and it doesn't matter if it's not right to you well. It does matter if it's not right to you. If what I experience makes me go out and like you know take my dick out on the subway and stab people randomly or you know hit my neighbor or something. Then then that's that's dissociative then. There's a break in me. There is a physical emotional break caused by biology and by the behavior of others in my response to it. That of course we're living in a simulation but it doesn't of course. We're living a simulation. The simulation is is reality. The simulation is our collective material attempt to reconstruct a world as individuals out of the undifferentiated universal consciousness. We emerge from so like it doesn't need like that's. That's that's that's another point of quite like the mechanistic de. It's like the demo years talked about spirit well. We killed God so it's not about there's no Demiurge because you can't convince anyone of that because we killed God so now oh. It's machine. That's the same thing is the same purpose. It's. It's recognizing the same fallen state of consciousness that was required to just live related to what we could be. But now. We give it a mechanical name rather than a spiritual one because we've killed the spirit and replaced it with Pure Reason which is what which is what decadence comes from that's where decadence comes from that's where all this like the trad casts. The trad people aren't right in the sense that the things were using to fill. The gap are alienating and poisoning as are all and pursuits of pleasure.

But they're not they're not inherently evil. They are. They are mechanisms of coping and which we can we can disconnect the machine. The problem is is that we have this machinery that turns all of our worst all the worst elements of society. Marx talked about this about like on the Jewish Question. Like capitalism creates all these dehumanizing conditions between people and then creates a structure that says actually those those those like broken relationships are good actually. It's that's supposed that's supposed to be the way it is and in fact here here are X Y & Z things you can buy or do or or jobs to take or whatever the  places you can be slotted in the honeycomb hierarchy of Industry to to indulge them poor. Little guy I don't know specifically I don't know that I don't know enough about like neuroscience to say where thoughts come from. But I just think the thing that generates thoughts and the thing that generated the universe is a fundamental contradiction and the contradiction is to be a feeling being that perceives itself as feeling. That's where our thoughts come from and that's what separates humanity from all other being of course. All other beings have they're all on the same they're all on levels of the tower. They're all in different areas. They're all different spokes of the wheel. We consider ours higher but that is judgment that's just a judgment. That is that is a Demiurge achill spook. But it's different. It's just different and that means we have we then that person that that blessing gives us the ability to shape this material world in a way that animals that don't have that ability can't and so we have to try to do it that is our mission and we fail that task that a degree to which we put our our our work or our bodies our minds towards the towards satisfying physical indulgence and that doesn't just mean like eating a quarter-pounder or anything it means sqlite. It's just it could mean us. It means simply accumulating surplus value from surplus calories because to have surplus calories means someone is working more than someone else. That's the that's where you get the division of labor. That's where you get the Apple in the garden. Someone has to work more than someone else because if they don't there's no there's no surplus to allow for moment of repose and that is the task of society civilization and the hungry ghosts says no will. I will make it I will turn the world and I will become God and I will I will be the only thing in the universe and the thing is if you are the only thing in the universe.

Then you are damned you are you are Satan. You're at you're actually you're actually Lucifer Morningstar owned. But if we collectively seek to better each other spread material suffering as thinly as possible increase everyone's capacity for play and and and present this and thought and and kindness and and all of those things. Then then we can restructure we can make this world differently. I mean obviously that's not there's. It's not like yeah and in your lifetime. Everyone's gonna try and send to the etheric plane of course not absurd I'm saying in some distant galaxy to thumb thousands of billions of whatever that might be happening here we're gonna fail. We will fail we will. We will fall short of that. It is without question how far short was the only difference between one version of reality and one life and another is how far short we fall and all we can do is push because there's nothing else to do there's nowhere else to go. There is nowhere else to go you can the wicked flail or no none pursue earth. There's nowhere else to go but inside the only way out is through.
