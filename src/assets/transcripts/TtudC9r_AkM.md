All right foreign happy labor day everybody of course. I probably don't have to tell you guys that labor day is fake that it was a psyop assembl essentially and that it was created explicitly to remove the working classes association with mayday which was a day of international working-class solidarity that sprung out of the 1881 haymarket bombing which happened on may 1st and the building on you know. Traditions of european may day rituals and all that and associated with harvest with labor you know with work. It was a little too radical. It was getting people all riled up. They started thinking oh man maybe maybe we can should do something. Together. You know as a working class who labor and so they created labor day a de politicized official carnival of of labor as an abstract concept like with microship where you extol all the things that are true about unalienated labor and apply them to alienated labor which is just the devil's own trickery. You could even say that that's like the root of like cultural superstructure recreating capitalism. You have to have some degree of investment from the people being ruled even if it's coercive.

There has to be an element of of belief if not you know in the virtue and the worthiness of the system. They find themselves under then under a preference for life over death or preference for being free than for being in prison. Like you have to have something like that and one of the chief pillars of that is called mystification is mystifying what life is by emphasizing all that is good and all that is healthy about social existence and applying it intentionally but over time just reproducing by reflex onto the awful system that we actually live under that undercuts and undermines all of that good stuff. It contains that good stuff because it contains everything but it it is not. It doesn't generate those things. Those things are generated by us as people. The system generates all that is awful but we confuse the difference and so mike rowe can go around explaining all the virtues of of of duty and discipline and and so satisfaction that come with a job well done all of which are 100 true but only on the behalf of oneself in concert with others. A collaborative coordinated beneficial relationship that suffuses our life with ease and comfort and a sense of satisfaction because we know that we're building a community of friends a community that is safe and secure because it is consensual but that's not how labor works under capitalism. It is wildly alienated and stripped of all goodness and and that is the source of much social dysfunction but ideology doesn't make a distinction. It just takes the whole of society and and subliminally even if it's critiquing. It reinforces them as things that flow out of what we like to call human nature which is of course more. More propaganda human nature.

I mean there is a human nature. There are fundamental human responses to certain conditions but they are malleable. They come from our encounter with the world. Is we find it as we come into consciousness and how what that is will shape our response to it. There's nothing natural about that other than the fact that it is it appears to us to be in nature but it is not nature. This is an interesting question.

Someone asked they say was was that um that equalization of or that increase in labor share of profit that happened after world war. Ii totally contingent on the devastation of world war of world war ii and it's yes 100 There was enough to go around basically where those in power found it more more of more utility to neutralize the threat of the working class by buying them off to the degree that they could because there was money to buy them off and that's because the us stood alone in the post-war world as the industrial dynamo of the entire non-communist earth and that require and also we were in conflict with another system communism which was a direct threat and you can argue that it wasn't really ideological. It was more just well. There were russians we're americans and it's about who's being in charge who gets the who gets the access to the choices spoils of the imperial world system but either way they were a real danger and the working class were a potential vulnerability if if there was too much self-conscious radicalization among the working class which there was a ton of before world war ii and was terrifying and the more advanced forms of forces of capital divorce the world finance capital the world. The capital that like work had an olympian removed from the economy made a deal because it made sense but that deal started breaking apart first from the political perspective because there was that segment of small producers who made up the backbone of like the emergent conservative movement which in the context of the 50s in the context of the 60s was stupid it was why would you destabilize this deal. We have with labor when there's so much money to go around but that was not a sustainable system because part of fighting the soviets was building up these former enemies of ours who'd been destroyed because if we let them stay wrecked they would be vulnerable to overthrow and consolidation behind the iron curtain. So we had to build back japan. We had to build back germany. We had to circulate the currency and circulating the currency undermined our ability to to maintain profit at the center. Profit was still being made of course but it was no longer being made at the center and to be distributed to workers. It was being internationalized but word labor was not and so when when when the economy was re-established after the turbulence the the the destabilization of the 70s it was reestablished on the neutralization of labor power and the and the the decision was made at the highest levels. Volcker carter the builder.

The carlyle group the business roundtable the chamber of commerce that the problems stagflation were going to be solved by the and the problems of declining profits which were finally biting in would be solved by taking it from the labor share of value and that meant breaking labor as a countervailing force in american politics which is what both parties got together to do and so that raises a question asked by the person in the comments that well does that mean that we can't have another world war. We can't have a restoration of the of that post-war like labor share without some sort of massive. Conflict and the thing is is that if you want to keep the system as it is yeah like there's no more money to go around like the the the bernie kind of pitches. His pitched. His thing and a lot of people believed it on the premise of we're going to go back to the good old days. We're going to have high labor participation high union participation and organization of our working class and we're going to have them be at the table. For these discussions and labor share. Value is going to increase but there's not they can't maintain a system that way. Due to the fact that this thing is all a high house of cards. It's all built on speculative bubbles that require massive amounts of money and specifically loss of amounts of money concentrated at the hands of the very top. It's not a negotiable stance and that's why like and that's why I think the people but a lot of people saw that and said well. The point of this this is stupid jack me off forever and to me to that.

If I say no he might not be right about that the people who believe that might not be right about that but bernie at the point at that point and I still think this is true was the best chance we had to stand up any kind of working-class organization at all. In this country. Any kind of beginning like to brief to reconnect the severed nerve endings of the american like working class so that this crisis could be met when it came and when moments of real potential rupture emerge in the best position to engage them and to make demands instead of being like they were in the 70s. The sacrificial goat and one of the reasons it was allowed to happen is because no one thought it could happen like the people at the top. Like the patco. The air air traffic controllers who he would summarily fire and mask when they went on strike a few years later because they thought carter's up well. Maybe reagan will give us a better deal. Nobody had got the memo that this was all over that both parties were just going to sever the connective tissue. There they were going to cut the spine out of the labor movement so but and and so even if I think that's true. I don't necessarily think that even now post-bernie a political movement has to lead with we are going to have to marshal our forces for an apocalyptic confrontation with capital because as I have said a billion times there aren't enough people who already agree with those premises and you can't you cannot have any faith any confident confidence that you can convince them especially since all the people who think they can convince them are only adept at arguing in this hot hot box of people who have already accepted all of their premises and that they essentially don't have the language to speak to normal people because that harkening back to the new deal era. It is a rhetoric. It has a rhetorical effect and that rhetorical effect especially for older voters.

 is to remind them of a time when things weren't so shitty and and reorient their thought of why that might be oh man jessica krug. I love how there is no chance that this thing is going to lead to any reflection of any of the yahoos involved. In this any of the dummies who are part and parcel of that and essentially like frank abagnale them themselves into into the halls of the academy just knowing the right words and knowing the right way to act and the right way to respond to any challenge and can do whatever they want. There's no concern if anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about there's a woman who is recently outed a self-outed. I don't know why maybe she couldn't handle the pressure anymore or it was going to come out. Eventually where she admitted that she she had risen she'd become an academic of like some sort of race theory from and the whole time presenting as like an a latina an afro latina even though she was very light-skinned very light-skinned and she spoke with some sort of like what she claimed was a a caribbean bronx patois and no one objected. No one challenged her really and she had to out herself and no one is out no one's going to look at this. At all.

No one is going to think maybe. This is stupid. Maybe we have bad maybe our. Maybe standpoint theory has inherent problems with it. Maybe the idea that all you have to do is invoke your identity in order to defeat an argument or neutralize. A concern leads you open to people who can do whatever the. She wants right so she's saying someone challenged her on it but how long did it take how long did it take and there was one person who posted a a screenshot of a of a dm exchange they had with her where she actually did say you know how where so you're black and she goes yeah and she's like ah well in what way. I mean you just presented white and she's like. I don't identify with the colonizers and she just uses a bunch of the buzzwords and the lady kind of goes okay and just sort of keeps going and in the thread she said 

I was suspicious but I didn't want to do respectability politics and for people who don't know what that means there's this like line of argument. That says that anybody who is like in a in a in a oppressed category in america is under no obligation to to There's no under no moral obligation to adhere to any standards of like decorum in argumentation or in scholarship or in politics because they are bad faith attempts to neutralize radicalism and are inherently racist because they're prejudging like what might be like authentic cultural practices and this incident really shows that you can make that argument all day from a moral perspective that I have the moral right to act that way to act the way. I want to to speak my truth and not not worry that the white man is going to concern troll me but once again because these arguments are all one-dimensional.

No one asks a question like well does it make sense for me to do that does it make sense to operate from that principle in in in the terms of negotiating life with other people because remember there's not there's not just a moral dimension to a question because all these people were talking about the need about how bad respectability politics are are doing it in the context of advancing what they say is social justice. They're saying we want social justice and they say by us being active. We will bring it about but if that's the case and if you believe that then you are obligated to not just examine every decision through a moral lens removed from practicality. You also have to ask yourself what is this going to do if I act this way and the answer for this respectability. Politics thing is it disarms everybody. It makes you ultra paranoid about everybody unless they say the right words and in this case you can just be awful and obnoxious to people and they will essentially be disarmed by that partially because they don't want to do respectability politics. But most of all.

I think this is very much part of it. Brian quimby has pointed out that that owning conservatives by saying that you were in the military. I think he said liberals but it's true of conservatives. Too is perfect because they will never doubt you. They will never challenge you because to them that is anathema that is a taboo beyond taboo and so therefore no one could ever even do that if they couldn't think of it no one could think of it. This is one of those lacunae things I'm talking about they cannot conceive of stealing valor. So of course. No one else would at least until they like see evidence of it or like those guys who are like freaks and like obsess about it. They have their own weird thing we're normal people who are like really reverent about about serving either.

If they did or didn't that's an anthem and this is a this is the liberal version of that like lying about your race transgressing against people through like a racial appropriation certainly like taking a spot that might go to a a platform that might go to a minority is absolutely unthinkable and so they can't even imagine someone doing it and that means that you're totally disarmed you can't argue anything because how are you going to know what anybody's intentions are. You. Can't say well you know you go by who they are you could say. I can go by who they are but what if they're lying and and more importantly what if the fact that they are a certain identity doesn't actually mean they know what they're talking about on a given subject because we can it's pretty easy to see that there is no universal standpoint from any one particular like intersection of oppression. If there were there would be no black conservatives right at least according to the thinking of these people like they're talking about like what emergent insights come from being having a particular experience. I mean if if they're not universal then they can't be used as the benchmark.

[18:47](https://youtu.be/TtudC9r_AkM?t=18m47s)

I did have a very nice weekend thank you someone said that asked if I had a nice weekend it was a good one. It's been nice so far kind of taking the day slow after yesterday kind of went hard. It was very nice day ah someone what do. I think of the lodge 49 ending sadly. I don't really think it had one. I mean it was pretty clearly intended to have another at least one more season and I honestly think that it could have really like brought the strands together even just one more so. I really hope it gets another season somewhere. I know at this point. It's a slim read but that last scene of the last episode is so awesome and evocative and it just demands another season but lodge 49.

It's like people's. It's it. I mean people are saying give me the business for talking about a prestige show. But I think part of the big reason that it's not popular was it that it didn't follow a lot of the of the necessary elements of prestige show one of them that I think gets under discussed is how and this is really weird when people want to insist that like television is the new high art. How many of those shows are genre shows essentially are are some sort of of like plot first structure like even the sopranos which of course isn't really a mob thing you know. It's a deconstruction but still has the structure and certainly the like scenes content of a genre production and that's true of like the wire deadwood and breaking bad fargo. Like like the best of this genre is still genre stuff and it's like I'm not disparaging genre chef. I mostly watch it because it's fun and I like it and I have kind of middle brow tastes. I'm not gonna front but what I don't do is. I don't act like this is the ceiling of like art now and the people who assume it is is It's baffling. I mean it's not baffling. I think I understand why you know people have essentially given up on anything better. Because it asks too much of them.

I don't think it's a useless to talk about genre shows because I think the thing about genre programs is that they include certain elements that are designed to indulge the audience and you can say they have other things they do like genre isn't all a good. You know all dumb there's plenty of great genre movies. I love a lot of fantastic genre films and shows some too. But there is still a there's a indulgence at the center of it. That I think adulterates to some degree the artistic intent and once again that doesn't make it bad and it doesn't make me not to be engaged with it. Just means that if you want to actually have like a well-rounded artistic diet and you want to feel like you are you know challenging yourself which is the point of art to some degree. It's not only that but it's partially that then you should really challenge yourself and part of that involves engaging with things that do not indulge you along certain predictable ways and the fact that we've even lost the vocabulary to talk about art that way indicates the way the culture has been deadened and and stupefied by by the overwhelming influence of capital. Someone said that tacking toward critical praise attenuates and two yes it does but look even in that case one of the reasons that genre one of the reasons that prestige shows stopped being even interesting after a very short time is that very quickly. They went from a creator having an idea and then trying to pursue it to a creator having an idea and then tacking off of subconsciously or consciously the response from the media because there was a mutually reinforcing dynamic especially in the early arts in the early internet era between critics validating television as an art form and creators of shows making those programs and that's one of the things that I think is most annoying to me about fargo even though I really like it.

I think the the achilles heel for that show is that I think it is far too conscious of of the critical like consensus around what makes good tv and that means it is good because the guys making it are very and guys and gals making. It are very good at hitting those benchmarks. But they're limited also by those benchmarks which are built around this need to reinforce a consensus around like what makes good tv that is inherently inherently deformed because the the form is inherently deformed or more deformed than other forms and like latch 49 doesn't really have a lot of the stuff that gets bells and whistles going in the critical warehouses. The critical fire houses rather but it's really good. I would say that madmen did not have the traditional genre trappings but I but anytime you're dealing with 

I don't know I i think the way they shot the 60s and like the specific way that that era is just so evocative of like an american. The american renaissance like our greatest moment culturally in terms of like total confidence in in our in our hegemony and and a a futuristic forward-looking approach to all cultural issues which reflected itself in that fantastic aesthetic and madman really really leaned into the aesthetic of the 60s which helped prop up its critical reputation in a way that was not necessarily you know artistic intent but I understand that that was also like part of the part of the artistic intent was to lure people in with that and then reveal the harsh underbelly but at the same time it's like oh really wow you're gonna tell me you're gonna tell me something. David lynch hasn't told me about that. I do love deadwood. I have to say.

I haven't watched it since. I haven't rewatched it since it came once since. I first watched it which is years ago now. But I don't think it's. I don't think I'm worried about it not being as good as I think. It is because I'm pretty sure it's great but I don't know I kind of like having it in my memory. I didn't really like the deadwood movie too much honestly. I understand what he was trying to do. It was it was just sort of it was kind of fitting because that movie is is like the movie is about. The the movie is about these characters dealing with the traumatic after effects of going through the experiences in the first three seasons while also being a meta like grief expression about the show's untimely cancellation like it's about the it's about death. But it's also about the death of deadwood the premature death of deadwood because the plot of it if anyone has seen. It is basically just a compressed version of the third season. The plot points like he even beats up hearst and puts him in the jail again and it's because and they kill charlie utter which is basically a repeat of them killing what's his name jim beaver's character. Farnsworth or farnsworth ellsworth that's it not farnsworth um. But that's because it's like we didn't get a chance to end the show and and what they probably what he had. What milk and those guys had in mind for the fourth or fifth season was probably too ambitious to cram in satisfactorily into a two-hour movie. But what they could do is like have a chance to grieve for what they never got to make and I feel like that's kind of the meta text of the deadwood movie which I get why they made that. And I get why that was a thing that made sense to do with the limitations of just trying to put this capstone at the end of this huge project and considering how many years later it is and how much visibly older.

[28:40](https://youtu.be/TtudC9r_AkM?t=28m40s)

Everyone is which means that all the like the the evocations of death and like grief are even more appointed so it has those resonances that are good but like after all that time. It's a little. It's a little underwhelming. I guess. I haven't seen planet of the humans. People say it's echofash.

I don't really care about those arguments I someone's asking about chinese action movies not really. I did see the wall but the great wall right that was the name of it one with matt damon which I thought was really funny because people got mad at that for cultural appropriation because a white guy was leading the movie even though it was an all ge all chinese production that was like an attempt to make a chinese blockbuster and they wanted a american movie star because people recognize american movie stars no but anyway. I know that doesn't count the one that people keep talking to me. About is wolf warrior 2 because it's so hilariously like an american action. Movie flipped over because the americans are the bad guys and he like owns the out of them But I essentially need to know if there's cgi and I kind of assume there is and if I don't know if I can get over that honestly like I'm trying to get to the point where I don't complain about squibs so much by avoiding seeing them and being upset by them. I do like now how how like they're getting pretty overt with the with the propaganda. The chinese propaganda in in all their stuff. I like that.

I like that we're we're gonna get we're getting real great power rivalry again I mean it's inevitable and I think it undermines a lot of people's under assumptions about like how these countries work thank you yes the death around the corner appearance that was a lot of fun mike is Mike is very sharp. I think I'm going to go on again soon because we didn't get a chance to talk about the master and we want to break that down is china the best at soft power. Now that's still us for now we'll see how long it lasts. But our cultural output is still dwarfs. China's. It's one of those things where we underestimate it because of how powerful it is.

It's when people think about us fighting china in a conventional war. They have a lot of guys but we still have just an absurdly large amount of weaponry. Now of course. It's a lot of it is for show and not meant to work but I mean hell even if you just like dropped pallets of cash on china. It might do some damage but we still have a huge military and we still have more than anything really. Like like. We have a huge military that asserts control over the globe. But what what manufactures consent for american empire way more even than our military presence is our cultural output. In terms of like ratifying you know some sort of consensus but of course it's undergirded by the military but they they're they're reflections of one another and so they're both pretty powerful. And it's both still us but you know it's all about the trend lines. Like all. This stuff with china is about trend lines not the current situation really I think that some of the chinese trolls I've seen have been okay like the troll farms. But I think the saudis are still more entertaining. I know somebody's mad that I said us 

I don't think it's. I get you know you don't want to make it feel. Like this is all consensual but at the same time you know i. I don't want to lose sight of where I am and who I and you know what what I what system. I benefit from yeah somebody says dollars. That's the three things. That's the three legs of american of american hegemony within the global capitalist system because remember it's like it's not a hegemony over like as as a in a in a conventional empire. It's it's it's hegemony of like the geographically centered american political and economic class but incorporating all other regional powers and regional economies. It's it's the circulation of dollars weapons and transformers movies basically and it's funny when you think of how many big american blockbusters are centered around the military and involve military like consul consultation and and the use of actual military equipment like transformers. Movie debuted the f-22 like giving a theoretical place where that weapon that plane might be useful. Hey what if the decepticons show up so that's um you could look at it kind of as like a a catalog like you put out a movie and it sort of also it doubles as a weapons catalog. Hey. This is what we got both as a veiled threat but also as a enticement to buy because we sell a lot of that.

[35:19](https://youtu.be/TtudC9r_AkM?t=35m19s)

Someone's asking about sirhan sirhan and about m.k. Ultra the theory about him. There's not a lot of There's a lot of circumstances. There's it's all very circumstantial much like with manson. But it still raises a lot of eyebrows. One of the big things about sir han was not just that he claimed that he didn't remember the night of the shooting. It's it's the nature of his automatic writing like he didn't write a diary like arthur bremmer or something he just wrote. Rfk must die over and over again which is ah not a usual association with an assassin. They tend to be like baroque in their in their self-justifications and want people to understand them instead of like like. Rfg. Must die is almost more like convincing himself of something and I believe although I haven't read about it in years. This might be like my mind filling in a plank. I believe if someone could correct me if they know. I'm wrong that when he was a view that at one point he was a jockey and at one point he had a concussion or he broke a leg or something falling off of a horse at the paddock and he was treated at a hospital that received nk ultra grants like mcgill. University did um and I don't know. I'm not sure but you add that to like you know the gunpowder residue behind rfk's ear when sarhan was standing in front of him. The fact that more shots were hurt more shots were heard or or bullet holes recovered than are could be found in the chamber of of the ivor. Johnson 22 caliber pistol that saran was firing thane caesar.

 huge tool iron bob mayhew it's like with all the assassination stuff. It raises eyebrows and I kind of just like. I think all that stuff is most pedagogically useful as as narrative sort of betting you know. But it's it's not really good to fixate on it because a lot of it is just a lot of it's just phantoms that can't be grasped and trying to grasp them does. It takes your eye off the ball so you just have to like leave it around as furniture like accent pieces when you're trying to like construct a world. Someone's asking about the mlk assassination see that one to me is the one that I think I intuitively buy the most and it boils down to motive like for me. I'm not fully convinced like mike mike judge and a lot of people are now like building a new consensus on the left that like replaces the old alexander coburn idea.

That jfk couldn't have been assassinated by the deep state because he wasn't a threat to them. He was a cold warrior. Why would they do something so horrifyingly dangerous and well norm. Violating. Norms that benefited them to kill them and people are building a case that no like jfk actually did have a like oliver stone says in jfk have a explicit agenda of stepping down the cold war in a way that would have fatally undermined the military keynesianism that was powering the american economy and of course you know make them vulnerable to communism winning or that it was alan. It was essentially a revenge hit by by alan dulles. The one I found a little underwhelming because I just haven't got convinced myself. That jfk was that guy and I don't know if anybody could honestly the more everything more specific. I can't really because it could fit with all the specific stuff about the assassination how it might not have been the official story that could fit with a bunch of interpretations. Like the ellen dulles did it as a revenge thing which I kind of don't buy because it's like. I mean. It's a little petty. I mean to kill the president. It's a little petty but like you know it was 

It was cubans or it was or was the mafia and the cia basically covered it up to prevent people from finding out that they collaborated with the mafia to try to kill castro or like libra. It was a botched assassination staging to get jfk to recommit which and the thing is that also kind of fits with a lot of the broader arguments about jfk being a threat to national security. The thing is I can't pierce that veil. I can't get through there. Like the motivation question for me is too too central and rfk is similar but there you have like subsidiary things of like well. If any of the r and any of the jfk conspiracy theories are true that involve any kind of deep implication of the government or like the mafia or something not even in doing it on purpose. But in covering it up. Afterwards there would be a huge incentive to prevent the brother of the guy you did that to to be president there's I mean and there is some evidence that. Rfk told people around him that when he he wanted to be president partially because he was going to bust open the books on his brother's assassination and if you have any part in it. Even if it wasn't directed by the state to stop kennedy you have motive but once again it's a high burden.

It's a high hurdle. He's but for me like our mlk. I think one that he was viewed. He absolutely was used as an existential threat by people who mattered like specifically j edgar hoover. One of the most powerful men in america like a guy who could press a button and have a thing done a man who was essentially the deep state personified. He was the physical and human embodiment of the buried infrastructure of of like military or of like domestic coercive mechanisms that undergirded the political class and made him essentially above them because he knew all their dirt and he saw mlk as an existential threat. So there's motive there that I think is sufficient and also if you're the fbi you have very little to fear of anyone finding out about it. You know because all the most of the kennedy assassination conspiracies involve around some subsection of the government planning this thing but but in a way that would maybe have pissed off other parts of the government or parts of the deep power structure that weren't that weren't ready for that violation of norms. Like say the kennedy family who have those one of their family members got killed and they're not going away. They're still a powerful political force. If you kill mlk you have not destabilized anything from the point of view of the unified opinion of the ruling glass. In fact you've stabilized it so the risk of getting caught is essentially nil but you know as with other things the cir the the evidentiary case separate from the motive question is also largely circumstantial and mostly based on incongruities like the fact that james ro ray was spent over a year.

I believe as a fugitive who'd broken out of a prison in missouri with no visible means of support buying insanely expensive telescopes traveling to canada and then most buzzingly after the assassination flying to london on his way to rhodesia to join up with with the with the ian. Smith's white minority government's military there which was a big thing in the 60s was like was like guy like the guys who are now proud boys the real hardcore ones. In the 60s they signed up with the rhodesian army to like go in on the helicopters and perform mozambique drills on black people which is what what they really wanted. To do but there weren't I mean. Some of them did that but like how the hell they get to london this yokel um so that's why but like. I said it's so circumstantial They're certainly not the physical evidence that you see in the rfk case. But I think it's a stronger circumstantial case because I think the motivation thing.

I don't know what to do about the camera man. Why are you looking at me. Anyway look at something else why don't by the way it looks fine. In my camera. It looks absolutely pristine in my camera. I do not know why it goes through smudged so you can explain that to me please can someone with a science degree. Tell me why it looks absolutely clear in the screen that I'm looking at but I'm looking at the sorry. I'm losing my religion. But I'm trying to talk here and the tech stuff always throws me off because it's another thing I've got to worry about. When we do the streams from the office. They will be pristine and you won't be able to complain so 

I wanted to read something from a book. I just started which is which is russell banks's cloud splitter which is an epistolary novel of letters ostensibly from owens brown the last surviving son of john brown from years after harper's ferry recounting the experiences of living with john brown and I just started it and it's very good so far But I wanted to read something from it that hits on one of these set like. I talked about john brown here and how he is like the model of sacrifice out of love of conviction out of belief out of faith and how it's hard for us to look at that and make it coherent because we don't live that way because because we have been materialized we are we are sort of ego bound in a way that makes us unwilling to risk comfort and it's not like. I said it's not our fault. We have to but we have to fight against it and one of the things that flows from like a lot of people will point out to john brown.

Like oh he was a religious fanatic like if he was around now. He'd like be shooting up abortion clinics or he'd be like a mega psycho because he's so pissed about like like pink-haired transgendered people going to the wrong bathroom or something because it's against the bible and I think that that confuses how religion works within someone because the people who are that way the people who are psychotically fixated on like enforcing a a explicitly religious social demand do so out of lack of belief out of lack of faith. They have no belief and that's why they're tempted. That's why they have to seek it out and suppress it not for their children because they're their children you know you should be instilling values and and part of it is because their lives are harder and more alienated and and they have less time for to spend instilling values in their children and that does give them anxiety but a lot of it is they're tempted themselves. I mean we know the porn the the amount of porn consumed in the bible belt utah. For example. I think was one of the highest internet porn consumption in the country but that's that's that speaks to the fact that there is a real temptation and that's because of a lack of of real conviction.

In not the not that god exists. They think god exists but like god is a separate being heaven as a real place their soul as eternal and never to be brought back into communion with god really if so at far far distant future in their so they believe in that but that's just an external mechanism of enforcement of behavior because they don't have their ego is completely fixed on self indulgence and so they want to do all the bad things they want to do. All the bad things and only god in their head will stop them and if culture gets more tempting that will tempt them too. It's the logic of the al-qaeda of the of the like al-qaeda and isis guys like all the belgian gamer kids who went to isis to cut heads off. It wasn't just the the promise of you know slave girls and stuff or go to heaven. It was because they believed in god like as as an architecture of like enforcement of book behavior and they believed in like the the mythology of it and where their soul would end up.

But they did not believe it out of a desire to transcend the self through communion with others because they grew up in alienated and and hedonic easter western europe. And it's like that's why so many of them were like fails and gamers or drug dealers criminals and like why um well why not some of the 911 hijackers went to a strip club like that before they did 9 11. That wasn't that wasn't hypocrisy it didn't mean they didn't believe in their faith as an abstract concept. What it meant was is that they were tempted by all of the west and they wanted. They would rather annihilate themselves with in an act of purity than risk continuing their life and being tempted which is what the west would continue to do and that's because and that's because people want to say that's islam. No that's not islam. That is the fact that we this is the way different cultures and different levels of symbolic like reasoning and symbolic logic and and like axis of like symbolic attachment respond to the the destabilizing and atomizing effects of capitalism as they undermine social connections how do people respond to that and that like you make these people who have in their head an ancient religious tradition that sprang out of originally a desire to dissolve distinctions and re become reunited with all other people and then with god which is all other people in the universe and has over time been replaced by the psychic regime of of coercion.

Because the lives we live have drained that of our of us. It's drained out of us and so we I mean we're fallen. We're that's where that's the actual sin that's the actual fallenness but because we don't even recognize. That's the source of it we decide oh. I just have to not do the bad things and stop the temptation to do the bad things and that will be make me good. No you'll still be separated. You will still go to hell when you die and that you will die in fear because you will die gone mad at the prospect of losing losing attachment to the world attachment to the world that is totally organized around you perceiving yourself as the sole node of consciousness in the universe and that's and john brown was different than so many men of his generation and so many religious men of his generation because I remember there were plenty of pro-slavery christians. I mean the the southern baptist broke away from the methodists because they were being too persnickety about owning people and built a whole new ideology. I mean the dutch reformed church in in south. Africa was like arranged around like reifying hierarchy why because it was a really a project of indulgence. It was a project of extracting surplus. We're going to get the diamonds we're going to get the land but john brown didn't want to do. John. Brown saw the humanity because he felt connected to all humans. He felt the connection to black people the same because it was not obfuscated by by this craving for satisfaction in the material world that comes from ego separation. He didn't have that and so he could see clearly and then act ra act morally which is what we can't do and I'm not saying it's impossible. But it is an individual struggle with within all of us to eventually rediscover the ability to do that But but he was there he was like a ren. He was a he was a rare like the system is not set to predict create people like him certain even by 18 the 1830s but certainly not in america. But the right things pop together. He was in the right places at the right times had the right grooves in his brain to create like to actually see the world as it existed to like to to put on them. He put it out he created his own. They lived glasses and I think this section there's early in the book. Owen brown is describing john brown as a father and reading. It really hit me just how this what he's describing whether it was true or not you know like. I think you know. Obviously. This is a novel but I think that this description comports to how I imagine faith works in one who really believes let me find it.

Here. All right. I'm gonna here. We go following yesterday's letter. I've been recalling this morning those early days in new richmond and the peaceful prior years of my boyhood in hudson both wildernesses of the old western reserve. When we resided there has fraught with difficulty and danger on our first arrival and settlement as was our adirondack mountain farm. Later we lived in our villages then amongst wolves and bears and mountain lions and deep forests that blacked out all light in the lost ravines. We lived close to indians iroquois mostly suspicious and withdrawn and silent who sometimes left their forest enclaves and visited our villages to trade but mainly kept a safe distance from us and there was the occasional fugitive slave coming up from kentucky or the mountains of western virginia by way of the underground railroad run generally by the quakers back then and passing through to canada. A quiet frightened day-long visitor hidden in the attic of our house and spirited on under hay and father's wagon as soon as night fell to the farm of a quaker. Some federal fellow radical abolitionist 30 or 40 miles to the north but recalling those days of long ago after having seen all of the civilized world that an ordinary man needs to see in order to know the true nature of people in society.

I am struck by nothing so much as our sustained virtue and orderliness wherever we lived in those days wherever we set up our house and farm and commence. During doing business with our neighbors. We were like an island and a sieve chicanery godlessness disorder and willful ignorance. For we browns were distinct. We were different for most of us. Those who surrounded us. We were surprised not just by wilderness but by reckless sinners as individuals and as a family. We were sinners too of course like all men and women but ours was the fastidious sin of pride for we were proud of our difference and took pleasure in enumerating the ways in which it got daily manifested. We even prided ourselves on the number of occasions and the ways in which our friends and neighbors were affronted by our virtue and orderliness or found it strange or eccentric and as a result held themselves off from us choosing to view us as did the iroquois from what must have felt them a safe distance our pride that subtlest and most insidious of sins got manifested in a variety of ways but all reports to the contrary. I do not believe that we were arrogant certainly mother and later my stepmother mary and my sister ruth were not arrogant and the younger children were all naturally modest and shy boys and girls alike and were constantly encouraged to remind remain. So when they ventured out into the wider world that home provided and for the most part they did my older brothers and I too strove not to lord it over others. Less fortunate than we less disciplined less inclined to sacrifice their force and time on earth for the greater good. What father called the common wheel and even god father himself was not arrogant although he was indeed commanding and headstrong and made only those demands of us that we made of himself that he made out of himself as well and made no demands on others. But wholly accepted people as he found them to father.

Other people chose to live our way and there were a few here and there who did or they choose. Not to. It was the same to him either way on the other hand. Though there was never a man so detached from the sinner who so loathed sin when it came to the sin of owning slaves which father labeled not sin but evil all his loathing came down at once and in a very personal way. Upon the head of the evil doer he broke no fine distinctions. The man who pleaded for the kindly treatment of the human channel or as it had could occur naturally like a shift in the seasons argued for the gradual elimination of slavery as was just as evil was just as evil as the man who whipped branded raped and slew his slaves and he who did not proudly loudly oppose the extension of slavery into the western territories was as despicable as he who founded escaped slaves all the way to canada and branded them on the spot to punish them and to make pursuit and capture easier next time but with the notable exception of where a man or woman stood on the question of slavery.

When father considered the difference between our way of life and the ways of others. He did not judge them or lorded over them. He did not condemn or set himself off from our neighbors. He merely observed their ways and passed silently by and he knew all the ways of men and women extremely well. He was no knee no bumpkin. My father was not the sort of man who stopped stopped up his ears at the sound of foul language or shut his eyes to the lasciviousness and sensuality that passed daily before him. He never warned another man or woman off from speech or act because he was too delicate of sensibility or too pious or too virtuous to hear of it or went to witness the thing. He knew what went on between men and women between men and men between men and animals even in the small crowded cabins of the settlements and out in the sheds and barns of our neighbors and he knew what was nightly bought and sold on the streets and alleys and in the taverns of the towns and cities. He visited the man had read every word of his bible hundreds of times. Nothing human beings did with or to another or themselves shocked him. Only. Slavery shocked him father was a countryman after all a farmer and stockman much admired by other farmers in stockman.

A working man who could roll up his sleeves and cut timber tan hides or build a stone wall along the side the roughest men in the region and although he was a failure at it he was a businessman too a man who traveled widely to boston and new york and once even to england and to the european continent and stayed in hotels and taverns where prostitutes plied their trade in the lobbies and drinking rooms below and visited men who traveled with in their rooms. Next to his only with a thin partition between father knew the ways of most men and women and he did not loudly condemn them. He merely elected to behave differently to go his own way to keep himself pure and to marry young our virtues as a family were of course guided and enforced by our earliest childhood years well into adult life by father's own example and by his steadfast instruction. Although when he did become adults after about six age of 16 or so his manner of dealing with our lapses changed and that he no longer chastised us or enforced his will and the wisdom of his ways with the rod and belt or punished us for our disobedience. Instead he merely withdrew from the offender. The shining light of his trust and no punishment was so powerful and corrective as that he did not require that we share him with him. His deep unquestioning christian faith as long as our every act was a reflection of our belief in the rightness of the golden rule and our love of the truth.

If you cannot be a believing christian but will nonetheless do unto others as you would have them do unto you and if you will obey the first commandment of jesus christ and only substitute the word trust truth for god that I swear that I shall not disown you. That was his pledge to us and it is only that purity of intent and confidence i.e. Faith real faith in the interconnectivity of all not in some. About about lakes of fire and streets of gold. The inner connectivity. The the the inherent connection of all humans only if you start from that premise will you be secure in your beliefs. Otherwise you will have to always strike down temptation where you see it and you will be pulled off the beam of reality and pulled towards reactionary attitudes. Because there were a lot of christians who sought themselves as godly as don brown at that time and who believed in god as and spent all their time complaining about like the demon corn liquor and you know women showing their ankles like boston. Corbett cutting his balls off because he got talked to by a prostitute in new york. He wasn't doing that because he could see in front of him he wasn't trying to ward off doubt all right guys.
