It up doing podcast broadcasting broadcasting time to broadcast broadcasting on the internet can you believe it the modern age we live in allowing people to broadcast from their own telephones. These things used to just be calling for calling people call up your aunt gertie and ask how she's doing call up the pizza man and see what's shaking. This is the first time we've never been able to talk to people on the internet. I'm sorry telephone this is the first time telephones have been used to broadcast on the internet welcome to the future. You've always dreamed of there. I am I'm on the computer and the phone. At the same time you know what it kind of makes up for everything else the whole dizzying collapse situation. The uh the epochal climate disasters and such. I am on my computer and my phone at the same time. If I could put this. On a chromecast onto a television I will have completed the trifecta. I will have hit for the cycle as it were. I'm not getting any comments yet am. I actually broadcasting. There you are there are the comments ah yes now. I know I am being viewed. Hello everyone. It's very muggy. Here. It's gonna rain. It's gonna rain tonight and I think cool things off which will be nice and then it's just going to rain like crazy because of whatever tropical storm is going to show up. So today the president did the thing that everyone was freaking out about.

He suggested hey maybe we delay the election. What do you think until we can figure it out. Everyone freaked out people. First you had the wave of of institutionally invested liberals saying don't worry that's unconstitutional. Then you had the traumatized populist screaming back when does that stopped him before. But I've got to say right now. I'm putting my money and as I said as I must always stipulate. I don't know what the hell is happening yeah. None of us do we're only guessing. We're blindly flailing in the dark. So we can only project forward our understanding very very close to the front of us so anything beyond a few feet is is missed. Shadows had missed but my guess. There is he's setting up an alibi for losing way to whine about it because as people pointed out yeah if he wants to not have an election he could do that. I guess he could say that he could order that to be done and maybe barbara and the justice department say like pompeo suggested yeah okay. That's fine but the election isn't um carried out by the um. Elections aren't carried out by the united states government it should be but it's not they're carried out by the states so unless he's going to send the national like military units to occupy democratic states to force them not to vote that doesn't work if they have an election and he's like claiming uh uh. He's throwing a flag on it and saying none of this counts because uh you're doing mail order ballots and we need to delay it that would could be affirmed in court and it could be affirmed by as people have pointed out. You know the states that biden wins that have republican legislatures could hypothetically give those electoral votes to trump even if he didn't win them and none of that is technically impossible. I guess. But I don't see him having the buy in with any of these institutions necessary to have them help him do that I mean a good example.

I would say is matt bevitt. Matt. Bevin is the recently ousted governor of kentucky had one term. He basically promised to undo obamacare in kentucky. A state that has more poor people in it per capita than almost any state we have uh and he did that he  uh. But he also governed as just a a trump-like contradiction heightener he governed. He covered his corporate agenda with constant antagonistic culture war uh and the thing is and so then he ran against the sun of the last governor. Uh stephen brashear uh and brashear won but bevin tried to challenge the results. Bevin tried to say that he wasn't going to recognize the votes and he could have and he was. Gonna make a demand for a recount even though he was outside the margin of error for one at which point all bets are kind of off and this is a situation where technically this could have worked. Even if it was destroying norms it could have happened because kentucky has a democratic or a kentucky. Kentucky has a republican-controlled legislature or did at that time. I don't know what it is now and so they could have voted to yes endorse bevin's call for a recount against even the roles and they didn't do it because they didn't like him either. He had no investment with the state gop because he had governed like a one-man wrecking crew bent on his own self-aggrandizement and so when he lost that was a gift for the republicans in the house and senate there who didn't have to deal with him anymore and I am saying that if the chips actually fall for a for a trump-esque coup attempt where he has to press the button. That says all of this. This hypothetical loyalty that is now trickled out through the entirety of the republican party. Apparatus must now all be brought into action on my behalf right now.

I don't think that that was what would happen. I think he might press the button but then it would not activate anybody because they would want to get rid of him too. They want to get rid of him  and even if they don't. I don't think the true believers are in enough sufficient positions of of of um. Leverageable influence in the requisite array of institutions state federal judicial legislative military law enforcement that would have to come together behind that just don't see it now. On the other hand he thinks he's going to lose. He wants to have a way to lose in his mind without having lost and that is to call the whole thing rigged and then walk away now that's going to get people killed. I think I think you're going to see more than a few q people get pushed off the edge by that uh and yeah there'll be some. Some mass shootings maybe or temps.

I mean the key the the q score so far is very low. The lethality of q is very low even the most damaged q people seem to be too damaged to successfully kill. Many people you got that guy who uh who just posted up in a van across the uh across the hoover dam holding up a sign demanding that like some inter attorney general's report be uh declassified like trump trump's got this whole master plan for q and he's going to drop the thing on his say-so but no he's going to listen to this idiot who  waved a sign in the front of the hoover dam. Instead that undermines like that that act means you don't even understand your own theory. It's trust the plan they know best and you're going to push their  tell me when I'm supposed to release the attorney general's plan or arrest. The pedophiles no man shall know the hour of the day and there was that guy who went to comet ping pong and just like shot. One hole threw uh through a wall and then left. Apparently there was a cue guy in sweden who chopped his girlfriend's head off and there been there was like a cute guy who killed his father with a katana that's gonna happen. But that's what it's gonna be because since when to anybody but trump and his supporters not people in power.

Not not military leaders not people in congress. Most people in congress except for the real shiny eye true believers even in the judiciary none of these people. They don't view the the the ascension of a regular democratic uh administration as apocalyptic because for the most part they have not entirely ingested the kool-aid now when they do then. All this is over once that happens once the republican party is completely on the same page and has fully metabolized the notion of the democrats as existential threats in themselves on par with like the communist party in the 40s. Then all bets are off. I don't think we're there yet but of course let me stipulate. I didn't think we were I thought that trump made sense and that trump trump-ass figure was inevitable. But I thought we weren't there yet but once again. I think the difference is we're talking about an electorate one hand which basically went to trump not because of of overwhelming you know uh being taken with his message mostly by disaffection and people checking out and uh this would be the decisions of people at the highest levels of it of uh of all the sinews of our of our state uh and they I don't think they yet see it that way. I think they still are like we can do business with them.


Joe biden. I know that guy we made money during obama. Everybody made out everybody got to do whatever they want to do the army guys got to kick up sand and and the cia guys got to have fun adventures in ukraine and uh and syria and libya and. Uh the cocaine flow continued the uh the child. The the the child wrangling and uh and trafficking networks hummed along the the the symphony of commerce was uninterrupted and biden is explicitly telling them more the same their. Uh party met explicitly to to denounce in in no uncertain terms.

The insurgent left on that is part of their broad electoral coalition and they have every ability to do that because that insurgent left has no institutional ability to provide leverage against the democratic party in any way not yet anyway. This is not a situation where people are going to risk it all for a man who most people who know him know is not in any way stable or more importantly loyal or competent or any of the things you would want and somebody that you're gonna go. Cross the rubicon for I think the reason people are are more credulous of this and they probably should be is because they are imbibing all of these cultural products and all of this output social media output by his voters and although the process of the voters views slowly assimilating through capillary action up into the upper reaches of the party which has definitely happened. It's not a complete process. I don't think we have enough proof of that but again that's in that's in august all right that's in late june in november who the  knows what the brown conditions will be who knows how the economy in covid uh and the protest movements and the escalation with between police and uh protesters and good old-fashioned uh good old-fashioned race conflict. I mean there's there's a number of groups out there who are angling to to provo provoke a shooting war uh a a helter-skelter-esque conflagration and uh you know. I don't think that's likely but there's there's tinder and as a result. That's why I can't say with any kind of certainty. What I think is going to happen. But I'd say right now right.

Now trump is tweeting that not as a not as a uh. I don't even understand what the idea is. If he wants to do that he should just do it. I guess no what do they call it uh yeah pesting the water. He's testing the water for this maybe but when is he ever I mean does that really describe his communication style gently testing the water for certain ideas or does he reflexively just tweet about what he sees. He watched a guy on stuart varney show on fox news. A fox business some  uh republican pizzeria owner in long island. He sees him going like trump's doing a great job and he goes uh go get the pizza. It's wonderful. That's as much thought as he puts into this. And so why is he saying that because he wants an excuse maybe in a few months he'll look around and be like holy crap maybe. I can hold on to this thing but right now. I think he looks around and he sees not good and the thing is he might be wrong.

Maybe trump wins you know polling obviously 2016 and really put the stake in the heart of any kind of confidence you can have in poland but for me it boils down to this. It's often been said that every election involving an incumbent president ends up boiling down to one question that every voter subconsciously consciously asks themselves and that is are you better off now than you were four years ago and that traditionally has been what reelects or defeats. An incumbent now take obama for example things were pretty bad in 2012. The unemployment rate was like nine percent. I think uh it was still the recovery was early and rocky but he was elected during a literal economic meltdown. He was elected in in the middle of a slow-motion economic collapse and so people were better off even if things got worse like even if things solidified into something worse. They were solid that's an improvement george w h bush just one of the great.

His just tragic stories beautif the beauty. I think I've talked about this. The beautiful poetry of this guy who mastered the sinews of the american state and party system and and uh its connection to to petroleum. Uh and the world markets the guy. It's like he's basically christopher plummer in syriana. This maestro cia agent republican uh gray eminence. The man who basically forged the alliance between eastern capital and the emerging sun belt west. Uh ran more coke through central america than pablo escobar and the colleague cartel combined uh no literally knew where the bodies were buried maybe up to and including jfk and he got and he's a loser one termer because of a tiny little recession that hit in early to uh. 1992. Just it was barely a big. It wasn't even a big one and it immediately the recovery from it was was galloping. You had the whole clinton boom.


After that he even engineered a war to keep his numbers up if anybody's listened to blowback. The iraq war was a  was a trap laid by the bush administration to give a pretext for a war that they could then prosecute that would boost his poll. Numbers create a new american-led military order to fill the gap created by the collapse of the soviet union and to justify cold war or higher levels of military spending in the face of uh calls. For their cut. They told kohi they told hussein in so many words we don't care if you invade kuwait just like we didn't care and in fact encouraged you to invade iran. So he does it so that we can smash it so that we can squash them like a bug and it worked 80 percent approval rating god emperor.

Bubble money gets to just whoop get him through there in 1996 bridge to the 20th century 21st century and in my memory I cannot think of a president who has gone into reelection where people's answer to that question will be universal more universally no now of course for a lot of people. A disturbingly large number that's not going to matter because they have an internal ideological buffer that turns the awfulness of what around them into more proof of how good he is but that is not enough people to reelect him. I hope people get that I hope people haven't like convinced themselves through just the ubiquity of trump and and his his the solidity of his base that it is a majority in any way. Even among the half of people who vote it is around 40 40 to 42 percent and I would say the vast majority of everyone else is going to answer. No. I'm not better off than. I was four years ago and elections are still one at those margins and so you know assuming that we actually get an election. That is able that assuming the coven situation in november is sufficient to allow for an election that goes off with any kind of legitimacy. That's a big if I think he's going to lose and probably by too big of a margin for him to even to even realistically claim fraud in a way that would get others to rally to his banner.

But like. I said that's right now. But I mean how the hell do you beat that how do you answer that question unless the person is like I've talked about. The the liberal anti-racist idea involves talking to people who have essentially already agreed with your premise. It's the same way with this. The only way to spin the question of how are you better than off now than you were four years ago is to have someone already invested in the idea that well you know. Trump is trying to change everything for the veteran uh the media and the chinese and and all of the democrats and even the republicans they're trying to stop him unless you already believe that there's no way that you can look at his performance and find it salutory to your life salutory whatever oh we'll see we'll see we'll see the fact that he's running against a senile mummy who does not appear to know where he is uh. That's a concern. But I kind of think that I kind of think trump is counter-mobilizing enough to outweigh that.

I don't think because I think a lot of people there's always this. There's the theory of like mobilization that you're you're that um there's something called counter mobilization where you by activating your core. Supporters also activate the court for supporters of your opponent and there was a thinking I think for democrats that assumed that hillary was going to win. In 2016 they believed well yeah okay. We know hillary isn't terribly popular. She stands in for a lot of things. People don't like and that means the republicans even if they don't like trump are going to come out to vote against her. But trump is just as counter-mobilizing for our side people hate him and don't want him to be president and I think one of the big shocks of 2016 is that there was an asymmetrical counter mobilization that hillary got people to the polls to vote against her way. More than trump got people to the polls to vote against him because he was a hypothetical. He was a hypothetical thing to vote against you were voting you didn't want him to be in because he seemed like a bad guy and erratic and racist and all that but you weren't really tacking a agenda to that other than just amorphous badness. If you're a liberal for conservatives. Hillary clinton stood in for a very specific legacy that they abhorred and I think that the thing that's going to work for the democrats advantage. This time is that I think biden is much less counter mobilizing than hillary was and trump now that he's been president for four years and it has gone as badly as the most dire prediction of someone who didn't like him on the day he won how it would have gone that's going to fill in the gap of biden enthusiasm. That's the theory I don't know if it's true. I suspect it might be because people don't hate bite in the way that they hated clinton like his entire. His entire hit on biden.

Is now about competence and brain power and the thing is people. Don't actually care that much about that because they kind of know at a certain level. The president doesn't really run anything. It's a whole  squad. It's a team and then there's the vice president. It's like it doesn't really and it's not like trump is setting the world on fire. The guy spent two months bragging about passing a basic cognitive faculty test essentially bro past. He bragged about like uh passing a concussion protocol that doesn't make the contrast and that was. Hillary's problem is that she could never make the contrast with trump work because everything you could say about. Uh. Trump had a symmetrical thing. You could say about hillary from corruption to sexual assault and harassment. Uh crooked charities uh no account no talent kids uh getting jobs. They don't deserve uncanny not the same thing here what does biden represent mine represents the obama years which where during which nothing like this happened and trump represents this. I think that's I think I think people need to kind of get over this trauma from trump winning where by now they're going to credit him with a power over like the psyche of the american voter that I think is not really accurate but caveat always a caveat.

We'll see because I always get this  wrong anyway just laying out more than anything. I'm just laying out my thought process you can agree or disagree with that more than like the conclusion god. If we don't if we don't get we're not going to get a debate. I'm positive there's going to be no debate certainly not in person which is the only way it really would have been fun like if it's a zoom debate. It's already ruined. That's the best we can hope for like dueling town halls and dueling like enclosed bunkers. It's really depressing. There's no way that dnc allows there to be a hunter don jr. Debate even though yeah. It's the same way like urban cane is like the high that's about as where we're going to top out in terms of evil people biting it from kovad which is still very very very low just and we're not we're not going to get any kind of good debate. It's a bummer real bummer man. Unemployment is not going to be allowed to expire. I mean they might  it up but that's that's like that's how there's a lot of malevolence in the cove at bungling but there's also a lot of just sheer incompetence and lack of institutional capability. There's a chance that congress is too dysfunctional to pass something that everyone knows has to pass that could happen but I mean they make the rules you know deadline shmedline. They can. They can fix that in post that's kind of the whole deal they're right the laws. So. I think that that's this this thing isn't going to collapse because somebody pressed a button that said make it fall apart. You know that's not going to happen no one's going to hit their ass on the self-destruct button. It's gonna be people making decisions that they think are in the best interest of the moment that are cumulatively catastrophic and that was not cumulatively catastrophic that is self-destructive that's detonating a suicide fest in the heart of the american economy. Why would they do it and the answer oh they're they're. They're sick and the cruelty is the point that's the kind of emotionalist.


Honestly that obscures proper analysis and material conditions so yesterday. Somebody was really hollering at me for some reagan land. A reagan land update. I hope they're listening or watching or will at some point because I kind of I spent the weekend. I was off doing stuff. I didn't uh. I didn't really read any but I got back into it 1979 and there's some stuff in here about uh about the neoliberal turn of carter that is uh genuinely uh. I mean the material is obviously very relevant but pearlstein frames it in a very uh insightful way. Uh so basically he's talking about how by 1979 carter's completely convinced that that that inflation which was the number one domestic issue it's hard to imagine but yes inflation because it was very high. It was it was almost double digits which was just wiping out savings uh and freaking people out because at that point people weren't all all debt riddled at that point that was was rare that was to be avoided. It was not just the condition of life not uh the way it is now. Uh so people it just drained away people's savings uh and he points out actually that one of the big things that leads to the credit. The shift to credit is people start wanting to buy expensive things right away rather than save for them because it's impossible to save with inflation too high so charge it and pay a rate of interest that will still be cheaper than waiting too long and seeing the thing get too expensive uh but carter's answer to this was oh inflation is caused by government spending specifically deficits and he pursued that to his his party's essential uh immolation like destroying his own party and then it had the carcass rotted on the street until it got filled in by uh the dlc and uh the same corporate interests who had taken over the who owned the republican party uh and he did that out of miss a a delusional belief in in the the causes of government. Uh the causes of inflation and then what's really most notable even more than that is that so carter says oh look we gotta we have to live within our means. We have to stop the amer we.

I I have to be a politician who for the first time since the world war ii has to tell people to tighten their belts to say that they can't they have to do more with less which is not that goes against 40 years of democratic. But uh politics how am i. I mean that's that's undermines our entire electoral uh raise on debt. There's no other reason what's the point of the democratic party if they're not there to hand out goodies from an ever expanding economy uh and so like his uh his liberal uh policy director in 1979 who said that carter must face the new reality he inherits. He must govern based on facts and situations handed to him. He cannot recreate the 60s when he must conf govern when he must govern with the far different problems of the 70s. An era of constraints they're saying we need to constrain and in that and he never asked the question well. What do you do how does that mean politically and I think that's because he had an assumption buried in his assumptions which was okay this fact. This new america must live within its means reality well because this is objectively true.

The republicans know this too and that means we're both parties are going to have to govern now and campaign with the understanding. That austerity is the new normal but as a republican if I'm ronald reagan and I'm looking to take over the reins of government and recreate it and all that's standing between me and that is this  car what is my incentive to go along with his horseshit about austerity especially when some. Uh some voodoo priests have brought up this beautiful thing. This beautiful uh enchantment called supply-side economics where I can just say no no we cut taxes and that takes care of it. We can still you can still have indulgence at every level you might have to uh borrow some money but it's fine it'll all work out. He's under no requirement to listen to to do what's best for the country. As though that's some sort of objective thing. He can tell people whatever they want to hear which is what he did. He sold him a line that's why this book about the rise of reagan is the invisible bridge. He sold him a  fake bridge built on built on a fantasy that was entirely funded by debt uh and de-industrialization. But that's not what he told people. He didn't say that that's where they were making the he did. There was no informed decision that that was the trade-off people were making it just is what happened because he wanted to win. There's a story about carter getting leaked reagan's debate prep book in 1980 and then giving it back without looking at it part and parcel. There's no re there is nothing making the republicans have the democrats buried assumptions about like the guard rails on responsible behavior in government. That I also wanted to point to one other thing that's very funny he had a.

In late 1978. There was a state state visit by deng xiaoping who was just consolidating his rule in china and starting the process of marketization and I just want to read this quickly uh the state visit proved a tonic for the battered president's soul quote. He's small tough intelligent frank courageous personable self-assured friendly and it's a pleasure to negotiate with him. Carter wrote in his diary something he'd never say of the congressional leadership of his own party and I think that's very fitting because jimmy carter is basically the deng xiaoping of the republic of the democratic party. So no no wonder they really got along I do like though that he lists all this great stuff about how great deng xiaoping is. But the first thing he says is small like he's a like. He's a tumblr guy oh my god dang you're so small you're such a small being ah you're tiny oh look at you decollectivizing agriculture ah small boy uh somebody's asking if I've read behold a pale horse.

Uh the hold of pale horse is the book by milton william cooper that is a conspiracy favorite. It's essentially a unified field theory for all all ufo conspiracies secret societies. It's it's it's got everything. You need uh the soviets and the americans meeting in a submarine under the antarctic. But I haven't read the whole thing because it's not the pros isn't scintillating but I know. I know the main the main arcs of it. There's a conspiracy as a deeply uh stewed conspiracy uh fan i. I'm aware of the arcs. I haven't I'll admit. I generally don't read a lot of the a lot of the classic texts themselves because most of those guys don't really know how to write uh and they love repeating themselves and larding things with purple prose. Just give me. The bullet points that's why I want to throw this out there for anybody who likes conspiracies one of my favorite documents. In conspiracy. Lore is the skeleton key to the gemstone file. It's I this is a thing that I found on web 1.0 when I was in high school. I printed it off and read it in like during lunch and it's this amazing layout of of uh like 20th century history through the lens. It's like a james ellroy history of the 20th century where aristotle onassis is like the kingpin of all world crime. He's like.

Fu manchu uh and he of course assassinates the president kennedy but assassinates a million other people uh in pursuit of uh global uh organized crime racketeering profits and also kidnaps and replaces with a double howard hughes. But the thing I like about it is. It's it's bullet points. It's this date this thing happened like a telex very elroy. Also uh. I read it right around the time. I read american tabloid and man that was peanut butter and jelly uh so love the skeleton key that's a gemstone file but just one more thing about cooper. Uh so yeah the hell depart horse is conspiracy look very a classic seminal conspiracy text. A lot of people have read it uh not terribly rigorous but I thing I think is funny about him. Most of all though is that less than a week. After 9 11 he was confronted by like u.s. Marshals or something over over like his refusal to pay taxes uh and he got in a huge shootout with him on his front porch and he shot one of them in the face. I think and he got lit up and killed that happened less than a week after 9 11. I just imagine somebody who was a big fan of his finding that out and just being like what and then of course hanging with refers to the mark curry sitcom from the 90s hanging with mr cooper. I thought I put how put the guy's full name in there as a classic uh bit of pun pun based synergy which I like to do with the titles for some of these like a little make them up we like to have fun here at the twitch at the twitch stream of chapeau.


Fym. Apparently the chinese have bought 60 000 tons of gold to try to put this to put the yawn on the out there as a world currency. I don't know about it. I mean my guess is. It's a hedge. I think everything's just hedges. I think all these moves. I don't think anybody's plan. I really it feels more and more to me like everyone is just hedging their bets until the jenga tower collapses rather than pursuing any meaningful long-term strategy. I just don't think that there's the stability the resource stability climate stability. Uh geopolitical stability to to lend itself to significant long-scale long long-term planning by anybody so my guess is that they're just covering their asses but uh if they make a move that's going to be that's a hell of an escalation right there. Katie might have to bar the door on that one oh boy what's going on everybody.

I think there's one more thing in here. I wanted to talk about let me see if I can find it oh this. This is it. I remember now so. It's talking about how carter in the second half of his term is trying to figure out a way to package this austerity message first time ever for a democrat to tell people that they're not going to get more more in your paycheck was the democratic message for 40 years. It worked how are they supposed to to do this. The responsible thing we're doing the responsible thing and surely the republicans will follow our lead. It's like not. It's amazing the levels of the self-deception and just downright. Uh failure to recognize reality are stunning first just buying the horseshit about about deficits being the cause of inflation without a thought and then assuming furthermore that the republicans were going to have any good faith incentive to follow through on your responsibility. But anyway so he's got to figure out a way to make austerity compatible with democratic values and so let me just read this thing about uh the it's when they're getting ready to they're.

They're preparing the state of the union address for 1979. Uh preparing for it sorely rattle the speechwriters worried about complaints that carter failed to inspire and had no clear idea of where he is leading the country. They decided it was past time to devise a catchy two-word slogan kennedy's new frontier johnson's great society roosevelt's new deal their dilemma however was simultaneously inspiring clarity and credibly acknowledging the intractably complex interlocking problems the nation faced. It was compounded by the fact that the problems conceivable solutions all lay in the distant future with no political dividends. In the to be harvested for the work required to get. There they decided to try to convince the public that the essence of carter's accomplishments was initiating a process. They tried out phrases like new groundwork and new building blocks. Someone suggested new foundation can't we do better one speechwriter carp. Apparently. Not some form of new foundation appeared in the speech 13 times.

Sounds like a ladies undergarment said one commentator daniel patrick. Moynihan pointed out that the phrase appeared in the first stanza of the communist ansem. The international there's your boy daniel patrick boynihan being a  epic troll as always but that really does grab grasp a fundamental hinge point in democratic politics and that is the moment when the democratic party went from pitching voters on a outcome and started pitching them. On a process. We are not promising anything we don't give anything. The market provides what we do is provide a process that allows the market to provide and that is not what the democrats used to say these they used to say you got social security because president president. Your pay packet's gonna go up every year that was the promise more you more jobs higher wages at those jobs. Not just jobs jobs got detached from wages right around this time and talk about jobs completely detached from wages. Too and carter is when they can't the democrats cannot responsibly make promises and because the party is inherently they're responsible. That's what a democrat is.

They cannot not be responsible. Then all you can do is offer a process. All you can do is offer to be a fair guardian of interests to be a to be a umpire or a a linesman and then you got the republicans. They're not necessarily offering anything material but they offering something something spiritual something visceral which is defending a culture which is defending a a hazily conceived way of life and concept of hierarchy that's gonna be  president and I think that like the fact that liberals love him a while I used to think liberals are are wrong to like uh carter. No no liberals should love. Carter.


Carter is the ideal democratic president because he did the right thing against his political interests and it cost him the white house but not his integrity. There is no more perfect democrat than jimmy carter of course liberals love carter. Carter won that pro that nomination because he was a cipher he he was also uh. He was obama-like in that way he was promising to redeem a nation traumatized by vietnam and watergate because he was a ostentatious born again. Christian yes. They used there used to be democrats. Actual democrats who were like that not just dixiecrats like new south democrats were also evangelical bapti uh uh christians. He was an evangelical christian he had a sterling reputation. He was a son of the soil for god's sake and a nuclear engineer and he also had a top rate pr shop that was as cynical and as manipulative as nixon's advantage 68. The guys from joe mcginnis's uh making of a president and then when he got in there after promising to be all things to all people he ended up being nobody to anybody and for democrats.

His tale is the perfect that's the way all them all democratic uh like in in in the the process-minded democratic uh uh uh morality play that is always in the back of the mind of like the fully conditioned post. Watergate liberals should end in being voted out of office for casting a vote that your constituents don't like so carter's holding the line on the budget holding the line on deficits refusing to try to create a new a new arrangement that maybe I don't know constrain corporate power and profit instead of making uh instead of ending inflation on the backs of a labor share of of the surplus. No he accepted the parameters laid down by the narrow uh bourgeoisie experts. The narrow range of opinions of the bourgeois experts who he surrounded himself with because by that point uh the power of the labor movement was waning over the democratic party and they couldn't get they weren't.

There they weren't in those rooms they weren't there for long enough. They. Weren't persuading they weren't persuading and then they also were not offering enough of a danger to make someone act they couldn't coerce or persuade whereas so that meant that the hegemonic uh neoclassical understanding was accepted as gospel. So he accepts this brainwashing without a thought and then sacrifices his presidency holding to it and that is that's that's that is the passion play.

That's that's the great example of a christ-like figure in politics so yeah love carter. But uh if you're liberal because he is the ideal one of you and think about that think about that like do you want to be able to smugly think that you you ran things with. Uh you ran the country with a sense of honor or is that okay is that enough to make up for the fact that you're a  historical laughingstock yeah. No carter was the first neo-liberal president in that he had internalized neo-liberalism at an ideological level which I don't think any of the other ones had. I mean partially because it wasn't yet fully formed he had he had internalized it. He believed it like his his his diaries we gotta get that budget deficit under control like they believe that. That's the thing there might have been a cat. There was a a budding capital revolt happening under carter's feet. But that's one of those things where these are mutually reinforcing phenomena and like looking at the degree to which capital was able to reassert control over the political process.

In the 70s absent analysis of the carter administration's breakneck run towards neoliberalism is incomplete. I think you can assume that if they had actually fought on firmer terrain and attempted. I don't know to yoke the strength of the still much more powerful than it is now and much more organized american labor movement maybe they could have fought back. He didn't want to though like it was it was not even a question of him uh like bending the knee like the starks. When avon targaryen showed up to avoid the north being burned up by dragon fire they don't they didn't want to fight it. He went in there with we're gonna take I'm gonna discipline. This party there are a bunch of kids running around or they're a bunch of babies big old babies looting the treasury for all their pork barrel and I'm gonna spank their bottoms so yeah like capital would have won probably in the end carter probably would have lost but maybe the terrain is different. Maybe it maybe the party does not become the absolute husk. It is maybe maybe points of resistance change the the shape of our descent and leave us now in a period of critical crisis with a higher capacity than we have to resist it.

That's all you can ever say about any historical counterfactual greater or lesser degrees of coping with the overwhelming and shaping forces of material history. Now the real counterfactuals what if reagan wins in 76 because very could reagan could have beaten uh ford. I mean it came down to the mississippi delegation at the at the uh convention. They were essentially tied at delegates going into uh last time. That's happened uh going into kansas city in 76 reagan. I think won more votes in primaries than ford did or if he didn't. It was close ford if reagan had been the nominee he could have beaten he might have beaten carter uh and then he would have presided over. He would have had to have given a republican gloss to austerity unless he decided to just ignore it and spend like crazy anyway because he didn't really believe any of that. See there you go that's why these things are difficult. I don't know and really you really need the perfect storm of of of these self uh self policing process dorks taking over at that exact moment but reagan absolutely still would have broken labor uh no question about that. But the thing is he did that in the 80s and it didn't matter yeah you know what that's it somebody was.


We were somebody was asking me about the difference between the analog and the digital high and I was trying to talk about how you know digital high is sort of a simulacrum. It's it's it's a ones and zeros version of getting high and somebody says it's shorter lived and that is it yeah. It's uh. It just doesn't last. It doesn't have any kind of resonance uh uh leonardo dicaprio is playing grant. I the thing is I like leo. I thought he was fantastic and once upon a time in hollywood uh and his performance in wolf of wall street is an all-timer he got  ripped off. I didn't like the revenant and he wasn't good in it. But I consider that compensation for getting ripped off for not winning wolf of wall street. His just just just him winding up the the floor the boiler room floor. Those scenes are phenomenal but I don't know if I buy the thing about grant is that grant was and this is the problem with making the grant. The focus of a movie is that grant was a guy who faded into the background. He was not a prominent personality he was and especially contrasting in an era of just peacock. Like george mcclellan with his little napoleon with his fuss old fussing feathers is what they called uh winfield scott or because of the ornateness of his uniform and his penchant for pageantry. Uh grant no just blood spattered boots in a private uniform very soft-spoken rare rare to get angry uh his whole like anything that's charismatic and interesting about him is about like just being a a cool and calm presence and I think that could work in battle scenes especially like shiloh's a great example yep. Uh he gets he gets buffaloed and uh absolutely absolutely just shocked by a surprise confederate attack that almost drives him into the  river uh and that night he's at the camp where everybody's frantically trying to you know dig in and worried about it.

Something worried about the next day. Nobody knows what's going on and sherman comes up to grant and goes well. We've had the devil's own day and grant goes yeah looking tomorrow though and then they did. They kicked their ass uh so that could be work but like. I just don't see leo as that guy leo is the cauldron. Leo's the simmering pot the vein he's like when I think of some actors have like a some physical feature. That is where they're acting sort of concentrates and for me uh with leo. It's that line in the middle of his forehead. It's just this like center. It's like a seam. It's like a tectonic plate contact point where all this lava comes out that's not grant and also grant didn't really have a have a lot of like dramatic moments. I mean uh. Chattanooga is very very dramatic but he just watched that I mean he was a general. I don't know. I don't know. I think grant would be more interesting in in a movie about the presidency than about uh about the war. Brolin could maybe work. Brolin has that like quiet reserve thing.

I actually thought jared harris kind of got it. Some people don't like him in lincoln but I thought I mean you know because he's not a guy who does a great american accent. But I just thought that his sort of quiet uh centeredness was appropriate. But I mean I'll watch it. There's no question about that if we still got tv if we still got movies and we still have uh programming. I will watch it now grant. The clan would be interesting my favorite movie about the civil war will always be glory because I saw it when I was a kid and the ending hit me so profoundly and emotionally that it basically made me single-handedly into a civil war nerd so uh so yeah nothing's gonna beat that one sherman would make a better movie. The march to the sea is genuinely apocalyptic and that that really depicted on screen would be would be amazing and sherman is much more of a character than grant was because uh because grant you know he was like a melancholy alcoholic and a quiet one at that whereas uh. I would say that I think they've like remotely got diagnosed sherman with like manic depression or bipolarity or something. He famously said of grant. I stood by uh. He stood me up. He stood by me when I was crazy and I stood by him when he was drunk. He's got the red hair too oh yeah. Sherman movie would rip yeah. Sherman was a big neurotic and that's another classic sherman quote is he says like I'm smarter than grant.

I'm more tactically and strategically uh adept than him. I've more read more on on military theory. But there's one thing that he has me beat on every day and that is that I cannot he said he does not care what the enemy is doing. He fully focuses on his disposition whereas I cannot think of anything else than where the enemy is and it undoes me and that's what undid a lot of uh union generals uh uh. Mcclellan more than anybody and the contrast between mcclellan and grant is so poignant because mcclellan was the boy genius. He was already called they were calling him the little napoleon before the war started. He thought of himself as like one of the great american military officers before he lost his first battle which is one of the big things that contributed to him as well as his sympathies for the south and slavery uh because he was a  copperhead basically my god terrible terrible terrible disastrous choice but um but anyway had to happen you know losses into lessons. One of the big reasons he wouldn't fight is because he didn't want to lose. He won't want to destroy his impression of himself and the world's impression of him so he just drilled and drilled and drilled and organized the army. Everybody talks about what a great organizer logistics guy he was like yeah that's all he did no. I hope he would be  good at it and then when he fought he fought poorly.

He won every battle in the seven days but he retreated after each one because he thought he was about to be overwhelmed. He of course he got lee's orders to his. Courier dropped him and rolled up in some cigars and he still nearly he still thought he still was only able to get a draw at antietam god imagine if grant had gotten these  orders like a wrecking ball and one of the big reasons he lost it. He didn't was unable to overwhelm an antietam. It's because he wouldn't commit his whole force at once because he didn't want to get beat. Grant was a  loser drummed out of the army for alcoholism only when the army in the first place is because he didn't really have anything else to do failed businessman uh kind of in-laws ashamed of him wishing that their daughter had made a better choice uh so he didn't give a. He was he was. He was able to concentrate on what was actually in front of him instead of fighting castles fighting armies in the sky like mcclellan and so he loses the first light shiloh and he's like okay we'll win tomorrow. I mean my god I i if shiloh had happened to mcclellan. I just imagined him like falling on his sword like a roman consul yeah. Grant couldn't even farm for christ's sake in the rich soils of the midwest which is literally. That's why people live. There is because you can farm there ah yeah. No he is grant is the promise grant is the problem is that wig is that wig jeffersonian to wig like yeoman farmer like citizens just the idea of like a whole citizen you know created in the frontier experience.

But of course there is no such thing as a whole citizen and he had his uh. He had his problems and his lacks and his lacunae as we all do and it helped undermine him. Although. I don't really blame him for like it's not his fault that reconstruction ended uh. He he he pursued it with real vigor um. It's just that if if we were gonna if we were going to hyper exploit the south after the war which is what everyone wanted to do everyone was waiting to just carve up that land. Uh then there was no way to build the sort of multi-racial democratic society that would have well basically the way we could have made. Reconstruction. Work is if we had made the agricultural south into the agricultural north as in people by this kind of small holding farmers like the grant family create more grants out of the out of the ex slaves and the and the ex. Uh confederate small holders by breaking up the but the thing is is that that cotton man that was the engine of the america. One of the engines of the american economy replace replacing that with small holding tenant small holding land uh uh yeoman producing like surpluses that they sell on the market for like goods like the at the craft level you've just pulled the engine out of your economic dynamo so the question is was. There was there a hypothetical combination of elements existing in america after the civil war to do that to do a smallholders. Yeoman reconstruction wipe out the panda clanter planter class. I'll be. I'll be nice and say you don't even have to execute all of them. Although I wouldn't shed a tier if they had but dispossess them entirely no land anybody. All plantations not sold to  speculators all of them broken into lots and distributed to all races 40 acres and a mule you would have had to add some sort of economic alternative to uh. Uh the the um to the cotton economy of the south.


So it's an economic question. It's an economic question and the problem is is that the same war that ended slavery. Fittingly. The fighting of it created a capital concentration in the north that became overweening and soon enough essentially captured the entire uh infrastructure of government which led of course to the monstrosity of the of the gilded age and the robber baron rule and that's why there is a like a revisionist left take on the civil war. That says the north was the bad guys because they ended up doing the dirty work of finance capital to fully proletarianize like the south and like that's true in that it's describing what happened. But it's the normative argument is absurd because nobody knew that that's what was happening and it didn't have to happen just that's how the intersection of material reality and hampton stance the arising stochastic chaos of the human natural order shaped us towards that and the counterfactual question is like would. Lincoln's surviving have been enough uh. I don't think by itself but my god it would have helped oh jesus that's. I am.

I'm fairly agnostic on the question of jfk living making things much better because honestly his assassination. I'm agnostic on whether he would have really ended vietnam. But it's pretty clear that he was completely. On civil rights. He was in a log jam and his death cleared so what happens with civil rights. If there's no like sacrifice of kennedy to break break up the the senate log jam there like how much does that exacerbate domestic uh racial conflict. There's all these questions you gotta ask so. I'm like jf jet with everything with jfk who killed him whether he was good or bad. I'm agnostic lincoln. I really think almost we would have been slightly to perhaps butterfly effects working in the right way vastly better off if lincoln had lived. But I don't think it would have been enough by itself but it could have been a precondition for other things. I don't know.

I also like to imagine garibaldi getting that commission to be the commander of the union army because of course. Garibaldi's condition of uh to take off power was you got to make freeing the slaves the point of the war and uh because he would have commit he would have waged a guerrilla war is that he was a guerrilla fighter uh and that meant he would have when he captured uh territory. In the south. He not only would have freed slaves the way that fremont did and uh and benjamin butler contraband uh without and that was controversial because it was not without with. It was without the orders of the uh of washington but he would have armed immediately created a created a literal insurgent rolling insurgent army uh which would have changed the the players uh in the post-war political discussion changed the terms of the debate and the and the and the conditions of the parties going through the uh the political process immensely but one of those tragedies of history is that even though I think that that would have been acceptable at the end of the war among most northerners. I mean we are the the union finally did arm black soldiers uh glory is about that uh and that they they fitted up. Some you know contraband units but that was after years of bloodshed and after slavery had risen in centrality to war aims in the early war. When everyone really wanted us like keep it narrow and about a slavery at least at the top. I mean partially to ally racial anxiety but also to keep the border states from seceding. I don't know I've thought about this stuff a lot as you can imagine when I wasn't going on dates in high school yeah.

That's so annoying about all the  italiano guys has no one offered to just do like switch it with garibaldi. I mean for one thing columbus is not italian. He was genoese. Italy was not in any sense a unified country or concept. He was a genuine garibaldi literally made italy into a thing. Garibaldi is the reason you can even call yourself italian and not calabrese or something or napolitano you dumb. I'm trying not to use any anti-italian slurs here but it's just very frustrating. I saw a uh a billboard. It's apparently in connecticut and it was paid for by some local italians and it says the first italian american christopher. Columbus welcomes you to connecticut and I thought that was pretty funny because for one thing he's dead. I don't think he's he's welcoming me anywhere. Secondly we can argue about whether he's italian because you could say oh yes there might not have been an italian state but there was an italian language even though italian is notoriously dialec like uh dialect heavy and and uh relatively uh unintelligible across relatively small distances traditionally. But even if you want to call him italian. He 100 was not american by the way these people talk about america because when people say like I'm italian american they don't mean in that like you know uh globalists like well. The united states is not the only country in the americas anyone in north and south. America is technically an american. I'm going to call them a uscn because they're not american. Now of course. These guys don't go for that  guarantee you. The guys who put up that sign do not think that anybody from hispaniola or south america is an american. I'm guaran goddamn to you.

They do not all right. This has been fun. It was a good one. I've had good time. I hope you have too keep tuning in bye-bye oh. I think I might start reading.
