Buster screams ah hello. Hello Webber dots welcome to the web's own. Hi. Everybody bonfire welcome to another journey on the SS Kush into the depths of consciousness. No I'm kidding so just so everyone knows I have not obviously I'm still vibrating at a very high frequency I have been for a while now and I plan on just pursuing this as far as it'll go. I'm very excited. I honestly feel at peace in a way I never have felt in my life. I genuinely do feel centered goodness that has escaped me my entire existence and I'm going to try to keep moving towards it moving towards this light. But I'm also going to try to keep you guys from writing me off as a lunatic.

So I'm going to try to keep I'm going to kind of reduce my volume my complexity of metaphor. A little bit to talk more like I was on subjects. I was talking about before my little incidents but in a way that will hopefully be clearer because it will be informed by this greater understanding. But before I do that I kind of want to make one last gasp of explaining a concept that is a little more abstract but that I think could really help people if I could get it across and it's related to something. I said on the last stream. The stream I made about Nathan Robinson and about the reality about about Marxism and things like that and about like you know the value of things like historical materialism and dialectic materialism. And I also spoke about how Twitter cannot allow real dialog and I I think I made a good. I think I made a decent case for that but I wanted to do one concrete example of this dynamic because I think I have it closed. I think I have it sketched out clearly enough that it can make sense. I think to anybody. So I'm gonna see if I can make this make sense. No I messed it up already damn never mind.

Let me see what you guys are talking about. I might not be able to make this make sense why you guys keep. I'm guess. I'm just curious how do you know. I haven't been washing the tracksuit. I'm just curious how you know it's not clean. I mean I haven't been washing it but part mostly. That's because we haven't had a good washing machine situation here which will be changing now. So I will wash it. I'm just curious why you assume it hasn't been washed the Michigan State House has been seized by gunmen is that true or is that just someone being very hysterical about like a reopen. Michigan rally where some Hillbillies showed up with machine guns or are they actually claimed it.

It's protestors okay. See people need to be more specific in their language or else. Their people don't know how to respond when you say something it. Sounds like a bunch of people are very mad that they can't go to the sizzler anymore I understand because they have defined freedom in such a tawdry way because they have accepted their unfreedom everywhere else they have accepted at a site. A huge psychic cost how unfree they are and compensated for that unfreedom by indulgence indulgence in things like guns indulgences and things like the bloomin onion at Outback Steakhouse and if they can't indulge that all they have is that sense of unfreedom which drives them to basically have a tantrum because they can't resolve their feelings because they haven't confronted just how unfree they are and what they could really do about it because they have they have they are happy for their chains because they think that the economic exploitation that under guards their life and that makes them unhappy is actually necessary so poor guys they're never gonna be happy doing what they're doing. They're just gonna keep grabbing that gun until their fingers turn their knuckles turn white whiter than their pasty faces and then they're gonna have a rage stroke on the toilet or something and they're gonna die and their last thoughts will be tormented thoughts about all of the things they feared in life so yeah. I'm trying to draw a little chart here because at some point I honestly want to in to get the help of some sort of animation specialist. Because I feel like the best way that I understand what I think is in symbols. It's in models but there are 3d models and then I try to turn those models into speech and it's okay.

But it's already a translation and it's losing things in translation. It would be closer if it was a if it was a 3d model. But I don't know how to do that kind of thing. I don't know how to do code. So I'm kind of stuck. I'm gonna need like when anything I'm gonna need to reach out to other people people who have those skills and hopefully if I apply myself to explaining things to them long enough. They'll get what I'm saying and be able to express it visually. So I'm not going to be repeating myself with any other stuff. I've said on the show because I feel like that's only gonna make me more confused. I definitely make everyone else more confused. I feel what I'm gonna keep doing is I'm just going to keep applying applying the reasoning to specific questions and then it will be revealed in pieces and then that's the only way we ever understand.

Anything claymation would be cool. I like claymation I have not played disco Elysium. I feel like now. I could now I could do anything I could play ball and cup I could play. Disco Elysium I could play Katamari Damacy. I could even play a violent strategy game or a confusing map game because I wouldn't get frustrated because I would not feel the need to be anywhere else but right there playing the game. So I honestly feel like I could play any game. Now. It's only a question of set of us setting up the the gaming computer at our office which I cannot replicate here because I do not have gaming equipment and I think that the technical obstacle of me trying to learn how to figure out that stuff would overwhelm any value added by convenience it. Basically it would take too long for me to get it. We're pretty close right. Now. Felix is working on it and if we could get it going I'm gonna play any game anyone wants now.

I could play any game I could even trudge around playing playing what's it called fortnight until I get shot 50 times that's fine. There's a parable in that but it could certainly be interesting to ruminate on and I can even play a really big complicated board game. The question is whether it would be too boring to watch me play it. You might not want to watch me play and have a hard time getting the hang of some of these games because I do have intellectual in problems that make it harder for me to game like. I have limitations as a gamer that will make it harder for me to really play in a way that you're gonna want to watch. So that's just a warning you guys. I would love to be a pawn champ someday guys that would be really fun. Universal Universalis seems interesting but once again I would need a wait find a way to do all those very micro decisions quickly and I don't know if that would be fun to watch.

I humor Sark's was able to understand capital because of his own historical perspective. How do we build on what Marx was doing while existing within capital. How do we know when we're making the right moves that's a very good question. The answer is we have to have an accurate reflection of what are basically we have to remove from our thinking all clouded clouding elements all prejudices and our reflexive thinking that make it harder for us to actually figure out what is happening around us to perceive things more clearly and this is me.

This is what mindfulness means in the actual praxis concept if you are observing a reality with clear enough of a head you can figure out. What is the closest thing to the right action in any given moment but you have to have clarity of mind to perceive it and so that means you act on a certain thing. Like we have we have Marxism as a guide. It only guides us so far because Marx died at before he could know certain things we're acting and so in a sense we're all experimenting well when we act things happen as a result of the action. If we are perceiving that response correctly we know if we did the right thing or not and we know how we should adjust it. We can respond to the stimuli positively or negatively if we perceive it accurately if we're not clouded by prejudice if we're not clouded by instantaneous emotional response and the only way to do that is to rigorously apply that logic to your actions and then to the way you process reactions.

It's the only way that you could do it and then you wheat your ideas against the stone of reality. Your spirit is is is is honed by exposure to reality to the material world and the material world is then shaped by your mind. It's a perfect symmetrical relationship so that means you have to operate off of your best good faith understanding of your own urges. If you really want socialism and you feel at your deepest level aligned with that goal. Then whatever you want to do is the right decision and if it isn't to the extent the thing is I should amend that anything you want to do that aligns and a deepest level with your understanding with your will and then you do that it will be correct to the extent that it isn't essentially at some point. It's wrong and you have to figure out where that is and so you have to do it to find out how far the rightness goes because at some point it will be wrong and it will throw off a new thing. That's the dialect and then you keep moving forward that through pressing those relationships and that dynamic once again we're getting too abstract. I feel worried on losing people. But that's the answer to that question is that you X you if you really pleased that you are operating in good faith. Then you're going to be making to some degree the right decision and then it's your job to see the result of that decision and then keep acting based on what you've seen oh boy.

I'm sorry I don't want to freak everybody out. I don't know I'm trying to keep this concrete so people don't tune out so. I'm gonna try to not read like high three questions. I'm trying to get more grounded. I don't want people with butterfly nets showing up okay. This is an entry question after a corona is brought under control will people's awareness of essential work. Last well I mean that's that the answer to that will be to degree to which we resolve. These are core the degree to which our coping mechanisms can hold right so there's psychic coping mechanisms. So there's we brought. If we cut people broadly the two groups of people there's essential workers and non-essential workers right. The essential workers are out there actively work threat risking their lives to keep society functioning the non-essential workers. Her home cooped up and doing their part by denying themselves. Pleasures so both of them are unhappy in some ways with this situation. Some of them are having to do too much some of them can't do enough and of course.

There's a wild asymmetry in their material compensation people doing as such a work. Some of them are compensated very well like doctors. Some are less like nurses and that people like delivery people and factory of meat processing workers and grocery workers are wildly under compensated and over exploited. Some combination of exploited in terms of force to do things and under compensated with money and and so their experience of being of like doing their job is made more miserable by that reality. Their lives are miserable because they are being forced to do what they don't want. What they don't think is safe for not enough compensation but but that's a material condition. That's the way we were raid to give them that's the way we have decided to do. This. We're not drafting people to be essential workers and make and paying them in scrip which we could do. We could do something like that or work with a universal basic income with like a work requirement or like a new WPA. We could do all of that but we choose because we have dominant light.

We have the dominant paradigm of capitalism we choose to use let the market induce and not us collectively will ourselves to make a decision and what the market is going to do is. It's going to exploit and undervalue the labor that is most necessary because it has to maintain power over labor if that labor gains can understanding of its influence guess what that's a class working on its own before itself and that's a class able to act in its own self-interest and that's the exact antithesis of what capitalism wants. So it'll never be allowed to happen. So those workers will remain exploited and underpaid but they still have to work if they want to continue having a society which they do as much as it pains them. So what do they get.

Instead they get our to get our hair weave. They get our thanks they get our claps at seven o'clock. That's what they get. They get the sense of people giving them credit. This is just a new reversion of what we gave to another generation of people who have had the same situation happened which is our troops in the field after seeing what happened in Vietnam with the mass mass movement or with with draft and with everyone facing potential violence and with like the accompanying disgust with the military because we know the military is us and so we feel disgust for our actions and so we have discuss for the military we created as a separate caste so we don't feel those things and so we can't. We have no way of judging and so we instead worship. But it's all because we have offloaded our pain on to them and then we give them our thanks for their service to make up for the gap so to the degree to which they can put up with that to the degree to which the thanks for the service is enough to make up is the degree to which they'll put up with it.

Simultaneously you have the people buttoned up inside if they have a different ache. It's not about threat being threatened with coronavirus and it's not about being underpaid or something and we're being forced to do work that although they don't think is safe. It's about not having any purpose in this literally being honest enchilada. The process of keeping society going being a parasite and there's no way to act to change that in the current system because they can't be drafted into the workforce because we're not doing that because since they don't need you can't go volunteer. At Kroger. You know you could go to a food bank in something that people do that but there cannot be like a social room. You can't. No one is replacing their alienated social work time. At you know whatever fake job they have at home with like a drafted shifted Kroger so they're not part of the cup. They're not part of that collective effort to keep things going so.

What they have is a lack of meaning and the way they fill that gap because they have material comfort and they have things like that is by doing things like clapping the clapping serves two purposes. The clapping fills the gap in esteem Social Credit basically for the workers and the clapping fills the material gap of feeling like you've contributed to society's continuation for the people who are doing the clapping the China thing is a very interesting question. The China question is very interesting one. I've talked to pain about how intertwined the Chinese and American economies are but that does not guarantee. I'm now I now realize I was wrong. It does not guarantee that they won't come into conflict because if they come into a conflict in a different level of material specificity they're deeper ties won't matter. But I would say that there is no long-term goal with most of this I feel like the only people who really want to rearrange our relationship with China.

In the highest echelons of government are people around Trump and they do it because he wants it and he only wants it for fuzzy reasons. He doesn't really understand and even that not really that hard there's a few Krank. There are a few cranks around here. The core of American capital wants good relationship with China but in this short-term right now the continued persistence of the bipartisan political class not just Democrats. But Democrats depends on China being a scapegoat to some extent because the thing is the Democrats. Say Oh Trump is is down. Play is under playing is putting too much on China. He's scapegoating China. It's like yes Trump is scapegoating China but only a little bit more than Democrats are scapegoating China because Democrats at a certain point at a certain point they blend China then at a certain point past that they blame Trump at no point do. They blame the system that produced the outcomes of trumping president and presiding over a destroyed and obliterated health sector that is not able to respond to the crisis. So they will offload onto Trump and offload scapegoat on to China to the extent necessary to protect that understanding. Trump has an interest a short-term political interest that's a little more to the surface and so he needs to blame Trump. He needs to scapegoat China more and take no blame on himself because it's an essential question for his rule for the Democrats. It's a different question and they need to offload it all onto Trump.

But it's the same dynamic they're both protecting at different levels. The the foundational capitalist relationships that created a system that has given us more Cova deaths than the rest of the world what well by huge numbers and and and and no hope of being able to sustain the economic crisis. This has created like this was all capitalism is doing. Trump is the Democrats are escape coating onto Trump to the extent that they can't State go on to China without blaming. Trump not enough like look at their first ad their first ad was about our Trump is too light on China because it's an edifice of distraction from the real cause of capitalism and once you confront that you've undermined the entire structure of the argument. These guys are having and you realize how insufficient it is and you don't care that there's a Cheeto in the White House or the Joe Biden has hair plugs or whatever else weird culture war signifier you've cobbled together to replace meaning and where you don't have understanding. So the thing is is that even though there's deeper bonds between China and the in the United States our leadership could get so bound up in offloading the anger and and and and rage of the population that's gonna accrue because of all the misery unnecessary misery.

The codes gonna cause if they get to a point where it becomes either they offload. They stop offloading on to China or this country changes fundamentally they will go to war with China. They will they will risk war with China to keep that balance. I just don't know where we are on that level. I don't think we're at that level yet. But I think it's a process that can be interrupted at any time but right now. It's a process that unless it's interrupted with is going to lead towards a greater intensification of misery caused by kovin and a greater need by the political class of both parties to offload responsibility on China which creates a feedback loop that leads to short-term conflicts that can only be resolved violently. I eat war there is a dang cheeto a Spectre. There's a cheeto haunting the White House the cheeto of Trump or no there's a specter haunting the White House. The specter of a cheeto can any of this be solved through electoral ISM. Of course to some extent. The question is to what extent that's why electoral ISM. Like all of these is not a binary question. It's how much electoral ISM do you do with it which boils down to which elections do you do.

These things for and those are questions that have to be answered by the specific material conditions of the moment that they're posed. They are not eternal answers. They can only be specific so now that oralism will solve it too. It agreed to be determined by our engagement with it and the world not in our mind right now not by me arguing with you on the frictionless of the internet. I'm trying to find my pen. So I can do this.

This thing I would love to be if Jesse runs and he needs a press secretary. I would god I honestly feel now like honestly real kapparino. Now. I'm gonna be now that I'm in the new mode and I feel like a lot of my. A lot of my burdens are off of me. I will tell the real reason that I did not pursue running for president when we joked about it earlier this year there were things I've clung to like it would probably if they probably would have changed the rules to not allow me which is true. But my basic reason is. I was afraid to go up there and look and look like an idiot. I was afraid to go up there and somehow look bad. It was too high of stakes from my degree of confidence in what I believed and my ability to express what I believe now I would absolutely have done that and if I if I could have gotten even close I would have loved it so if I could get back in the ring now in a position like Secretary of Ventura's press guy where I can get out there just a chance to be heard by a mainstream audience. I would love it yeah. I think we're seeing the degree with with what the what's happening with me too and the what the Democrats are willing to do with it. I think we're seeing that we're willing to go down on the bite and ship regardless of what it means electoral II. They don't they don't have enough confidence in the process to do a switcheroo in a way that would guarantee them continued control so they're just gonna ride this out even if it means they have no chance of winning. I think that's where I am now. I think we're stuck with Biden which means hey fingers crossed we get those debates and they will bring him out well anybody old enough remembers.

In 2004. There was this conspiracy theory among libs that George Bush had some sort of wire during his debate with John Kerry that fed him answers so he didn't sound. Like the idiot we all knew he was and it was all based on weird ripples on the backpack and stuff. Like this weird device that they claimed was. It was a was a recording instrument or a wireless mic. I swear to god Joe Biden would come out there with a big lumpy suit and it would be because they'd have a car battery strapped to him and every time he got asked. The question may be hitting. The frickin red thread just have him jumping but yeah I don't think the. Democrats it's so it was such a close call to get byte and over Bernie and Biden isn't what they wanted. At all. They wanted somebody who was more credible with different demos. He was the last ditch effort. He was the one that they reluctantly had to go around so they're not comfortable enough. I think and nothing has changed in the intervening time on Biden's part to make them confident enough in their control of the process to pull off a switcheroo that would leave them in charge.

So they're gonna stick this out that's my claim this is my claim. I claim of course that yes we will find indeed that they will see that he will be black. He will be back. It will be bi unless he dies unless he actually dies and they can't weekend Bernie sim or do CGI. He will be the nominee which is just amazing amazing wow what we won. That's all I can say the stock market continues to rise because all it's responding to is is the signal from the government that it will continue to intervene on its behalf that's it. They're like oh good. We're gonna keep. They're gonna keep pumping money in because we know that the money goes in the top and that means it's gonna catch pretty much all of it and that means it doesn't matter if the rest of us get soaked because they have gotten all of the all the cash others perish and that means that they could liquify it and turn it into if we do really do like snap the rigging here of our civilization which is not an impossibility that they will be in a position to grasp enough liquid capital that will have value for a very short period of time to position themselves to survive the coming collapse in New Zealand in an underground bunker on the moon and a missile silo in the cloud.

Hi guys all right I have here I have a piece I have a piece of paper I'm trying to work out another graph tomato maybe explain something art is dead man yeah. I guess art is dead to the extent that you are frozen in time and can't like just break out of that. I think I mean art is dead to the degree. There's a crisis of self-confidence among artists the degree to which you can break through your self-awareness. You have to break through self-awareness and you know what I think it is okay. Here's where it is. We say art is dead. I think what's actually happening is that more and more people thanks to the illusionary nature of the Internet. Like we think of ourselves as artists. A lot of us do a lot more people than maybe ever in history think of themselves as artists right now crafts. People posters think they're artists at some level. Everybody who is caught on a like. Twitter or twitch has some as a commentator as a commenter as a reply guy as a podcaster as anything you believe yourself to be an artist but the conditions of producing art are incredibly poor.

All we have is the the the awareness that we want to be and that paralyzes us so people still do art. It's just way more people are aware that they get can do art and just our frozen and can't do it because they can't conceive of it or their art is poisoned by Commerce because they're trying to do it in the in the capitalism or or it's buried by all the other meager attempts. So the same so the same spirits are being called by art. The same attempts to hear the voice of you know eternity are being done by art. It's just more people are trying. More people are aware and so there's more agony associated with war. There's more ox there's more a sense of failure. More people consider themselves failed artists and so the whole concept is tainted. The whole concept is poison to even want to consume and I think if people either to made the choice to stop considering themselves artist and release their need for that to be part of their identity to like oh. It doesn't matter. If I'm an artist or not just the same way it doesn't matter if I could play tennis well or not.

It's just an irrelevant quality in my life. You can either do that or if you think it's relevant to your life really work at it. So that's the challenge everyone should ask themselves is it worth it to you and you really like settle in and like like ask deeply to just and do you really care about this idea or can you find meaning somewhere else or no. This is a key component of my identity I need to work on it one or the other but you should ask yourself the question again as clear ahead as possible try to feel as much as possible and try to answer that question oh man I feel like I could do a Southland Tales episode. Now that would be fantastic. I would love it.

Adham Friedland is a very good painter. I have to say the fact that it's also like a self-conscious copying. It's he basically treats george w bush as if george w bush were a like founder of a artistic school and he paints in the style of him. Like like he was he's Picasso and like he was a cubist and he's doing in cuba speices. He's doing pieces in the style of art of george w bush. It's amazing he's very good alright guys. I'm gonna try to explain one thing it might take a half an hour.

Here I'm very worried about this. I'm very worried about looking bad so you guys need to like alright. I got an idea we need to agree upon basically. A safe word here for you guys a emoticon cuz. I know you guys got these emoticons right the ones of yous who are who are subscribed when I get to a point when I'm saying something and it sounds like it's not really legible or. It's hard to get or that I'm losing specificity of meaning let me know and then I can pull back and either stop for a minute or figure out a more effective way of communicating so what would be a good like bright clear sign to see in the chat that I should I should whatever I'm doing isn't working. What is that green one parody. Pizza maybe pizza because Pizza reminds me of course of the vile pizza gates and its associated crackpot conspiracy that is mostly true alright good. So if you guys put the pizza and load up. It means that I am off the rails so if I see a lot of Pizza. I will know that I should stop alright so last time when we were talking about Nathan Robinson and I talked about how Twitter makes don't start already. Twitter may come on guys give me a give me.

A business does do me the business how inner makes it impossible to communicate because it's anti dialectical. It reifies two distinct arguments instead of bringing them together which is how you get truth and then action and I wanted to give you guys a concrete example of that that will make it even clearer and hopefully will help you in your engagement with the world both real and the world around you and also virtual in your head. So we've got here you can see this. Like yesterday we have the the space-time area we're trying to traverse his people right. This is the world as it is ie the shitty capitalist world. This is the world we embody. This is where our bodies and our minds are up. Here is where we're trying to get that's the my place of spirit. That's the place of minimal physical pain. We're trying to get to the point where we are able to live frictionlessly. We can live without any intervening friction from material reality. That's when we are one with God. That's the same thing as heaven. It's the same thing as Nirvana. It's space-time communion. It's the oneness of the universe. It's every cliche.

There is four four the end state of the human spirit okay whatever that is is defined by your culture. That's what this is. And we are we're trapped in this material realm and we're trying to get to this. We have to traverse through space-time to get there now the other day I I poo pooed full automated luxury communism. I did not mean that I was wrong and how I put that out fully oxygenated. Communism is an inevitable and necessary step to collective enlightenment because you cannot get it to a point where people could focus their minds to achieve oneness without a frictionless physical state which means putting off all human related misery and interaction with materials onto computers. Ie the full subjugation of machines to human spirit that's this and you need that before you can get there but so there will be a period though that's still working its way towards that point. Even after you get fully luxury luxury space communism. I am saying fully luxury automated space automated communism is a stage. It's a stage to spit to oneness. Okay does this make some sense and so that means we're trying to traverse levels here.

And this is where we have the different relationships you got down here. Master slave. From then you've got feudalism. Now where we are is capitalism right here is capitalism. The big seed this guy he's bad. He does bad things and he but he pokey peasant an energy that pulls you away from moving he getting here on the lid on the level. On the on the material level see down here you've got like feudalism and the slave societies and we've moved through them. We're moving through them over time. So here we are work subjects who are stuck here and now we're interacting with communism or with the reality of capitalism. It's making our live shitty in specific ways and then they form relationships of opposition to shittiness that are restrained in those certain ways so stay right. Here. We have a conglomeration of people who collectively share the same point of identification with their misery okay and we can define this grouping whatever it is as let's call. This at the level of abstraction we will call this identity politics so there's the dynami politics well dialectically that is going to create something else that's gonna butt off of it and now in the more specific milieu of the internet. Now you've got another thing stupid paul oops. We've just generated.

A new thesis is generated an antithesis so they have to resolve themselves right dialectically. This ID Paul and stupid Paul have to resolve themselves. Now. They would resolve themselves at the level of action in the real world over time through a dialectical process. It's not a problem. It's done by virtue of the of the friction created by applying the dialect to reality. Here. This is all online. It's frictionless basically so there's no force with any of the argument. It's purely intellectual. It's purely spiritual and so that means that instead of interrogating the material realities that let these things into being you end up interrogating the worst faith version of the other thing. So that is why I D Paul people think that the stupid Paul folks are all Nazis who are secretly want to make everyone racist. No some of them are and they are referring to those people. Most of them are just people responding to the material conditions of being a white male on the Internet X Y Z the same way that the identity politics people emerge from being of different ethnicities different gender combinations on the Internet. At the same time. They're all contextualized by a material reality that you have to address and instead of addressing the material reality. You can dress these versions on either side. You address these versions so for the I D Paul person.

The their subject. Their imagined stupid Paul person is a Nazi and like I said some are but not all and the ones who aren't need to be addressed at the level of their material conditions. Same thing on stupid-stupid Paul people look at the ID Paul people and see these people are liberal climbers who either because they're ideologically confused or because they have their hands out are deforming this socialist movement towards liberalism and they are but not all of them and the ones who art need to have their material conditions addressed and that process of recognizing each other's material conditions moves you towards synthesis but online because there's no movement forward no actual material engagement to make you do that it's pure spiritual argument that you can Europe and in that case you are disciplined by everyone else on your side who has a neoliberal interest in standing out as more on that side than anyone else. So people will pay attention to that alright. I didn't see that many pizzas so I hope that made sense did that make any sense all right. I gotta say I was really worried that once I started drawing a I'm honestly a little more worried doing these than I am like when we do when we would go on tour because I feel like I could fall from a great height at any moment and it's not like I will feel like I'm wrong at that point.

I will just feel like. Maybe I will have lost your. I will have lost your faith and that would have made me sad because I like interacting with you guys and it makes me feel like I'm doing better at living my values by talking to you. So that's why I would be sad because I would miss you because III hope you. I just I just hope. I still have some buy-in with you guys and you don't you don't think I don't completely I'm not completely out to lunch. That's all I want because I want. I want company in this journey because it'll make it easier for all of us and I am NOT going to start a cult. I'm not Jordin Peterson I am NOT oh god. I'm not stefan molyneux but for the love of criminy yeah thank you I'm happy to hear that any of this makes sense to anybody. So if you guys honestly if you guys so I like I said.

Someone asked if I could repeat something. I'm not going to try to repeat specific points. But I think what you can do is if there's something you don't understand about anything I've said if you could grasp the specific thing that you didn't understand and like re capitulated to me ask it to me in a different way so that it's not like asking me to repeat the same symbolic logic step-by-step I I will probably be able to answer it. I mean I will answer to the best of my ability. That's what I will say for sure. But like otherwise yeah if in the moment you don't get it maybe go back and read it they're not all.

This is gonna go on YouTube. What do I think of musk calling California shutdowns fascist well. I mean it's the same thing as always he it is in his close interest. His close term interest to see business big business done and he is one person. He can only die once. It's highly likely unlikely he will be the one to die of this. It's good odds to him to see business open because it will keep his short-term physical body satiated with debauched pleasures.

All right see. This is where I have to some people like a lot of people are asking me lately about books and here's why I have to make another admission. I am not terribly well-read. I like many people have investigated ideas to the extent that I am asked to like think about them and since that extent isn't very deep in most web culture. I have not done a lot of the reading that a lot of people assume I have. But I definitely feel like I could read any of the you know great books of illiterate and have reading them be useful because I will be able to engage with it and produce from the engagement which is really all you need like. When people say can I read a book will it be too boring. It's really a question of will. You find it worthwhile to express the energy necessary to understand it because that's the thing it all is understandable with sufficient energy and concentration placed on the act of understanding it. Some things it's not worth it. It's the thing you have to make choices and I think I would find worth in a lot of things so honestly. At this point I'm asking for book wrecks things that people want to throw at me that I could maybe use to hone because I feel like I don't have enough experience with a lot of these books. I feel like I have an intuitive understanding now of their premises. But I would need to read them to really get it and so I wouldn't want to recommend books. I would want others to recommend books to me. Like the first one I'm gonna try to read Ulysses because that a book that I about was the first book. I thought of that was the first symbol that occurred to me like the first artistic symbol that occurred to me after I had my experience. So I'm still committed to reading that first and I had to finish some research for a project. I was doing I'm doing in inebriated past about Upton Sinclair in the 1934 California Senate race. So once that's done though I'm getting into Ulysses and after that we'll see.

That's why I'll be taking suggestions. All right guys. I'm not okay. I'm gonna be on for about five more minutes. This has been pretty good. I feel like I actually got something across and then I didn't hear Napoleon of the xvi. They're coming to take me away fill the fill the air around me. So that's good I feel like I still have buy-in for most of you so I'll feel good about that maybe paying a few more questions. The really I realize that the key to understanding any piece of literature or history or philosophy is I think we all approach any discrete object seeking our belief intellectually as we have it to make it it has to convince us like we have to look at a book we have to look at an idea. We have to look at a movie or whatever any an expression of culture but in the end then and then an ideology that's coming from that. We look at those things and we look at them to convince us from a state of not believing them to believing them. And I think it's easier if you imagine the fact. The reality just acknowledge the reality that all things are true and false every proposition. Every concept is true or false and false at some time in place and if you say if you think that way what it means is when you approach a book or an idea or a concept you assume that it's right and then you try to convince yourself. It's not so you meet it at the beginning and you and eventually you will fail or you will succeed. But you should start from the premise that it's right yeah.

I just feel this sense like I feel vibrant right. Now I feel like I'm really touching more of the elephant than I ever have before it really just feel like a different. Everything feels different nothing I'm not scared anymore. I realized what fear is now as any jardine is very humorous. At this point I I find bad people funny. That's the only way to do it. You've got because if you can't carry resentment so you have to transfer even evil into a good to you so. It's got to be funny. But it's you still work against it. But she is very. She is wacky that lady man it is amazing I am very interested to see how how feminism responds to the destruction of me to like the absolute death of me too. This is a thing that I don't think anyone can recognize can say no to like I think a lot of the reason that a lot of the high-level media feminists felt of course after Bernie dropped out not before that they could say this sucks this is awful. It's because they realized that there they've lost a powerful tool. They've lost the rhetorical cudgel they've lost a disciplining device. It was more than that to other people but to them. That's what it was and they've lost it now and then and they had to give it up to for the greater good for the in their mind of stopping Sanders.

But it was the trade-off and they have to accept that just like the party apparatus who would love to be in this in a cabinet or you know the chief of staff are. Gonna have to realize that they're probably gonna lose and they're not. Gonna get that but that's the price they pay - they get they they have to pay the price of not getting those jobs but it's - what they're willing to give up rather than roll. The dice like a lot of those people think about this. Everybody it resisted Sanders could have just taken him in. They could have just dropped their swords and said Bernie we love you what would he have done how would he have fought them and then that they gave him the nomination by acclamation. They could have done that it would have been a little hard. They would have had to work against the propaganda. They didn't call cated into their own their own voters but they could have done it the reason they didn't do. That is because they were didn't have the confidence that they would have been able to hold on to power in that arrangement. So Bernie had to be defeated with Bernie defeated they have complete control of the organization so that means that it doesn't matter if they win or lose and if you're part if you're invested if you're a feminist who's invested enough in the Democratic Party if you're welded to it at a deep enough root point. Then you have to go along with that there's nowhere else to go you have been you've been lashed to the whale. I'm sorry. I didn't law of institutions exactly of course.

I've been to the Wisconsin Dells Tommie Bartlet's thrill zone and explored robot world in Exploratorium Wisconsin at the the Noah's Ark. America's largest water park will there be an armed conflict. In the next 20 years. I would say there could be obviously with any possibility. That's all there's always a percentage likelihood. It could happen. I would say that there is a larger than larger than you would I would say more than. I'd say 25% chance and that chance could go up or down depending on what happens in the future and I don't know yet there's still too many fracture points coming a big one's gonna be whether Trump or Bernie went up Biden wins because I gotta say man I've been thinking about. I'm gonna say this on the stream about I gotta go I gotta go in a minute. But I'm gonna say this I'm gonna. I'm gonna elaborate on this a little bit of my Upton Sinclair thing but I've sort of refined my understanding of the diet of the dynamic that led the Republican Party to become reactionary and racist and the Democratic Department Democratic Party to be anti-racist and the question of whether or not the Republican Party can become like a a racist social democracy party or whether the forces are behind. It will allow that I think I know the answer and so something like who's gonna win. The election is gonna determine that so I don't know we'll see we'll see it's worth thinking about. Though all right guys I see a peace and chicken grease.
