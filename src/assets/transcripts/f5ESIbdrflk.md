Uh is is oh classic tune from my uh my fellow wisconsinites. The violent femmes am I supposed to feel sorrow. That's the question goddamn man isn't it something to be alive. At this moment. At a certain point you can talk hell world all you want but man there's something about living now obviously if you don't have the boot of capital directly on your neck. If you're privileged enough to be in that position. There's something vertigonously giddy about this whole thing. They they all got it. They all got it. They all gave it to each other to prove a point to prove a point about how it wasn't a big deal. That's the best part like we've talked about alex. Perrine wrote a great article about how you know the rubes are in charge now and like like there used to be a divide between the hoople heads and and the leadership of the of the republican party. You know there was stuff that you told people but you didn't actually care you know. It was to rile them up and now and more importantly. I think even in that process is just the panopticon of online. Like you cannot be seen in masks you cannot be seen to care. Let look like you actually care about coven because to do so uh is to undermine your argument and then you got the fact that for a lot of these people like it is reality. It is reality like. It's not a big deal. Like these are not just things they tell people to keep the vote heavily up. They really believe it and now they all have it. They all gave it to each other and when did they do it at the  uh on on the supreme court they all ended up giving it to each other oh man.

I don't think any of them are going to die though as funny as it is to imagine especially like the idea of him dying like a week before the election uh I mean people said that about rbg. How funny would it be if she died two months before the election. How funny would it be if trump died of corona a month before the election once again how funny would it be if biden. The sleepwalking geriatric got that nomination over like 20 strivers how funny would it be if trump beat hillary. The funniest answer has been the most predictive one and I think that's not just being facile. It's because what is comedy like comedy is surprise. Comedy is a is is something uh defying expectation and we live in the moment when all expectations are being annihilated by the accelerating crisis and the lack of our political institution and media institution. Uh their fundamental lack of flexibility in dealing with it their incapability of dealing with it which means that what we get is the funniest outcome long live the broomstick. I don't know where the hell those birds are but they're getting really loud. Lately they've not been this loud before is it the time of year do. They know that the super volcano is about to erupt or something is this like the beginning of uh the core when all the birds like geolocators get messed up by the failure of the earth's core to create electromagnetic field and they just start smashing into things. It would be funny if he has to debate biden from a hospital bed. That'd be very humorous like on zoom.

Oh man are you saying the audio's choppy because the thing is I went with the uh plug-in to the computer because people said it actually was better and specifically they said it was louder which I know has been a consistent criticism. Uh so I wanted to do this because i. I think it might work but if it's choppy I'll go back to the I'll go back to the laugh. Mic should you vote for kanye in oklahoma. I mean if you think it'd be funny. I mean why it's not my choice. You're the one doing it. I mean kanye to me is a little played out at this point. I mean I'm not voting for biden but I don't vote for kanye or howie hawkins for that matter. If I'm gonna just do something to amuse myself. It's gonna be to amuse myself. You know and kanye is not music to me. At this point. He's a little played out so uh. I don't know yet.

I might write in bernie just as like a like a bit of sentimentality. I think maybe the funniest thing you could do is vote in write in hillary clinton which I might do that might be the funniest thing you could do is write in hillary clinton. I'm still with her folks. I'll. I will always be with her also yeah voting for everything except president like they did in michigan in the tens of thousands which helped kill hillary's chances of the presidency. That's another that's another strong move uh well. I want to say one thing is that there's already been some argument about like all right say bye say trump dies soon hilarious hilarious and then presumably it would be up to the rnc and who that they would like be the candidate and I think they would probably just pick pence for continuity reasons and the question is like was does that help the republicans or hurt them and I've seen. Some people argue that it helps them because it might get those suburban republicans who hate trump back in the fall. But I think that that number would be dwarfed by the number of trump warriors who would just be be broken by it and would not vote for pence wouldn't vote at all more likely to show up at the polls with like a an ar-15 and get suicide by copt. It would be funny though if the q people insist he's not dead and he becomes like the false dimitri or something just like he's like the occluded motty of american politics and they just keep waiting for trump to come back. I do think that if he dies they should give him a viking funeral in one of the beautiful boats get him out into one of those shitty lakes that all those people like to tool around in on all saturdays have don junior don. Jr tries to do it and he  up like 15 times like edward tully he can't get the thing and then they try eric tries it. He can't do it either and then. Ivanka comes in like the blackfish one shot. Some people say he doesn't he's not sick. I don't believe that because I mean frankly that's that seems like cue stuff to me oh. He's not really he doesn't really have it.

It's all a ruse. Uh it goes against. His narrative is the big thing. I have a problem with that like okay sure what it means he doesn't have to do a debate. Maybe or it gets people to have sympathy for him. But it cuts undercuts the whole argument he's made which is that it isn't a big deal. How is it not a big deal. If the entire white house has it and I guess they're thinking like well. This old  gets it. It doesn't die. Then people will think it isn't a big deal either but I mean at this point. It's so close to the election that his not available that they're going to keep that secret is like thinking that they're executing john legend and chrissy teigen and guantanamo bay and replacing them with clones come on. But the tweets are gonna be great. I can't wait to see the tweets of him quarantine just watching even more tv than he usually does not being able to go to the rallies. Uh the fact that everyone has it though is so funny mike lee's got it which means there's probably a couple. Other senators that have it this could honestly be the one thing that stops them from getting amy. Uh joseph coney on the on the on the supreme court which would be of course hilarious. I mean those senators must be terrified because there's they're old as. Although of course you know rand paul had it earlier in the year and he didn't. He didn't give it to anybody who died virginia foxx that awful gorgon from uh.

I think south carolina. She didn't die either because god delights in human evil and when I say god. I mean of course yellow boweth the  demiurge. He loves them and he's going to keep him alive. He's going to protect his arch gods he'll protect his archops. He's got their back folks.


I had the corona and I'm fine in fact. I have more powers. I can smell time now. I can smell it. I can smell the time yes for the time. It is I smell and I know that's thanks to garcoda. I do wonder if he's going to take hydrochloroquine because he kind of suggested that he was taking it a few months ago. But of course you can never tell what's real and what's carnival barkery. I realized looking through my notes from uh the uh comey rule that we watched and talked about on the last episode that I missed. I forgot to say one thing about the show which is uh. There's a scene where he's talking to kony where where brennan gleason is doing his irish trump like top of the martin luther.

I'm donald trump. I'm here to talk to you about pre-president uh and he goes and he's he's talking about how he doesn't listen to experts or uh. You know political people. He talks to tv people because tv people actually have uh stakes in their jobs. They can if they don't get ratings they lose and so they have to be right now of course that's very easy to undermine and point out the absurdity of because no they don't have to be right. They just have to be entertaining but that shows that trump understood american politics better than anybody at the time and why he won more than anything is that he understood that being entertaining is being right.

It's the same  thing now entertaining is correctness. It's because eyeballs are all that matters which honestly is why. I think this could hurt him badly because uh in the last episode uh felix was suggesting that trump might win if he can just use the next month to maximize like to what he did in the debate every day in terms of just getting everyone so disgusted and exhausted that instead of voting to turn the volume down they just stop voting. They just stay home and then the rabid rump of trump supporters is enough to just sneak them over the finish line thanks to of course voter suppression and outright fraud and all the stuff that we know they're gonna do one way or the other uh and I think this really hurts his chance to do that he's in quarantine for two weeks now. I mean what's he gonna do.

I did not predict this on twitter by the way somebody made a fake tweet about me. That was very funny but no that did not happen. I did not say he was gonna do that. I did predict though uh talking about the debate that he would condemn biden uh for being racist due to passing due to writing the crime bill and say that all cops hate him because he is uh a puppet of antifa and blm in the same answer and he did it. He did it in the same  answer which is just so ma and more than anything reminds you that these people are not operating off of premises or political motivation political ideology. They just have a few lumps of facebook lard in their brain. They're shuffling around at any given moment and then barfing up which is why he's beloved because that's true of everyone who likes him. They don't have political ideas they have. They have a facebook feed that provides them with something to tell people about what they're mad about on a day-by-day basis but none of it connects to each other.

None of it coheres into a hole. None of it has any uh coherency to speak up. They're. It's all isolated. The only people who are threading things together. Of course are the q people but they're doing it at a level of like esoteric uh analysis that is beyond even talking points. It's it's pulling things out of the talking points. Those birds are losing it up there wow they're really nuts oh. If this is a if they are ravens and they're they're quoting nevermore. I'm gonna be pissed if they interrupt me when I go back inside here and I'm pouring over my quaint and curious volumes of forgot lore. I am going to be mega pissed. I'm gonna come out here like betty draper with a  bb gun. No. I'm not they're fine love all animals what the hell is a narco communism. I I always get mad. I guess people always yell at me when I talk about anarchism.

So. I'm not going to talk about it too much just to say that it's a way for people to think that they're good guys. It's a way to be like. I want all the good stuff without any of the bad stuff and since it's all at the level of labels. It doesn't really matter but what matters is like how you are operating off of those labels because one thing. I know from like dealing even in the minimum way that I have with like the micro sects and you know emerging tendencies within the self-conscious left in this country which is to say political cosplayers. Myself included there's no real coherence there anymore as there is the people like trump and facebook grandparents. Like there are uh mls like people who I've seen call themselves you know in dsa for example like call themselves marxist leninists who uh demand like regional autonomy for like their dsa chapter from a national that's the exact opposite of leninism as it applies to party structure like leninism means democratic centralism which is like something like psl has where there is a line that is enforced after a vote. Once the vote is taken the line is enforced and you've got people who call themselves marxist leninist saying no no. I want my chapter to be able to do whatever it wants well that's not what what it's just because the words have resonance the words mean things emotionally uh and then they want to apply those regardless of what it means to their actual lives and that's not a huge deal as long as it doesn't obscure your ability to see what's happening in front of you because I really don't think any of those labels mean anything when the nut cutting time comes when people have to get offline and uh and engage with their hate to use the word but community oh. They're saying he's gonna get experimental treatment.


That's so funny that's very funny. I mean I don't know if that means hydrochloroquine. It would surely be funny if he took that oleander extract that my pillow guy is flogging which is apparently actually deadly. I gotta say though if he bounces back in two weeks and he's fine. I kind of think that's the most likely scenario because he shouldn't be alive now but  he shouldn't be alive period. He should not be alive. What actuarial table tells you that a man who is the who is the exact shape of a frigidaire refrigerator and eats nothing but gristle for three meals a day should be alive at the age of 74.

So maybe he is impervious. Maybe. He's like his like keith richards of course if he was uh. If he is if he is felled by quack medicine. He will not be the first president to be killed by uh uh quack medicine uh. I think we've talked about it on the stream before but george. Washington father of our country was killed by a guy a doctor whose only treatment for um for whatever the hell uh he had. I'm not sure. I don't know if anyone knows what he had. But it was. It was one of those classic went out went out and rode in the rain and came home and got ill you know type of situations pneumonia or something. He just bled him. He's just like he's still sick got to get more blood out of there and he literally just draculed the father of our country to that and then of course there's uh garfield who was killed by his quack doctor friend uh who insisted on sticking uh unsanitized fingers into the bullet hole and then most damagingly of all refused to allow him to be fed orally but instead rectally which caused him to over the course of his. Uh attempted convalescence to lose like 60 pounds which made it much harder for him to fight off the infection which could have been defeated if they had just uh sewn them up after the gunshot because the bullet didn't hit anything anything vital. It got lodged like in the broad muscles of his lower back.

I'm trying to think of who else I'm trying to think of anybody else died of uh die hilariously among presidents. I mean nelson rockefeller who was the unelected vp for ford uh. He died pretty funny. He he died having sex with his mistress. William henry. Harrison famously said to have died because he uh gave a speech in the rain and got pneumonia that's possible. But my opinion is is that he died for the same reason that zachary taylor died and james polk right. After his term ended which is during the 1840s there was behind the white house about a couple hundred yards maybe not even that far a giant sewage lagoon. A huge open air pit of human feces which most likely gave cholera to one or three of those guys they said. Zachary taylor died from milk and cherries. There was also a theory for a long time that he was poisoned by the slave power to stop him from uh resisting um allowing slavery into western the western territories claimed in the mexican war but he was most likely killed by the poop water as well in fact zachary taylor. I think I think it's a while ago now. I think it's like 20 years ago. He was um disinterred because they wanted to test his body for arsenic because arsenic lasts very long in the human body and you can actually uh do test sport in hair. You don't even have to do an autopsy. So they they um. They they dug them up and they cut some hair loose. But they didn't find any arsenic coolies just had a heart attack. I thought while shaving I believe shaving just dropped it.

Tr presidents don't die like they used to. They don't die at all they live forever. Uh jimmy carter is 96. Now he has had a brain tumor for five years. Herbert hoover also lived into his 90s and of course ronald reagan uh bush these guys they have all the adrenochrome like they've literally taken all everyone else's uh animal spirit into themselves and allowed them to live forever because they they don't suffer. The same health risks that the rest of us do because they pile up our our labor to to keep them alive. So. I mean somebody will die prematurely at some point but I don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't want to bet on which one it is sure not going to be obama. You know he's got the best. He's got the best of during the chrome possible. He'll be 150.


Have you read about the bloody uh baron unger sternberg in the russian civil war. I have in fact. I highly recommend the book the bloody white baron about him because that is an insane story uh so during the russian civil war. You might know this or not you know there was uh. The the basic geography was is that the bolsheviks held roughly the center of the russian empire's territory and then around the edges were a number of rebel armies under different commands which is the big reason that the bolsheviks won against them against such long odds and against you know the combined attempted intervention of the uh of the allies from world war one is that they held the middle they held the middle area which means that they had internal lines of defense and stuff and and they could coordinate in a way that the white armies just couldn't uh and there was one white army uh under a uh like an old prussian aristocrat named uh under baron ungers von sternberg who uh had a ragtag army in mongolia where he essentially declared himself like a reincarnated uh buddha and had like kind of a weird quasi-mystic buddhist uh cannibal army in the mongolian hinterland before the uh before the before he was finally defeated by the bolsheviks and executed there's a very interesting um moment there because after he was caught he was brought to a nearby city and displayed for the town like they put him on a stage and people came and watched him and like asked him questions about what he had done and he defended himself before they. Uh before they. I think hanged him but he was a complete psycho uh and yeah. He thought he was like he was a god on earth. He was a very much a colonel kurt situation uh and he had his his guys massacring civilians and and deserters and and he made deals with like local uh uh like buddhist mongolian religious leaders to to like co-rule with him interesting very interesting story and uh there's a detail from that book that I think is one of the most chilling things.

I've ever I've ever encountered which is that uh when one of the um one of the romanovs one of the one of the one of the girls while she was in captivity and they found out later um her she had written while she was in uh in her cell wherever she had like a journal and she was drawing swastikas. She just was drawing she had drew in a bunch of swastikas. This is like 1918 uh because you know the nazi party did it emerged from an esoteric tradition in among uh specifically among european aristocracy which sternberg was representing which the romanovs were part of which uh ended up in germany finding expression in the tool society which was a group of esoteric cultic wealthy germans who backed the nazis in the early era. So I recommend that book it's very. It's it's short. It's well written uh and there's lots of good gory details they're saying.

He has a high fever oh. Oh boy. That's not good god if he does die. He dies before the election god damn. I mean if he died before the election how could we handle that like he has been this man has been the single focus of the emotional energy of what I'd say 50 million americans something like that either against him or for him like he has been the star that their psychic world has revolved around. We have all even if we don't have that much emotional investment in him as a person. We've all been living in his brain for the last four years and if he just was oh yeah. He's gone now before this election. That's supposed to be this titanic contest that might might turn into a civil war according to everybody who's secretly jacking off under their  blockings honestly just an entire nation with blue balls. I'm trying to think there's a. I'm trying to think there's a book or a movie or something that's got like one of those just hilariously anticlimactic endings. I'm trying to think of what it is the closest thing we have to esoteric rightism in this country now and you and if you saw that feels good man documentary and the interview with the with the uh with the with the magician guy. It's probably like 4chan. It's probably it's probably forums. It's probably reactionary forums full of those like in-cell child molesters who just concentrate have so much time on their hands that they can cont and that they can. They can collectively concentrate their will on creating memes that they charge with dark power and then put out into the world. I would say that more than q just because q is it's less self-conscious. I think like these people don't these people think they're doing. Normal politics is the thing for now. I think that's going to change as q gets more intense and and more broke but for now. It's like they're normal they're. They think they're normal still.

They think they're normal is q christian. It's not only christian but it is largely christian. It's its earliest proponents are definitely uh evangelicals. There's it still is like. I say fundamentally evangelical and I would say also and I talked about this with sean on uh history as a weapon that just came out where we talk about cube that the the new age people who are now part of hugh are essentially secular evangelicals. The way that scientologists are you know like everyone's essentially an evangelical in this country because at least everyone who is pursuing the american dream self-consciously is an evangelical because the american dream is the dream of everyone being god which is of course why mormons are the ideal americans and the ones who have done the best at. A synthesizing uh a way of life out of american capitalism because they were the first ones to twitch onto what america really meant and they went out west where there was still land. They grabbed some even though it was  and by virtue of the fact that they sublimated uh capitalism into their social fabric. They were able to present the they were able to prevent the the deracination that happened to everybody else uh but but you know everyone is seeking that they're the only ones who have it as a theological uh principle but everyone is seeking gut to be seeking godhood on earth and it's it's it's. It's why we are consuming the world because the american dream is that the the access to material excess that used to be the province of gods on earth kings.

Emperors sat traps. Potentates is now for everybody. Everybody can have that and and like the idea of a social good is is consumption well. There's a math. I could it's not hard math problem to show why that's not sustainable and that's why we need a new uh a new religious framework a new spiritual uh and value framework that that d that de-emphasizes material not not in the interest of austerity for everybody like oh you know like the way carter did hey. You guys should you guys should stop uh stop being so materialistic and save some energy. It's like well  how about you create a world where that's even possible you know. Uh. It's about changing the social inputs in such a way that uh that living is possible living in the absence of striving for material gain is possible well. It says abundance for everybody but abundance is what you know like abundance if it's abundance in hamburgers. If it's abundance in  high fructose corn syrup if it's abundance in mcmansions. That's not a viable. Most social model like abundance has to be defined socially like everyone should have an abundant access to to the what is best in life. But what that is can can't be determined by the market because the market's answer will always be consumption.

What is best in life uh chillin chillin with the homies. I think um no what is best in life sure  human species. Someone wants to know what books to recommend on john brown uh obviously if you want to write a novel which has a lot like it has. It has a lot of like if you want to know like what happened in terms of just bare facts. There's a lot of accuracy that's very well researched cloud splitter uh. But uh there's also a a kind of considered a pretty uh authoritative biography from david reynolds called john brown abolitionist. The man who killed slavery sparked the civil war and ceded civil rights.


What's the progressive international is this a replacement of the fake pathetic socialist international because honestly I feel like that's going backwards into terminology. Progressive is one of my least favorite words. On earth. There was a period of a brief period when I was all headed with the concept of bernie winning and and uh you know and if not bringing about social democracy at least changing the game and I'm imagining a world where in the future you know that battle has been fought and uh I always thought it'd be fun to write a book in that position about elizabeth. Warren called the last progressive just the idea of warren at that. I mean that if bernie won of course if uh uh warren representing sort of the last gasp of of the progressive uh tradition in america but sadly that did not happen not don't like that word is that something from giannis versus fakas because I absolutely. I think that his analysis his his analysis uh of the situation and his insistence that we need to think in terms of building institutions that transcend national boundaries is very very true like.

I think this idea that you're gonna. I understand the argument and I agree with it that in the current moment national political institutions are the only ones that people can have any effect on really and so that's where people have to focus their energy. But I think there has to be an eye at all times on the on the necessity to transcend that because because international cooperation is going to be the only way that we mitigate the worst of the crisis we're in but he doesn't seem to really have a very at least successful uh project going on. I know that his uh his election his his party or whatever in eu is is not doing is very doing very poorly. I like nietzsche someone asks what's my thoughts on nietzsche. I'm a big. I'm a fan gets a bum rap mostly thanks to his awful nazi sister. No he didn't kill god we killed god he just noticed.

I don't think he was a reactionary uh and and yeah he didn't like socialism. Because he was he was repelled by any kind of uh. You know uh any project that sublimated like the individual like that and then yeah because he was a romantic. It's but like there's still use useful stuff. There you can't just like reject or embrace things someone's asking about like the idea of like using nationalism and patriotism to sell socialism. I think any at this point. I think we should see that there is no future in branding that that what we're branding is too hegemonically capitalist to accommodate a alternative within it that could genuinely challenge it yeah we should because like when people talk about like bernie wasn't uh like patriotic enough or he didn't he didn't like salute the troops enough or whatever that all feels like people uh pippin picking that  out of peppa because that was not the thought he did not run on. Like america. The united snakes he ran on boilerplate america is a great country and it deserves the great you know system and all that stuff there was no way to add to that that was gonna that was going to change.

The fundamental dynamic which is that somebody somebody in that field is gonna have to is going to be pitching themselves to a specific group of people. I.e voters and those voters are going to be taking their cues if they're democrats specifically from a media apparatus and from a party that is just fundamentally incapable of assimilating that level of uh of government intervention into the to into our blessed neoliberal uh market system and there's no way around that and I and I and I think people thinking of ways to you know buff it up and and and throw some uh throw. Some cool uh tires onto it and turn it into a  suv with a big american flag or something. None of that is going to change the the under the fundamental issue which is that what alienates people from bernie among the people you needed him not to be alienated by are two things one if you are a voter. If you're a democratic voter. You are taking your cues from the democratic party and from the media apparatus which means that it's a non-starter.

There's not enough amer america flag kissing he could do and secondly the second group uh are not paying attention so they don't  truck or hat. They're not paying attention and that is the problem and if they're not paying attention to politics. I don't think they really are humping the symbols of patriotism in such a way that they are like just waiting to be activated by the right incantation and also like all that patriotic stuff like that's all coded already. Like you can't pry that stuff away from its context. Like when people talk about patriotism they're not just using it as a as a broad concept. It's connected to other specific sub-concepts that are antithetical to a socialist project prying it off prying. It off is not the easy task that people think it is and I think it's.


It's because of that. It's more fruitful to look lower to look to look to more basic stuff than to branding campaigns. The democrats are will go for q and r over time as I've said. Everyone who is politically minded will go queuing on over time because things are going to keep getting worse politics is going to continue not intersecting with actual conditions and that means that you're either going to have to stop paying attention which a lot of people are going to do and just check out from it. But the ones who keep paying attention on all sides of the aisle are going to have to get more and more intensely esoteric with their parsing of symbols in order to invest the whole pageant with any meaning because like q started with a very simple from a very simple crisis point like we talked about how you know. It's the difference between the america. They find themselves in in the america that they have in their head but more specifically it happened because trump was to them the guy who was going to make america great again. He was going to fix the problems he was going to get rid of the sickos he was going to more than anything be the revenging angel against the people who they blame because resentment is the engine of politics at this point on all sides and then he got in there and he didn't do it.

Nobody went to jail hillary for one thing like lock. Her up was the essential like forget great america great again lock. Her up was as important if not more so a slogan of 2016 trump campaign and did he lock her up no in fact at one point. He even admitted that he wasn't going to lock her up in front of a bunch of hooting chuds. After he got elected. He says to him that was good for the campaign that was fun but yeah like he was just telling these people you actually  care um and so that was what they had to square. Trump's supposed to be putting these people in jail. He's supposed to be cleaning out the swamp and yet everything's the same. It's because it's happening behind the scenes. Well. Democrats do that too like with all their with obama with all the 11 dimensional chess stuff and like queen pelosi. Uh how she's got a trick up her sleeve. That's only going to get more and more intense like biden gets in there and does nothing about the crisis which is probably going to happen. Democrats are going to go get q brain 2 even more so to try to parse now because q exists and is coded as trumpy and republican and reactionary.

It will look differently it'll self-consciously be different because they will have this example that they're not going to want to be like but in content in terms of its motivation and the engagement between politics and their world like the way that they are approaching it not as uh you know a a actual um exercise of power that's happening in public that you're observing but as a secret coded veil that you have to pierce they gave regeneron to trump. They're not giving him hydrochloroquine what the  regeneron that sounds like a uh that sounds like a drug in in like a robocop remake like some sort of rich person stem cell thing that gives you a tail and a laser vision or something oh. If he they gave him energon cubes we're  uh if if donald trump turns into a decepticon. I don't think it matters how many proud boys show up at the polling places in november oh. Regeneron is the company okay that's still that's also sounds creepy. That's like a company in a robocop movie. Regeneron is a subsidiary of ocp so what if melania dies and trump doesn't wouldn't that be funny melania dies at the covet and he survives or don jr dies of it and he doesn't.

I think harris would beat pence if it came to that every trump dies except baron and then he becomes the the false dimitri who who emerges to lead that nation through its time of troubles the bloody white baron von baron trump. He's huge he's absurdly huge and he is uh. He is a virgin chad. He is the he is. He is the synthesis that dork one time said that trump was gonna complete the cycle of german idealism. He didn't know that it was barron not donald because you see him. He's this giant man and yet he does the virgin walk. Uh I have read about 30 years awards.


Pretty intense honestly kind of crazy. How little an effect it has on popular culture considering how hair-raisingly monstrously violent. It was uh the number of people who died uh in germany was absolutely catastrophic. I'm trying to find the uh the death toll but I think they estimate like a quarter of the german population or something like that died during the war entire regions completely disrupted spoiled swedish armies marching like  locusts across the countryside and just destroying towns and castles and villages yeah. The swedish army itself destroyed one third of all towns in germany. Over 1500 sweden gustavus adolphus the uh the most interesting players in this 30 years war were of course the french because france was of a catholic power of europe uh but it fought with the protestant league against the catholics because the catholics were led by the habsburgs and the habsburgs were considered a greater threat to the bar bones than uh than any kind of any any uh potato eating uh  scandals and square heads. In fact it was a catholic cardinal cardinal. Rich. Lou himself are not rich luke uh a different guy who uh who advised france to get into that war on the on behalf of the protestants which of course means it was not just a religious conflict. It was good old-fashioned power politics which is always what it ends up being people forget that uh people of course forget that sweden was a world power in europe uh in the in the 16th and 17th century uh. In 18th century they actually had a north american colony. Delaware and parts of new jersey were were called new sweden until peter stuyvesant and the dutch kicked him out and then after charles the uh.

The 12th just got their asses kicked against the russians. They just said we'll find we'll just do furniture from now on no more wars for us who killed palm uh gladio broadly south africans probably specifically but like that whole spider network palm was a thorn in the side of uh of the anti-communists international. That was uh by the 80s going ham in south africa in latin america operation condor but also genocides in central america italy of course belgium and he was uh. It wasn't hard to kill him that's for sure you say killing. A leader of a country is a bit over the top though but I mean if if the the latest revelations are right the guy who pulled the trigger was some crank because cranks are great if you have an intelligence operation uh because even if they get caught they don't they're too dysfunctional to have like live connections to anything uh and also when you look at how easy it was to kill him. The dude had no body guards. He was leaving a movie theater with his wife and then the guy who shot him even though he was maybe. Just this crank got away with it and never got caught. He's dead now.

I actually don't know if the business plot is real. I don't know how real the business plot was I believe that smedley butler had these conversations. But I don't know if it went even beyond that. But it definitely indicates that you know even though fdr was the savior of capitalism in many ways that the capitalists were not all on the same page as to whether they wanted to be saved which is why which is the which is. The value of government which is the value of democracy in a capitalist system is that it not only does it provide popular legitimacy to legitimize all the exploitation and horror of it. But it also allows for the coordination of behavior that individual actors within it are never going to uh sign off on because it hurts their bottom line. I just want to end on that note of like like what's realistic for capitalists to do uh. I want to say that I just rewatched for a first time in a number of years michael clayton which I think is getting. It's people are talking about it more and more these days uh and a movie that came out in that great year. The last great american movie you're an american film 2007. There will be blood no country for old men zodiac before the devil knows you're dead uh and michael clayton that's just off the top my head. There's more than I'm not even remembering uh and I think now clayton might be the best one of those honestly just because it is in my mind just the perfect legal thriller. It's like it is. It does everything that it could do with the material that is that it's made up of it. The performances are amazing tom.

Wilkinson obviously is fantastic but clooney has never been better than that movie. He does so much stuff with his face so he's just like he's this twitchy mask that's always looking like it's going to pop open really good stuff um. But if you haven't seen the movie spoiler alert. Uh turn I'm gonna stop after this so you can log off. If you wanna go watch it and I highly recommend going and watching it uh. So if you don't want a spoiler drop off now uh because. I will just be wrapping up here after I finish saying this so the plot of the movie is that uh tom wilkinson is this big shot lawyer with this firm. That's defending a agricultural agribusiness giant against the lawsuit from a bunch of farmers in wisconsin that they gave them that they sold them a fertilizer that gave them all cancer and it's been going on for years but in the middle of a deposition uh tom. Wilson has a psychotic break and freaks out and and uh the firm brings in george clooney who's the fixer he doesn't do litigation he just rough. He just smooths over  for people uh which is something that out. The capital system needs those lubricants a guy to uh to uh a guy to patch over uh the rough spots and and do the things that are not within the realm of the law necessarily and they bring him in because he's a friend with him to to talk him down but at one point eventually uh the head of the internal uh legal team for the uh agricultural company played by tilda. Swinton uh hires these dudes to kill tom wilkinson and then later uh george clooney after it looks like he's getting too close to the case and she's working on behalf of uh.

This the big the ceo of the company who's played by uh he was ed truck in the office uh also uh on 30 rock. He was uh hank hooper and I think what's really well observed about. It is that and I remember at the time when it came out ross. Douthit complained that it was unrealistic because a corporation wouldn't just have someone killed. It wouldn't just have people killed because it's a corporation. They have zillions of dollars like even if they lose this lawsuit and the like the big thing hinges on the fact that uh the litigator the tom wilkinson character has a document that's like a absolute smoking gun that these guys knew the drug killed people knew that uh the fertilizer killed people and didn't do anything about it like the stuff that means you're dead you're. Thing is that the order doesn't come from the top guy. The order doesn't come from hank hooper the ceo because even if this comes out what's the worst thing that happens he has to retire two years early right. He has to take his golden parachute parachute uh a little ahead of time before he goes and golfs like oh maybe he has to go in front of congress like he's not going to jail he'll be fine. The stockholders will take a hit they'll be pissed at him but like there's insurance it'll all be fine. The person who orders the hit is tilda swinton because for her the stakes are vastly higher because if this goes south her career is ruined. She doesn't have the golden parachute.

She's just she's just like halfway up the mountain she doesn't want to get thrown to the bottom. She has the fear of falling and that is where all of the nonstress extra legal stuff happens not at the commanding heights because the guys at the commanding heights they're not really at risk of anything. Our system exists to completely uh protect them from any real consequences of their actions because like paying a fine with somebody else's money and then like resigning your job is not a real consequence for killing in this case. Like hundreds of people with a  uh fertilizer uh or a pesticide of life rather um. It's people in the middle. It's people who want that and aren't there yet and could maybe face real consequences if something happened because they could go to jail. Those are the people who who who pull the trigger or order others to pull the trigger are. The ones floating in the middle are those the guys who would do something like have a hit off olaf almost assassinated.


Maybe okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna log off here but first some uh halloween movie recommendations good idea halloween three season of the witch. You don't even have to have seen the first two because it's totally disconnected which is hilarious because they wanted to make it into an anthology series after the third after the second one but then nobody liked it so they went back to the michael myers stuff which first two are good. After that. It's like no they should they should have stuck with the with the idea of a anthology. Anthologies are highly underrated especially horror anthologies uh and on that uh third sequel second sequel tip exorcist three. Uh the one directed by the writer of exorcist a a wahhabist catholic william peter blatty who also made a great movie called the ninth configuration. The only two movies he ever directed and both of them are really good um fright night. Two. You mean a sequel to the original one with william ragsdale and uh and roddy mcdowell. I didn't know there was a sequel to that that was a movie. I saw a bunch as a kid fright night too oh no this is a sequel to the remake get out of here and it doesn't even have the same cast get out of here. Uh let me think of some other ones yeah three and a half stars that's good people under the stairs is fun. I like the you gotta love blunt political allegory evil dead 2 yes of course army of darkness 2 army of darkness 2 even though that's not scary. I did I recently watched wake and fright which is not. I don't think really a horror movie except for the scene where they shoot. They really shoot all those kangaroos which is pretty gruesome. But I do like to think that it is a horror movie where the premise is what if you had to hang out with australians.

That's the horror oh and uh in john carpenter uh on john carpenter tip. Uh obviously the thing but prince of darkness which is underrated and the mouth of madness which is also underrated. I did see miracle mile that movie is nuts uh. That's a great uh nuclear holocaust paranoia movie where anthony edwards overhears someone on the phone saying that there's a nuclear missile headed towards los angeles in like four hours and they have to try to get out of the city in time drag me the hell's a lot of fun. I gotta say. I haven't really liked a lot of these new. These new fangled horror films. I haven't seen one in a bit that I really really like but hopefully something. Soon. Miracle mile is the one about the nuclear uh attack on los angeles that actually would make a nice in terms of like the time frame some of the setting. Uh it would actually make a good double feature with knight of the comet if anyone's seen that which is about a couple of valley girls who survive a nuclear attack yeah. I'm gonna watch the new invisible man soon before the before the month is out oh. Now. I'm very intrigued oh yeah.

There it is tommy lee wallace roddy mcfaul back oh man oh. It's not available anywhere is it streaming anywhere okay. I gotta see that because that because the original fright night is is a foundational movie for me the scene when evil turns into a  uh like a wolf man thing after he gets the steak. That's that's seared in my mind. You're so cool brewster all right. I gotta try to find. I gotta find try to find fight night. Two all right guys monster squad of course of course of course. Bye-bye folks stay frosty and uh get well soon okay well soon president trump lol long live. The broomstick.
