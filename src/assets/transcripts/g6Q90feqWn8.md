Um oh this broadcast is intended for I don't know mature viewers. I don't know if that's true. I don't know if. I would say that we're mature on here ah. I'm indoors because it's annoyingly called rainy out. Today. It's raining all over the place can't go back to the bunker even though it's still unseasonably warm. I have not yet been able to set foot outside. It's quite a dismal day. Indeed oh god damn. It are people asking about mic volume. I'm gonna hold on one second. I'm gonna hold on one second let me hear. It again look at that hold on one second. Let me hear it again. I literally am listening to it on twitch and it sounds fine. I just listened to it coming through my own speakers at a certain point. I'm just going to have to privilege my own perception over whatever the robots and potential beijing's provocateur in this goddamn stream are telling me to do. I gotta say that that the fact that it sounds crystal clear coming out of the audio equipment and as robert downey senior said in boogie nights that is a yp. That's not an mp how's everybody doing tonight. I don't really know anything. I'm I'm kind of cashed out actually might not do one tomorrow if it feels if. I'm not getting if I don't if I don't get a little frisian but that's often happened.

I've come on the stream having no idea what to talk about and end up being like holy. Where'd that come from so we'll see. We're gonna take the journey together congratulations by the way to president trump for four more years. The the electoral college has voted and he has enough electoral votes when go when vice president pence presides over the certification that he will be president several very several very well-known and and and trustworthy websites. and twitter accounts have said this and I have no reason to disbelieve it so man if they did that it would be the funniest thing in the world. I mean and the funniest thing about it would be that all of the liberals right now including myself broadly defined who are smugly watching this flailing like pathetic non-coup happen if they just said oh yeah. We're we're we're not going to certify these votes. We're going to vote give it to trump and even though it violates the constitution and the letter and spirit of all law. Nobody stops them none of the people who would be shocked by it would be able to do anything about it.

Like that's the truth of it and I think that's why they feel so insistent on making you be mad. There's they note they realize that oh like their chest they imagine themselves part of a grand chess game of american progressivism stretching back to. I don't know wilson something like that where they are battling like the behemoth of america's bestial like populist heart that you know they used to think was just dumb but now think is racist because like the changing intellectual composition of liberals and elite liberals who populate elite liberal institutions. They've been in a chess game with reaction since world sense since the progressive movement began and they found themselves and I think they realized that after this election and they realized that after watching all the norms just get blown away by trump and now a situation where they all realize oh our our our formal. barriers against just a pure reactionary grasp for power are non-existent. They do not exist well that means you've lost the game that means you have been checkmated. You cannot do any move other than slit your own throat if you're. If you consider yourself pro part of the liberal project broadly construed and all these people do like the way they talk about politics. Even if they're just regular people. They talk about the democratic party like they're part of it like the way democrats but voters not even people at like the media level talk about the democratic party as if they're part of a project which is of course not the case they're along for the ride to one degree or another. They're along for the ride so they've lost they've lost because they know in their heart oh if we ever did try to get the kind of change that I keep insisting. I want to see happen the kind of change on something like climate change or even some more emotionally like emotionally you know compelling issue like racism or gun control.

We're not going to get there without them just taking power because we now know they could if they wanted to you've lost and because you're liberal you have discounted anything other than politics as you understand it to be the the way that we can you know battle reaction the the dark heart of america's you know white maleness you have discounted activism of any meaningful sign. You've discounted the labor movement as just another interest group. That's what that's what the new left in the 60s and and the emergent like atari democrats agreed on which was the consensus left position in amongst this new like post 60s collegiate liberal and left milieu. was that the unions are just another interest group if not an upholder of racism and patriarchy and they've stuck. They've stood fast with that 40 years later and now they have no interest in in using labor as a mobilizing tool against reaction. They have no interest in doing anything other than voting for democrats but they know now in their hearts that voting for democrats will never get them so what they want now is. They want to do the only thing that they think can work and that is because they are media creatures one way or another and they've decided in their hearts that that activism consists of yelling at people until they do what you told them to do that all they can do is insist as loudly as possible that this is something you should care about so that we'll just transubstantiate people into like transubstantiate regular democrats into donors and you know on the fence like liberals into committed democrats and and people who don't vote but are part of um. A oppressed minority that should instinctively vote for democrats will be snapped into consciousness. They will be phase shifted into a consciousness as like a self-conscious democratic voter and then they will win because they'll just it'll be.

They'll they will have too many votes. There will be too many places to steal it from and they'll have to give power and the only way that can come about is by yelling by getting people by presenting yourself emotionally. Now that's one part of it. There's another more important part for anybody who's at the top of this media totem pole or rather even in the middle. If you're getting money from the the political media. As we understand it your calculus is different. It's more self-consciously self-interested and less like psychological coping mechanism. Here at that level. You can't just say write an article or do a tweet or do an appearance on television and say this fake coup this. The continuance of this of the republicans to go along with all of these things up to and including you know the texas lawsuit and over 100 house republicans signing on to it that means that they will not accept another election that they lose if it's anything. If it's any closer than this you anyone can say that that doesn't really that doesn't position you that doesn't make you stand out.

It doesn't provide value add as a part of the media hierarchy even if you're just trying to be a commentator for the bottom up. What what provides value. Add is the follow-up which is and I can't believe we're track we're not acting. Like this is a big deal that is the move where you distinguish yourself where you take something. That's banal and you say. I am different from those others because I care about it more people act like bob barr resigning as a big deal.

He'd be gone in the middle of january. Anyway what what oh yeah on the other side of the diluted fence. Apparently the chinese army was just attacked with a with an air bombardment while trying to invade maine from canada so everybody's living in their own fantasy world us too and It's all about which one is is is more pleasing to you. I think this is a pretty good one. I feel like the vibe here is better.

I feel like there's that it's less anxious that's the thing I notice on all spectrums of people trying to pretend that their political participation means something. The thing that unites them is the anxiety anxiety about and I felt this anxiety for a long time especially as we got closer to like the the to the inflection point of the pro of the bernie campaign in 2020. Early good gourd still this year. was oh god like am I wrong what if I'm wrong and that's bad you ought to be wrong for a bunch of reasons but you also want to make sure that people think that there's a reason it matters if you're right or wrong and the thing that makes it matter is supposed to be you listen to this and then you do something or you act certain way or you think a thing that makes you behave away and if you need to sustain that. I think it it takes an emotional toll and it was one that I couldn't handle anymore. That's why I kind of had to. I was forced to reassess and break my relationship from this this machinery and also there's the idea that you know look at me. I care more about this coup and also that means that if you cared more then we would stop it and it's going to be institutional.

 resistance that changes the calculus of capital or the republican party within it. It's not going to be. It's not going to be us participating at the level of electoral ritual which is where we're happy where we're comfortable is not gonna do it. They will cancel an election if it's close enough or if they feel like the risk of losing power is great enough like real power like the republicans willing to cut bait on trump to the to the exact degree that they don't get is their base voters matter. That's the calculus. I have total interest in seeing trump lose at this get out of here. At this point. I have nothing to gain we have nothing to gain as a party by him clinging to power or trying to resist a peaceful transition. But we have these voters who love him and we can't tell them the truth because they don't think there's a project beyond trump because they're dumb pigs and the one thing that distinguishes us from them is at the highest level. Although this is less and less true even within the ranks of government because you know. I said I think something like two-thirds of republicans. have either lost election primary or retired since trump won like they turned over almost the entire congress and that change was to put true believers there or people who either people who were cynically close enough to the grassroots to just mirror it for their own benefit or they believed it themselves but at the very high levels like the supreme court they're not there. Yet they have a greater investment than trump as a person but they don't want to get people to mad at him which is why judges have been the ones who are happy to do the dirty work that the republican party people can't do. The electeds can't do. They can't say move on because they will get primaried just as surely as if they voted to impeach him.

 we talked a little bit on the show today about the whole thing about aoc and and the healthcare vote and I would I will say this. I said some more on the show but to sum it up the question about aoc in a vote in congress for medicare for all versus whether or not to tie that to a vote for pelosi a speaker. This is the pun. This is the narrative media equivalent. This conversation we're having everyone talking about it. It is sports talk radio. It is the exact same thing as calling in the mike and the mad dog to jawbone about whether the giants should draft a running back or a a wide receiver. It. That is what its function is. It is it is it is off-season talk. It's off-season sports radio because we have no influence on these people whatsoever.

There is no practical question. It is purely a moral question even if you are you agree with with the argument that aoc needs to do this to to draw on the sander. All she is is fairly compromised. What are you going to do about it going to call her office. What does she care in in real terms. She is only even hypothetically answerable to her constituents in her district and the greater progressive movement. They have no there is first of all there is none and because there's none there is no pressure they could put on her. So the question is purely a question of like her her worth as an individual and that's meaningless it means nothing she is a tool and it's a question of who's going to wield her. We the left which doesn't exist because it the left doesn't exist how could it wield a tool how could the left be a hand to hold a tool if there's no body and no hand so that's that you can like.

I said there should be sports political conversation that's like sports conversation. It's it's entertainment. It's talking about the weather with friends. It's a thing to talk about but that's all it is. It's just a thing to talk about and if it's a thing to talk about. I find. It's not very interesting. So it solves itself the question of like what it is. I've lost interest already the only way you can convince yourself that it's a meaningful discussion to have is if you think it has actual meaning beyond idle speculation about what the front office is going to do about the quarterback position. Ah oh man fighting on that conference call is great it's perfect. He just wants them to give him a little gratitude for saving their asses because in his mind he's the only person who could have won in the mind that such it exists the mind that trump biden has and that all upper crust democrats have and filtering down into the even into the party faithful. They believe that this election improves has proven riyada shout. This is a trump country that the average american out there in the hinderlands away from us in our cove cozy coasts and college towns is a savage is an unresolved unreasonable bang jackal of reaction a cart like from a world war one propaganda poster about like the hun as a barbarian with a pickle hub holding a belgian version in his hands and in that world in that america.

The only thing they can win is somebody who appeals to the least savage of the savages and that was that was biden and his whole lincoln campaign approach which hilariously was the same thing hillary did and lost indicating to these people they didn't do it enough and the thing about that is it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong. I mean. I think it's pretty obviously wrong and i. I could. I could collect sheaves of documents about voter behavior and turnout and demographics proving that that's not the case and also like make a broader a philosophical question about like the the the distorting and properizing social effect of of of the american electoral system and american politics and how it how it turns us into like the shadow that we create in our elector systems is the worst of ourselves and that it's a terrible measure of like america's potential as a political body and that we should engage it.

On those terms. It doesn't matter if they're right or wrong the funding model and the organizational structure and the personnel of the democratic party means that they have to run the campaign. They ran against trump when he went economic populist. Even though he didn't mean it obviously. He didn't mean it as soon as he put down the gauntlet that he was going to be economically heterodox. The democrats were pinned. They could not go to his left economically because they cannot raise the hopes of their voters so they had to run against trump as an arrest. An aberration as this monstrosity that is our worst selves and that we're all better than including republicans and it didn't work but nothing changed in the intervening four years about the democratic party's funding model organizational structure and personnel to force it to change its calculus. So it had to run the play again and now we have another outlook the president oh president Popular vote and and sees negative coat and you see negative coattails almost no negative coattails in in the house and senate just but to them they will say. This proves that the country is even more reactionary which means that biden is going to have to go even further to the right as a governor than he had. It's.

The it's the one-way crank that gets you that gets you eventually like the the the goddard run that we're all imagining of like the the trumpest republican party seizing power unilaterally and yeah like that's an uninterrupted road to that if economic conditions deteriorate enough. It's a one-way ratchet and so the whole and so this is why you know. The the the political media sphere is so often detached from real questions is because you can so easily get caught up in refuting the model refuting the democrats by their logic of we're trying to win elections. We're trying to gain power. We're trying to push through progressive legislation. That's immaterial to the actual question of why they do it. And if they're going to keep being able to do it. That is determined by the array of forces and powers materially that undergird the democratic party and nothing about the discussion nothing about the argument and no correct case to be made that like even in public opinion changes the way people view. It is going to change that basic dynamic ugh yeah no no from not for me not for me. These conversations anymore.

How do we push president xi to the left. There's the real question. How do we push general president xi to the left. I mean. I know there are efforts. I know there are like communizing efforts in china in fact It's there's a pretty funny phenomenon now in china where college kids go through the university indoctrination system and learn about marx. As you know you do in chinese colleges and then come out and say oh wow all these working-class workers sure could use some representations in government and then they get arrested.

They say no no no not like that will I go on iglesias podcast oh god no that sounds like oh my stomach hurts even thinking about that. I don't think he would want me on either. I think he gets. I think he does. I think he hates me which is nice because I think most of those people don't know who I am or pretend not to care. I know that he I know that he is a He is aware of online critics and is incredibly outraged by them because he's got the obama brain whereby he is fully confident that he has done the math on every question that matters and that he got the right answer and so anybody who disagrees with him and consistently is at the end of the day um being presumptuous. They're presuming to know something or understand something that he doesn't which cannot be done. That is the iglesias like liberal obama neolib brain emmanuel macron is another guy like that um emmanuel macron by the way who is the one neo-liberal leader who seems to grasp fundamentally that there is a irreconcilable conflict between democracy and like the liberal project. The neoliberal project whatever you want to call it and he has said yes there is so we got to get rid of the democracy not all at once because people are used to it. But it's got to go like even the vestiges of it have to be tamed and of course. He's the one who gets that because france is one of the western countries where like working-class institutional power is most resilient where where coordinated demonstrations and and and meaningful conflict with the state for the grassroots level is continuous and effective where their the worst of neoliberalism has been avoided of course.

They're still on the same trajectory of us as we are. But it's from a higher point and it's going slow more slowly simply because there is more resistance to it as it's implemented unlike the brits and the americans where we are just completely whipped dogs and we have accepted neoliberalism completely and I will say the reason why they had a. They had a real revolution you want to really boil it down to it like at a political level. Obviously there's material reasons that undergird that even but the answer to the same the the political like differentiation is they have a actual revolutionary tradition by which I mean an idea of rebellion against govern a rebellion against depression that that does not erroneously identify government as the only vector of oppression and that has a social conception of freedom and liberty that go beyond individual market participation and and so they've got a guy now who recognizes like okay. This is this has got to go and I think countries like like our guys. I think they still believe that even in their hearts because they can afford to because we're we're not really putting up.

A fight people are arguing about the merits of paris in the in the commentary well a bunch of bunch of gentlemen and ladies cursing about oh. It's a sunday in the park on lagrange jet over here. Somebody says the whiskey rebellion. I mean how is that even remembered as a tax revolt as a revolt against government and a revolt against not exploitation not like exploitation of labor or even like manipulation of of like a market by like a monopoly purchaser. But tax but but government taxation because we never formed up a a a a a citizenry. The way that the way that at least paris was able to because before even there was like fully full capitalism in in france there was this proletarianism of artisanship because paris was filled with artisans but they were syphilitic dukes who controlled it all and and and treated them like internal monopoly markets and had like tariff lines that were everywhere you went. There was land for the taking and we took it and so that understanding of there being like a social reciprocal relationship that it was a fun under fundamental undergirding of even any individual right was absent. Our conception of rights and liberties were denatured. We're we're isolated. We're atomized because of free real estate.

Somebody has guilty pleasures. I try not to have guilty pleasures anymore. I've tried to the guilty plea you. The concept of guilty pleasure emerged as a way to give people who otherwise were only consuming middle brow drac a sense that they had like higher artistic as aspirations because like how many people talk about guilty pleasures who like would un-ironically talk about how moving like avengers endgame or black panther was you know like by any meaningful metric black panther or the marvel movies in general would be a guilty pleasure. You'd feel guilty about it. If the way they talk about art was valid which I don't think it is. They created the category of guilty pleasure like awful reality shows that are even more like witless and and less creative than big budget blockbusters and then say they're feel oh that's. I'm guilty about that to to essentially to elevate the crap that they take for real art if you're consuming real art your concerned and when I say real. I don't mean like. I'm not saying there's an objective criteria for that.

I mean soul-nourishing art soul-nourishing art. If you're consuming that then you don't have this anxiety about dividing the good for the bad because you're not feeling the lack and that's the thing that unifies the entire broad middle populist brow of people who've decided that actually everything you need to know about the world everything every emotional experience. You need to have every like intellectual idea every cathartic bringing together of like image and sound and and and perspective into like a a to as a little prism to view through the to view another person's view of the world through like if you see art as that like somebody creating a perfect lens of observation and craft and poetry to have you look through and then the experience of art is just to seeing through it and the clearer. It is the more beautiful it is and the more you feel that if you feel a communion of spirits at some level you feel something that is ineffable in your experience of it and these people the lotus eaters of the poptimist mainstream. I swear to god. They don't feel that but what they do is. They feel the lack of it and then they go out and seek to insist that it doesn't exist that they're not missing anything. Everybody who says there's anything more to art is lying to them to sound smart and fancy.

That is the go-to argument. If anyone who who brings down the wrath who who's outraged by by by large-scale monocultural entertainment being besmirched is to say you don't really like that stuff. You don't really read those books. You don't really listen to that music. You're you don't you're lying. You just want to sound because why would you do that. It's not fun well because it doesn't. It's because fun isn't the only metric there's other things to art. No there isn't because if there was they'd be missing something and they can't even imagine that because they're so fully bought into the capitalist realist world the and and have so conditioned their coping mechanisms to be around that sense of identity and purpose and an intellectual challenge. It's essentially cultural gaming and so they have to create this guilty pleasure but if you want to say things that are objectively bad that I can't like argue are good that I still enjoy. I guess that's more it like objective isn't a thing but things that I couldn't make a plausible case even to myself are good. But I still like that's a different thing yeah. See I guess snl would of course work but yeah. I never. I can't feel guilty for watching. Snl.

People are yelling about the raw meat yeah. It's called a cannibal sandwich. It's not even all in wisconsin by the way it's only around milwaukee. In fact. I was a little north like other people who grew up near where I grew up probably didn't never heard of it. But like I distinctly remember having a christmas in sheboygan which is like about 30 to 45 minutes. About 30 minutes north of milwaukee right along the wa lake michigan so like 30 minutes up to lake michigan shore from milwaukee county is sheboygan and I remember having a sheboygan christmas where there was set on a little table next to the venison and the like. The cheese curds and and the cocktail sauce were a bunch of little those little rye cocktail end pieces and then a bowl of ground chuck raw ground chuck that was then you just take a butter knife and you put it on and then you put on salt and pepper and raw onion and they call it a cannibal sandwich and it is a leftover. It's the remaining cultural food way of the germans who who made up like the first large europe scale european settling in wisconsin wisconsin was founded by by yankee congregationalists.

Both michigan western new york the upper. the case western the case the western reserve in ohio. Michigan and wisconsin were were just were originally settled as like american territories by immigrants from new england. So like the the children of the children of the puritans the the who ended up being like the the the The social base for the republican party basically and the wigs before that settled it but then the first large-scale immigration. To fill this the cities like milwaukee was from germany specifically catholic southern germany. the beer drinking stein wielding party germans not the dower militarist austere prussians. party germans and the one of the great traditions in party germany is ground pork raw ground pork or beef and actually in It's apparently a buffet food in germany to this day and they shape it like a hedgehog and they put little They make it look like a little hedgehog and then they put little slices of onion in the back to be like 

The quills raised 70s even before and it still exists a little bit in wisconsin. Like i. I had it when I was a kid but it wasn't something that stuck around like that we it's not like my family family's been doing this recently. and the reason people are hearing about this and freaking out about. It is because wisconsin asked people because of the danger of the raw. Meat please do not eat it and there were these people who of course were all supposed to laugh at saying. You. I eat this every year take it from a gold dead. Hand people like are you are these guys what's wrong with them. It is an actual wisconsin food way. It's not something that's terribly dangerous if the meat is fresh and certainly if the fret if the meat comes from one cow and this is where things get like. This is where you can see like how how our folkways are so constrained and like in our and our freedoms. Like these guys our freedoms are constrained by things that we don't recognize as such like so.

These guys who are responding in the facebook comments saying you they're probably mad at the state for being nannies and telling them don't eat raw meat. But the thing is is if you do go to piggly wiggly or iga and buy a ground a pound of ground chuck and just spread it on bread you'll probably guts out. It's a bad idea don't do that. But the thing is traditionally that's not what people did you would go to your local butcher and you would get a fresh ground meat and then you would eat that but the thing is over the last 40 50 years. All those local butchers have been driven out of business and the only place you can get ground. Chuck is to go to the iga or the piggly wiggly and so fewer and fewer people eat it like. I said the last time I ate it. I was like eight because most people even if they like it. They're not gonna grocery store they know. It's bad they've gone to school. They know what raw food does. It's only gonna be like the stubborn holdouts. At this point. I I doubt more than a handful of people still eat those things and what some of them that do probably are psychos who say it and go to kroger.

But if they but the thing that constrained them is not the nanny state. The thing that constrained their ability to get to because you shouldn't be able to you should probably not get raw meat and then eat it like that from the grocery store and maybe like the state should be involved in preventing that from happening but that's not why people can't do it. They can't do it because they can't do it safely. They cannot do it safely and so you have to decide oh. That's the thing we used to do and we used to like it. I can't do it anymore and maybe somehow your brain vaguely thinks oh. I bet it was lawsuits or something. No it was the consolidation of capital and people. Say it's like steak tartare but no it isn't steak. Tartare is a minced up steak and there's an egg on it and like. I think like mustard or stuffing that does like acid. I mean acid cooking the cannibal sandwich is just ground beef but like I said you can get it from a butcher fresh ground. That's not that dangerous. It's also um apparently lebanon. They eat raw beef too raw ground beef or around raw lamb and yes yes yes yes eating meat is indeed monstrous.

It is the regime of terror and blood and horror and participating in it at any level makes you a moral monster and if we do survive as a species I hope everyone is prepared for like. If we do get some sort of space communist future. We will be viewed as monsters for what we have done to animals but god damn it. It's so good. It's so good and all those questions recede in the face of a of a juicy steak or a nice pile of ground raw beef. I will say though that the the fake meat industry is coming along. I know. It's soy based and and not based to want that. But I'm much looking forward to that. Mcdonald's mcplant because sometimes I want to eat the mcdonald's flavor and I would love to do it without knowing that it involved some sort of hostile style monstrous assault on all. That's holy but of course. I think like they destroy half a like. They destroy every every beyond burger. You eat like destroyed a football field's worth of palm trees in banda aceh or something. Mcdonald's fries do not have powdered beef fat in them. They used to though they used to have like some sort of tallow. extract on them and people do say that they were way better back then and you know what I bet they were. I bet they were. I sadly don't remember them when they still had the beef on them.

The fact is industrial agricultural production as we understand it for profit just cannot sustain itself. I mean from a moral perspective but also just ecologically. I mean we're creating monochrome monocultural crops that are begging to be wiped out by some sort by by disease. And we're you know destroying the environment wherever we do large-scale agriculture destroying the water tables. It can't work but you know you can't do craft farming either. You can't that's not going to sustain a population you need to do is what you need to do. In every one of these industries you need to take all of the mechanical and scientific development that we have done in agricultural production and then apply it to the question of use and the question of sustenance and not the question of profit man don't do so much. It really would it would do a lot. It would do a lot. It wouldn't solve everything and it wouldn't make everything perfect but my god it would it would it would make a lot of the things that seem I unscalably horrific in in their criminality and also in their unsustainability more manageable.

The united states wastes half the food that it produces that's not that's not an exaggeration and of course you can say well you know that's it's always tough to anticipate. But I mean that boils down to the fact that we have a that we have a food economy that is entirely built around profit and specifically built around profit in a like competitive market where choice and variety are the only things that matter and the only things that confer the ability to find points of like leverage to extract profit. What people like the way that mcdonald's the mcrib is back because pork prices went down. I believe because of the trade war with china. The mcgriff is back because the u.s because china banned imports of american pork as part as like a tit-for-tat thing for trump's tariffs on chinese goods and it led to a big glut in pork bellies and pork. Belly futures dropped and when that happens.

Mcdonald's buys a ton of pork bellies so that's why we have the mcbritt back after over what a decade like an economy where that can happen. You have to have a lot of food just waiting to get destroyed and not distributed because that would reduce the prop the market price of the of the of the rest of it. That's why they won't let they rest supermarkets have to destroy food that they don't sell it's monstrous. It's a regime of monstrous waste and it is to me the fundamental rejoinder to any idiotic argument. The capitalism is in any way efficient an efficient allocation of resources. It would be funny though if we if we basically like d technologized agriculture like had just had more people farm.

It's like to give them something to do so. I think a lot of people kind of send them down to the countryside you know kind of. I don't know like some sort of rebellion in the in the superstructure. What do you call that a cultural revolution no never mind empty the suburbs I can get behind. I don't know how what the what like the balance of rural and urban. life should be that's way beyond my pay grade. I've read arguments in both directions. The need for like labor intensive local agriculture and you know intensification of infrastructure in in countryside and then arguments for no no you know and encourage minimal minimal. human footprint outside of urban areas and create like dense density. heard arguments for both probably somewhere in the middle. All of it above my pay grade not my question not my circus not my monkeys because I sure. I'm never going to see a society where I have to answer that question. It is certainly my duty to try to get us to a point where these questions mean something. But they're not there yet.

But I do wish. I knew more. I do wish. I could farm. I'll say that I wish. I could I wish. I could form isn't the great reset once again isn't the great reset just capitalism. I I never understand what this especially it's very frustrating to see on the right with the q2. All of these big large large-scale like new world order things it's just oh what they're gonna. A lot of people are gonna die so the capitalism can maintain itself right. They're going to keep like every crisis of capitalism is going to just be met with more quantitative easing at the top and more like liquid money being pooled into the hands of the wealthy and just continue like a dynamo of consumption at the very top of the the world. consumption order that just like sucks everything out out of the world literally like a giant straw until the ability of the earth to like actually whole maintain human life. It starts being compromised and people start dying and mass and and the political structure. eliminates points of descent so that it can more effectively. carry out a regime of border enforcement and technological surveillance am I saying anything that isn't just the trajectory of us.

What is what is the thing that's supposed to be special about this once again. It's like we see it in front of us. We see the the creature the monster operating in plain sight. There's no man behind the curtain. It's just it is. It's in front of the curtain but it's too big to take in. So we vent. We create a mini version of it. A story time fun time version of it to to invest with meaning because it's easier to understand so. I don't even know what I'm supposed. What are the main points about it.

They're gonna sterilize everybody we're being sterilized. Already. Do you guys know what what plastics are doing to our endocrine systems you know like. I mean obviously. You don't want to turn into a red pill psycho talking about like male male virility but sperm counts in the world are collapsing. I don't know if you're aware of this and not just in the west. It's not just because oh yeah you're all living next to You know you're living in between the plastic. The you know you're eating mcdonald's and and just eating no in the least developed parts of the world. Too is because plastic is becoming complete. It's becoming constitutive of the human. Reproduce we're literally already being children of men sterilized what what else do you need what else so what what's special about the great reset thing about it.

What's the difference because whether the broad thing is real or this specific version of it. The fantasy version of it is real. This the challenge is the same and the enemies are the same or should be. I mean if it's about how like they're betting on what it's like. The people in power are making money off of the crisis and that in fact they're the way they're responding the crisis is designed to make them more money. It's about market share what you mean. These people are gonna are gonna that the continued accumulation of capital is going to monopolize what and like amazon's gonna be the only company within the generation. What I mean they don't even have to. They don't even have to sterilize or kill the unproductive and the unnecessary people. They just have to put up a border because they're mostly sorted by geography. I guess like the thing that's most reasonable about all this need for to be like about to be eliminated is that I'm sorry if you're talking about the grace great reset you're not one of the people that they want to reset. You're one of the ledger and keep the the flow of capital going the people are going to get reset are nowhere near you and they're going to be kept that way with machinery and of surveillance and and violence.

They're putting chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay once again yeah. They are but not to make them gay that doesn't kill them. There's been. I mean not gay but like there's been like gender mutations in frogs thanks to exposure to atrazine. I believe it is how many fraud genders are there to quote to quote joe biden at least three. It would be funny if trump tries to now that bar is resigning. I guess it'd be really funny if he tried to just appoint sheriff clark or something and just have them try to do a like order the fbi to arrest congress or something. I don't think they would do it but it'd be funny. Hell. Yeah may clay j higgins attorney general yeah right. There gordy we're going to do it. We're going to do that cool. We're going to take back america. We're going to rest that electoral call. He's going to put in that gold college yep. We're going to get that left home college. We're going to get that good electron college in there avatar by the way was not a bit. People are now saying that that we're doing it is a bit. No we do think avatar is great and everything you can say about how it's bad.

It's like yeah that's true too. But it's a gestalt. Movies are a gestalt like the overall thing when I think about the movie and I watch it. I enjoy it not ironically because I appreciate what went into it and you can like that you can do it. You can like a movie. That's cringey you can like a movie that has like identifiably stock or uninspiring or or or cliche elements. You can like that you're not being tricked into liking something necessarily and I understand why people's backs are up because so much of like blockbuster cynicism is about tricking you with that. But sometimes you gotta accept some of it at a large enough scale of spectacle. You've got to accept a a certain skeleton a a certain degree of stock elements because it wouldn't be. It wouldn't be sustainable at that size without that without that many viewers without that lebron of an audience expectation yeah. It's not a guilty pleasure oh man dune is gonna bite especially on tv now. I wasn't too excited about it either way. I really don't like that. Villanova look at this point of the future. It's like okay. It's yeah everything's all like dull and colorless. It's it seems like it's very nolan asking it's blinkered understanding of like the possibilities the aesthetic possibilities of life all right guys. I'm gonna sign off here thanks for the memories.
