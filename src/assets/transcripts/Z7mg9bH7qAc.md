Was that the muppets originally did they make that up did the muppets write that if so kudos it's a hell of a song we all love to listen to it. We all love to hum it. Sometimes it's fun for the whole family. You don't even have the lyrics to deal with international feeling good guys. I feel like I've got. I'm getting. I'm heading towards being able to articulate something on paper. Soon just put that out there because I'm feeling pretty confident I'll be able to put something together soon in a writing form I'm just excited about it. So. I just wanted to put that out there as a more of anything as a as a marker so that I don't like get lazy on it because I feel like. I could actually I could get myself across anyway. That's all.

I can really ask nothing more than that seems. realistic man I've been thinking about battle bungler man thinking about that oh bungler that'll bungler he is as narcissistic. As trump is. He is a it's a mayor. It's amazing liberals and conservatives have now created like union archetypes around their collective behaviors. In the form of this figure of the united states president and they have polarized around these things and like donald trump is the malignant narcissistic heart of american reactionary ideology which is of course just super structural aesthetic ornament to the bipartisan neoliberal economic order that is undergirding all of it and completely depends and it is the two are totally meshed in and are insufferable from and cannot be removed from and then the democratic id the democratic narcissist. The democrat who thinks he's a progressive because he wants what's best for everybody which is really just what he imagines is best for him personally in every sense of me. What I mean personally as in personal pleasure personal like narcissistic narcissistic self-conception and he is a narcissist in the way that liberals are and these guys both made incredibly improbable runs at the white house when you think about it.

Now unless you want to believe the idea that that obama was like a cia mark project as a kid and they're like we're going to make him president someday. I mean maybe he was cia maybe. His mom was like her postings are very suspicious and like anybody especially at that period of the cold war involved in any kind of international academic outreach. They had an involvement with the cia but that cuts both ways really because it's like well. Everybody had their involvement but that also means that these organizations anyone involved in them is has an implicit association with something that they might not specifically have because not everybody. In all. These orgs like even usaid is cia. I'm sorry like they don't at least they don't know they are whatever you know like they're not agents. They're bureaucrats and they think that they have that their job is real that's true in every one of these organizations but anyway whatever one way or the other.

If you take him for seriousness. He wasn't a plant which I think is silly he got to where he was from single motherhood in hawaii and and you know being one of the chum gang through just a single-minded pursuit of his narcissistic self like of of feeding the furnace of his ego and what he wanted because of his because it was the specifics of his background at the specifics of his life experience. What that meant to him was approval from the establishment approval and absorption and ratification by a status quo that he was awed by and terrified of even if he recognized its evil and so he pursued it with a mad gusto a life force that makes him you know in his own way a genius. This trump is and that led him towards absorbing every status ever because since the end since so as a young man powered by this desire where do you go where do you go to make it in the world you go to college and when he went to college he absorbed college he absorbed it like galactus absorbing a planet at like a molecular level. He absorbed it like it's mores. It's this because he's like oh. This is how you get ahead. These are the values you hold to get ahead. This is the operating system that you move from to get ahead and then he embodying them move forward and of course over time that stands in for what being a progressive means because those are the people who are progressives not of not.

They're not all sociopaths and unnecessary maniacs like obama. They have souls but they also have false consciousness and so they adhere to him because they have like an emotional connection that is not substantiated by like his real con his real position in the in the in the global. exploito sphere but him at the center. He's fine because he knows real. Power is always elsewhere. He is happy to just circulate amongst power like a ghost I've trump has talked. I've talked about how trump acts like he's watching himself be president and he isn't president same thing with obama. He just didn't do it publicly. He did it through like this. this this literary style trump does it 140 characters at a time. Tr obama does it with these impress someone and that is the essence of the democratic ideology as it exists that suffuses everyone who went to college and came out with a political idea whatever it is not everyone holds it the same. Not everyone is obama for god's sakes and there are people of good will a part of that hell. I'm part of it so you can't be completely tainted if you are then stop listening to me completely and sure maybe you think that's okay. It's fine but let me just try to express this for the love of god and so their values are obama embodied by obama's life and now by the politics that he created in. In the in the in.

The the void of the two post 2008 crisis when we vaporize the economy again and had to refound it and we've created just this quantum economy of pure cash injection of pure liquidity adhering to formations of capital that already exist in order essentially to to just exchange for its own sake to pass briefcases back and forth at the end of the global production line. That's what they're there for the president doesn't have anything to do with that so it becomes how do you approach the presidency just as for us held hostage. In this machine. We don't feel like we can do anything about how do we come to terms with this world. We're in and for obama it is by you know being the most he that he can be like we all are trying to do and that's how and that was his presidency is it created this identity that was creating its antithesis in the non-college. I wouldn't say not college educated because a lot of them are college educated not college housebroken people. The people who the majority of them certainly in 2016 less so in 2020 but in 2016 his base was people who went to college were in that middle strata but instead of absorbing college like obama did rejecting it at some level not completely not completely like all these republicans who voted against trump. This time they adhere to the stuff at the base about the norm's meaning stuff and democracy being a real thing and that one man would vote like they do believe that stuff. They just step they stop believing once you get higher than that to like well. Racism is real and there's responsibility and you know rawlsy and no things are the way they are. There's nothing you can really do about it trying to change. Things only makes them worse. You just have to try to succeed within that rubric and that's the undergirding logic of the whole thing and that's what you learn but then if you're if you're a liberal. If you have a certain sensibility. You learn on top of that well that can't change but we can make things more equitable against race and against racial oppression and against gender oppression and against class oppression which is another form of oppression and they get that gets you to liberalism that's a bunch that's like a tower babel that ends with obama's head on the top now trumpism emerging out of just like the the cultural. you know organization opposed to the thesis that obama presented in the in the collapse of the bush administration and the collapse of the economy in 2008. Obama arose as this new thesis in american politics and liberals and democrats and and socialists because how many people who were of age at the time who are now socialists who hate obama weren't in favor of voting for him at the time when he appeared. I was for bungler. I didn't see through his lies. I wasn't. I was not a child either. I was a voting age. There are a lot of people who would be like how did you get suckered by obama.

It's like well you had to be there because you had to be. There you had to have absorbed like the psychic reality. so yeah. I was an old bungler. We all thought there was something there because what else was there there was no working-class response. Working-class had been demobilized from a social point of view and the working class was scattered to the winds. It could not go here in a moment of crisis all that cohered was think it could be expressed in culture and that means college kids created this guy obama out of the sand. Like a gin and then he captured this whole demographic slice and then over the course four years. He created an antithesis. This new this this thing that started among the people who went through the machine and said okay yeah yeah yeah liberal democracy whatever whatever keeps the money flowing but no your feelings and they organized around trump and that created a eventual disdain for all the institutions that the the that the the college absorbs including the ones that are actually important structurally but over time because it's all just it's all just a performance remember. This is politics as theater it just gets sharper and more intense and by 2016 just like obama emerged almost out of nowhere to to to smite hillary and against long odds. Trump did likewise to embody this new end to business which takes all the values that you learn past the basic stuff about this is how the money works capitalism is bedrock. Capitalism is immovable the stuff that's on top of that that's negotiable because that's the stuff you need to get a job and prosper which is why people actually go to college as aggregates and not completely. I mean if you talk why people go to college.

The motivator is money that's the through line of everyone who goes all the other stuff is built on top of that and is in fact college kind of advertising itself to people. It's not just about money. It's about this other stuff too that's like saying you got new features on the latest 4x4 and so a college-educated republican reactionary still wants to make that money still is absorbed that much. But the rest of this even though it might be like the way that you negotiate changing demographic realities and the way that capitalism atomizes social bonds and has to replace them with just more market which means you have to give up prejudices of all social kinds. You'd have to give them up in exchange for money or market participation market replacing life market market decisions replacing individual decisions turning you into just a circuit yes no circuit and what you see. I think with biden getting the nomination biden got the nomination sort of this. I mean people talk about. I've talked about how trump is like louis iii napoleon louis napoleon. I'm sorry talk about how trump is like napoleon iii and like you know. He's this comic opera. presence who just bundles into history because of the inability of like the ruling class to create a politics that can facilitate their disagreements. But it's really biden because what happens with biden is you see in the political sphere.

This coalition of people some of them class conscious in the sense that they are aware that there's capitalism and they like it that way the upper middle class the strike. The successful strivers and then at the bottom end the people who think no. That stuff too we do need a revolution but are still operating from a lot of the other assumptions that they got in college that dilute their ability to organize effectively and make them kind of hostage to the democratic party the people who would say when bernie sanders shows up adhere to him and then what the what the what the what the 20 2020 primary was was a civil war basically Within this emergent you know young diverse college educated demo the one that put obama in power and then kind of lost interest especially and didn't really show up for hillary but then freaked out because trump won and there was a split you had among the successful successful which is like people under the age of 45 who have their own home. It's pete or maybe klobuchar or cory booker or something that's not a base you're not gonna win with that. Then you had but you could get a good you know but then so basically the rest of it is renters under 45 and then bernie and warren kind of split them along how are you doing otherwise are you renting but you have a decent gig are you renting. But you feel like you're participating in the creative economy in a way that is renumerative to you both spiritually and economically are you secure in a way and you sense security and do you want to maintain security.

Then you were wore it if you went through that whole rigmarole but found yourself in a declension in a social declension or which is this and and like even treading water is going downward with debt. expanding the way it is um and they went for. They went for bernie but all the time the rest of the of the voters the non-college they're just sitting here. Once the first round went and it was clear that all of the weller off we're not going to be able to stave off the lower off. They freaking panicked but what saved them is those early results in south carolina.

That said this other hunk is all for biden because it has nothing to do with this whole argument. You guys are having all the argument bernie versus warren on progressivism racism and like how do we like reparations and medicare for all. Even even like those things they are all framed as I think outside of the college bubble. As just more politics talk all of these things are um they're just passing through like gamma radiation and the only thing that's left is this guy who was there when obama was in and so why wouldn't you go with that you could get rid of trump. Why wouldn't you want to get rid of trump. This is all rational because all this stuff that's happening is mostly delusional. It's tapping around the fact that the democratic party cannot be moved and I will say that among those people I think the bernie people if things have gone differently could have maybe assembled a coalition to push over the coke machine but as it was if you don't think bernie can win and you're and you're not in that if you're observing that civil war there's nothing to make you go in for him and not go for the safe hand which is what they did and as soon as that happened you saw the big flight first happened in south carolina the the richest the night. The wellest off olds the ones who are class the most class conscious because they they live class they're for biden of course. They are and they see bernie as a and a lot of them are republicans. They don't even vote democrat that's how conservative they are. They see bernie might win. What's the safe hand to stop that it's biden and everybody played the safe hand at once and then once that happened it snapped the snap.

It broke the fantasy. It broke the fantasy politics that were pervading within the bubble that I was part of. I was in the fantasy. I was ensorced. It broke that I was like oh. At that point everybody else the question was how are they going to make a deal. Everybody had a price and we'll see how well they negotiated like.

I think if if mayor pete only gets like veterans affairs. I think he didn't do a very good job. I think he had a stronger hand than that and maybe he's just getting cocky because he's so young. He thinks he can just like go just like start. I don't know. I think he's up or he's He's dumber than everyone than he thinks he is which obviously. I highly entertain that notion you know.

I don't we'll see what the club will get because she doesn't seem like a very negotiation. She's like one of those classic people the reason she beats up. Her underlings is because she kisses ass everyone who's more powerful than her like that's why they do that because they have to express their frustration somewhere. But they're cowardly. Kiss asses literally. So she's going to take what they give her and she probably already did and warren of course is either a sucker or or a a chump. No that's a guess the same thing. I mean just she's either cynical and just got outplayed or she's She's totally earnest and is just a and then that that that like it's like they called a truce and then they subsumed under biden. The same way that the fractious bourgeois under after the 48 revolution in france were eventually subsumed by the figure of moving napoleon iii because they couldn't and oh and the constitutional republicans and the radicals and the socialists absorbed it like the plot and that and of course you might say well.

This is this proves that like you know these people. These are all the work. These are the new ruling class. No these are not real class categories. These are essentially these are skins you put on in the virtual reality battle drone of politics. They are your team jerseys when you go play like paintball. That's what they are and then you go and vote and those votes are cast and those are real elections that have real consequences but all the real consequences are not discussed. The ornamental stuff is what we actually respond to like pavlova's dogs because it's all the only voice we can hear and so now you've got this democratic coalition. The future of the democratic party unable to resolve its own contradictions because bernie because oyster that turns into a pearl or whatever it was. There was some pearls in there damn it damn it and that means that and this must be stressed. There is a reverse of this.

Politics occurring in the republican party at the exact same time because there's a lot of these college-educated republicans who come out and they still think that they are pursuing some version of the good that isn't being a pro profit maximizing goblin that is not being an instrument of capitalism. They have a sense that they are being alienated. They have that same combination of material pain and guilt that has to be put somewhere that is inculcated by the college experience and they have to express it somewhere and they find enemies and they want to fight them and as conditions get worse. The enemies are harder and harder to mistake. It is the leviathan of capitalism. That's why we see this acceleration of anti-semitism because you've got to find an alternative explanation because you're on the right remember. You still say that the hierarchy is right and I belong believe in my position in it. And I will defend it. That's you're still observing that so everything else flows from that and so you have to get into more and more like contortions to imagine that you're like defending like real culture against an encroaching global homo like united nation. John birch society. It's the exact same argument for 1954. But you have to do that to find purchase to find a reason to care about this stuff because you know everything good even at your point in the hierarchy is going away because you probably are a renter too. And if you're not you know your kids are and you're aware of precarity except at the very top where you're just making the bet of oh yeah. The people give me money give me more money and man the people. I see talking about how like donald trump was a anti-war president.

You respond to that. You say he's bombed the hell out of everybody. He escalated bombs over everybody. He's done more drone strikes in one term than obama and bush did and their response is yeah. But what what have hillary done or what do you think biden's gonna do in this moment that is indistinguishable from a liberal defending obama's drone policy because what would have mccain done the exact same ideological conditioning tool and it operates in the same way which means all that all that righteous like socially generated right-wing populist energy that people like to jack themselves off exist like this sleeping leviathan of white working class solidarity. When it gets expressed politically it gets expressed as this stupid petty fighting about who to blame for what's wrong and it'll never get to capitalism because it is entertainment because everybody involved has made the decision that even though they do believe they say they believe in things they say they have ideology and they say they're trying to fight for a better future remember.

Right wingers think this too they just have a different idea of what it is they they I just it's all a farago people will choose continuing to pleasure themselves through observing and participating in the social media. Spectacle of politics as consumer and creator then do anything that sacrifices their personal pleasure and I include myself in this and that is why anything that's going to come and break up this horrifying stalemate. This awful political situation where we have detached politics from the material completely and absorbed it like we've absorbed the internet as a replacement for real life. A real activity is going to come from outside of it and I've obviously very you know fastly you could say that means log off and it's like yes d replace time online with time doing almost anything else. I can imagine just pure that's clean your room level basic but it's. I can't think of any other word for it. That is time online is inherently alienated and you have to get that back you have to get that that that experience of being a place because you want to not because it's it's it's It's it's a distraction from something. That's because it's palliative doing something because you want to be doing it and it's never being online and then it's going to be people infusing their relationships with real like love in a way that makes it so that they can't get the pleasure.

They used to get out of this because they feel too much what's going on because our own pain can always be perspective because we can put it in perspective of what we could lose even if things get worse for us at every point of the ladder. Even if we're exploited more or alienated more and remember the rich are alienated more too in the spiritual sense. It's just that they express their alienation solely through sadism and ostentatious spectacles of waste. Because that's all they have they they have all the guilt. They have none of the pain so they have to channel it somewhere else it's the people in the middle who are caught and the only way to break out of that is to detach your libidinal package of desires which are mostly created by capitalism like as in root and branch. Like your pituitary development is like wrapped around a spectacle. A capitalist spectacle like you've turned into a cro you're turned into a cronenberg creature before you're. Even you even get hair on your balls and then you're you and then that to you is the sum total of good like we extrapolate all of our abstract ideas about what the best is what what what's good what's bad.

What love is what does that even mean we get them from our own experience of what those things mean and they are alienated even from ourselves and only by unalienating time can we unalienate our relationships and I'm not saying completely. I'm saying into a degree that can allow us to be where we want to be with who we want to be with. And when you are where you want to be and you are with people who want to be with you. That's where the magic happens baby for real baby. I know I'm sounding like jim jones right now. But I think that that's true but of course the thing that makes me not jim jones is.

I don't say the answer to this is follow me to guyana the answer to this is to be continued like that is the end like one of the things I've been trying to drive at one of the things that's made me hesitate to like write stuff down is. I've had a hard time sort of getting to a conclusion that felt meaningful that felt like it wasn't just passing the buck and I feel like just that notion of you know importing impor imparting the idea of like what is built in social spaces which includes people's places of work by definition because that is the engine of their alienation whether they have a job or not and of course. The brutal horror of this is as someone has pointed out is we're all family members. This is a nightmare and yeah. It's terrible. This is as bad as it gets in terms of just having all of the social forces like current but you gotta you gotta do it anyway you got to do it anyway.

It sucks there's no alternative is the thing we can't the thing that like brought me to the point of feeling like. I needed to just like rebuild. My mental engine is just the recognition that I cannot think myself out of this in any way in any way that will be satisfying to me spiritually and if I can't then I have to find some other place to do that because that's where I'm being like that is the engine driving me towards peace and I need to instead of ignoring it. I need to engage with it and and the pseudo spectacle of politics allows you to ignore. It allows you to find a pleasure principle closer to you than any abstract notion of a greater good that you're operating off of because there will be no emotion behind it. It will be dry. It will it will be some sort of symbolic logic and that will never transcend your lived feeling and your desire for pleasure and your desire to avoid pain iron and salt debates oh that's intriguing. I don't think I've heard of. That is this having to do with warhammer oh yes. I don't really know anything about ancient china. I should though. I mean if they're the future.

I gotta find out more about the past half of the chat is trolling the other half that doesn't seem like healthy behavior. But it's okay. This isn't either me doing. This isn't healthy behavior. None of it's healthy behavior my god. I don't want to read heidegger that sounds boring.

I feel like. I just kind of get the gist of it isn't that true with all those philosophical concepts you kind of just get the gist of them in terms of like your day-to-day reasoning. You read the books. I've read some of these books man. I folks have read the books the like the texture of the argument doesn't hold you beyond the reading of it. You end up just with like these placeholders unless you're gonna every time you're engaged with the issue stop and re-read it. You're not gonna do that so what you're really operating off of is the echo everyone's operated off of just this like echo located socially distorted version of a thing. They remember reading. The impact of a piece of reading.

A piece of work on us is a degree to which having read it changes us in our daily behaviors and patterns and outlook in a repeatable way in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop as an engine as an engine of of of presence of mindfulness as awful as that word is as and as cheapened by capitalism as it has become as all concepts are like the thing is is all the ideas we talk all the words we say you know like. When we talk about religion and politics we talk about values we talk about things like socialism or christianity. These things only have mean these as these things have a symbolic meaning and they have an emotional meaning and the more socially attenuated your existence is the less your. The meaning of like the symbols you use is grounded in an experiential an experiential communion with other people. The more they are merely symbolically or logically convincing which means that when you get into a conflict between resolving a question towards answering it or resolving a quest and therefore having to maybe do something you don't want to do and just keep having it because that's more fun even and is filling up the same psychic slot in your head towards political action and political activism and political self-fulfillment. You're gonna pick that and that includes me that's why I made a podcast because it was easier and it was more fun. It will always be more fun and easy to post and the sacrifice has to be has to come not from a logical proposition that you pose yourself.

It has to come from a place of dare. I say it love where the love is transcendent of your individual sense of consciousness where your ego has been reduced in your calculation of value. That's the john brown spirit. I'm talking about where you are. It was not the violence that he carried out that mattered really. That was a tactic. What mattered was that he was willing to sacrifice himself with actual efficacy in a way that others weren't like um. I've said this before but john brown was the synthesis of the two strains of anti-slavery. politics that emerged in the antebellum american north you had abolitionism middle-class phenomenon centered in cities like boston of doily bored rich people who saw slavery as a moral horror which boiled down to boiled down to because they're still participating in the system and they don't really challenge its ability in any meaningful way because they don't operate from any awareness that or desire to to abolish class anyway that boils down to impolite impoliteness.

It's a moral horror but but it's because it's it's gross. I'm not saying the people. These people weren't good. I'm not saying that they didn't operate out of pure hearts but like their pure hearts were wrapped around a definition of good of morality that was desacralized by the experience of being a middle-class urban urbanite and it was replaced with this abhorrence in manners now in the sa. In the in the butternut north and in the urban tenements of the of the irish. Mostly irish urban rabble there was and although less with them because they were clients of the democratic party. The the non- irish urban workers the non-catholics. The non-tammanyized ones who were like there were plenty of mechanics who were who were anti-slavery who were free soil and then of course. The almost the whole of the omen ray across. The whole northern tier were eventually as the issue became more prominent more committed to anti-slavery because they saw it as a material a material threat to their way of life a competition. A labor competition in which they were at a disadvantage and which would lead them or their children to end up in a situation where they would of course have to either be master of slave and being a small holder with no capital likely to become a slave and what this meant was that these two movements. They had different approaches to the question of opposing slavery.

 the abolitionists had a general theory of moral suasion. Like that was the garrisonian school proselytize the awfulness of slavery and eventually people will realize how horrible it is because of the power of our oratory and it will make them stop doing it and of course. They thought that and they thought it deeply but what was underneath. Even their understanding is that the real reason they didn't. They thought that is because they didn't want to get their hands dirty. They lived nice lives. They did not feel precarious. They did not feel threatened by slavery. They did not feel the daily pain of alienation of being a bank out east or or a toiling urban mechanic. They had real problems to worry about so the abstract pain of somebody else wasn't any more real to them than it was to the northern abolitionists and so their anti-slavery was basically just vote wig and then over time vote republican like vote for you so just like. I don't yeah yeah yeah.

I'm not going to do that but if there's a choice more slavery less slavery I'm going to vote less slavery let me know what else what happens then of course. This the south says oh yeah no we're going to get rid of the union. They're like oh. I guess we got to throw hands and out of that out of the war. Anti-slavery sentiment became real because the bloodshed and the experience of it actually made it real. But before that it wasn't there. What consecrated that what catalyzed that opposition to slavery which was attenuated because it was divided in a way that the southern pro-slavery aristocracy was completely undivided was john brown fusing the real pain. I mean this guy was miserable. He was he he made attempts at being a a a speculator like a lot of people did in the ohio. the the um the ohio river valley. I believe or the the western reserve and he speculated on land but he was ruined. By the 1930s 1836 panic thank you martin van buren martin van ruin more like it and he was broke the rest of his life. He was constantly hounded by debtors hounded by debtors. He was in court all the time he went to and owing everybody money he was mis. He was always on someone else's tender hook.

He was this close to thing even though he like had his own property and he had farms that he worked either like gifted to him by garrett smith or owned outright before they were taken from him. He was working for other people even in that capacity and he was always tenuous but his and so he had the rough manner and and the willingness to take questions to the extremity posed by his own suffering. He also lost he lost 11 of his 20 children. I believe in childhood or or dying before him including a number of them who were killed in his war against slavery either with him at harpers ferry beforehand in kansas fred. For example he was it was like real human like real experience consecrated his pain is and he's expressed it towards an institution that was offensive to the human spirit at a level that only he really could sense because of the wealth of his the depth of his pain and his connection of that pain to the pain of others that spiritualized understanding that the swells in boston said they had mouths but for most part at the end of the day didn't really believe because remember.

These guys weren't really christians for the most part they were unitarians. By this point they were all like emersonian transcendentalists. They were their their faith was weak tea. They did believe in the brotherhood of man but they were ideas as they are to us. Now. Like these are our predecessors and like this is the favorite class. This is the buffeted costed favored like middle strata class that's like born born up through the tides of history until now at which point the thing is capsizing. But on like on the bedrock was theirs they're wanting to preserve their comfortable position. Brown had no comfortable position so his moral horror at slavery was and his religious horror slavery was a live wire. It was grounded to a well of real pain that was connected to him and his family and his the people. He loved the most and that drove him to break a stalemate that was always being settled on the side of slavery because the slavers wanted it more.

They were on the precipice of winning the the kansas battle because they wanted it more because they had a unified working class that as whole and a social order that did away with any of the niceties surrounding this is an issue either by because it's there is no social opposition to it at least in wherever plantar economies were hegemonic. They were hegemonic in the creation of the entire social order around them and the alienation of the small heart holder of the south. The white smallholder of the south was as ideologically ensnared as it was in the north just towards the planter position and there was no real opposition like uni. like southern unionism didn't even really like cohere until very late in the sectional crisis because it didn't seem like it was really going to happen until that point and john brown was the one one northerner who was willing to put the bet down and say I am willing to sacrifice this. This might not work because the reason the north kept backing down is because the only way to win was to risk and why risk because nobody's really that concerned like even the nor nor they're not opposition to slavery in in like you know the the non-middle-class spear was um was firming up but you know you could also let things go. John brown wasn't going to let anything go and the violence all flowed from that and you can question the tactical necessity of.

It but you cannot question the morality. It's more moral than anything any of us have ever done and I think even tactically you got to say it worked. You know they hang him in 1959. Within two years. The guy who sentenced him to hang was in a federal jail after having been taken off the css trent trying to go to negotiate with the british. The world can turn upside down but you're not going to live to see it and or in realistic terms because we're not in that moment we're not in that apocalyptic moment. We're at the very basic level of like building even you know like the the rudiments of a social consciousness to to operate out of So there's no need for that kind of thing.

There. It does know need to be a willingness to sacrifice in terms of just letting go of some possibility for personal selfish pleasure which is always going to be more more real. And I'm I'm as implicated by this as anyone and I hope that I can find a place to put that energy and feel like I'm doing something with it but yeah. I mean I'm certainly not blaming anybody for not doing it and certainly not now when we are literally all being told to unless you're being compelled by the market to run around like a gerbil and a habitrail delivering things to people or risking your life staffing grocery stores and stuff you got to stay home so nobody has any position to do anything other than just be compelled either to ignore things by distracting oneself or just being distracted by the brutal reality of having to you know work. 15-hour shifts or whatever the people have to do now um and the degree to which we can. Distract. Ourselves is the degree of which we're not going to feel that enough to push out of ourselves and that's why logging off is the first and most important step all comes back to this as banal as it is. It's like the hope is that with each circuit like you intensify the feeling around the thought so that that when you think it you think it more powerfully than you thought it before you're amplifying you're like charging it with psychic energy. You're you're you're in sorcering it. You're giving the word or the phrase an actual like psychic energy and that happens through repeated like reaffirmations of the truth of it and the necessity for it.

That's what. I think. I'm doing with these. I hope it's having some echoing effect on those who listen. But I don't know obviously. All of my reasonings related to my life are filtered through the same thing and as much as I say that I'm trying to build a sense of love that goes beyond myself. I am certainly not there. I certainly struggle with the desire to just listen to the fully structured.

I mean. I went a long time operating on autopilot that way and so I'm still I'm bucking a lot of programming and so all my reasoning. This way might very well be like and yeah yeah yeah. But you know what right now you really can't do anything but I gotta say right now. I really don't know what I can do like as in there's a virus going but one of these days this thing's gonna stop and I hope that the people we have used this time wisely is I guess what I would say is that we have used this time if we have it and a lot of people don't and that's terrible. But if you have it use it wisely whatever that means cannot be prescribed because at that point you're just operating off of some flimsy rickety. Ideological construct that's really just designed to like improve your take position in the clautosphere. It's not placed on anything more than just motivated reasoning and selfishness but if anybody I mean.

I have not used my time. I've used my time better than I could have in the worst case. I certainly know it hasn't been as good but that's okay it's finding. It's just knowing that you're trying. It's knowing what you're trying. It's just not letting it run on autopilot because that's the danger it just sucks time away from you and that time doesn't just go away that time is alienated and that time that alienation has to be recouped. Somewhere that pain has to be vented somewhere and the more you're there. The more you're going to want to stay there to keep venting it because that's the only other way you can do it. And if you are working use the time at work wisely once again what that means you're there. I'm not there. I couldn't mug. I know.

This is all commodified pablum. I know then this is david foster wallace style faux self-deprecation as a rhetorical turn. Yes what about it did. It make sense because the standpoint at the end of the day cannot be attained. Anyone interacting with any text cannot attain. The standpoint of the person who present through who expressed it which means they'll never be able to weigh their heart against a feather as they go into an anubis's lair so yeah. It's a. It's a very tough place to find yourself at any end of this. It's very alienating. I mean it's literally alienating it's accelerating alienation. It's because. I really do feel like every like not just talk about labor. I feel like every hour spent online as a concept like when I say online. I mean social media. I mean not all cases of gaming or or watching films but most of them definitely all uses of it for pornography. None of this is sin. None of this is evil all of this is necessary but that amount of time that can be defended to it is so elastic.

There's so much stretch in those genes that if you just let it go long enough you will find yourself lost and I have I've been lost doing that basically my whole life and I agree I look back and I'm like man so many places. I made mistakes so maybe where could. I have been if. I'd done x y or z differently. But the thing that I remind myself is that I'm only here because all that happened and I have no idea what the would have occurred what kind of catastrophes could have intervened how. I would have responded to the stochastic terror of life in a body and all that time is alienated and it it makes us unhappy because it's not what we want to be doing and like I'm saying that's alienation is at the base you're not doing what you want to be doing and of course. What is want but we're. I think that want is so deformed that even doing what you think you want to be doing is not doing what you want to be doing. If that makes sense and I think come on that makes sense right because what you want to be doing is just programming. It's just it's just the options presented to you.

Here's the one you want. It's like when they gave the they gave the different magazine covers to eric trump and he got to pick one. That's what his job at the trump news magazine and they go and we really like this one and they put it towards him. He goes that's the one and then that is what we want. I was like yeah. We want it. We want it no one's. I'm not going to deny anybody's lived experience. But we want it as consolation. We want it as soporific. We want it as balm for an underlying injury which is unaddressed and going unaddressed continues to suffer separate and weep pus and that has to be expressed somewhere and one way it can be is to turn all of those bad feelings into into spectaclized amusement and in politics. This is where it all comes together in politics the inflictment of pain the vicarious infliction of pain on others. People that are responsible for why things are bad things are bad. They cannot be changed because we cannot change them because we cannot operate out of anything other than self-interest. We are the homo economicus that the fancy talk all the guys making us feel bad about just being kings about making that money all you just nagging little. It up and of course the democratic. The broad democratic response is no it's race. It's you racist misogynist male white male demons you yacubian monsters. You are the ones who poisoned the garden not eve and so we will array our politics around using this machinery of state that is dishing out. The misery of neoliberalism at an accelerating rate is going to try to direct it towards our enemies that will be the sum of politics until it is interrupted from below and from without and from within as people like opt out and burst away from this thing.

I have not read corey robin's book on clarence. Thomas. I have to say I am a big fan of corey robbins just want us because someone mentioned him. I think one of the very few legacy left establishment media people who understood the trump era at all. They just people seem to just like people who have a real grasp of every moment until that just like his his election short circuit their brain rick. Pearlstein is an example of this. His books are great reagan lands fantastic. He put in oh you know what he did. He got that greg gumbo he got that culture or he got that culture over there. Oh you know that culture is good oh yeah. He got that list of all that my book of the month club main selections there. Oh you're gonna slap your mama. That's some good stuff right there. Oh. What's that oh yeah put that over here he's got them politics oh yeah you got that nixon in there you got that reagan oh yeah you got that those guys at those conventions causing all that ruckus oh that's good. But what's this he gonna bring some political economy in there. Oh my god. This stew is off the chain slap your mama but he just like even though he wrote stuff like reading up to trump about like yeah. This is this thing's a whole giant marketing level marketing scheme and it's a bunch of people ripping each other off and that's the whole core of it. Trump shows up and it's just like he fritzed out like he was fretting about like how we were going to have war in the streets on election day. It's like do you not get that this whole thing is transactional. This thing is too transactional to allow for an ideological contest. These guys are all just selling each other time shares you just can't apply it because he was too enthralled to the drama of the norm breaking he was too invested with the norms. Corey robbins seems like he was like yeah. No.

I get this because like obviously the reactionary mind is on point. I think largely there's stuff you might quibble with but I think his generals. His general turn is very accurate and then his his diagnosis of trump has been very good and like his main emphasis has been that like trump as policymaker is basically powerless and was the entire presidency and that was always true and if his policymaker is powerless. Then all the questions about him being a fascist and his agenda are essentially ornamental because even if he was he couldn't do anything about it and that I think that like first principle for him. I think it allowed him to not get carried away with a lot of nonsense that got other people carried away because they didn't have that grounding of yeah. No these guys are these guys are all scout scamming each other and and his whole thing about like seeing trump as a disjunctive president. The way that like carter was and predicting very early on that he wouldn't get reelected that I think sort of fell apart towards the end of the term with the covet and everything and biden getting the nomination. I think that like a lot of that was predicated on the assumption that bernie would have emerged as like a counter as like an as a reagan style antithesis like a new nemesis to the current system like a nemesis to to like the degraded conservative. decadent conservative ruling class but then that didn't emerge and we got biden instead and so I think that the grounds the grounds are febrile now for something something more sulfurous than that to emerge. But it's not here yet and I appreciate that he doesn't go crazy trying to ring the damn bell all the time just because everyone's got a goddamn soccer on their neck and they're jacking off to this stuff. There's an auto erratic quality to all speculations of purges and coups happening and then stealing the election because if they stole the election that means that because you say what's going to stop him okay take that logic seriously why are you scared why are you worried.

What are you fretting about you literally are describing a fan accompli to the point of metaphysical certainty so what are you actually scared of. I would submit that you are not really scared of anything you're scared the way that somebody in a movie theater is scared watching the blair witch project that is what I would say and of course. People get mad at you because they'll say that you're denying their lived experience and that is one of the mystifying horrors of this current moment. This cultural turn this this like autoimmune system kick in as capitalism gets more and more extractive and and the superstructure has to find new and in impressive ways to explain it away your. Lived experience doesn't really mean anything because it is not yours you're a constitutive of an entire matrix of ideological formation that tear apart your very idea of even imagining yourself a unified being that can express a desire or have a point of view only through them. The accumulation of these things lived experience at the at the at the population level can there be grasped any sort of intelligible pattern. You filter out all the and that is what comes from mass organizing which you know that's easy to say. But it's still the only thing we're going to get and a lot of people say our a lot of arguments. Online really boil down to like how do we get that mass movement that's like yeah you can't plan your way there because these mechanisms are broken but if it emerges like. I said that's gonna that's how it's gonna emerge. We are all in fact contradictions that are resolving ourselves and that's why you're never sitting still and all that time online is not just you're. It's like it's like you're doing a you're solving a bitcoin. You're you're mining bitcoin in there you're you're mining like social bitcoin. You're getting your. You're getting your little fragment of clout that you can exchange. I'm doing it too. And I'm doing better I'm one of the winklevosses of the social bitcoin cloud but meanwhile your waiting room which is what we're doing we're hanging around in the waiting room of western civilization.

The or the waiting for like doa to get called yes corey robin. I like him indeed. I would like to read the songs book because I think clarence thomas does make sense like people. Think clarence people have a very hard time analyzing him and I think that robin's from what I've read some articles in excerpts I i broadly get him is saying like clarence. Thomas is a black nationalist clarence. Thomas is operating off of coherent political objectives and theories that arise from an acceptance of a racial pessimism and acceptance that there can be no non- multi-racial democracy. He believes that he believes like afro-pessimism but he also believes a lot of other stuff and built up together. It turns into his political ideology. His his political ideology expressed through his to his his judicial decisions and votes but yeah. I realize I'm just howard beale now yelling turn it off right before the commercial break and they bring out Josie the psychic and we do vox populi and then I get murdered by by epic maoist zoomers. I mean we could literally just do a remake with my life. If that's how it ends but honestly anything that does end it would probably be like similarly fitting and absurd yeah.

Like the thing about that that network is that you got to take it all the way and if you take it all the way all the way to like. No all of this is entertainment like everything that doesn't directly everything that doesn't directly connect to you. Your sustenance is a person your your tearing from the earth's bounty your ability to sustain yourself and your family members everything that isn't that in this social order at the end point of the conveyor belt of the global economy the big open mouth at the end of the thing homer simpson eating the donuts in hell that means it's all just pleasure because we have a baseline protect protection from the worst of full immiseration and you say yeah. But like there are so many people in this country who that's not true of correct. But they aren't part of the we. They're not part of our body politic in the way that we conceive of it. They're not participating in it because they have been let go because the way we normalize is by when horror happens we localize we cut it off and we just create a new class of people who are no longer within the continuum of our moral consideration not at the same level. Even if we feel for them we feel for them at an abstraction and a distance that we don't feel for people who are closer to us in a sense of citizenship and that's because the more we feel their pain. The more we can't distract ourselves so we have to damp it. We're not doing it on purpose. It's our spiritual sense. Our antenna are dampened out of self-protection because if we didn't if we could feel it if we could feel the real declination of people just the people around you in a city the people around you in a town. The people that make up the country that you live in the people who make up the world you live in. You would not be able to indulge in the compensatory spectacle observation and engagement that we are all doing okay. I feel like this was a breakthrough. I feel like this was a good one. I got real real down low here got to the gritty. I realize though a lot of people are going to say you sound crazy. I realize that now I know people tell me don't worry about it but I'll today right now. I'm not worried about it. I know you got to do this. Sometimes you've got to find the extension of your ability to express things in symbols and other people's ability to figure out what you mean like you need to know if you're translatable if you're operating at a level of translation. And if you're not you got to slow down. And so I i welcome the feedback certainly alright guys peace.
