Every time every time every single time no man knoweth the day or the hour. Sometimes I just gotta get on here. Regardless of the time of day. All right looks like we're good my microphone working everybody. I sound good turn that mic up oh. It is balmy. Indeed it is a the air is thick. The air is juicy. Just got finished with that uh tropical storm remnant so I will probably be sweating during the course of this video. I hope it's not too traumatic for people because I know I do a lot of it uh today. I wanted to talk sort of about a big picture thing not.


I'm not really trying to derive any practical uh advice from it. I guess. I'm not trying to like turn it into a action item. I'm just trying to like talk through something just as like a general theory for exactly why the  on all sides and I think it boils down to faith not religious faith necessarily although that's part of it in a in a different way. But the sense that no one has faith in the project and I don't think that's anyone's fault. I want to make that clear everything.

I'm going to say goes for everyone. I can think of including myself so I'm not pointing any fingers at anyone trying to just for myself and hopefully for anybody listening who wants to tell me what they think uh their response. This is my thought about it. Uh is that because of the collapse of the institutional left which is what we're living in like. I would say that technically we don't have a left in this country because we do not have the structure of one and without the structure of something in a political sense you don't really have. It. Opinions takes even organizations as long as they're not coordinating and as long as uh people are operating without any sort of as I've talked about disciplinary or coordinating mechanism in their lives. To direct their energies. There is no real structure and that's a legacy of 40 years of intentional neoliberal politics and and uh the spectaclization and the the the atomization we've talked about all this like why it's happened is not a question or why is our mystery. The reality is is that because there's no structure everyone now who is a moment where it was living through a moment of unprecedented. I would say crisis in america in terms of its long-term viability as a  project and the individual viability of any one person who isn't already wealthy to even survive. I mean my god literally.

Now they're talking about sending everybody back to school in september to just give everybody  more disease as the numbers keep going up as we're probably going to be talking about half a million dead by the end of the year and the reality of that being absolutely in the same moment and in the same reality as a world where there's no left and where the attempt to build one out of the bernie sanders campaign failed completely. Uh it's a horrifying thing and I think the way that it shapes the discourse because that's all anyone really talks about when they talk about the left is people talking because there's nothing else to really do other than protest which people have been doing but which as time has gone on the protests have grown more less confrontational and they've gotten off the front pages. I saw a tweet by someone who said none of these protests are getting attention now because they're not violent anymore. There's not an uh there's not escalation there's not rioting and that's and that's why now it's being why why the why the protests are now kind of being processed and ignored and they blame that on people taking seriously liberal admonitions against violent rioting as as counterproductive and I can see why people would think that because we're online all the time.

But I think a more more compelling materialistic explanation is that the cops kicked everyone's. Out of everybody started throwing people in jail. People started getting run over at protests and I think a lot of people as the as passions cooled a little bit as they do over time. You know  second law of thermodynamics and as that initial rush of like from being out of cooped up in the houses out into the street petered out. It was not met with a corresponding rise in organizational capacity that could allow a continued escalation with of conflict with the state to be sustained like there's no way to keep fighting the state meet uh productively. All you're gonna do is end up getting beat up and go to jail for no reason.

I mean other than to express your personal horror at the situation but you can you you're doing it without any hope that it's going to build that's going to develop. It's going to mean anything and people want their sacrifice to mean something and who wouldn't everyone does and without that possibility of sacrifice meaning. Something fewer people are willing to risk are willing to sacrifice and that's totally understandable and reasonable. That's way that's that's what else are. They supposed to do and that that tide pulling back is because of the lack of organizational capacity. So that's like the actual material reason that people don't have faith in the project because their efforts cannot be put to use. But what that means the reality of that the reality of that general sense of hopelessness even among people who are suffering wildly and are wildly radicalized is that when we try to do politics in a mindset of hopelessness not a conscious mindset mind you. I think a a deeper awareness of futility uh. It means that we instinctively filter politics not through the lens of effectiveness of action but through personal pleasure uh because there is a like the fundamental leftist.

Uh project of recognizing the common good the idea that we all share an interest in replacing capitalism with a system that is not exploitative that common interest is abstract whereas our specific concrete desires are real to us. They're realer anyway we feel them more. They're there every moment we don't have to conjure them they're there and so if we're committed to politics committed to being political but we've kind of already ruled out uh efficacy as the main thing to be focused on. We are going to then go to personal pleasure as the thing to focus on and once again that's not unpredictable or something you can really blame people for what else are they supposed to do because effective political action one no one really knows what it is and two whatever it is. It's probably going to be in some respect boring or uh tedious or hard and why would you want to do something that is tedious or difficult if it's not going to accomplish anything. On the other hand. You could approach politics libidinally as a as a zone of a personal identity formation as a way to gain social prestige and as a way to satisfy your emotional rage. I mean like so much so many people are so  pissed and have every right to be and who privileged their ability to express that anger on someone somewhere. And I think that's a lot of the cancer culture desire. It's like don't take away my ability to yell at famous people who are  because I'm mad at them and why shouldn't I be and there's no response to that. Because yeah.


Of course they suck and and your life sucks and their life is great and they're whining about getting canceled. Of course you want to yell at them. Now the thing is though that's not going to accomplish anything and as I've said like the one-two justification for cancel culture is one um you know. It's people. It's response. It's people getting uh. It's it's it's speech having uh consequences but also no one ever gets canceled well that means there are no consequences and that means it's just for personal satisfaction of the person doing the doing the owning and that's what the whole the whole box the whole the the skinner box of of internet politics. It's just a libidinal sink. It's it's. It's politics is personal pleasure and I think that that is not the fault of the pmc or uh woke capital or anything.

It is the inevitable result of living in a world without hope. You can recognize the horror of the world around you and recognize the bad guys. But if you don't really think that there's anything that you can do to have any hope of changing it. Then you're gonna look for other things to make your life more bearable because it's getting more unbearable every day and it's that lack of it's that lack of uh any real belief in in progress. I think that's at the root of every dysfunction that gets teased out at every level. I mean there are people my god who have decided that they're going to create some sort of post-marxist theory that rep that redefines class and says classes are not about a relationship to a means of production. It's about I i guess a cultural affect or having gone to college. That's what real class is now because those those people are the ones who direct the culture. The discord and you've got people willing to just throw a key marxist concept out of the window so that they can stay online so that because they can fight the pmc online they can joust with the pmc online. They can drag them and so they've decided that actually these are the real rulers of the world. This is the real ruling class because they're the ones who I can actually yell at they're the ones that I can have an effect on or even in my mind imagine so and that's because there is no effective action that anyone feels like they can take so they're going to take the action that is most satisfying most personally satisfying.

So one level of the lack of faith is just the fact that nobody has any real investment in a project that they think is gonna make anything better but there's a deeper problem too and this one is is uh. I think another one that's endemic to post-modern capitalist culture writ large nothing having to do with politics or uh or anything. It's that it's that we in the west. I would say broadly and more and more over the world as capitalism conquers as capitalism becomes the only language of meaning uh have been conditioned to in the absence of god because god is dead. Nietzsche is right about that 19th century boom blown away done for like obviously people still believe in god but there's doubt now that didn't used to be there at least more of it and it leaves it. It's essentially we killed god but we left the devil because now it's hard for anyone. It's a struggle for anyone to invest supernatural uh to invest real belief in a supernatural future.

If they have gone if they have a basic understanding of science you know uh. It's harder and harder you can do it but it's harder it's a struggle. It's more of a struggle than it used to be uh and like that was inevitable. You know like we built. These gods in ignorance and now we're less ignorant and they don't make sense anymore like that's supposed to happen. But the problem is is that when you abolish the infinite as as if you abolish like a realm of infinite where a spiritual realm where you can imagine yourself then you have two choices.

You can either realize that the self is actually not any different than anything else in the universe and it's essentially an illusion and that it can be overcome or you worship the self as god you redefine god as your own sense perception identity and desires and wouldn't you know it that is actually what we ended up building out of the rubble of the old religious traditions because what other engine does capitalism have other than personal the satisfaction of personal desires and so now we have a genuine conflict within every person in america. At least who is trying to build a left political praxis in that their commitment to a general well-being is in direct conflict with their individual desires and of course they're going to privilege their individual desires. The only thing there's only two things that can make that equation flip.

One is if you do like annihilate your ego which is very difficult. I haven't done it that's for  sure it's a it's a it's a it's a process uh and and a lot of people. Most people are never even going to come to the point of realizing that that should even be a goal of their lives uh and the other is finding something to believe in as a project as in believe in its efficacy and effectiveness or at the very least to believe in your individual uh that you are individually playing a role in it moving forward and I think those things are intertwined and I think that the moment is demanding a new left organization a new left structure and also honestly a new spiritual understanding like the like. The the personal ego satisfaction that is built that is encoded in the dna of uh of our social order like stripped of everything life liberty pursuit of happiness. All those things are defined by personal ego satisfaction through the market but that has to be that's that's that's exhaust. I mean we're seeing it exhausted in front of us.


I mean what what are all those videos of people freaking out melting down about having to wear a mask. What was all the people wait uh protesting about not being able to go to chili's. It's our our about the bounds of our lives have gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. Our our zone of actual autonomy is getting smaller and smaller. All we have are our desires which are mediated and which are essentially handed to us by a culture and if we can't satisfy those desires. Then we don't have freedom. We don't have individuality. We aren't the beings that we thought we were and being able to be that has become harder and harder to do and trying to do. It is turning into  suicide. It is now literally suicidal to try to assert yourself in the marketplace. The way that we've been taught is the sum total of human so we've reached a point where this these things are no longer tenable at any level. Like the economy is obviously basically uh uh examinated and the there's a virus that is physically preventing people. At least some people people who are not deluded enough to just ignore the reality from engaging in those self-building activities of satisfaction and in the left we have seen among leftists. I guess I should say since. I don't think the left is real.

We have seen a this this uh libidinal indulgence replacing any kind of group project. Everyone is in it to satisfy their pleasure and they could and a lot of people will say no. I want everything to be better I want I want things to be better what are you talking about pleasure. But one of those things that creates pleasure is being seen as good by others imagining oneself to be good better than the system that they're in imagining oneself not to be an exploiter and most importantly imagining oneself to be being seen by others as good and so that structures the discourse too it becomes like. I've talked about. It becomes an entrepreneurial war of all against all to be the best person because that's all we can seek but I think because we're at a moment of crisis and because the conditions are changing every second.

I really think that both those problems are going to uh be addressed not by me not by any project that's currently existing certainly not by anybody posting online about it uh. I think that that the the insufficiency of the current models will essentially require a darwinian sense uh a change in approach both spiritually and personally uh and and organizationally. What that's going to look like. I don't know and the real question whether it's too late uh to be affected and those are two questions the answer to which I don't know but like. I said this is not prescriptive. This is just me trying to talk through like what it seems to me to be the root of a lot of the the um. The uh pathologies uh that seem to be metastasizing and all I could do is just hope like we all have to do that that the un untenability of the moment will push us towards building some new moral system where where where that ego gratification is. Uh is subsumed uh into a understanding that the real that there is real meaning in struggle real meaning in suffering for a cause and most importantly that you get enough people who think that way all of a sudden you've got an organization that can affect change now.

I'm not saying it's going to happen magically and it's not going to happen spiritually. It's going to be a response to eruptions in the material conditions uh. But I do think that it's inevitable like I said the thing I don't know is whether it's going to be enough or enough time ugh. I gotta say that the people who want to like redefine class to be not about material conditions in relationship to means of production that is honestly it's tragic because you can see where it comes from. It comes from being terminally frustrated with the awful bad faith maelstrom of of discourse and of the the there is sort of a reifying and um and disciplining function within you know from the media to to like a generalized population of mostly college educated people online uh that that establishes like a standard of behavior and or more importantly a standard of outlook and a standard of opinions uh and then punishes people who just who disagree with them and a lot of those opinions end up insisting upon the primacy of focusing on non-material conditions.

On saying. No we can't do any socialism until we fight racism as though those are inextricable as though as though there's a way to fight racism that does not uh if those are ways to fight racism alone that will not leave the structures that recreate racial sep racial disparities that's just going to recreate itself and that's very frustrating to see and I get why people get mad at it. But not only by doing that not only are you of course committing heresy against marx. But like I mean who cares at the end of the day you know conditions changed. She died a long time ago we have to acknowledge things are different and I think that there is some sort. There is some um insight in pointing out that that there is essentially at this point a massive divide broadly between among white people. College-educated ones and non-college educated ones on questions of culture and both sides suffer are suffering from economic precarity like they're like the argument that the pmc whatever is downwardly mobile is true but that because of the difference in their conditioning their response to precarity is different. The response to college educated whites is to clean harder to wokeness as a way to fill that sense of anxiety with the at least the satisfaction of being being good and then there is a there can be an opposite response non-educa college-educated ways as conditions get worse two cling on to cultural explanations. The other way cultural demonization the other way and that that is like a mutual reinforcing process and that's bad. It's very bad and it needs to be overcome but it cannot be overcome online because uh it's not true to say.

The internet isn't real life because obviously people learn how to behave from watching other people online and then they take it offline and then that impacts the way that they relate to people in the real world. It impacts what activism they do it impacts the way that they approach their lives. It's real but it is an after effect it is epiphenomenon. It is it is um epiphenomenal. It is superstructure and what that means more than anything is that you can't change it. There you can't change it at the level of discourse. There's no amount of posting zero amount of posting that can change anything because while it reinforces existing structures it is not generative. The structures are generated and so by redefining class to be about whether you went to college and determining that that means that oh good I get to stay online all day to argue with these people well you've seeded the field and like. I said I understand why because there's no other alternative and that feels good even if it feels bad. It feels good you know like everybody gets mad getting mad that's the flip side of being happy. Uh there's a book about college football rivalries and I think it's called to hate like this is to be happy forever. I think is the name of it and I can't think of a better name for a book about the internet and the other thing the other problem with that. I mean for one thing you're doomed you've neutered yourself. You've decided I'm going to stay staring at the wall with the flickering flames in the cave because it's it's more recognizable to me. It's not scary and it has a reward system in place that I know how to gain um. The other problem is if you dismiss uh the means of production as the an orientation towards the means of production as as the thing that that determines class well that means that cultural concepts like nation and race and ethnicity and religion. These things that are understood properly as generated by capitalism become independent and become real and I don't see any way that there is a unified working-class movement that operates under those assumptions that those things are real that those things are more real anyway than in relationship to the means of production not do it.


I'm not sweating. I'm sweating a little bit but not too bad. How are you guys doing uh. Oh that reminds me the so like. I said. I don't know what the future is gonna hold i. I do think that there is I mean inevitably going to be some formation that arises to to resist what's happening just because you know people people get that up there's no guarantee. It's going to be effective like. I said and there's no guarantee that the uh the most hopeful combination of that is going to be the most dominant because there's plenty of reaction and there's plenty of um sort of useless public. Uh ego driven displays to be done and those are still going to happen you know. Uh. It's a question of getting into a critical mass but I think that I mean to sound boring about it. It's going to be at the workplace it's going to be at the level of the workplace and specifically. I think you've got a real possibility here in this coming school year with the police with with the with the trump administration insisting to reopen schools because you cannot reopen the economy and have people not have child care uh so but you have these the significant pushback from teachers and uh you know we've seen. Teacher. Militancy is is relatively high compared to other sectors of the economy so that could be something another thing. I think could be very is very potentially uh.

Fruitful is uh the big box retail economies that's it because one. Uh that's the closest thing in our service. Driven economy to a shop floor anymore right like obviously there's still manufacturing done in this country but it is largely a service. Economy and retail big boxes are the closest thing to to a shop floor in the sense that you've got a huge number of people who work near one another uh which is very much not the case in most other service industry uh environments and also they're crucial nodes in the distribution network. They're they're they're critical to our just-in-time delivery process. So they fit a lot of the potential um um oh and I would add to that obvious obviously amazon fulfillment centers. I mean they're not technically retail but they are part of the service industry and they also have that factory element that shop floor element and you're seeing militancy at all those places and if there is any kind of coordination at that level. Then I think you might have the seeds for something that could become a genuine point of uh escalating conflict with the existing order uh and that's why I think if you work at a big box store you should obviously not get fired by for talking about unions but you should be aware you should keep your head up. You should have your antenna pinged about the possibilities for labor organizing there. Uh if you don't have a job and you need one and they're hiring. I mean that's a place where you could actually work. I mean obviously work sucks and nobody wants to do it. But if you need to do it. You could do it in a place where politics could also be part of your daily life in your in your in your employment which most people don't have and those are the kind of things that clarify the stakes that raise awareness of the possibility of effective action and most importantly could decenter the ego. So there are there are existing nodes of potential resistance uh but they're not where we think they are.

They're sure  not having anything to do with cancel culture. Uh. And until the uh I mean until the police reform or abolition movement has a organizational backbone to it. It's not going to be there either. I've seen. A lot of people insist that that the protests have been affected because public opinion is changing but what good what use is public opinion if nobody has anything to do with their views like especially I mean for one thing when you say uh you know. X number of people are now in favor of what police abolition or whatever you want to call it. I doubt that you could get those people in a room and have them agree upon what they mean by those terms for one thing and secondly even if they did uh. They wouldn't have anything to do what vote for democrats is that is that the hope they're going to vote for joe biden. I mean I'm not saying that those that the movement should stop or anything or that people should if there's if there's a protest not go to one. I mean I'm still going but there has to be an awareness that organizational capacity has to be the the priority because absent that it all just it's just a cup of water getting poured out onto a  concrete. It's just. It's energy wasted and if you're seeing like uh there there are concessions being made. You know bought by different municipal police departments and that's good. But it's also a moment to stop and think well who's still in charge you know and who's and if if if the people in charge are mollifying you if the people in charge feel like they have diffused detention with with their uh reforms then they're just going to end up uh being recaptured by the systems of coercion and the thing is like some cities are doing. Stuff like seattle apparently is saying they're going to cut a bunch of their cops but I mean you have to it's weird. How people simultaneously will you know be be say. We're demanding radical action. We're we're insisting on abolition not reform blah blah and and because we understand we're dealing with you know capital exploitation system that needs to be overthrown. But it's still the same. It's still the same politicians in charge who are doing this. They haven't changed.

They're. They're responding to pressure now. But the nature of pressure is that unless it's organized to be systemic. It goes away momentum dissipates. It's like I've amazon's saying we're not going to sell uh facial recognition software to the cops. For one year. I mean you could say the same thing about a lot of these uh budgets cuts and reforms unless unless the actual structure of incentives for the political order changes or the actual political order itself is overthrown. These the all these reforms will then be will have their holes filled with with more coercion and more exploitation because that's all the system is I love to fill my reform holes. It's great all reform holes filled uh the wayfarer thing. Uh is very funny because it just shows in my opinion just the the the destabilizing nature of online. I mean this thing started on tick tock right with teenagers and they saw some kids saw like look. These are really expensive and look. They have the names of this and they just went oh. They're shipping them in these containers. Now that's insane that's insane thing to even think for a second. I mean it could happen but there are so many levels of analysis. You would have to do to make that the most likely outcome like you know so many different. Uh you'd have to use. Occam's rate you'd have to use  nub to get to yeah. No. They're shipping people in uh very expensive cupboards named after the people the kids who are in them but the instantaneous the instantaneousness of twitter means that that those are or the internet in general means that those questions are never asked. There is just a thing that's happening now and then you respond to the thing that's happening you don't have time to think about it and more importantly. You have no way to investigate it because how are you supposed to trust anything. How are you supposed to trust what anyone is saying about anything uh and so you it basically comes down to are you psychically. In a position to absorb the thing in front of you are you positioned culturally to when a a conspiracy is presented to you to just say okay that's true and if you are that's the end you're done.

I don't know what the deal is with the wafer thing. I mean maybe it is what they say it is. It's just like. I said. I would need a hell of a lot. I need to go through a hell of a lot of theories and disprove those before. I got to that one and the one. I keep seeing is people saying it's just algorithmic. Uh it's it's it's an algorithmic website and I think there's something to that. That's. I think that's also part of all those weird remember those weird uh. Uh videos that were on youtube for kids of like peppa pig getting her teeth pulled out or something and everyone's freaking out about how it's like some sort of cult programming operation and maybe part of it is but a lot of it is is. Those things are all made by computers and most the views are computers. The most the bots are watching. Videos made by algorithms and humans are literally getting squeezed out of the internet and we're just watching computers interact with each other. Watching. Machine learning take place in front of us and of course that's terrifying and alienating and it also leads us to project human shapes and structures and narratives to things like looking at a cloud and seeing a chariot because the thing about like because think about all the the things being named after uh people who've been abducted first of all. Why would you like you wouldn't do that you wouldn't do that. I mean it's just basic opsec. You wouldn't do that secondly apparently that that those names and  terms to put on things they're just scraping and so hey wait a minute. Here's the girl who got abducted and here's a name for her that must be mean. She's in there first glance that makes sense. But it's it's just as much uh that process of of of in putting on a human skin to a essentially random uh arrangement of of information uh that'll that happens all the time and it's only gonna happen more and more and more as we are observing less and less and less actual human content.

I do like that apparently one of the q people actually bought one of the cabinets which I i really I really can't wait to find out what happens there. I I hope. I mean. I'm sure they will keep people in the loop. What else why else would you do it if not for posts. But I really want to know what happens if there's a kid in there well. I will admit. I was wrong in other someone says. In other words.


We're going to go insane. I mean going to go. That's actually you could say that that's uh optimistic to say we're going to go because I think a case could be made that functionally we no longer relate to the real world which would make us by some definitions. All of us insane when you consider the degree to which we we live in an abstracted symbolic order. Compared to the amount of time. We spent wrangling with the real that you could say oh not. The real with the capital are not the lacanian real like material reality. The kind that has been the dot the domain of humans since the beginning of human existence and now we are living purely or largely at a symbolic abstraction level where we glide between ideas effortlessly and frictionlessly and are never forced to apply the the the the um the lathe of like material reality to them. Other people's opinions uh just time and space as constraints that we're able to do unconstrained uh association between symbols and symbolic orders and we do that more than we do anything else.

I mean maybe that that's just technologically induced schizophrenia and that's another thing honestly though. I think that's another thing that's pushing us to the point of unsustainability of this another thing that's making this continue. This may this this current uh order of of radical ego satisfaction in a fully simulated reality in which material conditions are collapsing in front of us. It's just not sustainable and uh obviously you could say that forever and then die having never seen the moment of friction break happen and that could happen. This thing could leap on for who knows how long but it won't limp on forever and I think the way to go through a day knowing that and not get too. Depressed and too hopeless is to know that we'll get there eventually at some point and if we don't how are you gonna ever know. How are any of us ever gonna know. None of us are gonna see socialism in our lifetimes so let me but we still have to live our lives and that's where destroying that ego part because I think a lot of the thing that makes people so miserable about politics is that that horror of knowing they're never going to probably ever see anything you'd be better. They're never going to experience things being better. They're never going to actually get to live the life of a post-capitalist uh subject and that is a bummer uh but at the same time it's irrelevant because you still hit you're still here. We're all still here and we have to live every day and I think the degree to which we live it for each other and not live it for a personal gratification is the degree that we can handle that total ego death yeah.

We gotta do that we gotta we gotta do it. But the thing is you can't tell people to do it and that's why like all the trad cats and people think we just need to like reinforce christianity as as as a hegemonic. Uh uh spirituality or something are absurd that's it that it's putting the toothpaste back in the tube. It's going to have to be a new thing. It's going to have to synthesize the concepts of pluralism and science and all of the all of the lived realities that permeate our relationships to one another you cannot you you you turn this into a some sort of matthew walter catholic theocracy. People are going to be  miserable even the catholics. I mean my god the catholics the countries in europe for example that had the most hegemonic catholicism. The ones where they didn't have a bunch of immigrants showing up and messing things up. They didn't have um. They didn't have hollywood triple parentheses using their cultural marxism on people. Uh then none of them believe in god ireland until like 20 years ago ireland was a theocratic plantation. It was a priest ruled bog and now none of those  people believe in god you cannot impose it. It has to rise organically for people coming to an awareness and then seeing that awareness reaffirmed in their relationships to each other.

Because the market is is the market is is its tendrils are everywhere and it's the thing that guarantees that your your precious little trad cath concept will be overwhelmed unless you abolish uh the market relationship and guess what you cannot do that from a sectarian perspective. Catholic sectarians aren't going to overthrow capitalism. White nationalists aren't going to overthrow capitalism because you need the you need. The people numbers are the only thing capital has everything else. They have our  brains in the form of our value system. They have the information networks they have. They have the capital they have. They have the military they have the police. All we have are numbers and any movement that says we're going to get there by radically proscribing through morality or skin. Color or ethnicity is doomed because you will eventually have to make it make a devil's bargain with capitalism because it cannot be defeated by a sect. I do think they should nationalize passive income absolutely national our uh nationalized passive income and also uh. This is one thing I agree with bakunin about abolishing inheritance.

The beauty thing is you could actually do like a judo flip on libertarians of course. It won't matter because they don't really believe what they say they believe. But if you wanted to just win an argument with libertarian. You could point out that all the things they say about about the market relationship. The equal relationship that exists between an employer and employee how it's. It's. It's a fair. Uh it's a fair negotiation between selling labor power buying it all. Their perceptions only exist without concentrated wealth and debt more than anything determining the power structure within those negotiations the only way to prevent that is to mow the lawn every generation every every new uh group of people you do not get your dad's  money or your mom's money. You don't get it no debt and no wealth accumulated. You can accumulate. I mean obviously there's a difference between reform and abolishing capitalism. But uh if you even wanted to make capitalism even vaguely use vaguely akin to its um theoretical function. You would have to abolish those things and the fact that that's uh that's absurd. The fact that those things that would actually make capitalism work are essentially not viable getting rid of passive income yeah. That'll work. They're gonna stop that uh getting rid of inheritance. The fact that those are non-negotiable means that capitalism has to be overthrown.

Someone says uh if you're gonna be buddhist doesn't that mean  it. No it doesn't because if you aren't living for yourself you're living for other people you're living you're living you're living loving kindness for all and in my mind anyway that means creating the conditions for everyone to reach that point and you cannot if you are deprived. If you lived a deprived existence you will probably it'll be very difficult for you especially in a western context to ever even occur to you to uh to abolish the ego or desire because you've never had it fulfilled and you spend your life seeking and craving and and striving and being thwarted and then building your personality around your inability to have your desires fulfilled and then of course they're the people the rich people who get their desires filled and when they do that drives that they're miserable as well that drives them to a different sort of misery. It's obviously more bearable but it is. It's the same spiritual deadness and the only way that any of that is going to be overcome is if you make so that rich people aren't able to get everything they want and poor. People are able to get enough to  breath and look around uh what books am I reading.


I've got um. I just got an advanced copy of reagan land the fourth rick pearlstein book which I'm very excited about. I'm 100 pages in uh. It's very good uh and it's basically he's clearly setting up. It's about the the carter administration uh and I think that that is. I'm excited because that's such an under studied era and under talked about era. I think because carter really was the guy who codified the uh bipartisan neoliberal consensus before reagan. Reagan was just the kind of the capstone on it and one thing I think is really interesting is that pearlstein talks in the early parts of the book about how uh you know carter came into office. He won the election closer than people thought it was going to be. But he came in with a with a comfortable super majority in the house and senate uh and almost immediately ran into ground because the conservative movement which a lot of people a lot of liberals thought was dead after uh ford lost and after reagan was defeated at the convention before that uh were able to rally resistance to carter along the axis of social issues uh gay marriage or uh gay rights and uh and the era and things like that and what I think is so funny is that you look you read that and you you read these. These guys who use those social discontents to power reagan into the white house and none of that stuff has stopped none of the things that they fought for none of the social change that they wanted to prevent has stopped. It kept going uh because reagan never really gave a  about it and none of the none of the actual um.

Functionaries of government really care about social issues because that's not what their job is. Their job is to maintain capital flows and capital capitalist control and more importantly they don't have power to change that those are all cultural responses to change in material conditions which is why fixating on culture from either end of it is futile because it doesn't reach down. It comes up from you're pushing against the current but anyway I'm looking forward to reading more of it. It's pretty good. It's been a while since. I've read any science fiction. I'm thinking of finally reading gene wolfe. A lot of people have been recommending gene wolfe to me and I've never read him before so I might check it out after I finish nixon land or reagan land. Rather. It's also true of democrats. It's true both parties. They don't really care. I mean it democrats get to get credit or blame for the fact that that uh social liberalism keeps uh accelerating. But it's not because of them. It's not because of the republicans uh. It's it's because of the social uh the social base.

It's atomization social base and the thing is that part of that is good because the the the traditionalism of the pre-seventies era was too stultifying and it had to be rearranged and it still needs to be rearranged. And that's why I can't accept any notion of traditionalism as some sort of uh uh banner because it's sorry. It's un-dialectical. Like the these these relationships have changed and we have to deal with the fact that they're different now now that doesn't mean that you uh the pro. The thing is though is that that doesn't mean that you create litmus tests and you say if you're not if you're if you're not fully on board with the entire gamut of social change as we believe it uh to mean right at this moment and by the way it'll be different in two weeks and if you aren't up on that difference then you're. Then too uh if it's not this running tally of uh if you haven't like passed the gauntlet of wokeness then you're not in the club.

I don't think that that's the answer and the thing is. I don't think most people care about that that much that uh people of good faith anyway uh. I think there's a boogeyman built up like how many people are obsessed with like keeping tucker carlson out of the left who the  because there is no like the idea of alliance with like the populist right. There is no populist right either there's just like there's no left there's no anybody. There's just people and and you're talking about leaders guys who have tv shows or politicians. They don't speak for anyone. They're not connected to any kind of uh organization that can that can bring people in. You can only say maybe the people who they like will like me now. And it's just it's. It's it's coke and pepsi. It's branding because there's no structure yeah.

People don't care about this stuff. It's all hot house fantasy because people want to fight. They want to slay demons uh online either are they either uh are the awoken the woke peace. Uh pmc uh propagandists or the the the strasserites and and it's fun doing that it's slippingly satisfying. But it doesn't do anything because these people don't represent anyone. No one represents anybody but themselves and that's why I think that whatever's coming is going to have to come with a radical break because of how exhausted and um uh stalemated. Everything is at the rhetorical level yeah that's right look at me drinking glas water with one hand spicy.


I like spicy mustard. I also like brown mustard on them on a brat honestly the I like the thick grain mustard best of all stone ground that's the stuff really good for abroad rich ooh the american tabloid movie dream casting that's tough somebody said joe berenthal could be pete bondurant. I think I could buy that I don't know everyone seems like a pipsqueak. Now all actors are like they're just little they're little guys. I don't buy any of them as any of those dudes do. I realize that 90 of what I'm saying applies to france.

It applies to every western every country to some extent because it's all part of the market but but more intensely in places where capitalism has been uh been hegemonic longer. So us most of all because we're the lead we're the or the bleeding edge of it. Uh. But also of course uh of course france and of course uh france more than any most other people in uh europe because as I said france is the america of europe you know. It's ass heinz ketchup wow we got the trolls out in force. Today. Someone bad-mouthing heinz ketchup the ideal condiment wow sad finding out. There are people who don't like heinz ketchup. That's a shocker but you know what taste is subjective and it doesn't really matter so everyone can enjoy their inferior ketchups. More hinds for me france is like the u.s and someone asks is it because they think people love them honestly yeah. That's a big part of it.

It's the thing that I think is american about france is just the the the uh the nauseating self-regard of their culture which I think that's why we're not the uk. Even though we're anglophone because the british are self-loathing and we are not uh and the same thing with the french. They love themselves and they love their country and they think that they they think they invented democracy. We think we did uh both of us think that's like we can look around now and act like that's anything to  celebrate um yeah yeah. They are nationalists in a very similar way that we are even of course ours is much more violent and that's that's the frontier baby that's the that's that free real estate. That's that's the settler colonial part which france doesn't have as much of all right. This is the last thing I'm going to say before I wrap up someone's asking about and this is the this is the sa. Scary thing is that somebody asks do. I think that you know as things get worse revolution's gonna be inevitable and I gotta say not at all because there's. I think a faith that a lot of people have and I think that undergirds a lot of assumptions and i.

I feel this way sometimes too and I kind of catch myself that as things get worse people are going to come to some sort of realization about the system they live under but I don't think there's any reason to assume that that's going to happen absent the social conditions that like the marxist conception of class consciousness arising is that people compare notes like peop. People in a factory are in a working class neighborhood. They have a they have a common experience of exploitation that they can discuss. They have a social relationship to one another that leads them to a realization. We all are siloed off in our individual mind units uh with our personally curated feeds and algorithmically generated content that give us individualized responses to our lives including its their conditions and their immiserations and that leads us to a lot of bad conclusions like they're shipping children in the mail in giant cabinets and when things get worse there's no guarantee that uh that we're going to change that heuristic we're only probably going to double down on it because nothing's intervening with us to make us not think that this is the way things are that our explanation for reality is not the correct one. That's that social dimension that makes that happen and that's why I'm saying the hope is into things like teacher strike or big box retail.

I think is a real big one amazon headquarters because to this day nothing has replaced and in fact everything is only displaced and made worse the the radicalizing empowering positive feedback loop of of the workplace as center of social uh conflict and radicalization and I know that that sucks because people are all working temp jobs where they don't even see a co-worker all day or they're working from home or they don't have a job at all and that's a huge huge percentage of the population and the question is well what about me uh and that's a hard one to answer. The hope is that enough of those people enough people who don't have a social relationship to labor uh that they can see people who do and get the and take the right uh. Lessons from that take uh and that's that's where the dice get rolled that's where that's where we enter the multiverse and uh we find out which which timeline we're in and I don't know. I don't know kind of got. This truck going but all we can do in the meantime is keep our powder dry so dry up your powder. Everybody dry up your. Powder bye-bye.
