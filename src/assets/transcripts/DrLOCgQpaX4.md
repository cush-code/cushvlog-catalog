Ah ah there we are ah hello everyone roll and roll and roll and roll and what we're a roll and roll and roll and roll and what one day limp Biskit will answer for 911. I hope I'm in the cosmic plane if not on this one. Eventually there will be some reckoning for the irresponsible role they had and calling down the cosmic forces that led to 9/11 and then the war Iraq and the war on terror. Hey guys. It's a very rainy. Today. It's the tropical depression or whatever today is the day it finally happened. It's been very annoying. Cuz I never know how to plan my stuff and what to do and because I'm always waiting for the rain to come in it has not come and now it's finally happening. It's raining.

But this weekend is gonna be nice. They say which is bad news for the NYPD. We'll be out. There don't know where yet but we will see. But I want to keep doing the streams and when it gets nice again as I promised girls stream incoming but right now. It's literally raining at the moment and I was thinking since.

This feels for me anyway like a moment that service to spend many time in this moment of tumultuous shifts. Not inside. It's raining time to do what I like to do best which is look backward. So I was figuring instead of commenting on what's happening right now and it anyway specifically look we're starting off with some sort of dissertation. On the events of the day of the week. I was thinking that maybe we could talk in history. Historical parallels. Moments moments that rhyme as George Lucas would say moments that people want to talk about so I'm gonna start sort of by asking anybody on the stream anybody in the comment section and wants to drop a question. What questions do they have and I'll see if I could answer them or at least talk through them and around them about historical moments that that they find resonant in the current moment. Let's see what I got.

I won't be able to talk about all these of course because that's not. I don't know that much about that much 1848. It's the first one someone says in 1848 is a good one to start with because 1848 was a very similar situation in that it was the unplanned spontaneous explosion of a long simmering resentment and dissatisfaction around a very sudden and dramatic shift in material conditions in two ways. One you had the rise of industrial capitalism which was driving people to miserable conditions and cities and also even more importantly because at this point there's still work that many industrial capital workers there weren't that many laborers yet as a percentage of the population in cities they created competition and conflict with the dwindling and under siege artisan class and then so you had this shift in the mode of production and the way people work very similar to the way it was sort of the first rung on the ladder of of coercive rearrangement of working conditions because before the mid-1800s there was so much land in common that there was always a ability to all else failed subside subsist on the land which gave you bargaining power in any specific job that was greater than the ability of the of the boss to get you to work for them if they weren't paying you enough you could say off and grow. Terps of course enclosure acts all that we all know that was gone by the a by the mid eighteen hundreds. So people were being forced into labor arrangements and wage relationships and that the artisan class the the individual self-employed manufacturer which was sort of a legacy of feudalism. It was still a prevalent employment in cities but it was very precarious is the thing and there were a lot of very poor artisans. Late there were the poor artisans drove the French Revolution. There were still plenty of poor artisans and cities throughout Europe in 1848 but then even the rich artisans were were in conflict with the state over the shift towards free markets away from industrial from local protectionism and the dropping of tariffs that made home crafts less less competitive in the market and so there was this pressure on people to behave to to to work in different ways to be more coerced into labor to have less control over their own working lives.

Parenthetically people always like to talk about well what because so much of our understanding of politics because of neoliberalism and capitalist ideology shaping our responses. Even our alienation from it we tend to go to standpoint a lot when we talk about ideas and so obviously people want to talk about podcasters on the Left. What are you you're not working class especially if you're making a decent amount of money from it and it's like no not podcaster suspect specifically. Anyway US podcasters like us who work who get money from directly from their listeners were artisans. We are we are those like the guy making making like stockings in this house. Like that's us. It's it's it's a pre capitalist mode of production and that's still embedded. So even now that's still embedded within capitalism because nothing is totalizing but anyway there was this push away from that self that degree of alien of control over one's work. But even if you weren't making money even if you were poor.

You saw a control of your own working conditions which is means you were less alienated than somebody who had to work in a factory at the direction of somebody else. But you were being pushed in that direction. People are being pushed in that direction so you just the way now after that has been totalized after wage labor became totalized under capitalism. Eventually though the deal broke down where the initial deal of okay you'll work for me and that'll be it and you I will be your employer and we a direct relationship employer employee and then after the rise of rigging that's okay and maybe you'll have a labor union or something or you'll be a manager and you'll have more control of your life well after the seventies crisis after the terminal decline of capitalism after it became harder and harder to bring profits out of old business models all of a sudden they wanted you to not work directly for anyone. They wanted people to all be contractors being hired for specific jobs that require that involves and suggests no extended relationship. No duty between the two or only one one duty in one way you you owe your employer your surplus labor and that's it your labor power. That's it that's all you other and they don't owe you anything at least in in the American sort of labor capitalist treaty for the the day top that happened after World War two and that persisted and was never let down by labor.

By the way it was only let down by capital slowly and behind their backs. There was a relationship. There is an implied responsibility of an employer but that cost money and now they're kind of squeezed that out of the economy every job basically made since the economic collapse of 2008 has been some sort of short time part-time or gig job. That's almost all of them not even exaggerating that you can look it up that you are literally reproducing one type of employment with another that is even more alienated and more threat there and more precarious than the one before it which is the same pressure that was operating in 1848. But at the same time you have that instead of it just being that like if that is a company economic growth that serves smooth smooth it away because it pains you back. It's like yeah yeah. You're more alienated now but you also make more money and there's more stuff to buy and there's a general rise and you know living standards and Happiness and you kind of be buoyed up and it's okay that you're being alienated more from control of your workplace or control of your labor hours. But in 1848 there had been a prolonged sustained continent-wide agricultural crisis the potato famine that people remember from Ireland did not just affect Ireland. It affect the entire it affected the entire continent of Europe and it essentially decimated peasant ability to to live all throughout the continent. But in addition to that they were all. It was also severely cold harsh summers because this was the tail end of the Little Ice Age and they and there was huge failures of crops all throughout the staple crop fields of Europe which of course caused in the cities massive.

Rises and costs of everything specifically foodstuffs then that meant that poor people couldn't eat and wealthier people were spending more of their money on food. Everybody was pissed off so you're gaining you're losing control of your workplace and you're not even getting any money for it. You're betting paid money that is worth less because you have to spend more of it on the food that you could you have to eat no matter what that's an inelastic good and now what do we see. Now. We see this exact same slow motion and serf rien surfman t' going along with the collapse of the economy. Literally all those gig jobs not even existing anymore and so what happens a spark lights off a explosion of resentment that is seen by others and it's spread Strava cockman. Now of course you wouldn't have to guess where the more revolutions of 1848 started. They had to start in the place that was continental Europe's first revolutionary crucible. I mean this is this is why history is so great you know like if you read about the French Revolution. I mean you say okay so that happened and then there was a continent-wide reaction and then loui got.

The Bourbons got reinstalled and then you could ask that person all right then 1848 later on if they didn't know anything about Europeans who you know in 1848. Things pop off again where do you think it started where did it start last time France the most populous country a country that was not developing economically with the insane speed of the UK and that did not have the UK's imperial resources to fall neither am. I feeling all the worst effects of change and very little of the benefits boom and annaroo in a tradition of of successful revolutionary action. You've got to go out the streets more likely to go on the streets if it you know it's worked. I mean that's I think why so many people are paralyzed now and so many people want to go to the computer to find a reason not to go out and not to support not even to even not even support the demonstrations because you don't to be disappointed and you look at that you going oh like look at the record of these things. They don't work so this isn't gonna work either but of course that depends on how many people are involved and how people respond to change to the conditions and the reactions of the state and things like that so in France well. The reasons revolutions kept working one of the reasons.

They were so effective one of the reasons the way they were able to Rio for the Bourbons after they were installed and then overthrow. The early artists was because they knew going out worked and so they went out more and they were more likely to do it and more likely to stay out and so everybody in Europe saw the flames rise in Paris and what do you know everywhere people were pissed. They threw up the goddamn barricades but because it was a spontaneous route for a volt that had no coordination that was essentially carried out by the same act. The same class of people everywhere but everywhere but distinctly separated meant that there was no unified purpose behind it so in France. The main art demands were for the overthrow of of the orally honest and the installation of a republic and then the right to work for industrial workers which included artisans who were not being engaged for labour and in depressed economy in the German cities. It was those things but more importantly than any of them the thing that they thought was necessary to get any of them a journal a unified German state now we might look back on that and say you know what you guys really you actually need to look back on your math someone up big time because you know God love him everybody thought that was a good idea at the time even Marx but looking back ooh unifying Germans turns out not to be a great idea. There's a little too much blood and thunder in that line. I don't know I think it's something about the language. The language has this sort of I don't know there's a there's a mystic bloody mindedness to German. It's almost compound words.

They should be separated is all I'm saying the like the bishoprics and stuff and the Prince touches those that was again elected. Type II. You know margrave's and land graves and fiefdom with you know individual royal families and duchies and and Archbishop's all of whom were reactionary. All of whom had commanded greater or lesser degrees of absolutist control over their populations unite under one enlightened constitutional monarch and the thing is is they weren't wrong in seeing that as a worthwhile goal the same way that the United States now in a similar situation is wildly hindered by wildly hindered by federalism wildly hit them because I mean I we don't have to say worry about the unified cuz. We're already there and we're already doing you know we're already doing a terrible job. But like there it's clear at this point that the states aren't helping anything so and by the way I'm not being a linguistic determinism is or idealism.

Languages are the way they are because of the surroundings the actual environment that the people who develop the languages existed in so they are an imprint from a specific physical moment in space and time. So that's what they're carrying with it. The language is just a marker and a reinforcer of it and over time it gains power we as the original conditions are less and less there to reinforce they reinforce on their own but they said they they have an effect okay. There. Nothing is a simple base superstructure. These ideas are not as simple as they appear because they are also at a certain point. They become reinforcing feedback loops that require one another and that if one wasn't there it wouldn't have operate the same way but anyway you need aliy. They wanted Italian unification in the US in the in the Austrian Empire. Those sort of the rump remnant of the Holy Roman Empire that wasn't totally severed by Napoleon. They the individual nationalities wanted their own God and they wanted their own places. The Hungarians wanted their own country. The the Bohemians wanted their own country and so all of these revolts happened without really any coordination. They forced the hands of their governments.

They were there was an initial capitulation and then eventually reactionary forces just waited for one thing for the urban middle class to sell out the workers which they did very quickly because they weren't as interested in a social revolution. They wanted just political reforms to reflect the Enlightenment values that had become pervading in the middle classes and then once the working class has sort of been demobilized by disillusionment and all that was left were essentially the students and some of the wealthier artisans. They rolled them up and so there's plenty of reason to see parallels between 1980 and 48 and now the same spontaneity the same lack of a coherent organizing principle. But I think there are also significant differences and one of them is that nationalism at least the way that it affected those conflicts is no longer relevant and in this era I think the closest thing you could say would hold the place for nationalism as in a thing that is within the movement of a movement. That is that is potentially a conflict point is race and but the good the good news is is that all of these different revolts that happen in Europe.

Their geographic location discretely is what reproduced their separation. You know you had the Czechs in Prague. You had the Hungarians and Budapest. You know you had the Romans and the Italians in Rome and Florence and stuff and so that they were separated literally by geography and so coordination was rendered impossible as and because those real goals were also either. Sometimes we're in conflict with one another or were totally irrelevant to one another. Like for example the Hungarians wanted a independent Hungarian state but there is also an overwhelming demand for Hungarian to be the the presiding language of Hungary. But the problem is Hungary was also multinational and there are a bunch of Croat sand and Serbs in the territory of Hungary Moldovans who didn't want to speak Hungarian and so that created a civil war within the was in the war itself. But in this case that that racial divide is reproduced inside every city and inside every movement which means that if it's going to be resolved it can be resolved at the actual point of contact which is a very good sign. Yes.

The chrome apps are actually the ones who rolled up the Hungarian Revolution ban yellow cheek shout-out to him. I saw a statue of him and when I was in Croatia a five-star pimp if ever there was one because it's because if that is why class is so important and that's why economic issues are important. If anyone wants to win because think about the crow hats right. The crow hats were also subjects of the austria austrian empire. They want there wasn't it there was crashing nationalism. There was a sense of Croatian identity but also they were part. They were under the subsequent heel of the Hungarians. So when the Hungarians say we want to be independent of Austria. We want an independent Hungarian speaking country. What is their appeal to the crow hats to get them to instead of taking the orders of the of the emperor and crushing them uniting with them. What do they give a in fact that's directly in conflict with their desires.

There has to be something that can commonly unify everyone who is in a position of oppression to push together and that requires empathy but it also requires self-interest because they should not and don't have to be at odds. They can and must in fact be together. Self-interest and and altruism need to be unified. One of the big problems with the fact that so much of the left is wealthy and operates from a sense of morality is that for wealthier people the reverse is true. In fact they don't feel that they are operating politically unless they are operating selflessly. Their morals require self-abnegation to operate because they have money because they're not oppressed and so to the degree that they run things. This is degree to which they're not going to be necessarily interested in alleviating anything not only one at the material level because they benefit from the arrangement but two from the psychic level that they develop they. They derive their sense of good conscience from the fact that they are that they give their money for people who don't have it and that they vote for people who will take money from them for people who don't have it or whatever or they care about issues that affect other people. That's what makes them good. And that is I mean you can have people like that following the train as the as the lower push will always will but they can't be in charge so that is why if we have any hope right. Now it is that this movement coalescence around issues of radical redistribution and I really do feel like I don't agree with anyone who says that oh this has a key idea Paulo over it. Therefore it can't work that's idealism. That's that's what happens when you spend all your time online. Everything exists is these frictionless categories that never interact and they're totally polarized because you're engaging exclusively in an anti dialectical polarizing diet dialogue with one another that you say oh. It's got the icky stuff on it. It's therefore if you can't be good. That is that is the delusional idealism of online argumentation.

If these things will be resolved they will be resolved on the ground and as much as anything else. The challenge is the pervading order I mean are you gonna tell me that policing is not a significant part of the global capitalist order and yes of course the danger exists. The a danger of course exists that this all ends with the police being defunded and it just means that Bezos builds Robocop or something or that there's a black water of the streets obviously that's a possibility but that was going to happen anyway. We're on the slide. For that. This might accelerate it but it's also the only thing that can interrupt the constant. The prospect that could interrupt the the inexorable movement towards that inevitability you're not saying anything by saying oh a bad thing could happen because of this no. Bad things are basically all that happened the question is do you look at the thing in front of you.

The thing that actually emerged from these actual conditions as opposed to something you imagine might can emerge in conditions that aren't real they're in your head. Then I don't know what if I could tell you because that's the only thing that's gonna stop. This. That's the only thing that's gonna interdict this Avalanche and if if it does end with defunded police but funded up in the future that's always what it is the idea that there is some victory you can have that is untainted and complete. That's insane that that's literally that's millenarianism. That's that's that's eschatological utopian madness and it's only possible because you're thinking of these things as discrete battles you're thinking of everything is a discrete event that is unconnected to reality because that's how you can think about something you have to disentangle it from its context right or else you can't look at it.

Otherwise it's embedded but in real life everything is embedded and so you can't know until you find out so you have to find out sorry. But you have to there's no way. You can reason yourself into saying that I'm gonna stay behind the computer because if you are you're looking for a reason to stay behind the computer and that means that you don't actually care about politics. You care about being on the computer and talking about politics is one of the things that makes it fun to be on the computer so ask yourself that look yourself in the mirror and say do. I really care about any of this political stuff or do I really like basically because I don't know what else to do with my time. I don't have a thing that I can invest in that will die if any promise will give me back any psychic pleasure. This is the thing I know makes me feel good and I know that like politics is like one of it like I just eating it you from a big internet stew every day and it's different seasonings and so like the salt and pepper are politics and video games and the the the garlic is is pornography well. This actually the broth is pornography who are we kidding and essentially I like I like this I like this delicious pozole or whatever it is and and and one of the things that gives a taste is the emotional zing I get from arguing about politics and if that wasn't there the soup wouldn't taste is good.

I wouldn't want to eat as much of it and since I don't have anything else to eat. Then I want my soup to taste as good as possible and that might be that's a lot of people and the thing is that's okay. I don't blame anyone for that. I am NOT trying to make having political opinions the sum total of someone's morality that is what the internet tells you to do. I don't judge anyone for that. I don't judge anyone for trying to cope with this world. However they can but don't think that you're doing politics at the end of the day you're seasoning your goddamn soup. And if you're okay with that that's okay but don't lie to yourself because it'll only make it harder for you. You'll only be more miserable but maybe you're not maybe you like being miserable. Maybe you're a sicko and of. Course this applies to everybody everyone's eating the soup when they're on the Internet just a question of how much time are you spending eating the soup I of course love eating the soup. That's the reason I love politics because it's the delicious zing because it gives me a sense of purpose and and I virtue and identity and and and discernment. But I also know that it is not a meal.

It's a fantasy meal to get way too involved with the metaphor. So the question is how real is it to you and it will be to a degree commitment is to by degree. But there are also those inflection points and if you have decided I'm going to ignore condemn or mock from a position of superiority and superior knowledge. This uprising or whatever it is then you have made that choice you have the Internet is the the that's your entire. Foodstuff is that is the chunky soup of the Internet and that you really love those you love that politics you love them well you get that in there oh you get that politics in there in that gumbo Oh Mon Ami oh ma after you right now you like my gumbo that's fine. But if I put that politics in that gumbo oh my lord Oh Mon Ami you gonna slap your mama cause.

She fall for Tromp alright so that was 1848. Anybody got another one was 1917 I believe they meant a function of revolutionary success or the weakness of the regime. I think it's pretty clear that the Russian Revolution succeeded because the fact that Russia was not a modern state like the creation of a modern economy doesn't only create alienation the way Marx saw it. It also creates accommodation and in co-optation within a system over time and I think that's nothing again are estimated just because he was not allowed to see it carry out. It's one of those things where you can't even say he was wrong. You can just say he lived at a place in time and then he wasn't alive anymore. That's not a criticism. It's just an observation but Russia even though it had the appearances and a lot of the capacity of a modern state in its real self was not. It was a medieval.

It was a medieval society that had had the 20th century drop in a slap in the form of the Eastern Front and that meant that it was much easier to overcome resistance because resistance was essentially just coming from a inbred royal family and a small layer of civil servants and everybody else was either a small number of workers and then a bunch of disinterested - alienated peasantry. That's not that's not that doesn't describe any contemporary culture. Any contemporary society somebody asked about the Iranian Revolution that waning revolution is always a really good warning call for the left because it is often forgotten but that was originally a popular uprising that involved a lot of leadership from the urban left-wing the Communist Party and like radical students and that over time they slowly were removed from power isolated and then eventually massacred by the Islamists headed by LeMay so keep your head on a swivel ah the Easter Rising. The Easter Rising is a lot like John Brown's raid in that it's a good reminder for people who fixate on the efficacy of action. Now you don't want to do things that might backfire worse. But I think a lot of people talk themselves into thinking that they support things. They oppose things because they think the backlash will be worse than doing nothing. But a lot of it boils down to.

They don't want to risk their lives for something that's not going to succeed or doesn't have a chance to succeed and I think both John Brown's raid and the Issa rising were conceived by men who did not expect them to work. They did not in both I mean Patrick Pearse said as much he said that what is required was a blood sacrifice I mean of course. He said that he was a Catholic mystic psycho whistled on his way to the exit to the firing squad. But they accept but they were also a recognition is that only some sort of dramatic interaction with the status quo was going to shake the the the stalemate open and break out of an unsustainably of a morally unsustainable situation and they were both right. They all died but they were they were all right because within ten years of both of those acts there was a free Ireland. Although obviously it was still part of the Commonwealth but it was on its way to being free.

The Queen wasn't on the money more and slavery was abolished and so those actions which it would have required to lose true delusion to think would have succeeded John Brown going into the woods to successfully roll up an entire revolutionary battalion that would I guess America. The northerners would just decide to like jump in halfway through and help him out or that that the that the the seizure of the post office and estate Stephen's Green was going to kick the Brits out of Ireland after five hundred years but what they were gonna do is they were gonna. They were gonna change things and honestly the guy who I respect the most obviously for doing that was Connolly because Patrick Pearse was he was born wanting to die.

He was a Catholic psycho. He was a blood. He was like the worst kind of lay of of like Mel Gibson's style mortification fetishist the kind of the kind of Catholic for whom life is discussed as a vile and should be scorned and fled from us so of course. He whistled to the harp but he knew that his people could be that he knew he couldn't stand to just live an entire life watching as a giant Magdalene laundry. Whoo this is a bummer did entering the nuclear age of mass destruction in 1945 create a permit technological steady-state that human determination may never be able to overcome. I wouldn't say if that's true it wouldn't just be the nuclear bomb I would say would be the nuclear bomb.

The combustion engine and the Internet together might have done that but here's the thing it might have done that. But we can't know it has any more than we know we live in a simulation right because it won't it could only be validated in retrospectively. We can't know so just like with the that's the question of if we're in a simulation you have to act as though you aren't because it's the only option so you have to act as though we can overcome technology. We have to act that way even if we can just like we have to act like we aren't the matrix even if we are because there is no alternative and that isn't even being snarky. It's a function of being a human yeah exactly nobody's the quids a cataract. The internet makes people think that they are because it gives that illusion of total total information because if you if you really in interrogated people they would admit sure I know that I don't really know anything. I just know what the internet tells me but you nobody acts that way. People do not act like that people act like they have been able to glean enough of the real the real terrain of reality to to grasp like the nettle of truth and see backwards and forwards through the prism of history.

You can't you can't do it. None of you can and if people say they can they are literal frauds. They are charlatans but that doesn't mean you can't act you have to act but that has to be that only comes from reacting with the world. It cannot be which casts through the internet. It cannot be reasoned with so many people online basically played both sides of a chess match and then say ok. This is what's gonna happen. No you have to play the opponent on the action in an actual match. You can't assume what their moves are gonna be and that's how people act on when they talk like if somebody says oh. It's just gonna end with rubble cops everywhere they have played the chess match ahead and have decided how everyone's gonna move. They might trust that that's true but you're a sucker if you do. I'll tell you that sundae's saying marx did what I'm talking about yeah. Marx is one of the most one of the singular geniuses in human history. He's a top time Brent all-time brain you're not. I'm not you can't assume you are he could do that because because he had the commitment to it. Then because he got enough reinforcement from the world around him to make him think he was on the right track that he was able to doing all that lamp on covered in pustules you haven't eaten in a week you got to write another letter two.

Cruising the web and you're not even doing the work are you in the freeze that you're looking at posts. I've read 10,000 posts that doesn't make you marks and it's not just because he was smarter than you. It's because he was willing to suffer. He was willing to do things that weren't fun to get there. You're only doing fun things you're eating candy for dinner. We're all eating candy for dinner on here did you if you could do this if the meager outcome of your posts and your ideas about politics could sustain you in a in an attic without air conditioning and writing for ten hours at a time under lamp light or whatever then okay I would like to see what you've written. But if you're doing it in the comfort of a life that it's otherwise so alienated it's the only way you can even find meaning. Then I bet their dog sorry because marks did not do what we did because he did not have a computer. He did not have any air conditioning. You don't have a checking account. I mean you didn't have a credit card. These things mean things are different like the conditions of life changed. The thoughts changed that the the vocabulary so direct comparison across time is impossible and of course.

The the to cloak is your on the internet right now and it's like you got me. I'm scared I'm just one guy I have to measure my commitment against my designer to maintain my comfort and I'm probably and I definitely wanting I'm wanting of where I would want to be ideally as we all are. But I have to actually look at it. I can't I can't go in here. I can't dive in here to try to escape from that feeling because to quote the Bible. The wicked flee would none pursue it. You're gonna chase yourself across the internet to try to escape from that feeling and eventually you're gonna have to act in order to deal with it or you're.

Gonna have to further delusion like delude yourself all right so anybody else to another historical question. Here am I man I try not to be mad anymore. Actually you know when I get mad like this. I'm really not talking to anybody on the Internet. I'm really yelling it past me. I'm yelling up the me who wasted a lot of time trying to do all the things I'm describing and just gotten felt worse and worse over time. So that's why I'm like oh god you. Idiot that's really what it comes down to so. I'm not really mad at anybody but me. But the thing is I have to forgive myself and everyone has to forgive themselves too because if you're too filled with self-loathing you can't you can't do anything. I am NOT a finished Civil War buff I didn't know such a thing existed. I wonder if they have reenactments that'd be funny. I don't think of my Satori moment is wearing off. I think it's being reinforced at every point Mexicans Pearlstein. I've said Pearlstein doesn't like me. He just doesn't like the show because we're rude to his friends.

I mean that's been and he's like he is constitutionally a liberal. He has a lot of faith in America's political institutions which is honest because he is a political historian. Like he doesn't really do. He doesn't really do material analysis. Like when he talked. He talks about Nixon and it's almost entirely in the context of Watergate and stuff and very little about Bretton Woods system breaking down and and you know in his book about Reagan and not a lot about not a lot about Volcker and stuff. It's all kind of just seasoning. So he has a lot more faith in like political processes determining outcomes so that you know and that means that he's really good at writing about him because he does the work and he's got the nuanced understanding and and he's done the research so their volleys they're very fun to read and they they'll teach you a lot about how public politics functions but not really integrated into like a broader material analysis and that's fine that's how most people are. Most people are only gonna get a partial partial description of any historical process. I mean my god of course so they're very useful to that end. But I think that because of that he doesn't like our rudeness and he also he's a guy who gets published in a lot of the magazines whose writers we have made fun of and who get mad at us and have blocked us on Twitter and probably have complained to him at parties about us and he probably was like oh like why are these people so truculent so that's too bad Veon Zapata man that was something Mexican Revolution. There's actually a book by that name being spotted by a Frank by Frank O'Neill. I think it's pretty good I read it when I was a kid I mean the revolutionary dynamics of the 60s failed due to their class character.

More than anything I mean it was a middle class uprising of middle class students. People who literally didn't even have jobs yet people weren't even integrated they hadn't even been got pop bought off with like professional jobs or whatever. At that point they were exogenously the economy so that's bad I mean. The problem now is is that there's a similar exhaustion II here just because there's less necessary work being done. As we now see. I mean you can if you can have 20 30 % of the population stopped working overnight and things just keep moving then that does undermine the ability to to strike capitalism. At vulnerable points.

She caused it to potentially stop functioning ah abolition of police unions okay now that's interesting because yeah. I think a police abolition. I do think is kind of childish. I understand why people feel the need to to have it as a as a it's a totem but realistically it's obviously not the beginning of any real demands. Police unions are different but at the same time it's difficult to say everyone in America should get you know collective bargaining except one group of people like I said on the show before I think maybe radically limiting what unions can negotiate on would be good like I said not allowing them to to resist something like residency requirement or civilian oversight or taking their guns away. I still know community-based policing is man. I still all this stuff when he it ends up like boiling down to either its cat music like banging pots and pans in front of somebody's front room for littering or or I don't know what I think you we have not yet reestablished enough of a communal relationship with each other to allow that kind of thing to do anything other than eventually be alienated and abrogated two specific groups of people and then you're back to having the cops you have to recreate a social fabric for anything like that to work.

It emerges from a new social fabric. It isn't it isn't. It doesn't create one out of whole cloth. I would say it doesn't cover my shooting negotiation where broadly because a lot of those things aren't things that other unions care about like the postal workers union don't care about getting able to carry guns or whether or not there's civilian that there's some sort of oversight for them were there for that for if they did something fireable. It's just what they would do for fire ability is different. They don't have a right to kill people programs like Cohen tell pearl and MKULTRA never ended. What are they doing now. That's something I've thought a lot about and it's scary to consider I don't know I mean that's the big what if like what if this all cuz we talked about this on queueing on me and well. There was an article in the Atlantic by the woman who when she was a teenager believed in Illuminati stuff and now doesn't and she has this paragraph where she acknowledges yeah. There were things like MKULTRA and whatever but but the thing is she never talks about what happened at the end of any of those they get found out years later.

Nobody ever gets put in jail. No none of the agencies to carry them out stop being funded. Nobody gets more accountable so why would anything change. We get this mantasy of like the fact that it was discovered ten years after it happened through. A limited hangout means that that it was stopped I don't know I like thinking about that because that's another one where if they really did perfect-perfect the gumbo. Then we're all dancing to their puppet tune and we ceased to be to even have a delusion of independence or even our free. Will was compromised beyond beyond reckoning beyond saving but same thing with everything else you have to assume you can only operate from the assumption that's not true and every point. It's like yeah. This sucks it sucks not knowing but it's the not knowing that makes you act. It's. It's the not knowing that that pushes you through the doorway because you have to make a leap of faith. That's that's where human consciousness emerges from Kyary.

Do I actually believe in free will free will is absolute in the subjective sense. You are free completely but your actions are completely and fully determined. It's just that that doesn't matter because you don't know how you can't see everything that is leading you to your decision. You can only sense even vaguely a few of the almost infinite specific and specific and events and encounters and and influences that led you to make a decision. You can only your only vaguely aware of a handful so that means that that ignorant is the degree to which you operate from freewill because you don't know why you're doing what you're doing you don't know why you're doing what you're doing. So you have to so you you can't use that as the way to do the next thing because you are ignorant of too much of it that doesn't matter but that also doesn't change the fact that outside of you subjectively as if your entire actions charted with a full understanding of the influences of what any of them know they were a hundred percent completely determined no free will at all but none of that means anything it has no influence on the subjective reality of free will. It's both the the girl in the Taco Bell that the girl in the ll old El Paso commercial so why not both girl is one of the great sages of human history because both basically all of the binary questions that have the deviled philosophy throughout history. The answer to all of them is both the only question is how they fit together. I mean the fact that you the fact that your body starts doing things before you even feel the fact that your body starts having starts doing things before you're even aware you're making a decision which is true means yeah of course. Free will isn't true but you don't notice that you're not there for that seven second second delay. You're floating on the top of that decision-making pile. You're you know you're hissing it with the steam out of the vents and you have to make sense of it. You have to make sense of what you're doing. You have to retroactively.

Lee makes some sort of justification for it and that is where morality comes in. That's where all of our moral physical psychic and emotional senses come in somebody says sterner I forget who it is but somebody once said to me that they think that it's very funny. That sterner was so hated by Marx and famously Marx wrote more words condemning sterner than sterner ever published himself. But butts Turner's description of humanity is is man at the end of the process that Marx sketches out man at that point is Stern errs man it's just that in under capitalism we cannot be that and we have to get out of it and that means we can't act like that either because it's not in accordance with the world around us. Why do we hate North Carolina so much I don't hate North Carolina. It's a weird question I mean anything we've ever said against the South has been a joke because people from the South keep bugging us to tour there.

Although less lately ah. Although I honestly at this point I would love to tour anywhere I would love to tour. I would go to the Antarctic MacMurray Research Station and do a show just to get out of here. I would definitely like to tour Canada first because it's nice and cool Trac jakub's over there. I'm not wearing it everyday. Now. I've got a little too self-conscious about it. So I don't know if I the only way I could wear it earnestly as sometimes I'm not wearing it. It's warm now and that's the other thing and I was wearing it.

When it was cooler. I will say that somebody mentions all the Confederate statues that have been pulled down. I do think that I was always a little disappointed by those protests that were fixated on removing the statues because that is literally a symbolic issue and more importantly none of the map. Very few of them actually succeeded at removing any of the statute but now with a broader a more challenging critique that actually hits it significant structures like police interactions with urban areas. Those we didn't even say anything about the Confederate stashes of course allowing that to be satisfactory is wrong but it's amazing the kind of symbolic bonuses and side effects you'll get as knock-on effects of a broader and more challenging and sustained critique of a social order. Debt. Jubilee obviously I said Michael Brooks said it on his show that I was on on Tuesday and I agree completely wholehearted. We need a jubilee all across the board debt obviously all kinds and then even the psychic debt of the internet. Although all the dead weight of our old opinions you know just so that we could shrug them off and of course oh they were gonna be liars and not banks who fraudulently get acknowledged again no no that guy's bad.

Though these people are bad they don't deserve Redemption okay. Though you they get their Jubilee. You give them the Jubilee if they're still bad and they still acted bad faith. Then you can condemn someone from a position of understanding not through not by everyone just fighting the ghost of each other. Someone said my beard is lame and they wanted to believe I mean lame is weird. It's mostly from laziness but sure fine just don't say it again. How about that see there you go absolved everybody used to said anything bad. In the past I was all of them but that makes the responsibility going forward to to honor people's faith in you for giving you the benefit of the doubt and then if you don't at that point you will be right you can be righteously rejected. Alright. This will be my last question. Someone says do you feel like people are focusing too much on the term grill pilled rather than actually what being sent on these streams. I mean to the degree that anyone is focusing on it as a as one it called - it's not caring about anything that's happening around them or as a meme then yeah. I mean that's inevitable though I mean I can't sweat it too much. I can only say what I can say and hope that some of it filters through the that separate everybody from everybody else online alright guys. I'm gonna go. But there will be a gril stream soon first a nice day you're gonna do it. I'm very excited bye bye.
