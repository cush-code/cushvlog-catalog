Soy facing like a boss hi guys here we go there. We are there are the faces smiling faces smiling faces. Sometimes they don't tell the truth smiling faces smiling faces. Sometimes hi guys ah so don't really have anything planned for today. I don't have any graphs don't worry about that just just having a chill wind down day hanging out what do you guys th. What's that what's going on. I haven't really been online. What's been the big news other than the hilarious mercenary. Mishaps of our of our friends in the deep state from the goof ups that everyone's having down in venezuela with the The danny mcbride characters who tried to grab nicholas maduro with a cartoon butterfly net we're going to do a crossover with the q anon guys next week. The q anon anonymous podcast not not the not the patriots who decode the proofs has there been a cue proof in a while it seems like the whole um. It's kind of funny because you'd think that the that the um the covet 19 thing would really go to their benefit. They'd be like oh great. We can you know. This is this is it but they had the problem that won you know. I'm not sure how much q talked about in any kind of legible way they're being you know um.

He didn't really talk about those things he didn't talk about um there being a bunch a virus or anything. So it's like hey if q is so smart. What the and then there's the fact that even though trump's president you'd think a time like a massive massive illness outbreak like this would be perfect opportunity to round up the sickos and they're not doing it. They're not rounding up the sickos so they must be very confused so. I'm looking forward to talking to those guys about what the latest what the latest attempts at parsing reality are from those people. I think that for epstein's stuff I think for anything any of the fun conspiracy stuff you should treat conspiracy. The way that you treat like one of your favorite food indulgences you know you shouldn't give up things that you really enjoy to eat. But you should eat them in moderation and certainly as part of a balanced diet that's you can apply that to media in all ways. But you can certainly apply it to the way that you construct like political reality in your head and the great thing about conspiracy stuff is that it's just even if it's not true. It's the shadow of what's really happened you know like nothing that oliver stone says about the the military-industrial complex taking over the government after the kennedy assassination is wrong. It's just a question of whether or not kennedy was actually killed by them um same thing with cia mind control.

I mean what the hell do you call this massive digital infrastructure that controls every element of our of our like symbolic language and which is basically at the beck and call only of corporate titans and the deep state intelligence agencies. How isn't that just how isn't the how do you not think of the internet. It's just like a giant ml. Mk ultra experiment you know and it's like none of that has to be literally true. But if you recognize the contours you can apply them to your real life and it makes you realize things like oh. This is not a democracy oh these institutions are not legitimized by who is who votes for who you get that truth and the like the lighter you hold and the less you indulge in like your conspiracy stuff needing to be technically true the more. It can help you contextualize information and new things that happen to you but like the cranks. The conspiracy cranks are the people who insist no no no.

This isn't just something we can speculate about. This is something that we can not only can the not then we know exactly what happened. But I am the one who actually knows what happened and those people have become too brittle in their thinking to accommodate anything else like take a guy like grover fur anybody know grover fur. Groverford is the king of the stalin apologists apologist um academic tradition. He right he's he's he's at a university in new jersey and he writes these books about how the entire cruise of secret speech was a lie that everybody who died in the um in The great purges was killed by yazov. Without stalin knowing it and um that the ukrainian famines basically didn't happen or were were grossly exaggerated and at the extent that they killed people. Stalin didn't know about it now of course he's trying to do that to justify stalin right like he's trying to get people to think. Stalin was a good guy but he's acknowledging that all this bad stuff happened well if stalin was a good leader and a good good guy to guide the the great ship of state. The great helmsman why the hell was all that bad happening like how how and it starts from. But the thing is he starts from a good premise. He starts from the premise of I'm going to defend stalin against the the the robert service robert conquest neocon slander of the soviet union and the entire bolshevik project and you should and stalin needs to be contextualized. I mean my god. I would start by pointing out. You want to cry for the holodormo how about the fact that the fat piece of who was supposed to be like the epic win bacon member of the big three winston churchill. Allowed three million people to die in bengal of starvation and yucked it up the entire time but I mean contextualize it. That's where you like try to extract the truth and like remove the sting of the slander but grover got so fixated on the question of stalin's personal virtue. As if that matters that he just like rearranged his entire project to not not even be about that anymore because he didn't because he wasn't. He didn't hold the truth loosely enough is in his hand and that's the same thing with conspiracy stuff so like yeah.

I believe the epstein stuff represents some degree of a real network of real rich pedophiles who really ritually abuse children where they do it how often they do it which ones do it. I don't know and neither does anybody else who speculates you can build up like you know the artifice of your of your instinctive faith in it through the accumulation of like meaningful details. I mean epstein is really the gift that keeps on giving in that respect. It's it's he's been dead from almost what a year almost a year now and or nine months and there's still stuff happening. That's that's spilling out about his insane connections to every element of the of the of of the of the what you got from the deep state you've got silicon valley You've got the the ngo para governments of the gates's that's also tied in with the corona virus vaccine. It's it's just a rich onion and worth up but like the whole time you don't have to you don't have to say no because if it's not true.

I'm wasting my time. It's only wasting your time if it matters whether it's true or not and then since you're trying to build an ideology and that's not like you're not serving on a jury just kind of let it hang and just find what really is convincing so you can let the stuff that you believe because of motivated reasoning fall away because then you're not convincing yourself. It's true all the time to fill in the gaps of your of your information. How would you start a mercenary company that's a good question. I I should probably get one sounds like it'd be fun. H that's funny.

Rojava is a model for post-american vulcanization. I mean that is obviously one of the better case scenarios if that were to happen um. I was thinking about the the whole like coalescing doomer wave now as we really look into the face that the government and the and and corporations are and the state is willing to just normalize 911 every day to maintain a market economy and not even like to get to permanently overthrow it and have themselves executed. No they could still manage the transition. They're just too incompetent and too brittle in their power to risk letting that happen letting it out of there letting letting it show be shown to people for even what a year that you can manage the economy without market signals so they're gonna just let everyone die. They're gonna fandom snap everybody because that's the thando snap. Sandos is the ultimate neoliberal because he's got the thanos glove and he could do anything but he is so conditioned by neoliberalism that he's like yeah. I know there's too many people not enough resources got to kill them all when you could reach for any number of changes to the material circumstances that would make it more more harmonious for people to live together.

And that's what we're not that's where we all are. I mean. They weren't enormity of our powerlessness in the face of this that's really what is freaking people out. It's just how powerless people are and how we're going to let it happen and we're going to end up blaming each other. We're going to end up feeling guilty and going to be mad at others to some degree and going to put almost none of that energy towards like resting power from these draculas and that's not any of our faults because coronavirus is like just breathtakingly symbolic creature. I mean not it comes out.

It attacks this system this late capitalist system and it basically replicates every fault line. It presses on every fault line to push things in a bad direction so like at the material level it comes to an economy. The united states that's first of all run by a corrupt cabal of of incompetent criminals and I'm not even talking about the trump administration. I'm talking about the the permanent bureaucracy and the basically semi-permanent party operatics who make up both hard parties of congress. Both both sides of the aisle obviously all the way through all three branches of guberman just topped with a little cherry of the ridiculous orange. Cheeto man so you have that and then you on top of that a economy of people working like people working tenuous precarious service industry jobs to just make up for the deficit in in or make up for the need. For consumption that americans are required for by the rest of the world to be as the consumer of last resort we got to keep eating if it piles up too much the economy falls apart you keep eating hogs keep eating well boom. Now at the at the material level you can't get service.

You can't go out. You can't go to the to the uncle. Pete's pop chops off slop trough rather You can't go down to going out of the pizza gorge and of course that just makes people who are wildly alienated and basically get only their almost all of their pleasure in life from direct physical sensation of fat carbohydrates and alcohol that's not a good combination and they have to stay home and the economy has a huge demand cycle and then you say great. This is the material conditions that should lead to a revolution right like that was the hopeful that was the hopeful pill. When this started people aren't going to put up for that but look at what the effect of the disease is just as it affects the material conditions along its weakest fault line which is the fact that it's a service economy. It attacks our political culture at its weakest fault line which is that it's wildly atomized like one of the big reasons.

That bernie failed is because the citizens do not have the motor connection between people who are have enough free time. And enough alienation to you know form a political opposition to capitalism that's coherent enough to be effective and the people who are in the communication flow to even hear that hear that or like at the level and have the level of like good faith investment in strangers on the internet. Or the government to invest any more any of their will towards it and now we're literally in a situation where we've created a caste system of people who are too busy running around i.e two materially alienate too labor alienated too busy running around risking their life to survive and everybody else stuck in their houses like veal calves to with with this vast amount of alienated um leisure time. And it's they're literally pressed against like out from each other. They are socially polarized by the actual the effect the virological effect of corona and so now you've got two forces pushing the economy into greater distress but also pushing the ability to fight back against it. Is dissipated by the pressure against people physically from even being able to talk to one another because as we've discussed internet isn't gonna do it.

We've discussed that's done it has to move to the real world and just as the real world reasserts itself. Everybody is literally behind their doors and unable to talk to each other and more and more and more invested in symbols. I mean my god they're now making like snl saturday night live a so a zoom show do you think that's going back. It's not going all the way back. None of this is going all the way back so that's why there's a lot of room for despair but like something's gonna shift. Something's gonna shift there's going to be a big old shift happening here in the coming years and the thing is because everything is so brittle and because our political system in particular is so brittle and because we spent so much time of our emotional investment in politics. Around those symbols that are most fragile like the united states and all that as a concept we forget that there's another representation of like the fragility of america and it's the size of its economy like the raw size of the american economy and the simple fact is that even with corona and even with thousands dead even with a huge demand shortfall even with great depression too with just pure neoliberalism. There is a there's like an entropic rate that that economy can like lose power unless there's some massive intervention like regret like the coronavirus turns into the black plague or you know we get nuked or something to destroy a bunch of capital. Instantly. The capital has to go there go out into the rest of the world at a certain rate. So america's decline from this point is clearly and obviously It's not even a question of whether it's going to happen. If we're in the decline phase. We are on a we are on one of those plinko board zigzaggy. Decline phases you know dude and um the thing is. This is going to bring another decline phase but at any one of those the conditions can shift enough that all of a sudden there's political friction again and you can do something so the assumption that because everything looks so brittle now even with even with bad things happening that those bad things have to be the end that those bad things mean there's no way to arrest decay that is incorrect. Also and of course. It's a liberal excuse to disengage from politics completely and let the world go to hell while you drowned yourselves and luxuries. Adam curtis a few years ago described how any compelling vision of it for a new world would require somebody something that could marry subjective mystery and scientific reality back together again. Agree disagree wow you know the funny thing is is. I would have read. I would. I didn't see that movie I'm not sure which one that is but um yeah. I know the pandemic's gonna be just the same only worse. But the thing is is that the worse is gonna cause a new alignment that might bring out a different crisis and that's the thing you gotta you gotta remember because like there still has to be a function that makes the worst happen and that is like you know the the punctuation oh he was interviewing. Russell brandt um. I would have read that a few years ago and I would have been like that's absolutely true but then I would have just been like yeah but how and then it would have been like yeah well somebody better figure that out oh well. I'm off to epically own ross douthit but now.

I'm like oh god yeah of course that's literally what I've been thinking through this whole time. But the problem is is that at that level of abstraction there's nothing to do about it. So you end up being paralyzed. You have to start from the grill you have to start from from the table in front of you and deciding what you're going to put on it. But the thing is is that you say you need to put and this is the problem like you got. Trad caps will say yeah you need to put religion back into the material world but the way they want to do. That is they want to take the material reality of like the the brittle and disgusting institution of the catholic church and just bash people over the head with it well. That's not gonna work that you're just gonna you're just gonna end up like being another arm of disciplinary capitalism. You know they're just gonna sell rosaries instead of flashlights. It's just it's not. It doesn't change anything because people's relationship to the religion hasn't changed organically which can only occur over time when they have an opportunity when people have an opportunity to reflect the only thing when we're this alienated materially globally and how and and is is gonna be to reduce material alienation so nobody's going to be able to go back to church and have kids again like these chad cast want if the boot isn't taken off the neck of people in this country and around the world and then then you can have like a a genuine piety and sense of of purpose and social cohesion emerge.

But that means you someone has to move first and the person has to move. First is the person who has to who has the foot on the neck and that is I'm sorry. It's not. It's not the the happy. It's not the happy merchant. It's not. It's not hollywood degeneracy. It's not cultural marxists which is all just begging the question. It's capitalism along that axis of who is making it harder for people to be spiritual. It is capitalism so any of these trad caps who want to marry anything to the idea that no we can do this through markets or through basically through supporting market politics it and and advancing market politics. Is absurdly wrong so it's like a spirit. All spiritual problems have a material base and vice versa and the spiritual problem is spiritual emptiness. The the solution is material is reduction of material alienation and spiritual alienation and equal measure and but the ques it's like well.

That's both things yeah but who but where is the plane the plane is material so you start with material so anybody who's tradcathing on the internet is just larping along with every other tanky with the stalin avatar or anybody else. They're all just playing pretend. None of them really believe in that because they're not acting in a way that would bring it about. They're acting in a way that will perpetuate and suspend if it were like. This is where the cat comes in I hate to say this but if everyone reacted that way if everybody decided to fight for traditional catholicism online or bring back the soviet union online. Guess what it would if and and their practice for doing that was fighting on the computer over it like if everybody had your beliefs but their beliefs were fighting over the computer about it guess what you'd still live in neoliberal hell think about that everybody who's like a political practice is yelling at other people on the computer to sharpen their identity. If everyone did that not everyone believed what you believed but everybody believed you believed and acted on it in the same way like if they were just snapped into a place.

It's the same world as ours so it's not like the material conditions have changed but now everyone believes you believe everyone's a trad cath congratulations. But they also have your ingrained need to to establish trad cathery through the internet or through or epic. Mao's third worldism or anything and guess what neoliberalism that you snapped back into would persist. It would change a little bit but it would be around the edges see. I don't. I don't understand how that's supposed to say be disagreement.

Suicide rates decreased during times of war because people felt their suffering served a greater purpose exactly. They were less spiritually alienated by because they were more materially invested. Their suffering work is not labor is not necessarily spirit. Deadening. Dead labor is spirit deadening dead labor with your fighting if you're fighting again a war that you believe in or believing to the extent that you want to see your family live through. That's because you believe what you're doing and so even if you are immaterial hardship. Your degree of alienation is less so yeah but that's the same process and it's generated at the material level.

I don't know I got all peppery. There guys. I'm sorry. I'm trying to yell less in general. I'm trying to like. I'm trying to let things flow through me. But I'm a little. I'm a little off kilter today for a few reasons sorry hoping to get back on to the on to the escot malt is liberalism still a useful term of what we're going to see. Following the pandemic is a refreshment toward globalism for globalism towards protectionism and yeah it'll just be It'll the the plan will be different like neoliberalism doesn't treat everybody the same obviously. That's gonna ask anyone from a sweatshop that matt iglesias defended doesn't the it doesn't. Under these conditions it doesn't treat anybody everybody without. It pretends to but these and but it doesn't actually and so if if if the global market breaks into regional markets that aren't able to connect to each other anymore because of some sort of massive breakdown. If if global warming and the pandemic have that degree of dissolution of of structural legitimacy.

Then that's just gonna reproduce itself in that group which is why the white nationalists are idiots. If you still have capitalism as the driver of your economy. You're just going to find a new group of people look at what john cornyn did in texas this guy. He tells everybody he says hey if you're a if you're fat or you have a heart attack and you die of covid you didn't really die of cover but you died of your own sinful behaviors but he's referring to his own texas constituents because a greater threat to profit exists that same phenomenon is going to exist in your white havens so neoliberalism is still going to be the or at that point. It's just capitalism because neoliberalism. The the neoliberal element of that is the is the dream of it becoming global. Like the globe really is the symbol of neoliberalism because that is the dream is is yes markets obviously like. It's always been yes markets obviously since the beginning of of history but yes markets obviously given these restraints yes markets obviously but like all these things keynesianism whatever it's all yes markets obviously but what about the real world we live in neoliberalism. No no markets we have the whole world see the globe so if that broke up you would just have smaller subunits since they were aware that other places still existed. It couldn't be neoliberalism anymore because those places are you know contributing in some way because they'd be interacting presumably to undermine like the establishment of a market. So like neoliberalism is a totalized state or a dream of a totalized state that wouldn't persist in like some fractured thing but the pers but but cap but the logic. The extractive logic of that hyper cap hyper developed state of capitalism where it's been honed to a hanzo steel edge that cuts through everything. That's going to still be there and it's going to cut up.

Every one of these societies is going to chop up all those hungarians who think that orban has their best interests at heart. It's. Going to chop up all the brexit all the gammons all the brexit gammons if they fall out of the purview of capitalism as it emerges if they are not needed um as consumers and then they'll just find a new axis of of a of back. Back justified differentiation to justify why they deserved it. See that's the problem is that like obviously the end state of communism is is global communism as it has to be. I mean. If neoliberalism is. The dream is the nightmare of a globe reduced by markets to destruction and desiccation. The the dream is the totalized a communal state that harmonizes flow of resources and protects the the homeostasis between species and and humans and and the natural world natural world and right now the one where it breaks down and shatters down into smaller and smaller units. Until we establish we go basically we went from. It's like a ride on It's like the the american eagle at six flags. It's like early early slave agricultural empires feudalism capitalism crisis point crisis of of of of inputs basically crisis of of profit. The need for profit in the system is essentially the point where the need for profit in the system of capitalism collapses against the degree of entropy in that system.

I.e the exhaustion of resources the alienation of of of human spirit and and and material you know condition and when that happens what has happened in the past the next stage. Hypothetically the one we're all hoping for is is a move towards the capitalism now or towards some sort of socialism. Now that if that flow is if that if the if the momentum in the direction up is insufficient it's going to fall back down and it's not going to go into something. We don't recognize. It's going to be a new version of feudalism. A synthesized techno feudalism that has the social characteristics of feudalism but now with the the economic efficiency and symbolic efficiency and material deadness frankly of of capitalism which is essentially the worst possible state. You can't think of a worse state than this because you've got a situation where people are as cowed and a and confused and unable to organize effectively against power as they are in as they more than they ever were under capitalism when it became hegemonic at the mercy of a of a governing ideology that has at its disposal a a refined version of the hoe and the and the mountain bailey castle that is purely digital purely.

Synthetic operated the press of a button and essentially guarantees that human conditions will be at that point reduced down to the status of slavery again slave empires which this is see by the way that is the singularity that the dope ass um like accelerationist nick land types that's what they're praying for Basically. They're they're betting that that's not just one result but the inevitable result and so they're basically coping with that. Like that's what nicklandshit is. It's the ultimate like fake cope. It's like yeah sure we're all gonna be one with a demonic robot lizard god. But that's cool that's fine. I like it actually but obviously this is a absurd ridiculousness because we're too early in the process way too early in the process to say oh yeah nah. Now this is the moment when it turns. There are so many different variables because so many different things can happen and there's so many different directions that that that developmental curve can take that yeah. It's just at the end of the day. The black pill is a failure of imagination.

It's a failure of of having the spiritual will to pursue the question to the to its fullest extent at which point you'll realize any any non-communist teleological approach to human history is faulty because it doesn't take contingency and the dialectical driver of history and to attend into into account. It does not accommodate space-time so throw it in the garbage throw it in the garbage if you got a teleology in there and it isn't towards if it isn't guided towards fully automated communism whatever that might be not in the near term not the idea that's going to happen in your lifetime that's absurd but that it is a potential end state for human existence and if nick land nick land by saying no it's going to be the tech hell singularity well. I'm sorry dude then there is a potential if there's a potential tekkel singularity for the to the exact same extent. There is a potential tech heaven singularity sorry. There is and you might say oh not really at the level of abstraction. We're talking about how many thousands like what hundreds of years. I know the timeline is going to be much faster than it got to get here because we've compounded time into these technological innovations that like basically concentrate time into a weapon. Like that's what technology often is um but even with with hundreds of years the idea that no we're in the world where this all falls apart 

It's cope you're giving up you're giving up you're giving up on the problem and and why because you trigger the libs you gave up on the problem the real rigor of this problem because it was more fun to trigger the libs online isn't that it nick and that's why they made the wrong call. That's why all these guys want the wrong code because they were too invested in mechanical truth to see the push and pull between spirit and matter oh boy. I'm getting over the top here never mind but yes so. That's that's me saying no doom pill because you're always in a contingent hit moment of history because everybody else look at look back at all history and you'll find the contingency in it at some level and you just have to know where you where that is for you to put your shoulder against the wheel because you're why are you triggering the libs because you cannot get full satisfaction from a moment of of of of labor of pressing against something of actually getting friction. You prefer the fake sterile friction of going on the internet. Actually there is no somebody asked what's the difference between grill pill and cleaning of your room. There isn't it's.

I'm attempting to this is essentially gonna be provide some I hope for some people. This is providing like a a a a challenge a dialectical challenge to the peterson stuff which we didn't do last time. I'll admit it because I wasn't thinking that way I was just thinking of his greater threat because everyone's beliefs were so brittle on the internet. It's like oh no the the the the essential insight that jordan peterson had was that you can't tell someone to do something they have to want to do it themselves. That's it and that's and that and the way you the the only way to prove that to someone is to ask them to do something small and then see it develop in their own life and so they convinced themselves and it wasn't you.

That's the central insight of clean your room and nobody talked about it like that because to give him any credit was to say that yes. Actually women are chaos lizards who need to be kept in cages or whatever the and like I guarantee you 99 and the thing is is that mine's better mine's better because like I guarantee you the majority of those. Um clean your room guys. They ended up just as miserable if not more so because what was jordan peters peterson's ultimate explanation for their misery. It wasn't that they live in misery because they're incarnated flesh and that their duty in life is to reduce the amount of suffering in the world. No it's that there's a demonic cabal of marxist college professors telling girls that they shouldn't date them. No amount of cleaning a room is going to get you to a point where you can satisfactorily press against that truth unless you fill up a gym bag with tech nines and go to a college campus because it's abstract because it's wrong because it's faulty. It's just a faulty thing and because it's faulty what do they end up doing if they don't grab a gun and go shoot people. They go and try to take down those marxist professors online because jordan peterson only told them one part.

One poll of this wiggling truth nugget thing that you're trying to grip together he was saying he was saying yes you need to be self-motivated but you need to be self-motivated to go on the computer and tell these banging your head against the wall seeing your degree of investment in any level dissipate and be replaced with nothing. But I'm saying we live in we live. We are bound. We are bound materially we are bound materially and that means that we can only act materially and that's why cleaning your room. Even though it starts from the same premise as a grill pill is fraudulent and mine like. I said you can find out for yourself. I'm not trying to tell anybody anything other than if they want to be less miserable try to find something that they can do in their lives yeah. Dbt is a part of it for sure whatever like thing in your head that can act as a as a bridge to legibility is something that you should incorporate. I mean. I'm not going to judge. I don't care yeah a current affair yeah. The mcribs back guy. I mean that guy really should have may cause people to be more introspective.

You know because I mean either way that's disturbing right like if you're not gonna think about it too much you're still going to have to wonder how many of my fellow rosamosi comrades are just like on the edge of some sort of snap. Some sort of break how can I trust their owns how can. I trust their their cool. How can. I trust that their memes aren't counterfeit or at least to think like damn. Doing all that posting online really did not help this guy at all develop better political opinions because usually your politics should not include shooting up a bunch of people at a bar including your your sister for my god's sakes or no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think This is trans brother. I'm not sure you're forgetting you've got to assume all these 

I'm sorry someone asked a question about the thing about energy and resources you have to imagine at some point that all systems are closed and that even that includes economic systems and at this point you can assume that the economic system is closed as for now the economic system is a closed system. Except for like photosynthesis. You know at that level of like of like the sun energy being brought brought in and like the the the cur the magnetic poles. It's a closed system. It's a global economic system for them. I mean the exceptions are negligible enough to be essentially friction. I might end up living in the woods. I have no idea. The thing is is that you can't really plan too far ahead and that's scary at times like this when everything feels so liquid and it's like it doesn't change things you planning and fretting about a future that you can't directly trying to bring about will not change the urgency of your feelings about it. You have to channel them productively right because you got to remember. It's like yeah. We still have photosynthesis and and and and sun coming in. But we also have greenhouse gases literally cutting off and and like reflecting the heat back. So it's like unless we are able. I mean unless somebody wants to to replace the carbon economy with like a wildly more efficient solar energy grab.

We're going to have a crisis point because because consumption just isn't going down because consumption is how authority is maintained in the west yeah see everyone's offering me. This everyone's saying. I'm wrong. It's like yeah people I am wrong because I don't know that much about science you can chat. I don't know but I just know that that is that is the mental picture to help you bring down to the size of things like the economy the specifics of it. I don't know because I'm not a science man and people are and any any objection anybody wants to talk about. It's a category because you see the way that systems rise and fall and collapse. They're all mirrors of each other oh boy. I'm getting crazy never mind again two in the weeds ah delete. All of this I gotta stop looking at the I gotta stop looking at the thing. I get the chat I get distracted but the thing is the problem with degrowth. People say we need to degrowth well. What is the political valence of that you got to get people on your side to have less of a consumer experience. When the consumer experience is the whole total of their commitment to the system that they live in that's a challenge and saying degrowth is one thing making to growth something that is politically palatable is different. There has to be a reduction of of consumption in the west just by virtue of people won't want to do it as much. It's not going to be like people like oh. It's you need a and the thing is. It's under neoliberalism yeah. Like degrowth in the west. It would be soylent and and those roach candy bars from snow piercer. Neoliberal degrowth is yeah genocidal like neoliberal anything is going to be genocidal as resource constraints and and distribu and climate change. Instability ratchets up but a socialist degrowth would just happen naturally because people wouldn't need as much stuff because they wouldn't need to be replacing their their their alienated spirit. So the way to talk about it is to talk about like the first step like so don't talk about degrowth because now you're arguing about whether degrowth is good or not oh good.

This is useful work from d growth to politics and then start over again work from anything and it's like no you need more tech. Yes you need more tech and the tech needs to be socialized. Work from there to politics don't argue on this on the abstract level of an ideology. I'm just saying that that's not going to be productive as a conversation with somebody else. If you want to think about those things in abstract terms go for it. But if you're going to talk to somebody else you're going to just end up arguing about semantics. I swear to god because at the end you have to reduce everything down to what is the material condition but most importantly what is the direct act. We can do in the present moment to advance it in the good direction and those are two different that's a different question than where we're trying to get to so. Those are two arguments that should be had but they should not determine present action and I feel like people have substituted arguing for like which brand of communism. What flavor what type of socialism will work and the thing is you can only refine that so much online eventually it has to turn into action and if you're taking the action at that abstract level to now you're going to get frustrated and give up again and go back to the computer because it's not applicable. It's a level of abstraction that's for that is not related to your daily life so you've got to work back from your conclusions. The growth is a correct conclusion under some circumstances a green like an industrial a job guarantee and like a new industrial revolution is also true and necessary to an extent you have to bring them back down to the level of politics to move forward enough to know what the mix will be.

When the moment comes that it becomes something to enact right when and where and that is going to be determined in the future. So we have to determine in the now how to create a space where the left is as strong as possible how to get to a point where people are willing to act on their belief in some symbolized concept that is boiled down to a coalition of humans willing to take action. We are both. We are waiting for the moment at the symbolic level but we're acting to bring it about at the material level and the thing is is that we're moving towards the goal. But we're moving foot. It's like we got a carrot on a stick in front of us. We got to watch our feet though you want to look at the carrot once in a while to make sure that it's still there and it didn't fall off the stick or get blown off by wind or a bird took it but you have to keep your if you're on a treacherous terrain which we are you gotta keep your eyes on the feet on your feet or else you're gonna trip. See everyone's asking me.

How can we do it. I don't know because it's not at that level. Yet we're not at the abstract level. The left isn't at a level of power to consider degrowthing. Anything people couldn't even degrowth the mole. I couldn't even go the mold in my own damn bathroom. Am I right folks left is in a position to do nothing to act in no way because it doesn't have power so it must build. Power. That answer to that question is too close and too close at hand to the people who need to do it to be answered in the etheric plane so yeah. I'm basically I'm kicking the can down the road. Because this is just such an unstable moment. It feels wildly unstable but the thing is there are spontaneous reactions. You know like the 1905 russian revolution obviously not comparable in a lot of different ways to our current situation at every level. All of the political parties that have been trying to agitate against zardom were completely shocked when it broke out. It was all through spontaneous action. They had helped bring it about through their agitation partially but they were all surprised by it and then they had to change to adapt to the new situation and we all find ourselves in that situation.

Right. Now we're waiting for the for the north sea fleet to go around africa. Ah. I do not do fat dabs. I've never done a dab. I mean. I've I've hit the dab of course as we all have whom amongst us doesn't enjoy hitting the dab. When do.

I think restaurants will be back. That's an interesting one. I think it's going to be that's really interesting because obviously they want everyone to go back to eat immediately but people don't want to die. But the good news for them is that if people do really start dying now in big numbers the way they're predicting. People will get more used to it and that will drive them basically to go you know distract themselves more from that horror by going back to the restaurants. But there's gonna be such a huge gap in demand there that I don't know how long it's gonna take on their way to iceland. I've been to iceland. It's beer beautiful. But it's also a volcano remember that thing blew up. It's clapping time folks. I think cities are gonna stay closed for a while but that's gonna pose problems obviously will the usps die. I mean the trajectory is.

It will be taken over to some degree by and replaced by something like amazon right. I mean that just seems to be unless something intervenes and it could it seems like that is the course yeah. The thing is is that one thing that might honestly happen that we honest that we are underestimating the possibility of is that there is just they do just go hog that even even these like you know neoliberal wahhabists in charge. They just open the spigot and you know instead of just doing the the the direct transfers to corporations. They've done actually start putting money out there just to keep the lights on and then and they would do that to the least extent. They would have feel like they would have to to keep the situation stable and that would be something.

I guess like finally instituting at long last and ubi just to get enough demand in the economy to hope to start a a keynesian cycle but that depends on a lot of things including how bad climate change gets and how quickly and like the if oil continues to not make be worth anything that's an x factor too that I have no idea how you factor in. But it's not good either way yeah. I mean it would have to be like. I don't think it would be a monthly thing that would that would be terrified that that would turn into a like social security checks but I could see them like cutting like twelve hundred dollar checks every like two or three months on an ad hoc basis classic kick. The can down the road because that's all they can do like that's late late stage capitalism is just kicking the can down the road until something happens what you're really intervening for if you have an interest in an investment in like the government. What you're really intervening waiting for is another technological like inflection point that solves a lot of your underlying problems of distribution and again gets and that puts profit back into the system but if that's not coming and man. I don't know if it doesn't sure doesn't look like it. Then they're gonna just keep kicking the kant on the road crumbles off the end of the bridge.

Oh yes kelly rouble hitler's niece. I you probably killed her. I mean he was adolf hitler right. I mean he's adolf hitler. Some is his his niece who had a very weird relationship mysteriously commit suicide during his rise to power. I'm not going to suspect. My first suspect isn't going to be adolf hitler like the worst guy ever yeah. I'm just going to make a bayesian inference that it might have been hitler. They clapped. It's just they left it's losing a little energy. It's like anything you know like you kind of get used to you kind of like clap it up and then it gets less novel and then you kind of and then you either peter it out or you know. At some point you give it a little bit more and it takes back up again. It's in a lull right now for sure that's very nice of you to give hitler the benefit of the doubt all right. I'm going to.

I think. I've realized what's happened is that when I get to the level of like politics abstract politics and prescriptive stuff it gets dicey because one it's so far away from the reality and two I feel so sort of unmoored still a little bit. You know. I'm still coming into my daily understanding of myself. So. I think tomorrow if you anybody who's tuning in tomorrow who's watching I would like to do some history questions. I had a lot of fun talking about napoleon a couple days ago. So let's let's talk. Some some movies maybe and and history would be fun tomorrow all right.

 the witch videos are a few days behind being up on youtube but they're all on twitch for now well. That's just it. This person says if I'm not well read how the hell are you learn about wallenstein well. That's just it you learn about wallenstein. You don't have to read them boom because it's not like anybody's going to really challenge you on your knowledge of them because nobody else is reading that nobody else has read them either which means the people who have read him aren't going to get other people to really get it and so they don't talk about it at a very advanced level and so nobody feels the need to like that's how like the incentive system of of talking about politics and history and stuff on the internet is to learn less. I know that happened to me taiping. Ooh. That's a good one. All right I got some stuff to think about for next week or for tomorrow. Taiping is very good and the thing is is. The discourse is all cliff notes and like that's inevitable it has to be. But it's what are in the notes. We picked the bad things we picked kind of vapid things to be in the notes ah the german peasant war. That's a good one too that was that one's very interesting to talk about in context of protestantism. I they're also doing a rob ford movie with with damien lewis as rob ford. Like in a fat suit very funny oh cromwell cromwell would be very good all right. I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye.
