Living easy living free season dig it on a one-way ride asking nothing let me be taking everything in my stride. Don't need reason don't need rhyme. There ain't nothing I'd rather do going down party time. My friends are gonna be there too. I'm on a highway to hell highway way to hell oh boy um all right that stop no stop signs speed limit nobody gonna tone me down. Gekko we all gonna spin it nobody's gonna rest me around so he has an interesting question.

I know the metaverse isn't happening but that's what they're pushing us to imagine as our future which is what really matters because that's what's actually structuring. Our decisions now is what we're imagining we're trying to push for and this is what they're trying to imagine for us. This is their idea of what our future should be and if we accept it we will make it a reality not the thing itself but a deformed gnarled pathetic halfway version which is what makes the metaverse as sketched out so depressing it's already sucky. It already sucks. You're like this is just second life. This is second life plus early 90s vr technology that people thought was lame by the second clinton administration and that's what we get to uh. That's what we get to live with. That's not even what we get to live with that's not what we get to actually experience. I should say that's what we get to live in the aspiration of live in the in the pathetic uh contrails of live in the dust up we get to live in the dust of this crappy future where we don't even get that level of lame interaction with a stupid fake universe. I mean my god.

Freddie player. One is supposed to be sort of a dystopia and it looks so much better than the  work meetings so anyway not great that that's the the carrot that they're gonna be dangling in front of our face as they trudge us into the uh into this. The hog shoots but hey it's not the only thing going. It's just what what they're right now trying to pitch as a way to make people think that there's some future for facebook beyond being a angry grandpa meme aggregator which has a very limited market uh future because it doesn't matter that it's incredibly profitable now what matters for the future of the company and its stock is that it has this imagined future business because those old people are going to die. How are you going to appeal to the younger people. If you are associated toxically with oldness. Sure you know they're older people coming up but maybe they're alienated from the entire uh concept of facebook they're not going to adopt it late. They're going to keep the things that they have so. They have to have some sort of thing that isn't old people uh yelling at people old people yelling at their grandkids for not liking their posts or whatever now they do own instagram. So that's their youth play. But facebook is the big enchilada and it's got to show a future uh market value yeah right. Like the old people the young old young people when they get old they're gonna keep doing discord or whatever the. They're not gonna switch to facebook. Once they get a certain age but yeah their only real hope is to buy the sector buy.


The uh competition monopolize the thing to set prices. That's it. That's all they can do that's all any of that can play for the monopoly play is the only play left because we've reached the terminal point of capital accumulation where it's no longer accumulating at least not at the rate that commands hurt with the need for growth in the system and you know what that's a good play like if they get us to a point where we're uh mandatorily having to buy neck braces that explode if we don't look at facebook enough. Then it doesn't matter that they never built a multiverse that it was all a  chimera because they will have uh what they need which is the ability to squeeze profit endlessly out of the system until of course. The thing collapses and all we'll have then are the remnants of technological hierarchy left over from the destruction of the main circulatory system like once capital stops circulating through the system which is when we're what we mean when we really talk about collapse. It's when the circulation of capital trade networks break down uh and then you're not going to just have people fleeing into anarchy or you know doing a revolution. You're going to see regional concentrations of capital around certain technological structures that support them considering dominance and so things like facebook are going to be features of those new regimes of power because they're necessary social architecture. At this point.

Like facebook is doing a a job. It is fulfilling a role in the market that is now thanks to the change of our living conditions. The atomization of life. The reconstitution of life online is as vital as electricity sewage and any other public utility. Certainly the  telephone it is now a thing. People need the way that people need those things in order to have a functioning society at this level of complexity and population. Sophistication is the word one so it's got to exist but it can't exist as a profit making enterprise because it will deform itself like we have to all talk to each other online. We have to have conduits for information and and relationships that facebook provides. But we do not need our participation in it mangled by a algorithm that is determined by a ad revenue model. If the thing is just administered neutrally now of course oh there's no neutral administration in politics yes of course and it would become a political argument but it would be an actual political argument like what's so frustrating about people arguing about facebook and about big tech.

Censorship is that you're talking about something that is outside of government regulatory structures at this point because we're not treating it like a utility like if it was an actual utility. At least the argument argument over what should go on there would have some sort of democratic uh uh input and deliberation behind it. It would not be dictated by profit. It's not perfect but it's better and I mean obviously all that really does is put a a but a layer of uh separation between uh facebook and you know government that really just increases the latency of a transaction that is dominant like oh we're going to vote on it and make it public like that isn't then going to be what we do with. The public utility isn't going to be dictated by private interests in the system that is not a democracy but at least it would start as a wedge and it would be something that could maybe enliven the actual political system which is dying because of a lack of any meaningful avenue of economic or I'm sorry of a democratic accountability. Like everyone knows now that nothing is determined nothing that matters is determined uh democratically which is why all the most important most passionately felt uh political beliefs.

People have are about culture but of course a lot of it is putting cat cart before horses because it's difficult to imagine any real public democratic accountability for attack. The new leviathan tech sector short of a genuine revolution you know and that is the dirty little secret of online. Political disputation is that even people who are here to talk about politics and try to cut through sort of the noise of the spectacle of politics and try to get to what really matters have to dance around the fact that we've reached a crisis point in the american democratic system relative to our real ecological barriers that are not being priced into our political deliberations now due to a complete breakdown of democracy. The transubstantiation of democracy into a technocracy skynet becoming self-aware means that conventional politics up to including basically all electoral politics can have really nothing but an entertainment function and that like if you wanted to determine what political act you taste take based on your real faith belief that it could do any good would have to be extra extra electoral in a way that doesn't lend itself to public discussion.

Let me just say that so how do you talk about things while talking around the unspoken fact that everyone knows but no one can say that we are past the point when effective political action as in things you think in your heart of hearts. Things you believe things you believe are gonna make things better. Uh can be anything other than resistance but the reason that people don't make that claim and make that jump in their personal life is for the very good reason that even the most extreme um visions of resistance to the state that one could imagine would be at best sort of uh glorious like self-annihilation that that there is no real capacity of uh organization in the current moment to allow for effective resistance to whatever we want to think of as the state.

The next best thing we have is local power in terms of supporting union organizing supporting strikes when they happen uh and uh participating in local politics as a way to base build towards creating a broad coalition of working-class interests as resistance at the workplace level accelerates which I think it will but the thing about that is it's not funny entertaining and more importantly relevant to everybody that you might be trying to communicate to because these are local questions. Most of the time and that and people trying to interact with a local struggle are not going to be able to commiserate on any of the relevant questions because they don't have they're not in the room and they don't have skin in the game and they and they are observing from a position of disengagement from the material questions like as in the stuff. That's going to either make my life better or worse like only in the most abstract sense because you're not there what that means is that if you want to get in there and of course everyone wants to  get in there. Everyone wants to help you find yourself applying questions applying heuristics to the situation that are irrelevant and that are going to most likely be made up of preconcept pre-occupations defined by participation in and spectation of the national political. Uh uh debate sphere which because nobody can talk about effective action because they can't do it because it's either too dangerous or it's not uh uh. It's not relevant to a a audience that isn't strictly regional and nobody has that anymore uh all they can talk about is.


You can either be having fun with it or you can be trying to argue it in earnest but either way you're responding to the the puppet show. I mean I know that's always seemed like the most trite observation about democracy is oh. It's all just a sham but like the reason that that is not enough to say is because a the degree of shamness matters and has practical considerations an impact strategy so saying oh. It's all a sham. It's all a spectacle isn't enough because there are degrees like we had we had more democratic control of our of our uh. We had more formal democratic control over the decisions of the system that we're building in the 60s than we do now now of course.

The electorate was much smaller and it was racially segregated which is in large part why we could allow that level of democratic participation because it was screened away from the people who would most need to or be most inclined to get together to redistribute things. Now those structures of democracy have imploded as the uh electorate has increased and that's been the way that american democracy has worked since the founding as the system gets more complicated as as our economy gets more complicated as more technology is introduced into our structures. The formal amount of democracy in our system goes away because there's too many decisions to make there's too many decisions that are too important that have to be made too quickly to allow for real democratic participation in all in the way that you could have it in a previous generation when there were fewer decisions to make and the pressure that this complexity puts on the system from below leads to the enlarging of the franchise and the increase of the number of people who are allowed to exercise electoral participation as a way of venting their alienation from the system. Now this is a process.

This happens over time and so we're at a point now where after having created a full formal electorate for the first time in america. In the last 30 years. We've also created a post 70s technocracy a a a political economy dictated by fully institutions that are undemocratic and and in fact anti-democratic like from the uh world bank and imf to most crucially the federal reserve and then of course. The military uh and the intelligence community. What that means is is that my opinion on what happens in a democracy. This hollowed out means nothing it might have meant something in a previous generation because my vote had a more meaningful impact on structures of power if I could vote if I was inside. The bubble well now more of us are inside that bubble of voting but all that passion we have is all going towards making a decision that will have no meaningful impact on the system.

That is a that is not political action that is not being a political subject that is pretending to be a political subject and that's what we're all doing we're pretending to be political subjects and our participation in uh political media is part of that building of imagined political subjectivity. Now real political action at this level is now effective. Action is going to be organizing in a way that is not spectacular. The way electoral politics are and because of all this we're now sliding towards the creation of the end state of capitalism where it is fully detached from all human will where our ruling class the people in charge are effectively all along for the ride and are all incapable of acting in a way counter towards a runaway unmoored uh profit accumulation algorithm and what that will create is a situation where there is no more human ownership of anything like in a meaningful sense. Even our rulers will not really own anything it will be owned by the algorithm which will distribute according to that algorithm. Now there's going to be people making a lot of money and sitting in houses that they own.


But it's essentially going to be an nft situation there. Uh they're allowed to sit there because someone's got to sit there. They're allowed to have access to that money because the profit has to go somewhere because the machine itself doesn't want it. It only does it because that's what it's there to do. It is inhuman and and profit is a human. It has subjective human value and that is not captured priced into the uh. So it's got to go somewhere and it goes towards those people who uh by happenstance are sitting right by the spout and everybody else will have their ownership of anything eventually denuded away so that everyone is renting their uh space on earth basically now the force. This is just the reverse this is. The this is the uh outcome of this is what happens when the human race fails to cohere and organize itself against this. Uh process which is what the uh socialist movement has been uh. What what marx identified at the beginning of the birth of modern capitalism was is that this machine would alienate us all from our humanity completely so that we literally own no material things including our bodies and that we would we would all make this happen without wanting it to happen well wanting. Some other thing we would be making this thing without knowing it.

Everyone would be fighting for what they considered their own human self-interest but what they were really serving. The whole time was a system that is inhuman and the only thing that could stop that is if people organized as humans as a human species as members of a species and not as individuals re-forge a collective identity that that pervaded in humanity before the intervention of modernity. But with now the uh advanced technology accumulated by capitalism to use to express the species will of the humanity and distribute resources accordingly. That's what that's what marx identified as the task of the working class as the leading edge of all humanity because the working class would uh experience conditions of life that would alienate them from capitalism in a specific way that other class members bourgeois. Landowners would not because they're dispossessed first and most uh essentially and then for and then they are all forced to live together in close conditions and experience the reality of that and the reality of capitalism's role. It would essentially demystify them and then they would organize and they would use their superior organizational skill and number as as as capitalism makes more and more proletarians and dispossesses more and more people until the point that their numbers present their numbers. Uh overcome the technological advantage of capital that is the teleology of marxism when it's spoken of and the reason that that is not wrong and the fact that we haven't had that happen doesn't disprove.

Marx is because marx was merely saying that we have that ability that that is the route of human salvation that if humanity defeats capitalism that's how it will happen doesn't mean it will. But it means that's how now. I think marx thought it would and on closer terms than many of us. Because he was creating a replacement for convent religion. He was replacing religion but not with an ideology with a vision of humanity that was a transformative one that was christian that was the best expression of all religious traditions but in the reformation with a lot of the protestant. Common people were trying to build was heaven on earth through the recreation of the conditions of the early church which were holding of things in common and that attempt was squashed by the earthly authorities who only allowed the reformation to the degree that it helped their power and the old holy warriors who fought for a a uh fantasy.

A a a creation of a ruling elite which was what christianity was that feeling of of righteous combat and righteous sacrifice on behalf of a cause can now be felt by people who can correctly see what the battle is correctly see what the sides are and what the stakes are in a way that people in previous orders where the hegemonic uh superstructures the cultural realities imposed by the ruling class were absolute and that was the condition of the pre-modern uh oppressed class of the serf. The slave they could not live in a way that allowed them to effectively create a counter-hegemonic understanding of the world. They had to live in the world imposed upon them by the church and by the the king and and or the emperor or whatever and that ratified their subject position and so you see like the gnostics and the anabaptists and the cathars and the  hutterites and all trying to build collective life. I mean it's not a coincidence that the great peasants german peasant revolt happens just a few years after the nailing of the feces in the wittenberg cathedral there was a drive to make uh christianity the social uh the the expressed social reality to have it match to have the social reality of living in christianity match the vision of universal brotherhood.

Now of course it was cramped and wrong because you could feel the alienation for the system and fight against it but only using the vocabulary of your rulers the creation of capitalism. The creation of this ever increasing pool of proletarianized people who live are forced to live together and struggle in the same conditions creates not just disillusionment with the system and the feeling of oppression but also solidarity and marx is saying every previous resistance to capitalism to a regime of power ends in collapse or domination of one by the other because they're all fighting with the cultural tools in the sandbox. They were in here medically sealed hegemonies so they could only recreate regimes of control because that's all they knew capitalism creates a antithesis. A fundamental antithesis as in a whole new world don't you dare close your eyes with a different religious understanding where religio where religiosity and sociality are fused and use and technology. The technology of mass media and uh consolidation of labor power into machines allows you to actually express it. The reason that those uh those cr.

Those efforts to create a just christendom failed is because the tools to distribute uh resources equitably didn't exist. There was not sufficient concentrated capital around means of production to do that when the anabaptists took munster they basically just hung around and waited for the world to end because none of them could unders. None of them had any ability to create a functioning economy and so they ended up just waiting for the world event and then it did when the emperor came and killed all of them because that was the one red line in the reformation. The reformation through most of the the deeply held notions of the western catholic. Church into question the one that couldn't be questioned was infant baptism even though one of the chief objections of protestantism was that the catholic church did a bunch of  up and that that was wrong because the bible is the only true authority. Everything else is fallen and deformed by man. But infant baptism isn't in the  bible but what infant baptism was was not a baptism into a religion. It was a baptism into a social world a hierarchy and to say I get to be baptized as an adult.


I get to choose to enter this community is to challenge the entire social order but it couldn't work because there wasn't sufficient social technology or uh economic technology around to redistribute labor. Effectively. We are at that point we are past the point where capitalism has created the means to allow a socially coherent working class uh socially according working class with its own internal machines. Technologies of belief adhering people to a project at the center of the technological nexus at the nodes of power able to turn the knobs you could do it. We could do it. It would essentially be humans taking over the machine from the algorithm and then building us a world where nothing is privately owned but nothing is rented either like provision for life is taken for granted and your participation in the world with others the building the making of an economy the the distribution of resources the building of a culture. The managing of those things is not participating in a market out of self-interest out of homo economicus desire to maximize profit for myself and to hoard surplus to enjoy materially but is is a spiritual communion with a social organism and that sounds crazy wacky crazy insane. But I swear to god it isn't the thing that makes it seem.

Insane is the idea that we are all that we all have as a lodestoner. On our neck is uh human nature which is just the secularized version of original sin. It is capitalism. It is secular capitalism recapitulation at the social level of belief in capitalism. Just as original sin was the functioning structure was. The fun is the defining mental structure that adhered one to the society of orders in the christian west. I am fallen I have sinned therefore I must accept my lot. It's essentially a westernized version of the cast idea. Your position in life is determined by your worthiness but all are all are fallen but what of course is making you fall is living under these conditions.

The reproduced social exploitation of a class society where bad is called good where you literally live in a matrix of ideology that turns virtue into vice and vice versa. Now we killed god. We can't tell you that you are where you are because god wants you to be there because not nobody nobody really believes in god anymore well. What they do believe in is that they're human beings and that they're in a natural order well. Part of that natural order is the idea that humans are wired to self-seek at the expense of other people and that's why we can't do what I talked about you can't create uh socialized structures of of economic power because they'll just be hoarded by the mob and selfishly used by uh by elites who then use their position to exploit everybody else yeah. If we did that yes that's what would happen. But we wouldn't do that the people doing that's machine. The people operating that social machinery are not us.

They have been transformed over time and struggle because you don't get that immediately that's the result of a  long human organizational task. The best example of this would be the cuban revolution the reason that cuba one of the reasons that cuba has survived in the form it has without becoming a cult of personality terror state like north korea sorry haters. But that's what it is was by building faith in the system and that means not just people who are subject to the system.

But the people who administer the system that doesn't mean there's no corruption in cuba. It doesn't mean. It's perfect what it means is the corruption and the exploitation are not so vast as to alienate the population at a mass scale in a way that can't be managed with the escape valve of immigration of course. The conditions of that exploitation and that corruption are economic deprivation if you have a if you have post scarcity plus if you have a post scarcity uh context and you have sufficient technology to distribute uncomfortable labor away from the human experience and people actually have values that are outside of the guilt matrix of living in capitalism feeling either guilt or resentment at all times and having to do something with that resentment or guilt that combination that everybody is filled with at all times under capitalism that everybody has filled it. I should say at all times under class or rule. There's a class system is bifurcated that means everybody is is guilty of exploitation or is a victim of exploitation but of course because this is a very complicated social organism.


This is gradient. This is not just at some point there's an inflection but there is a gradient and there's a middle category of people who are both and everybody feels guilt and resentment in some marbling. The more popular. The more powerful you are the more it's just plain guilt and of course. Some of the richest people in the world are incredibly resentful but of course that is resenting people for making them feel guilt and of course. At the very bottom. What do you have to feel guilty about other than the personal guilt of committing harm to people around you which happens a lot more when you're. Miserable all the time it is a parasitic relationship and it's no good for either side. It is bad for your soul and so your interaction with the world become selfish and dedicated to ignoring that feeling and the only thing to ignore it with is is that which could be purchased in the market either in the form of direct consumption or social standing elevation which you get to feel good about and the the pursuit of social standing now out of this.

This this sandwich of pain and resentment is forged the socialist movement but it has to struggle in the context of capitalism as part of a caste society. When when communism finally happens in the soviet union. It is not in the context of world revolution and the seizure of the means of production at the center that that lenin and trotsky imagined but in the isolation of a economically backward feudal world that then had to confront and compete with capitalism on its terms from a position of of deep deficits and it did the job as people have said miracle but what it but it did kill millions of people to make it happen. You cannot deny that and the reality of that is that it it makes the project less believable to people who live through that and that the people that they give birth to and raise it disillusion it. The the necessary social belief that powers communism is undermined and no one in the social bolshevik party at the top would have supported the october revolution if they thought they'd had to go it alone.

I would challenge anybody who disagrees with that they would not have done it if they thought they had to go it alone because they knew they all knew what would have what that would require it would require war on the peasantry because turning an agricultural population into an urban one is a violent horrifying process. That capitalism had had had uh carried out in the rest of the world either through enclosure and uh violence labor violence at the center or through colonization. From outside. This is the first time that communism is asked to do this violent work and yes it does it and it beats the nazis but by the 50s they're left with the task of trying to compete with the west to create a consumer economy. After they have lost the faith of the people.

They say look we're just a state like other states we're an elite but we can give you a better standard of living than you can get in the west. You can give you more stuff and the thing is the stuff that they could give them that we couldn't give our people like guaranteed health care guaranteed uh housing and employment in a in a position of social alienation in a in a in a context of social alienation. That's not what people need that's not what people notice missing because in the west where capitalism has uh where where the hegemonic processes of capitalism recreated our social order and our understanding of our place of society. We don't feel entitled to those things we feel like those are rewards too what the what the state is in charge. Of is all the pleasures what the state is in charge of is whether or not we can uh access consumer convenience because that is our only acceptable form of relief from the anguish of capitalism. We can do drugs. Some of those are legal and that you can contribute to the economy by buying them. Others aren't and you can contribute by to the intelligence community by buying those but mostly you have to buy things and the government's job is to allow you to buy as much stuff as possible and give you the opportunity to contribute or to the opportunity to compete in a market not only for stuff but for status and um and with that question with that as the as the modus operandify society.


Hey we're going to have you guys build a we're all going to have you guys work in factories and then we're going to give you stuff. But in the in the east you're going to believe that you are a public. You are working for the state and then the state gives you some shitty. Uh appliances uh and and they have deep scarcity because they have a much smaller reservoir of raw materials and a less less developed uh industry than the east does half of it got blown up by world war ii. They had to start from scratch practically in a lot of the country. The united states industrial heartland was untouched and in fact massively expanded by the war but in the west you work you work hard for yourself. Yes you have a boss but you are earning money. You're not working for the state and then you can take that money and buy things and you can buy more things than your neighbor. And if you work harder you can buy even more things you're not going to win.

That contest you can't that is why somebody said and I forgot to even mention it because I got sidetracked but at the beginning of the very beginning of the chat somebody asked of all of my pet counterfactuals which one would you like to be able to read like the magic trans-dimensional wikipedia. Uh article about like which of these futures if you could pick one would you like to get onto a magic laptop and read the history of in a world where it happened and I gotta say at this point what if the soviet union had never existed and the thing about this one is that it is the closest call of any of the big ones. The thing about reconstruction uh the german uh working class uniting against capitalism in 1918. These things are when you really look at them very over determined but the bolshevik revolution is such a close run thing. It is so uh so contingent if you look at it uh if you look at the situation in uh petrograd. After the february revolution and the the absolute terror and paralysis at the top of the bolshevik party. It is impossible for me to imagine them carrying off the october revolution without lenin showing up and that is a contingent event or anything happens to lenin between his arrival at the finland station.

In october. I think they break up because none of them had the full confidence that they would win and the confidence to imagine themselves in a position of power. Afterwards and for good reason. They were mostly a bunch of  fuck-ups. They were all there was a com. It was a bunch of people who had been sitting in coffee shops. Their entire lives arguing about posts and they were being asked to take over a government.


Lenin was will able to do it because of the vastness of his intellect and his full confidence in himself which was mostly completely warranted but one of the key things firing him towards october was a steely belief that they were going to kick off a world revolution. Something that trotsky had convinced him because a guy of lenin's capacity cannot be told your time in history has not arrived. Yet you have to sit back. It's absurd. He has to think of a way to imagine that he can even though there is no developed socialism in russia. At this point there's no working class. The country is ninety percent peasant but you have to imagine a world where you can take power and effectively wield it towards building world socialism and looking at russia that's hard to imagine unless you also imagine a world revolution and I am not saying that we that would be better. I just think it would be dramatically different and very very easy to imagine. Now. I do think that if there if the bolsheviks don't seize power in october I do believe that there is a military coup. Uh. I think that karensky gets uh gets. Uh somebody said that would be very similar to the mexican revolution where maduro gets uh overthrown and executed by huerta. I think you're going to see a situation see something like that and that would be a deep blow to the world socialist movement uh and there would be great disarray and uh panic after that uh and it would but it would it would change the the uh the flow of all our the flow of all uh it would it would absolutely impact everything massively in the united states the soviet. The establishment of the soviet union helped lead to the red scare now without the bolsheviks winning without the ability to terrify people about the idea of a red army that was running around killing people at least as far as the newspapers were reporting and not creating a workers paradise. Maybe the socialist movement stays coherent and gains popularity as it had been until that point or maybe. It dissipates now in this situation.

The german revolution of uh. 1918 I think still doesn't happen but and I think you still see the sdp. Uh. Uh spd. Rather. I keep  it up because stupid german uh the spd does sick the fry core on the workers no matter what but maybe you don't see the massive uh formalized and reinforced division between the communist party of germany and the social democrats that makes it them incapable of coming together in the reichstag to resist the nazis and that means you still have a world war. Ii you still have the apocalyptic confrontation over capitalism in europe in crisis. But what do the lines of it look like is it just another bourgeois versus bourgeois. Uh battle of resources like world war. One had been or do intervening years of uh striking and worker activism lead to an actual class war at least in europe maybe with the us under roosevelt. Although who knows what happens in the u.s. If that doesn't isn't the occur. Maybe u.s. Under uh debs or not debs by that point. But you know upton sinclair. Maybe helping contribute.

I don't know no way to say and that is why I would really like to read it and I know. I basically just described kaiser reich or no heart of iron right or hakai zarek. So. I guess. That's how you find out what that would look like is. If you play kaiser egg. I know people. I know in in those stories like cynicalism becomes the main uh uh organizing mechanism. I don't know if that would have happened. I can see the argument but I think maybe you just have a strengthening of the uh of like. The reformist democratic tradition which of course is insufficient but like I said maybe builds up structures and allies with labor in a way that allows them to be a competent and meaningful locus of force in a coming confrontation yeah. But of course you can't forget that you know the soviets winning. It did create a new era in world history and all of the accommodations with humanity that capitalism made in the 20th century were in a condition of being under the threat of the soviet competition. But if you delay the confrontation and you geographically redirect the center of power of the of the struggle maybe you kick off the chain reaction that pushes us towards a socialization of means of production rather than the uh.

I won't even say privatization because I said no human actually owns it the uh the full alienation of the means of production which is what we currently are moving towards somebody's asking about napoleon. I think the reason I root for napoleon and why his defeat was a disaster for humanity in my opinion is because I do really believe that capitalism is modern. Capitalism is not something that just emerged amorphously across the world. Uh social order. It is something that emerged concretely and and materially in england and then it took over the world from there uh starting with enclosure and ending with the uh glorious revolution. You see the transformation of uh the english economy and its political culture and and religious culture that makes a new form of state and that european capitalists. Capitalism is essentially is essentially uh imposed from without on the rest of europe and then on the rest of the world through colonialism. Uh that's why I think that there really isn't a conflict between brenner and wallenstein because I feel like brenner describes how capitalism is born and then wellenstein describes how it was exported and came to take over the the world um so what that means for me is that well. While capitalism does emerge uh in france. It is not.

It is this alien intervention uh and by the time of even the french revolution it is not fully like uh materialized and and developed yet and the revolution in the french revolution because of it happens so much later it happens in a moment of secular enlightenment. It's able to define like the interests of the people in a more uh secularized fashion than what happened in england where their revolution was headquartered was headed up by a bunch of puritan religious fanatics and that has an impact on the development of uh the social order from that point forward and it it. It mystifies the social relationship that emerges there is a clarity to the social. Relationship is understood under the by that first articulation modern articulation of of the bourgeois not because the bourgeois is not the same thing as capitalists because bourgeois existed before bourgeois people existed before the capitalism emerged. It just meant people who lived in the cities and lived off of trade and commerce rather than through direct agricultural work and that category becomes sort of the the class that powers the development of capitalism but it was one beforehand just as the working class is something that always existed but as increases size and increases internal consistency and political uh political mobilization and and organization over time but yeah of course. The the thing is like a nationally a nationalized sense of uh of a nationalized sense of duty and well-being or whatever uh fused to an advanced economy is fascism basically but you need uh. Fascism happens because of the continued dominance of capitalism which you in this instance would assume would be interrupted and arrested in some way because napoleon the first one really did want to impose a universal not particular meritocracy.

Uh and yes people say oh. He seeded the crowned the the the crowns of europe with his family yeah because he had deserved it and he he trusted them. Uh he is essentially refreshing the aristocratic uh uh ranks getting rid of the deadwood making it more efficient which is because of the pressure of capitalism. But it's still maintained the idea of human power over economic power. Now what the  what capitalism did is. It took the idea of of air of meritocracy and turned it eventually into aristocracy but did a few extra steps. So now we think we live or many of us do in some sort of system where people are in positions of power and wealth due to their merit when in fact they are as to the manner born as uh incompetent and generally uh useless unchallenged vapid uh and fundamentally incompetent as the uh decrepit ruling houses of europe in the 17th and 19th century but yeah no interesting to imagine but yeah no if you give me one to look at it would be like the sealed train from switzerland derails or something yeah. Exactly. Napoleon can't be a fascist any more than julius caesar. He turned it into a reactionary. He turned it into an empire because there could be a republic because it wasn't ready. You got to put it back in the oven all right. That's that's that's fine that's good all right talk to y'all soon peace.
