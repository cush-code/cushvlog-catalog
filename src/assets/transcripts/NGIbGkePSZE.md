Then there's nowhere else to rock is there room for one more song. One more song you can't hold on when you can't hold on hold on another heartbreak. So much you know you. Gotta help me out yeah. You know you know no you don't. Oh well. She took my love and ran around with every single guy in town. Hey hey my yes. This is the first bc stream the first or no.

I'm sorry ac chat after chair or after demolition of chair. I don't know but yes. I know that no one can ever think of me. The same way again after that one and that's fine that's life as frank. Sinatra said but that's cool in fact. I find it useful. I can just I can use it as a moment to cleanse my ego um. This chair is well. This has all the bolts and if one of the bolts falls out. I swear. I'm gonna actually put it back in and not just ignore it which is what happened with the other one. It literally was my own fault. My own laziness um so rumsfeld died today and I gotta say I understand why people want to like celebrate when that happens when one of these guys dies. One of these ghouls actually dies. It proves that they are not immortal reptiles although honestly do we know for sure that any of these people die do we know for sure that they're not just molting from one. Flesh skin to another. How do we know that they're not just peeling off their decrepit. Rumsfeld or h.w. Bush scales stepping out of it and being a crisp new wet creature that can come on the scene and create a whole new arc of evil through the world like the demonic. Archons that they are.

I mean these guys are archons. These guys are they're so close to the center of evil and they're so consequential in the the misery of so many others that they're imbued with like real spiritual power. I think they are sort of dark wizards. I mean and you know we know for a fact that they all to some degree or another and you can argue about what degree that they all love performing rituals of power from getting your ass paddled and having to jack off in a coffin for to join skull and bones or like how what's this nuts um david cameron. The the absolute oaf british prime minister who put his dick in a pig's mouth. They love ritualized performances of humiliation as like a gateway to power and then like indulgence as like a sacred ritual. Like like you are sacrificing millions on the altar of like your personal satisfaction and pleasure. You have to have if you're a thinking pure person with a heart and yes of course. These people are all sociopathic but they also have they have identities that extend beyond that they're not pure You know like nobody is purely self materially interested right like there's always something surrounding that and then they have to create channels to work through it. They have to vent all the associated bad feelings that come with being in that position and they do that through ritualized indulgence or denial and of course. That's the difference between powerful conservatives and liberals as denial versus indulgence. But if you're when you're at the very top you create rituals of indulgence and that's what these people do from. They were doing on epstein's island. They have this ritualized gradation of power that is conferred through performance of cruelty.

 sallow got that 100 correct about like what is at the base of like. He said he was talking about fascism but really any ruling power in in the moment of crisis. Like the whole context of sallow right is that that is the puppet regime that's the nazi puppet regime that was around um mussolini in northern italy after Mussolini was rescued from italian like state custody. That's the italian state that had overturned him and was negotiating surrender with the allies and imprisoned mussolini for his many crimes when he was busted out by of the like. It really is some james bond stuff otto scorseni who was like the nazi. James bond flew mussolini out of an island fortress on a glider. It's wild and then they put him and a bunch of us like top fascist cronies up in charge of this puppet regime. The sallow social republic that was quickly enveloped and destroyed and and was it finally over overrun by partisans communist partisans who captured mussolini and executed him and famously strung him up by his heels.

 you know one of the people who participated in the firing squad that killed. Mussolini became a italian communist politician after the war and was actually inc in parliament. So these the fascists who run italy or run this little portion of italy in the film in pocillini's film are consumed all in there consuming all of their time with these elaborate rituals of sadism where they take these poor young people and subject them to the most horrifying violence that is explicitly related to their erotic enjoyment of it. They're not just watching it. Coldly. It is it is sexual and it is a fusion of like sexuality. Like the the ba It is taking bodily connection and stripping it entirely of intimacy and replacing it with domination which is the end state of the ruling class in terminal crisis of death. It strikes out at everything because it is isolated from everything and so eroticism is all of life. All of life is aesthetics as it is under fascism and those aesthetics are of theatrical violence and cruelty and of course that's present in capitalism at every stage.

But when you get to the end point and the sen the south social republic. It was 120 days just like sodom before it was overrun. So these people were partying in a burning building and they all knew it. Nobody thought that they were in charge. Nobody thought that they were they had the allies on the run. They knew that these were the last days and they engaged as you would that means that when you get to the end of capitalism all that's left is dominion and a culture around dominion. An intimate dominion that is required by the intimacy of crisis conditions necessitates necessitates an eroticized sadism. Now of course. The reason we aren't having that kind of erotic explosion here is because we're so far from it because capitalism even though it is in a crisis where conditions of apocalypse are already here but unevenly distributed. The rest of the people within these systems and the ones closest to the the organs of political organization legal authority and electoral structures and access and proximity to technology and to capital flows like the most. The most central subjects are not experiencing that what they're experiencing is is the fear of it because they're seeing it around them and they're feeling bad about it. But they don't feel the way that a guy in the room has to feel as they're carrying out some sadistic ritual. They don't have to feel about it the way that the the way that the sallow aristocrats felt about it as in having to be there and having to really just turn your brain into something that finds that pleasurable fight against all human connection and all of your instinctive sense of of continuity with the universe cut it away cauterize it. But most people aren't going to do that and most people don't have to because they can afford to imagine that they're not benefiting from that more than they are being undermined from it because they are aware of their own subject position because we're not in charge of anything we're not in charge of anything and so instead of confronting the horrors of the system that they're happening right in front of us. We can perform rituals of either a cruelty simulated in the form of voting and like what t-shirt you wear and what you post online and remember. This is a cruelty that is across the board of all liberal people who think that they're on top and think that when it comes to the the end of the line when they're when they're in the salo social republic they're assuming that they would be the ones who are the guests and not the the servants like if they close their eyes and put themselves in pasolini salo at the end of capitalism when it is the naked lunch at the end of your fork. Instead of this machinery of ritual and technology and distance and geography and culture and spectacle to get you to detach from it and and operate within it complicitly well also powerlessly and they say where are you going to be. If we got. Those conditions now where would you end up. We have elites and by that I mean even people who are aspiring to positions within the knowledge economy people who think I'm going to be a professor or I'm going to be a media professional. I'm going to be a a influencer but for the left.

I'm going to. I'm going to do these things. I forgot what I'm saying. I'm going to ritualize my anxiety about this situation about this horrifying precarity because I don't want to be the one watching that. I don't want to be the sallow person. I identify with the other. I have nietzsche's slave morality and so I can't even though I'm a ruler or I imagine myself that in the future. I'll be a ruler so you have to create a situation where the people who are suffering have it coming and it's not your fault and you're not in indulging in it. You're you're not doing it sexually and dominatingly the way that say the fascist the right wing would you're going to do it by punishing the guilty you're going to do it by guillotining and by being john brown at oswatomi. You're going to be able to carry out that violence not in a spectacle an orgy like the fascist would but in like a court of law a in a performance of of domination over over over righteous enemies. But obviously most of us would not most of us who are having these conversations and this is where a lot of the confusion comes in about things like the pmc. All the people within this discussion if they close their eyes and said where would you imagine yourself if you were going through like a portal to that period where would you imagine yourself and of course a lot of them would say actually.

I'd be the partisans. I'd be the communist partisans. No you would be at the sallow republic but will you be because the seller republic is the closing net the gilded caller coming around the next of those in the center of the global capitalist system as it pulls away from the periphery as the climate catastrophes. Accelerate so you're never going to be outside of it. You're always going to be in it and so you're either going to be on top or you're going to see yourself fall down to a position of total exploitation most the people who are talking about politics if you actually hold their soul. They would say that they would imagine that they would be on top but because of the trajectory of downward mobility in america because the final dissolution of the fortis compromise because of the fact that the that the home owning like semi-autonomous suburban yeoman of america that that their entire that their share of the capital pi has been.

Gone has been cut away for 30 years now 40 years now and you're just living off of the fat of this dead dead thing the american labor movement. They're just on the on on this corpse eating the fat of it. It is a cargo cult and so everybody who went to college thinking that they were going to get a job and be able to live a life like their parents their own place. Their kids some sort of sense of control over their their their leisure time. Their workflow and confidence that their children would have a future.

Those things are all gone but people still have those expectations because that's how they were brought up and that's the conflict. That's why you have people saying that the pmc is the new elite. No but do they fancy themselves that in the global conflict for con over resources that we're currently in the final grasp of for for air as as the water levels literally rise the continuation of the war that's been going on ever since the end of world war. Ii really to to create a economy as a giant hose sucking surplus to the west from the south to from to from the to the north from the south a giant hose and that's continuing in a context now of genuine accelerating entropy and a feedback loop whereby the externalities of capitalism which are not priced into capitalist transactions but exist.

Nonetheless in real life are accumulating and the system as it is cannot address them because it doesn't see them. It's dark matter in in the world according to the the rationalist approach that dominates our economic understanding of the world. That is what makes us do transactions. The way we do is premised on the notion that there is an outs exterior an outside of the transaction world where all of the friction accumulated in that transaction. All of the social alienation that accumulates from subjects who are forced into these conditions. All of the destabilization of the ecology that occurs from from changing things like carbon dioxide outputs and putting acid and plastic in the environment like actually changing things and in every one of those transactions that is assumed as the undergirding logic of the algorithm of profit. Extraction. That thing that is not priced just happens somewhere else but there is nowhere else to account for it the thing that's supposed to account for it.

I would say in the telia if there's a teleology of marxism. It is that this dark matter ends up creating its own articulation its own social reality that can then come into conflict with this broken system that cannot recognize what's in front of it that is the hope of class consciousness. But the machinery of class consciousness broke in the 70s. So we're now in a point where there is just this accelerating crisis that will only be resolved by it starting to break up and change the conditions and relationships that undergird these dynamics. Because they can be arrested and diverted at every point is the key. I've been listening to a very good podcast called fall of civilizations recently it's in the it's sort of in. I would say it's sort of in between dan carlin and like mike duncan or something.

It's it's pop history. But it's well researched and it's about different civilizations in decline and and it describing what those conditions what conditions brought it about and it's amazing when you exclude the ones where it's an outside invasion that emerges and changes like a rapid condition exogenously like like the The spanish invasions that you could argue that there were internal contradictions within the aztec state. Obviously there were but the definitive disruption of that relationship came from outside but then but excluding those where you have civilizations that collapse from within like the Like the mayas for example who started to decline long before the europeans got to latin america and or the the late bronze age or um greenland or the the khmers. The thing that they all have in common is that humans came together to adapt to their environment to create a system that allowed them to manage the the dangers the scarcity. That's the word the scarcity of their social conditions dictated by their geography that is what starts the building of civilization. Some people sitting around thinking of things to do directing resources doing ritual. Other people putting their nose to the physical grindstone of of creating a fixed agricultural civilization some working for it for others for others and then those people may be giving each other like some sort of payment to simulate an exchange that is like based on exploitation.

When really the exploitation is happening at the bottom and but the culture this is the important part as in the reified structures that people navigate mentally is created by the top. The structure of this social order is created at the top. It might be made out of like a social relationship a distribution of job of people um and then like the actual infrastructure of okay. We have surplus what do we do with it. What do we build with it well. Let's build some canals so that we can generate a more stable supply of of food so that we can have a larger population so that we can compete with other populations of people and so that we can um we can we can maintain stability and the structures that are created by the people who are sitting around all day are dictated are are determined by that this relationship where some work for behalf of others at the rate that they want. They're dictating the terms and that will persist until a climate-related shift that is often but not always precipitated by these specific actions that these civilizations have taken to change their relationship to the land and their relationship to to like human habitation. Like hey we're gonna sell here. We're gonna we're going to grow this here we're going to clear this land for more crops. We're going to move this water here like that 

That is all those decisions are made by those who are benefiting by the labor of others but they want to keep it that way so that means that when the feedback loop changes and those external changes to the the externalities put out into the into the ecology. The shifts that have been put on the you know the the randomness generator of like the natural world all start pushing in the same direction and then that pushes back and when that happens when you have a system of drop when you have a bunch of droughts that overflow your water systems or that you have a diminishment of global temperatures that reduce your pr crop fecundity and and you have you run out of arable land and the arable land. You have begins to be exhausted of minerals by over planting to sustain population growth that allows for the maintenance of your social structure and so when those externalities start piling up the system cannot recognize the cause of them because it is made up of dark matter. It's not built into the equation they don't understand it and so even though there are things they could do hypothetically to to address these crises and maintain homogeny maintain.

A social order maintain a social body. They fail because to change in a way that would be amenable that would maintain the social order like greatly like the social body that you're part of would require those at the top to actually do some work. It would have to change the distribution of labor within the system. Oh we can't hyper exploit others so that we can have and have more efficient agriculture so that we can have more surplus that can be eaten in the cities and eaten into temples well. We all dance around and do blood sacrifices and and look at our calendar to figure out why this is happening when the answer is right in front of our face and if we had applied the genuine um like presence of mind that that exemplifies the best imagined tradition of empirical science and engagement. If we had the eyes that we had had when we designed this system to confront the crisis now we could thing and so over and over again. The fall civilization is a civilization finding itself confronted with a change in the expectation of the the climate an expectation of how much water would come when how much fertility would exist in x amount of land.

How much how much calories you could get you could you could guarantee from a certain area because once you have a stable and sort of guaranteed house of calories. You can start distributing them and you can just start distributing them to build institutions of technology of social technology of of literal technology and scientific mind scientific acuity and bring it to the question of civilization. Like the the the thing that actually the mechanism that really does under gird alienated civilization. Pre-socialist civilization is This is the consumption is the urge. The consumption of those at the top defines the culture. It defines the actual superstructure and that is why the marginal revolution when it came really was the the triumph of capitalism as it emerged into itself into itself as a fully coherent concept that it says no lit. Production. Labor is not is not the value associated that is not where value comes from because the un fundamental idea that of the labor theory of value in my mind metaphysically is that because labor is unpleasant. The labor that is alienated and all labor under under regimes of control is alienated because you're not getting the benefit of it and you're not choosing to do it. You're not choosing to do it. Someone else is making you do it so it is alienated labor that is pain that accumulates in the system as feedback that has to be addressed that has to be sued that has to be transformed into something else and as long as culture is being made by people who produce even because there is a relatively small number at the top who are unable to whose culture is very contained. Like pre-modern civilizations.

They were what those guys were talking about and what they were making is much farther from the experience of the average person within that polity that is true in the modern world of mass literacy and mass media like those guys were living in a different world and inside the castles and inside the temples for one thing they could read. They could read and write which the vast majority of these people could not do that meant that they could spend their time endlessly building a culture and of course what the the temples are what's left so we look back and we say oh. That's the civilization. No that was this thing on top of the social order. The the real the real culture was going on at the base but that real culture is gone. We can't see it. It's dissolved all we have left is this and now we all live in it. We live in the temple because the temple is now the internet. The temple is the internet and we all live in it everybody who got to this x point where they are alienated but but comfortable enough to put time into creating a identity that extends beyond themselves into a cyber realm where their actual subjectivity.

Their human sense of self is no longer extricable from this network which is where we all are. Once we took over because technology allowed the smaller number a much larger group to emerge out of the exploitation of one group by another imperialism. The spoils of imperialism were were measured out at at the top not evenly but over time which created more leisure and more technology more importantly more time to spend in the cloud which makes your reality part of the cloud in a way that previous people were fundamentally not like this is a difference. This is where you go from a society that is that is bifurcated where we're only seeing half of it or or not even half by by only half by like relationship not half by numbers a minority that's what we get. That's all we've ever had and that is what how you have to have in a society that is a pre. That is dominance based but pre-modern that is class-based but pre-modern.

Once you have a modern social media. Once you have mass media. You have taken huge chunks of people who are being exploited and who get to live in the realm of the rulers they get to live in the cloud with the rich people. They get to live in the temple. They get to live in the temple of their minds while their bodies are doing actual labor and that is that's what's scary about. The moment is that if we are at now a point where this dark matter that is now pushing against our social order that has accumulated since we went to a global system. Once we created a world system. We created a closed economic system and all of our models are based on open ones. Every model we have of how humans interact and engage with each other are premised with interactions having externalities not priced in which means we're literally unable to see their contribution to this until it's too late because you could argue. It's too late. I think that to avoid a breakup from within to avoid that crack that fall of a civilization. But what that means is up to us because civilizations can fall in different ways. There's no there's nothing.

I would say that necessitates the fall of this civilization to be a totally apocalyptic and gen and omnicidal one which I think a lot of people assume and of course there is a lot of comfort in assuming that if you assume that then you can kind of feel like well it doesn't really matter what I do in a real in like a metaphysical sense and in in another. Just more selfish imaginative sense you don't have to die worried about missing stuff which is what I think a lot of people feel or have felt especially in. Moments of progress oh man what am I going to miss what what human heights are we going to scale that I'm going to miss you don't have to if you really think that that the light of humanity is going to be extinguished. In the next hundred years you can really you can do the saturn the bakanali now how at some point it's going to get too sadistic and you're going to have to ask yourself. What you actually care about but you can live in that gray zone for a while so that isn't to say that we aren't going to all die in 100 years or 200 years.

It is simply to say that any you cannot approach that question and answer it objectively. Because these are things that frankly none of us are equipped to know predicting the future is the hardest thing in the world. Understanding the past is is impossible. Predicting the future is equally impossible. It is absurd to do so and it's it's one of the lowliest intellectual pursuits and yet we can look at a question like this which we can break down into numbers like amount of carbon ex. Amount of carbon that we're producing amount of energy necessary amount of energy consumption. All these questions you can look at them all and get a pretty good map of where we're going with nothing changes and of course. That's the big if if nothing changes or if not enough change is fast enough but you're filling in the gaps in your own mind. You are not getting some perfect understanding and rendering of this.

You are looking through a glass darkly and you're filling in the spaces with what you want to be true even if you don't know you're doing it. This is the most important part it does not have to be conscious. In fact it isn't if it was conscious you'd have to deal with it. You get to keep it under and then it stains your reasoning like it does everyone's in a way that you cannot perceive so everyone who's like convinced that that's the case you have to. I think you should admit that the deciding factor in you believing that is not any extrapolation from data or rational response or considered thing. It is the the seductive freedom the seductive indulgence that it suggests because you really could say like what I'm not really hurting anybody yeah. I'm hurting a little people a little bit you know. I'm. I'm consuming carbon outside of my vastly outside of what I what I should as an individual I i subsist on the labor of other people in other countries and and the manufacturer and agricultural sectors to provide me with food. Even here domestically. I take advantage of people through delivery services and servant apps. But all that violence is sublimated and and I really am in many ways not responsible for it.

So why not just have fun and it's like yeah. You know what if you can convince yourself of that do it but at a certain point you're going to hit it where it doesn't work anymore. The hedonic treadmill eventually leaves you exhausted you will be left exhausted. You'll be left a husk because the pleasures over time become familiar and therefore less pleasurable and also just the the the The sensuous energies. The the chemical and hormonal and your physical components of of sensation forget even sensuality sensuality in general not even sexuality sensuality in general sensual pleasures and those even include like the pleasures of The pleasures of like soporific indulgence are also those like being lazy is that too those all go that the ability to to feel sensuously is also adult physically and just through repetition and you're still going to be in this condition where you're headed towards the in the furnace but also feeling guilty and powerless guilty and miserable then that that can't be masked anymore and once you get to that point you have to say what do. I do and the the the problem with trying to coordinate action. Among people who are all experiencing.

This is that everybody is at a different point in that trajectory. The dream the fantasy the mystical hope of like a universal awakening comes from the idea of everybody getting to the same point at the same time. The same point of this isn't working anymore at the same time and so we're all floating through space trying to grab each other and form a human chain away from being cast into the sun. Basically we are reaching out and grabbing at each other and we're being scattered through space by the momentum that we've had by our accumulated interactions. We're just bouncing off of one another through space. The only way we're gonna. Avoid getting eaten by the sun is if we all get our hands together and move in the same direction and that by doing that we can change our our physical presentation. Our material arrangement towards the sun our relationship to it and and push us into a stable orbit and that comes from people reaching a similar point of disillusionment with the life as they've known it and a similar need to change directions to avoid catastrophe avoid avoid a crack up that can no longer be smothered that's not going to happen naturally that would it would be too un improbable.

That's just what it boils down to. These are all random we're all in that random particles bouncing off of each other. The odds that any of us are going to get into a point where we can have a meaningful moment of of clarity is is randomized too so it would be the ultimate lottery when it would not never. It's just it would not happen but people are still always bouncing off of each other and they're always bouncing off of concepts and ideas and experience and they're all having experiences and when they line up the light right way like on a codex or a a combination lock it pop something and then if that happens you can change the direction that you're going you know those little those little if somebody saw gravity with clooney where he's going around on the chair and he's able to change his direction with the little. Oxygen spurts that those little moments are those little are our spurts that allow us to reorient ourselves but of course they're not constant.

I mean you'd have to be an ascended plane for them to be constant. Most of us are regular people. We have flashes then we go back to being normal and then we have to live in that normal space until we have another flash but we can array ourselves in those moments between with little spurts and then increase the likelihood that we're going to bang into somebody else and maybe change their trajectory by making them have one of those moments and then you can start moving in a direction with others and using just your bodily. The accordion like muscle tension to move you through space so if you accept that your black-pilled convec convictions come from not your best rational mind but your most your worst most indulgent mind if you accept that and then operate from the premise that therefore you are still an agent of history. You still have a a responsibility to yourself and everybody else to move through space and time in harmony with it because otherwise it will make you miserable forget everybody else.

This is the difference between puritanism and real spirituality is the puritanism says no the fact that you're not get you're not enjoying. It is makes it better which of course creates the whole perverted superego. Dictatorship of the modern liberal who is a descendant of the puritan mind you do it because it feels good you do it because it is good for you. It provides you to feel harmonious which is the ultimate the ultimate distillation of when we say what does it mean to feel good in any abstract sense. What does it mean to feel right to feel home to feel. Safe. Secure to be validated is in harmony with the moment. Most of us never feel that because we're being ground through this thing without any awareness of where we're going or anything and the ability to to not allow the feelings the emote. The the physical feelings associated with our life to dominate and dictate our the mental world we live in well.

I was supposed to do book club requests today and I didn't really look at the chat. So let's do it now. If anyone has any ideas speaking of books it was announced today that I signed the contract with zero books to do a book called behold a fail horse which is going to be some transcripts and edited and and polished of course of interviews with me maybe an essay based on these last few that I feel like have been pretty pretty helpful. I feel like. I'm getting somewhere. It's never going to be finished but at some point I'm going to say good enough. That's for sure somebody said the black jacket is by clr james and that is not a bad suggestion.

I will take that into account. I'm not going to necessarily say now. But that's the leader in the clubhouse. I just got done listening to my friend everett's really good napoleon podcast series on the haitian war of independence and it is making me been thinking about haiti a lot so yeah. It's called age of napoleon. Let me let me plug that one of the best history podcasts out. There he uses napoleon basically as a lens to look through the the the the the phenomenon of like europe's final. Messy birth into full modernity like napoleon is basically the midwife of modern europe. He pulls that baby out of the mother gets the forceps in there yanks her out history on horseback just yanking that baby out of the gap. So he's a very useful character to examine the whole process through because that really is that that period from from the revolutionary war to probably congress of vienna. There you've got 

I would say there's two there's three crucial flash point conflicts that define the that define the the the trajectory of capitalism as it breaks free of containment basically in europe because capitalism starts off as just the accumulation of a bunch of practices ideas and technologies which had existed throughout human history. The chinese famously had most of them but even in europe they'd existed in some form or another throughout its period in its existence and even back in the the greco-roman era. What happened specifically in in modern europe though is that you had a a the creation of a technologically advancing social order coming into um coming to a point of crisis created by first the the the black death and its incumbent. It's a change of property relations.

It's undermining of ruling class authority. Like there is a long-term crisis of authority at the top of feudalism that emerges from the black death because there's so much more land because of all. The people who died that the individual agricultural workers had a much better hand that they could play. They could withhold their labor at their own terms because they could always just live off the land and the response to that is enclosure the creation of a a landless peasantry who would have to sell their labor to live that's and that's where capitalism comes from as a response to the crisis created by the The crisis created by um the black death and colonialism was part of the process of solving that and at first it did it sued the engine a little bit it.

It brought in currency into the system which was very important. But I would say that once you have that explosion and you have this the emergence of these forces the unleashing of the bourgeois basically that occurs at the beginning of of the of the fourteen hundreds of the fifteen hundreds. It culminates you know in it the first big crisis. The first third continent wide crisis that runs it apart and it makes it have to break. It has to break up the foundations of the system that it accumulated to that point is the period from the 30 years war basically. I would say from the beginning of the 80 years war in the netherlands through the 30 years war. Including this the english civil war and ending with the glorious revolution of 1688. You have a political revolt of broadly the bourgeois over the landed aristocratic nightly class of europe that had been the rulers of feudalism that fight starts in the immediate aftermath of the of the black death. It accumulate it culminates in this crisis and then the creation of the westphalian system of competing states that are eternally coherent and have like and whose sovereignty is respected across borders sort of as assumption.

Like if you are the head of state by that definition. You are the legitimate ruler of that area like the the your rulership and this is still how we understand sovereignty now in international law basically until the the people who are in charge say different. But at the time there were none like so within the system is whoever is in charge is the legitimate government so that means that you know this. This breaks up the the dreams of universal monarchy or a religious basis for authority and rulership which had broken up over the pr. Pro. The reformation nope we're doing realpolitik. We're doing nations. We can't do religion if we do religion everyone's going to die. We learn that in the 30 years war if we do religion everyone is going to die so we'll do it on nations and nations started to compete with one another and out of this competition. The system that best accommodated that competition was the one that most assiduously took the mechanisms of capitalism and use that to make their economic structure more efficient at extracting surplus and that was the the constitutional monarchy of of the of the hanoverians.

It took a long fight they had to kill a king. They had to have a who came over after a job interview and agreed to basically let the burgers run the show because it worked it got them it got them money. It got them control of resources in the rest of the world. It got them rulership over the sea of over the seas. It got them an empire where the sun would never set and then so europe starts competing on that browns. The other states have to play catch-up. Now the main other state is france. France is doing catch-up with britain. That's why it's fighting with britain. In these wars. It's exchanging slugs but losing all the way because it does not have this efficient structure. Its burgers have not been empowered and so once the crisis is within it become too accumulated.

It pops off in 1789 with a bourgeois revolt there and then that bourgeois revolt culminates in the figure of napoleon as the english civil war culminated in the figure of cromwell who then marches across the the grand knights of malta you are you have been creatively destroyed in the shumperterian sense that was what the french the french revolution and then the napoleonic wars were. It was because europe was never england. After the hundred years war was always looking in other directions. It wasn't looking at europe. It never really was. It was like okay. We're not going to be a european power in that sense but we're going to wield power elsewhere. France was still a european power and so it brought the competition of the bourgeois state that had been pretty much dominated by the dutch and the english before that point who'd been fighting each other until they had a a leveraged buyout which is what happened the dutch. Basically oh the hanoverians came came later but william of orange was a dutchman. Literally the the the ex. The exhausted dutch republic being being bought out is basically by by the british so the french bring this bourgeois revolt to the european continent and then through superior adaptation to the marketplace. They just carve up all these less efficient feudal remnants and they replace them with with a modern with modern people.

Modern conceptions of nationalism that is now not just a state project but a middle-class political project oh my god. Now you've got a whole new basis to undergird this thing nationalism ethno-nationalism. Hell yeah. Now you don't need now this thing that's bigger and more unwieldy and has much more. Complicated social structure and and mechanisms of of of culture that have to be maintained and more and more people who have to be put to idle work. Mind work. More and more minds are going to be idle and they have to have something to do give them nationalism build. A state now you've got a project well capitalism is still grinding around behind these people disrupting them undermining their structure and exhausting their their ability to max to do profit in the closed system of their of their of their individual economies and that conflict in in a in a political context of nationalism. There you got your third big explosion 1914-1945 and so we're now in the aftermath of that when when the national model was essentially broken and replaced by international capitalism and institutions cultural political and most importantly economic replace national ones. International capital is truly born in that era and now we are living in this totalized capitalism.

But there's nothing left to convert can to transition. That belief to this is the crisis. This is why it's the final crisis when when the divine right of kings was extinguished over the course of the 17th century it was not that faith didn't just evaporate it had to go somewhere and it went to individual. Like religion it went to confession. It was there of the reformation after all the king schming we need to be able to define ourselves by our religious tradition well okay that holds for a little bit but then the 17th century shows up Oh that's not good turns out religion can't do it either and over the course of the 17th century you have the emergence of this new liberal nationalism.

This idea that we are all individuals pursuing individual self-interest but within a framework of identity within a box within humanity and then we fought that out until it became no longer tenable after in the crisis of the early 20th century. Because periodic crisis are are emblematic and definitive of capitalism. It continues there will always be cyclical crisis of of increasing devastation because of increased extinguishment of the system and increased just by literally population and cultural density. Now all that we have is ourselves. That's all we've had since the end of 45 is ourselves as individuals and there's there's no way to fight. Back. Within that framework is the thing that's that's where that's where we're kind of screwed we have to build it ourselves. These other things are built in by the superstructure of capitalism. These things were inscribed in the culture that we all imbibed the religious confessionalism. The liberal nationalism. They were all embedded within the thing now though there's nothing embedded because the social has disappeared they were directly ruled in a way that we've never been before in a society that doesn't have the total technological control that ours does and when I say technological. I mean just to the power of the money form the fact that you cannot in most of the world live outside of the cache nexus that is a genuine enslavement.

That's why it's so funny when people say. I'm not going to live in the cube and I'm not going to eat bugs. You already live in the cube. You already eat bugs because all other systems of life are closed off you cannot live outside of them. I mean my god how are you. What's the difference between like some nice clean roasted crickets and whatever taco bell one time. I and I'm not saying. It's. I eat the bugs because I eat that. I'm not gonna act like there's a line. I won't let cross because the line doesn't exist. You will always accommodate it because you're comfortable and that is the point of the fall.

Civilizations. Thing is that the civilization can never correct because it cannot undermine its own control. People within it are too wedded to it because they cannot imagine living outside of it. They cannot imagine living with their hands. They cannot imagine living no longer within the systems of esteem and comfort and consumption that they have generated oh. The marginal revolution is just the situation where culture where the steering wheel of humanity is hijacked fully by a self-conscious bourgeois which then imposes itself on a public on a for national and international subject because we are consumers. It is the consumer's choice that defines the market and the thing is that is a correct understanding of how the movement works in capitalism because it moves towards need it.

It moves towards power and need the needs of those in power or next to power who benefit from powers overwhelming and overflowing largesse which is what we have a giant suction system of need and so we build a culture out of the consumption and then we look at it and say culture is consumption and therefore we are consumption and that's only possible because of how alienated we are from ourselves as workers and how few of us do meaningful work within the The little ice age kept the froze all the the waters between greenland and iceland or the or or 30-year drought or the like. The fifth year of the drought hit anker watt. That's not a drawing of me. That's paul. Giamatti thank you very much that's a famous paparazzi shot of him on the subway looking glum and gmatty-esque. So the more but the marginal revolution is part of that general process of economists describing the world as capitalism makes it and then refining it as natural law. Even though it is the contingent best interest of the capitalist class at a given moment which is in conflict with the best interest of the species and the planet because of all these unpriced externalities that the ruling class is unaware of and can't see their material interests cannot recognize it because their material interests in the near term depend on it.

So we find ourselves in a situation where people from the guys who say. I won't eat the bugs. The people who say we're gonna we're gonna guillotine all the rich people to the people who say I need. I'm keeping my guns so that when they come forward I can I could go down like a man and I can fight for my rights. That moment has been passed for everyone in this bubble like the guy with the gun. What he thinks that gun represents is the frontier mastery of the self that the early yeoman american farmers had or imagined. They had or at least had a much they imagined it too. But they actually had the ability to live off the land. They could live off the land they could live outside of the market. They were free from the market that gun is just the way to keep that state of affairs. We have people now who think that they're in that same position and who think that that gun represents the is the guarantor of that position who have been fully stripped from their ability to sustain themselves who have been fully atomized and made them and are fully at the mercy of the market. They cannot live outside the market. The market sustains them it's like getting booted out of the matrix without their zion. To catch you boot it out of the matrix to die of exposure in a public park. That's what we have and that is the that's what the extravagant public cruelty display of homelessness in this country is meant to convey so that gun is a trinket. That gun is a is. A is a is a symbol not of rights that you're defending but of rights you've lost. That's what that gun represents because your right is to go on a shooting spree.

Your right is to get shot by to do suicide by cop okay but you're not gonna do that and by the time you do it it'll be a lost cause and even your dream of being part of some wolverine zest resistance will mean nothing. It will be a pathetic orgy of a pointless bloodshed and you'll know it. That's the important part you'll know it. You'll know that it's a farce you won't go down smiling. You won't go to yourself and crying if you get up the balls to do it which you won't. You will either accede to what they want you to do or. If you say no or if you just can't hack what their new demands are mentally you get kicked out you get up to go on the other side of the human line. You are no longer a person. You are a homo saucer and at that point it doesn't matter what you do with. That gun go nuts you have no ability to threaten anyone that matters saucy homer all right well.

I didn't talk too much about the book club although I gotta say jack black. Jacobins is leading in the clubhouse because you guys know. I'm all about alternative history. I'm trying to do some projects along those lines and I've been thinking a lot about haiti as a result. Haiti reconstruction 1918. Like the real the real protean moments the real. The real lubricated joints in the structure um but yeah. I won't we won't say for next week but I'll think about it and announce if I want to do it. I'll see I'll go seek out get my hands on a copy unless I think of something else. Though. It's the leader in the clubhouse you.
