Um she thinks laughs a dog. She thinks lasts a dog on fire hurley burley by man man that's a good song I always thought that would be good uh at bat music. I said that I wanted my uh my hipster ass baseball closing pitching music to be two plus two equals five by radiohead. I think even more obnoxious would be doing a man-man song as my at bad music for officers for a free officers movement in america my kingdom for jerry rawlings. Ah man talked before about how like you know in a context of of unveil of of of compounding crises you know like if we assume that uh there isn't really a respite after covid. If if the next step after covet is an intensification rather than a remitting a relapsing and remitting uh uh admiseration which I think is unlikely but possible. Then you gotta throw politics out the window entirely. The only hope we have to to like stop the skid off of the end of the mountain and into the abyss of just total atomized. Uh uh techno overlordship is going to be the us military. I mean no joke not of course.

The monsters at the top of it. Not those joint chiefs of staff were mostly monstrous because of their banality. I mean these are all just eichmann's. They're all eichmann's not in the sense that they did as great evil as eichmann did even though of course. They're perpetuating militarily the great blood fountain of american empire which has a massive  body count itself. They are eichmann in their way that they approach their butchers. Lives is with uh total blank banality. It is time service. It isn't even like you could say about a figure like hitler. It isn't even some expression of a mad will to power that is at least connected to a human spiritual yearning even if it's corrupted and monstrous. They are merely punching a clock in the service of a misery. I mean the only reason they're able to do. It is because they've been abstracted from the process like eichmann was in his little room with his little typewriter same way. These guys are in their little centcoms looking through their. Uh night vision goggle shots of exploding weddings.

I think how many military males we got in there oh so good uh 30-45 well. There we go good job guys. We have now reduced that number of terrorists because as we all know the number of terrorists is fixed and therefore the job of fighting terrorism is just killing them until they're all gone. That's how it works right so they tell themselves as they punch the clock. They're never. Gonna stop anything from happening they'll become amazon generals they'll just get inducted into the bezos like peter thiel division and they won't even think about it.

Traditionally where there has been uh not not socialist not marxist but at least progressive and like broadly. I don't know humanitarian populist sentiment within the military. It has come from its middle ranks. Uh it is the all of all of the non-re non like of all the military regimes of all. The coup imposed regimes uh of the 20th century. Uh all the ones that were not strictly reactionary like strictly existed to serve the interest of of the most retransited. Uh uh um faction of like the the national bourgeois you know like your pinochets uh the ones who whose regimes did not just become like authoritarian imposition of neoliberalism. Uh they all occurred because middle level officers like lieutenants often captains sometimes colonels very very rarely generals get together and because a lot of them come from working class backgrounds you know they're not. The military is broadly uh egalitarian in its uh.

In its in fact. It's disproportionately weighted now in our military specifically and generally in the history. It's disproportionately weighted towards poorer people in terms of the number of people who make it up because of the need to uh. Because you need numbers you need cannon fodder and those aren't going to come from people with money. If you're in the if you have money if you have position if you have status and you're going into the military. It's in exchange for a shiny shiny sword and a beautiful red uniform and a guarantee that you'll never have to do a  push-up in your life but you get to ride around at a fancy horse and sit sit and sip tea and order other people into their deaths or maybe charge along them grandly but from the front so that your debt is part of a grand narrative that their deaths can never be one way or another. Uh you want rank and therefore you're a reactionary and so the top levels of the military will always end up selecting for that in the middle rank you have some upstarts. You have some people who came from the bottom started from the bottom. Now they're here or maybe from the restive and always and always uh liminal middle class and then you encounter army mel uh military organization military esprit de corps military education which is going to be broadly liberal in a way that's going to conflict with the uh you know if you have a nationalist conception with you have to if that nationalism goes beyond this narrow ruling clique which is more likely to happen if you come from the bottom part of it. All of a sudden that national concept is not strictly reactionary and so where does this happen free officers movement in egypt nasa of course. I mean no matter where they ended up and how degraded they end up of the bath revolutions in iraq and uh uh syria um and also gaddafi which by the way gaddafi.


I don't think is a great man. I think that you know he he belongs. Among the pantheon applies who are able to stand up to america and you kind of have to give all those guys credit. You have to respect them just because of how difficult that was uh but uh and you know he wasn't. He did not uh fully sign up. He was always playing a double game until it stopped working for him and he did forever and another thing. I respect about the  he uh he never promoted himself to general. The guy was a colonel when they took power when the green movement that he was ahead of took power and then he was in charge for 40 years and he never promoted himself to general. He was always a colonel and I respect that humble um who else uh the.

I mean the most like the most like explicitly left-wing movement actually had the support of a number of actual communists and I'm referring here to the carnation revolution in 1974 in portugal when when young officers some of whom were you know just liberals some who were disenchanted conservatives everybody who was sick of the estado novo. The decrepit salazar sort of uh corporatist government like proto-fascist I guess uh government that had ruled since the 20s uh before franco came up the ghost and there was an attempt to maintain the estado novo to maintain. More importantly. The colonial brush fire wars that portugal was fighting to maintain their territory in angola and mozambique where portuguese boys were going to fight and die including the friends of these officers and they came together and with their educations and their experiences and said holy. You know we have a chance here and they carried off something that could have tipped into a like a military-led communist uh uh overthrow. There it didn't because the weight of like the the center of gravity was not with the communists in portugal.

It was it was with the left more broadly which means that it would eventually settle more towards liberalism which in the context of the heart of cold war europe. It's hard to argue would have really had any other way of going and you know the early communist leaders of the kardashians revolution ended up kind of regretting what happened because it did you know it ended with port but you know now here in this crisis moment when everyone's turning to  and everything is turning. We're just getting either like the iron boot of biden bidenist macronut mercellian thought like the global just uh the jack boot of of naked uh neo-liberalism or just the incoherent. Uh uh reactionary dog-brained populism. The spectaclized uh fantasy politics of bolsonaro and trump and  orbit and all these motherfu. All these main cases all these martinets where is the place where those aren't the dominant tendencies.

Portugal is one and you can say that portugal's left-wing government has made compromises and is undermining. You know some broad left movement internationally such that it exists. But I would argue that in the context of where you could be in uh in the current moment where your government could be in response to dealing with this covet crisis and the way it's reshaping the economy uh and way of life. I would rather be in portugal and they had one of those uh colonel's movements. Chavez began his rise to power with an attempted coup before he well. They took that the uh like the position that having struck that blow and created that crete core for for freedom people gravitated towards problem is the united states. Military. Our our thing is almost designed to squeeze out anyone with any capacity if not you know for for left-wing sentiment because I'm sure there's plenty of broad liberals in the in the young officer corps. Some of whom could could if conditions deteriorate and they're forced to make you know more stark choices about choosing between profit and human life.

They might choose human life. They might choose socialism or barbarism as the choice becomes more clear but even if they wanted to they have no initiative or ability. Their their job is to push the buttons in this giant wheezing machinery of mil of war where winning is not the point of it. This is one of the first military. This is a very rare thing in the military where it is designed to not do the thing that it's supposed to be functioning for like when you go into the military. It is. You're taught that the role of the military is to win wars. But the actual role of the us military is to fight wars and those are two different things and having to live that lie it's unsustainable and I mean I i I don't know how many people who find themselves like tending towards humanity and towards socialism and away from capitalism and barbarism. They might just get turfed out before they have a chance to get even to the  junior officers level. But I have said that is speculation. I have very little familiarity with the military.

I'm a soft fancy college boy. I didn't go to. I didn't go where I'm from it really does come down to a lot of cases. You go to military or you go to college. That's that's the the choice in like uh yeah manitowoc which is like a a fly spec mini duck rust belt town that had been a um a maritime hub. It's actually where half of the submarine fleet was built during world war ii. The other half was built in pennsylvania and there's a sub uss kobe. You can go and visit in manifold and they had a big uh they created. I think they still make the uh the manitowoc uh cranes. I think uh. But there was like a pot pad factory and it was all going away as I was coming up there as I was com like coming into awareness because I really was born with the neoliberal era there in the early 80s and so.


I was uh seeing it all fall apart before my eyes and so by the time I get out of I got out of high school. Like if you go to the military unless you want to stick around in like huff blue or you can work or you work at a farm with your family and you want to do that you know and there were farm people. Around there. It's all surrounded by farmland uh or you uh you had to go to college or the military. Those are your options and because of what my experience of life had led me to weird quirks of biology and experience. I mean the  uh back injury being one of them that would have disqualified me even if nothing else had although honestly.

I don't think I could have joined the military if I wanted to I'm deaf in one ear. I don't think I think I wouldn't have even like. I wouldn't have been drafted in world war one world war ii. I would have been 4f with the hat because like I hear that people got denied uh service in world war ii which was not something. People really dodged like you really wanted to fight because it was so socially expected uh but people like not getting it because of  flat feet and I'm like god damn. I literally can't hear other half of my head. I bet they would not have let me in even then but anyway so but then like even if I've been able bodied and and whatever my temperament my experience my interests. My social self sense of self was not really compatible with the military. It did not appeal to me so hey college get. Some scholarships take up some money see what happens there and I made that choice. But there are those who go through the officer corps which is essentially the college of the military branch. That's the college of uh the military like vector there and then you come out of that and you've got a bunch of ideas. You know you've assimilated some you rejected others. You have some sort of sense of self politically even if you think you don't because a lot of those guys love to think that they're apolitical but of course.

That's also a political position in one way or another. They are thoroughly political. They are political politicized which means they're encountering. This moment of crisis and deprivation is the same way we are how will people respond as things get worse and that's why I say if this if the slide is intense. I don't think there's enough time for us to build up the infrastructure to resist it at a class level as a working-class movement to withdraw work in a strategic way in order to reduce the system's ability to function so that some sort of confrontation has to come to be had with capitalism. Like I said this is all presupposing one trajectory uh in that case. I think we got to just we got to be hopeful that that cast exists somewhere but like I said that is the less likely outcome but you know that's got to be something that people think about and you know keep stirring in the pot there when they think about things. Long term is the military because it is like the biggest only trusted nonpartisan institution in this country like we've talked about how we're in the among the politicized of us. We're creating a new dichotomy between two groups of people who live in alternative realities not just to the point where they think different things but that they essentially pay homage to the authority of only things of their choosing and in that case you really don't have any institution that can be ever ever hope to tame really out of control social uh violence or even uh just a rapid decline of you know coherence of an economy and it's in a civil order but yeah as I I'm speculating on a hypothesis but certainly does complicate the way a lot of people like on the left people who style themselves leftists like to think about the military.

Like yes it is uh. It is an agent of doom. It is our worldwide uh. It's it's what rends the sinews of the earth for us. But the people within it have to be understood to be in roughly the same relationship personally and culpability wise to the real exercise of this machinery as plenty of people who you would call comrade within the united states and so that's uh why you know it. Just things always need to be more nuanced. But we always just drive towards oppositions and bernie did have the most military donors and also as frederick jameson has pointed out. The us military is one of the few places where you actually live in some semblance of a social democracy. In this country you know obviously it's threadbare and getting worse over time because cuts everywhere austerity everywhere but you go you go into unlike any other place in american life. If you decide to go to college or you decide to learn a trade or or try to you know hustle or whatever the hell you're trying to do uh in in the in the wage economy. If you join the military you are guaranteed certain things like housing like health care in exchange for a civic engagement your duty that's actually how those are people.

That's that's the social order that would like hypothetically create a uh and sustain a social democracy or challenge capitalism coherently but of course the argument here is well. None of this is going to lead to socialism or a socialist revolution obviously not obviously not what it might do is stop not stop of course but slow change the trajectory of reduce the intensification of the process of full atomization and social dissolution and spiritual dissolution. Any literal physical dissolution that is occurring under this crisis-ridden death spiraling neoliberalism and then maybe in in that context you can work from there. It's easier to work in a room that's not filling with water. It's easier to do a crossword puzzle. If  vents so yeah. Now this is is prescriptive beyond that. It's like well what about uh you know should people be joining the military. I don't know these are all decisions.

People have to make on themselves but I do know that the the totalizing work of of defining yourself online through having a rigid approach to reduced binary questions is is. How is is a recipe for someone who cannot engage the world around them. Uh positively cannot is not likely to create the feedback loop that that produces a positively charged social interaction that can actually sustain itself but yeah. I would not I mean I obviously even if I could. I would not have joined the military ever. I couldn't imagine myself doing any of that uh even if I wasn't even if I was guaranteed. I wouldn't be in a theater of war but the thing is you can't guarantee that and that is the big reality that underscores all of this and that lends such like real um emotion charged feeling to the question of the military and society because while we're talking about this it's killing people while we're speaking it's killing people. I mean in every sense. Not only is it a machinery of death.


Not only does it by its name by its very existence rob american citizens and citizens globally of well-being and wealth and health and possibility to thrive uh. It's actually also the single largest corporate uh climate emitter in the world. It's killing us at every level. That's bad. It makes sense that people want to make this a like at the signal issue and then there's a question of solidarity. How do you say that. You have solidarity with the victims of empire if you're conspiring with the perpetrators of the violence of empire which I say that is the I mean that's the contradiction at the heart of organizing in the imperial core. But it's unresolvable and the reason people love arguing about it is because it's unresolvable because it will always lead to more arguing veterans.

I think uh would be a ver and and the thing about veterans is and this is a reason that I don't think that we're going to get to anything with the democrats and republicans. I feel like. At this point. The brand of the democrats has been so spoiled among. I would say veterans as a category broadly and certainly white veterans and of course. That's racism as a reason for that but a lot of it is unnecessary. A lot of it is around charged vacant political theater that doesn't actually result to have anything to do with the parties. Themselves like everybody can point out tediously that them actually democrats give more money to the military and they give more money to va offers and they their policies would help veterans yeah sure but that's not how it's experienced.

It's experienced as a cultural slugfest between performances of value and the democratic performance of value is even if like joe biden and those guys the political people try hard to counteract it. At the cultural level. The associated elements are hostile to it and and that means that the thing that's going to come up the thing that's going to catch among us. If it's going to is going to come in the form eventually eventually probably of some sort of party formation and it will be outside of that dynamic because that's the only way that you could breach the the the hall of like a localized labor and political movement uh onto one that people are aware of in the media sphere and then one into which people are moving towards elsewhere. The generation of political momentum you're not going to have uh that if you have to deal with a lot of the  about democrats and culture stuff and also if you're if you're a post lefty who wants the republicans to do it. It means the republicans can't do it either because the republicans are the party of racism. The republicans are the party of hatred of minorities and  immigrants and hostility to women as equal citizens that's not going anywhere either so nobody's working class person. No matter where they are demographically is going to be able to adhere to one of these parties uh enough to get a broad swath of working-class people that operate from a class perspective because they're alienating the other half and you need one of those halves to get with the people who aren't part of this  and you can say but it's not fair that the democrats aren't the part are considered not to hate troops and it is fair that the republicans are racist that doesn't matter yeah. You don't want to talk about a third way because that's I mean that was originally fascism if you talk about the military part people's hairs are really going to get back in the heads about fascism and then of course it was the you know neoliberal neo-fascism of the current. Uh the current trajectory either way no thank you but uh that only makes sense if you think that the two ways we have now are like a left and right.

They're not. It's actually more of a second way. Like the current way is one way. It's one big thing nothing is going to change. It's locked. The gears are frozen. We're tumbling off of the end of the thing politics is dead within this structure. So anything that comes outside of it is an alternative to that so it's a second way. I.e socialism because fascism was a third way in a real contest between capital and labor. It was it was a real donny brooke. Those commies looked like they would have they had old uh rich uncle penny bags on the run for a minute there until fascism showed up to save capitalism's ass that is not the situation we're in right now world where politics has become a a a trump low. It's it's a  an illusion and we're we're fixated by it. While uh the actual politics is fixed.

The chinese are tweeting about australian war crimes. They have entered the game folks. China is entered the mine space. They are going to try to weaponize human rights just like we do and it is going to be delightful. Oh man. Seeing people tie themselves into contortions to try to out woke one another in their justification of bloodshed. Because of course all of this talk about human rights is strictly for the eggheads. It's strictly for the don't be in. No one else is listening to that or cares so that means the language will get more and more horrifyingly grotesquely uh diversity uh infused yeah. My real dream is you know. I said it's gonna come down to china versus uh america well how about a couple of officers movements high-fiving in the middle what about that to get rid of the like. The top at the the top and corporate merger or confrontation how about one of those huh how lightly is it not not very.


But the good news is if you think about it. Nothing is likely because none of these there are so many probabilities and none of them uh mean anything until they've resolved into one state or another which means you can't look at anything until it's already happened and that the whole thing of likely or unlikely is much less important than understanding the greater structures. It's not whether your predictions are good or not. It's about whether you feel like you are grounded in your analysis and then you can extend it for a bit but the further you extend the  mistier. It gets because contingencies pile up upon one another and render every subsequent moment just uh vastly more difficult to calculate because of the amount of randomness involved. The cat is neither dead nor alive the cat the cat is floating through like we all are like. I talked about how the election was sort of opening of the box and I think it was an opening of the box for one thing. But it only opened the box on that thing. Now we got to deal with that that's a dead cat okay but there's a bunch of other cats. Here there's a bunch of other boxes. None of them have been opened yet and all we can really tell by that that box is maybe looking which direction we're likely to see. The next box grasping in in broad strokes not through I mean and of course what this is what I'm talking about like at the level of theory. The good news is while people talk like this well. People are operating at this level. People are operating at the level of technology people are operating at the level of personal engagement. The movement being built as I speak the contours of which are coming into view what it is.

I don't know no one even knows they're part of it and no one will until it's already happened so if you want to say there's no hope that nothing can be good. That doom is inevitable well honestly that doesn't really change anything because you're still going to be living a life. You're still going to have people you love unless you're just going to kill yourself which you're not going to do you're going to live your life. You're going to have people in your life that you love you're going to try to make your their life better. The more you love the people around you. The more your people you're. Gonna love the more you're gonna care about them which means the more likely. You are when a situation comes where you can all help each other you do it and then you're doing it and you're moving towards the same goal as somebody who has the perfect outline in their head and never lost faith and never took the black pill you're going to end up doing the same thing doesn't matter what got you there intellectually. That's oh that's that's just following after your heart pulling you in a direction you're hard pulling you gravitationally towards other hearts and like that is just to say like. It's fun to talk about this stuff and it should inform you your life one way or the other. It's tough to talk about think people need things to talk about people need things to think about and things that help them make sense of the world are better than things that make the world more murky and make them more angry and make them more scared because they understand it. Less like those things have help they have benefit but they cannot be the thing that makes you act.

They can't be because you will just be missing the forest for the picture of the trees you know. I realize that there is something to that oh that horrible saying that people uh that love to who who want to avoid uh any kind of account any sort. They want to do politics purely for clout and have no interest in actually changing anyone. The old anyone's mind are making the world better that is the old it's not my job to educate you think and that is obviously incredibly cynical when used and it is used specifically so that people can get out of justifying their beliefs because one it's it's hard two. It's frustrating uh. I.e not fun and three. It's actually impossible for some of them because they don't even know why they believe what they believe because deep down. They're operating off of social signals and they haven't reasoned to that point. So if they get into an argument or they get into a thing where they have to educate they might run out of knowledge and they can't run out of knowledge publicly without undermining their position and status. They always have to bluff that they know more that is essentially a call of blood if they don't have to. They won't and since then they can just say that and that lets them opt out. But I think one thing that makes people say that that isn't just craven and isn't purely just about clout is the fact that uh there is something to it if you extend it to.

It's not my job to educate you about everything and that's the big problem with one of the big. Problems with this online thing is that everybody is operating off the premise that they have to be a  expert on everything they have to be at comment on everything uh and so when they're asked why do you believe this they might not really know but also it might not matter that they don't know because it's not really their job in life. It's not what they know about. It's not what they can communicate. There is something they do know and can communicate and if you ask them about that they'd be able to they would want to answer you because they would be happy to share. But nobody nobody is in that position. Everyone is in the position of trying to bluff each other around knowing and that's why a lot of the questions and the the the things people are supposed to educate you about end up just being like contested sides of an argument rather than any useful insight because that's all you're really trying to do is tell somebody. The right side of an argument to take not any practical application to your life so everybody shouldn't be  career on being the generalist loudmouth and it's like yes fair cop and that's. I'm one of the people who helped create a incentive structure for people who go online to talk about politics which was if you just act like you know everything about everything enough people will take you seriously. They'll pay you to talk and then you don't have to do anything you ever work anymore which is what we're all trying to do is avoid the  wood chipper.

The wood chipper that is whittling around us at every moment of our lives or as we perceive it as such even if we're materially relatively secure what I'm saying is that now you know. I think it's a time to like pick which you think you can confidently articulate and I feel like. I have found through a lot of bullshitting and a lot of uh a lot of public uh you know thinking through. I have found like a a dimension of like human thought conception whatever information that I feel relatively confident about talking about of course just by luck. It's the stuff that's easiest to learn about because it's really just about absorbing information and then collating it. You don't need to apply it the way that a scientist does that's why I respect them or apply it in any real sense because you don't have any you don't really have like co-workers or customers in the traditional sense so you're not bound by those relationships. Uh it's a weird place to be. But it's left me here feeling like okay. This is stuff. I can talk about and I really try not to talk. I'm trying to wean myself off of talking about anything. I don't feel like. I have something to really add and that's why I'm like cutting myself away from predicting things besides trying to sketch out like a three-dimensional model for like the slice of time we find ourselves in uh because it it attenuates any like. I think some people might be better than to predict specifically if they had more at more grounding in certain empirical scientific traditions than I do so and like questions of economics like I like the arguments about you know uh mmt and  uh uh job guarantee versus ubi. I don't know enough and I don't. I don't think. I'm gonna find myself motivated enough to learn enough about that stuff to add anything that anybody else hasn't already said better than me all. I can do is like from my position of understanding observe the argument and see which one's convincing that's all you can ever do. It's chilly. It's getting cold and then it's apparently going to be a storm.

This weekend oh boy. That's why I like to talk about history because I feel like. I'm on a nice solid ground. There. No. I know in the broad sense what happened and that's why politics politics is essentially history backwards. Politics is essentially like I mean political science. I mean like you know whatever you call political science the made up science of political science. It's history backwards. We're trying to turn it and see the other way the other way through the telescope. And it's possible but you need to have tools. I don't have so. I like to do a little bit of that. Then. I like to use mostly history because I feel like. I've got a better uh grab on that one. Because all you got to do is read.


Easy. Don't have to do math oh my god kill me what would happen if I shaved my beard. I would probably lose subscribers. I will say that I'll just put it at that and leave it. I don't think it'll ever happen just like with the shaving of the head. I don't think it's gonna happen if it didn't happen at the height of the first quarantine. Uh before I even had my you know uh my moment of enlightenment that I've been you know has helped me cope ever since. It's not gonna. Happen now somebody said somebody keeps talking about ethan hogg in the chat. The other day they said that ethan hawke personally called us out and said chapel that he hates champo which I never found out if that's true. Nobody said it to me on twitter. Nobody like said cc. This happened and now they're saying that ethan hawk says that he is a marxist-leninist. This happening are these things happening or is there a weird guy creating like a para reality in the chat and trying to get me to participate in him because he's a little sicko is ethan hawking to be the american qaddafi. I highly doubt it. I don't think that's gonna happen such a weird guy to pick ethan hawk. The rich man's stephen dorf ethan hunk.

I did finish reagan land. It's great uh wonderful. I don't. I hope he doesn't keep going. I feel like he there's at this point. It's redundant like anything. Other anything from then would be a different project and uh it's probably not one that he's that interested in. I pursue. Apparently. He's doing uh uh work on like the early democratic party. I think if he is. I am very excited about that uh. I would love to see oh god rick pearlstein writing about martin. Van buren give me that who will be the lib. Pinkertons wasn't that lib. Uh isn't that the antifa pinkerton who domed that guy in denver. I know it's horrible and I'm not happy. It happened but there's something slapstick about it the whole setup. It's hard not to laugh. I'm sorry just the way that he just. I mean the guy does seem like a kind of a douche you know not that sad like you know. I don't get sad about way better people than him dying. But uh. I just don't like the whole spectacle of that. I just find it. I really don't it's. It's more than anything it just depresses me because it shows how far we are from real politics.

No this is not a ranger regiment jacket. I'm stealing three types of valor. With this shirt. Three types of valor are being stolen with this bomber jacket so we've got here. The united states uh marshall service. Then we have airborne here. That's right second rangers and then so I'm stealing valor from those organizations. And I'm also stealing valor from the cast of the film conair because I do not in fact. I did not in fact work on that movie. So stealing this chat wearing this jacket is in fact valor theft. This was my halloween costume. This year uh it was high concept so the premise is.

I was not teddy kgb. I had the teddy kgb. I had my my red sweat. Uh my my red jumpsuit on and then I had a button down. I didn't have this shirt. I had. I had a button-down kind of halloween looking shirt that was pretty close to where we he the one he wore. I was not teddy here. Gb. I was john malkovich on the set of conair because khan air came out uh. I think two years or a year before rounders so uh if oh yeah. I'm sorry on the set of rounders not conair so if hypothetically john malkovich was standing around waiting for a take like drinking a coffee. On a set of rounders. He might well have been wearing this jacket between takes so that was the halloween idea and it was good. I got the hat the beard played. I wanna. I always want to make I do have halloween costumes. I want the my facial  to play. I don't like it with if I don't have a mustache if it does if a guy doesn't have a beard. It's kind of annoying if I have a beard more glasses same thing. And the glasses are non-negotiable.

I am blind as a bat. Another reason they probably wouldn't love me in the military really really bad eyesight. I had I have to get special lenses that take the regular thickness and reduce them because if I didn't do that this this lens would probably be like maybe maybe a half inch thick like a quarter inch. I'm really. I'm a physical wreck you can kind of see how I ended up being very dualistic. So for much of my life my body did feel kind of like a. I could get contacts I think but I've never looked into it. I never wanted contacts one. I think I look better with glasses. My eyes are a little deep set. I kind of sit back there kind of look like a serial killer uh and the other is. I don't want to stick my finger in my eyeball every day.


That's gross oh smoke weed. I do somebody wants me to do yoda for some reason off off that loud. I am. I am the answer by the way to the question posed by e1. What if yoda was six tall six foot tall and smoked weed you're looking at him right here buddy. This is this is if yoda was six feet tall and smoked weed. What if yoda was six feet tall and spoke with grogu is not yoda obviously. I thought we were all clear on this. Grogu is a baby of the species of yoda ah what if yoda was six feet tall and he smoked weed boom shout out to e1 boys. Very good very good podcast very very very very talented. We're all we're all very fond of them. I am not a star wars nerd. I I was as much a star wars as anyone who grew up when I did. I mean. I had star wars sheets. I had star wars pop-up book. I had the star wars figures. I saw the movies a bunch of times but it was just part of like a broader palette of pop culture that I've also watched like I remember being really excited to see the batman movie waiting in line when I was a little kid uh. I liked that too you know it just it was back. Then.

Things didn't define you that way because we weren't at the micro sect level of pop culture. There was still a broad mainstream and you were just a part of it. You didn't unless you were a nerd which was when nerd meant something and like I was a nerd about some things. I was a nerd about the civil war that was my star wars that was my pokemon that was whatever the hell. You people were into while you were well. You were partying at uh with your pokedex playing magic. The gathering. I was studying the blade of joshua lawrence chamberlain which he used to lead the 20th maine down. Little round top on the second day of gettysburg. July 2nd 1863 I was reading the civil war books. I was looking through big civil war macbooks. I had this I literally had you guys had pokedex. I had a service they would mail me like every month a pack of essentially civil war trading cards. They were but they were about the size of um. They were the size of like recipes and they came out. You got a recipe book or a recipe box and then they came they're about the size of like a postcard or a recipe card and they had on the front. They had this like a battle or a general or a place or a piece of military equipment. In the back. They'd have the stats and I would substitute them so that was i.

I didn't really have a pop culture thing. I've developed those like you know attachments as I got older and I engaged with like this new pop culture where oh now there's a now nerd is like a category that you can like choose from and oh what's this it's basically absorbing all of culture. Because the things that make nerdy being nerdy cool are the things that you learn are cool in co or the things that make you nerdy are the things that in college you learn are actually cool and so the culture as it comes more ecology becomes nerdier and everyone gets pulled towards nerd or pulled away from nerd. Uh. Like that's the whedon snyder divergence and I never cared enough about it because it was not grounded in like the child. I think because a lot of the reason this is so powerful for people the why a people and what the and the the devin ferraccis and the movie bob type guys is because this ties them deeply to that period of time when their lives were promised when they felt fresh with with the life and enthusiasm and they had you know a life ahead of them and they they want to like stay connected to that and I understand it. I think one of the reasons. I was never able to like fully get on board with any of this stuff even though of course. I was. I got went along. I watched the marvel movies. I enjoyed them. I would it was a wait. What was what people like. I were talking about so. I talked about it with them.

But I never gave my soul over to it because where that is in my in me is not in. In those movies very rarely. I was I'm certainly not as much of a war nerd as the actual warner. Like that guy is me on like every type of like you know steroid of talent like far better writer than I could ever hope to be you know and therefore a more rigorous thinker and they're like a much broader spectrum of knowledge than I could ever hope to attain uh because it powered me. But you know. I was never very powered because my talents were meager and my motivation also and maybe even less so but yeah.


I'm thinking more and more that the alternative history of reconstruction might be my long-term writing project. I might do some other stuff but I'm starting to think I might like sit down. I mean it would start with just reading everything. I'm going to have to really go back and look a lot more like reread phoner start with rereading phoner and dubois and then everything I've missed you know since I kind of got destroyed by the internet and then I might do it. I might do that it might happen stay watch this space and if it does start happening. I will certainly talk it out here like that will be a very useful. I think that'll be useful for my process. I think so if I actually start doing this and start reading about it.

I'll probably do a little book club as I'm going through the stuff and moving through does that sound good like whatever I'm reading at the moment. I'll probably start with foner make sense right yeah. So we'll do a fauner. Uh book club very shortly. I mean maybe at the beginning maybe. Next year we should shoot for it because I got stuff I gotta do uh in december so yes next year you'll start a founder book club on here not like a whole hour. But you know like a little chunk at the end or something and we'll and we'll go through fauna. And we're all we'll do boys after that. Probably those two and then maybe like. I'll just do them like as I read. The book. I'll maybe talk about it instead of going through the whole thing. We'll see we'll see what people want to do if it's still even a thing if I'm still here to do it. But uh there's a couple books by at least one book by james oakes. I really want to read and then actually there's a big you know what else I might want to actually do. I'm wondering if I should even do it before fauna. Oh. There's this book called uh. I haven't read it and if people anyone has and you have a review please let me know because I think I might start with this one the same way when me and chris started talking about uh the politics of uh. Like uh the early republic for a project. We we read um the willens book rise of american democracy like it covers that arrow great and then you can build from there. Uh and I want something that you can start from like even below the level of reconstruction uh and and it covers the period and there's a there's a book called I hope. I'm remembering the title. Here. It's it's. It's a it's a rather cumbersome title yes the republic for which it stands the united states during reconstruction and the gold gilded age by richard white. I was thinking if that's good if people have heard it because I haven't read it and I'd like to start maybe with something. I haven't read before uh we could start there just to get like the the political uh and the greater uh context and then fauna from there.

So if anyone knows we'll do that and if not we'll start with connor. I am and I have to admit so all right so. I'm thinking about it. I don't know yet what the project will end up looking like there's a maybe. I could do it god help me. I could do it like as a novel. Oh my god harry turtledove style which is maybe too cringe or a sort of like a little monograph. Like that lincoln lennon lives book that just sort of sketches it out sort of like an alternative like historical chronicle more scholarly less cringy. Maybe the whole thing is cringe no matter what maybe counter narrative history is inherently cringe. I think an argument could be made but at the same time I'm trying to move towards the thing that I think I could fire my enthusiasms around and get me over the hump of like presenting uh you know a coherent view of something no musical. Let me say this it's not going to be a musical. There will be no rapping. There will be no hypno happening rapidly crappity well yeah. It is wish fulfillment but the thing is is what I would want to do is. I would want to steer away from like the best of all possible worlds scenario. I would. I would not. I would want to like self-consciously if either way. I did it. I would be. I would want to push against the headwinds of my of my fantasy of what I would want and I think I could do that the more grounded. It is historically that's why. I want to read a bunch and reread stuff before. I even start because I don't want to just make it a little uh a thumb sucker because the only reason counterfactual history is useful is if it allows you to see how mechanisms play out where fluidity exists within a system and where and where like uh energy and force can be applied and you can do that sometimes more clearly by abstracting yourself away from the moment which is too fired with uncertainty to really be able to uh articulate or just you could just sort of. If you study the past enough you can sort of project out a little blurry alternative pathway. You know like if you know enough about the conditions where things arose from you can start building a dream you know if not a dream of ultimate victory a dream of alternative. A second way dog is barking whoo doggies get killed walking you doggy is he here richard give me you got you can sit in my ex my wife's ex-husband's post-dead tech post-modernistic  house but you will not watch my television favorite.

Rapper gotta be young mc in that he's the one I probably have listened to the most in my life because man I really burned through stone cold ryman in junior high played that  non-stop I knew all the lines in every song on that tape for a while now though even years later I know all of uh bus to move of course got that one tattooed on my brain but also more uh more uh obscure ones like uh principal's office. So yeah definitely young mc yeah. No. I'm a boomer guys. I warn you going in. I don't pretend to be one of your uh one of your comrades. I don't pretend to be from the streets. I'm not. I'm not steve buscemi rolling in with my. It is a wasteland. It's the gulf coast right now. I am not a reactionary. Now that's the one thing. I don't think I am. I don't think I have a reaction. I mean depending on what you mean by that of course. People can make it mean whatever they want apparently and I do feel like.

I have a different perspective on this  stargate through the black hole of being spaghettified. But I'm in the process. I didn't come out a strand of spaghetti and that I think doesn't make me better. I think that's a lot of the stupid heat and argument about all this generational politics which is 90. Anyway boils down to this charged idea that there's like a judgment behind it. There's none it's just position in time. It's position in time and relationship to means of production and the technology thereof. That's the difference there's nothing to be judged about it. Just saying is. I think that I it allows me to see some of uh what's happening because I could still watch like it flowing up my arm. You know like. I can feel it moving through like uh you know blood poisoning. It's not just my whole circulatory system. But the thing about that is is that means that I am I am going to be limited in my ability to understand anything that's happening because I'm on the other side of this thing. I'm not fully within it which means that I don't really know what's going on. I can't all I can do is offer like a uh orthogonal commentary on it. The thing itself is going to have people within it and the people within are going to have responsibilities to themselves to their families and loved ones to try to you know take destiny's wheel and they are going to have knowledge that. I don't have because they're going to be acculturated to these ways in a way that I never will be and so saddle up partners. I wish you well. I just. I'm not going to act like. I could say you're going to save anybody. If there's anything determined by your being younger by being immersed in this techno world alienated even further from life than people before you uh that that's going to make you inherently the revolutionary cadre who saved the world. I'm afraid not nothing destined about it. It's in our hands. We're gonna have to reach across all these arbitrary boundaries and come together for any hope of an alternative to full liquid social liquefication.

I'm revisionist of course. I'm a revisionist that's such a stupid  tanks. There's nobody you could even possibly say are the tanks. I'm sorry china doesn't count even in your heart. You know it's not the same thing as a soviet union. It just isn't because it's not because these the chinese communist states say whatever you want about. It is not missionary the way that the soviet was there was not an internationalism to it. You couldn't join the club. They don't want you as a member. They want to make a deal with you and that's a different relationship to it than the relationship between western communists and the soviet union. So those were their tanks in their heart in a way that doesn't exist anymore. So tanky is meaningless and like it obscures the thing because it puts weight and power morally behind questions that mean nothing like whether you were going to stand for the purges in a western communist party that had meaning you were fighting for power. You were fighting against other people who were in the broad left trying to trying to move towards uh like a confrontation with capital. During the collapse of capitalism you were fighting you were fighting a battle and it had stakes and so of course it had moral weight. There's no moral weight to these questions because there's no these tanks don't belong to anybody revisionist is the same thing. Revisionist was a meaningful slur because you were revising away from a understood practice that undergirded a global movement. There is none you're not revising away from anything you're rising away from my boutique understanding of marxism that nobody else agrees with except you're your fellow clique members. All you can do is threaten to kick me out of a clique I've revised yes. I've revised from you but nobody else. But your fellow travelers think that that's the case not like revising away from a communist government or a communist history of state actions. Like oh this was a revisionism you can look back from a position of authority. There is just like with the tanks the tanks. There's no real tanks the revisionism. There's no real book like there's no real reified idea that you can deviate or revise from. And so in both cases the whole vocabulary only serves to obfuscate reality and and mystify the conditions of every argument you're trying to have and this is what I mean when I say that this is. This place is poison if you try to because like why are you talking about this stuff. Why do you care about the questions that would even read you to call someone a tankier revisionist. It's because you're trying to do politics and if that's what politics are you swung and missed again if you're doing something else that's one thing. But if this is what you're doing. It's not enough me included and I'm saying time out for kobe but seriously all right. I'm gonna go soon. It's getting chilly out. Here was I being trolled about the guy. The ethan hawk guy was he trolling me all right well like. I said sure I'm revisionist but who are you gonna call who are you gonna call mark's busters. There's no one there. There's no one who's authority you can call on that will be universally agreed upon by any sub-section that you could broadly call the left. So there's no um there's no enforcing orthodoxy intellectually just like there's no uh enforcing orthodoxy politically through the barrel of the soviet. Uh the red army's guns in the warsaw pact and that is the that is the condition that is the the condition of western politics where the drive train has been broken because there is no working-class movement undergirding any of this just like there's no soviet government undergirding a uh a marxist leninist praxis of state power wielding of a condition of an intensity deep enough to impact things or in the west trade unions and labor movements and labor parties. I should wear a kimono. I would like to wear a kimono one of these days when I get back in when it gets too cold to come out here. I might get I might. I might get a clown. I've been looking for a robe. I haven't been able to find one but yeah. I'm a revisionist call the kgb. They don't care call the kgb. I'll just have sex with.
