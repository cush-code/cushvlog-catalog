Another headache a heartbreak. I'm so much older. Then. I can take a reflection well. It comes and goes. I need direction to perfection. No no no no no help me out yeah when there's nowhere else to run is there room for one more song. The strangest ain't changing me the cold-hearted boy. I used to be hi guys. I'm not so I've got soul but damn it. I'm not a soldier oh full disclosure I've done a lot of content production today. So. I'm kind of We'll tap. I probably wouldn't have done a stream today. If I hadn't missed monday and tuesday. I try to do like three a week. If I'm not letting people know ahead of time. I'm not going to be doing them. So I felt like. I didn't want to skip again. But I'm I don't really know what to say so.

I might have it's going to be a loose one. This is going to be another low. Vibe stream so fair warning ahead of time on that don't expect a lot of verbal fireworks here. I'm just trying to kind of cool down ah make sure a beats working though. I'll say that there's no question about it. I saw the bob odenkirk trailer and I had heard of this movie before I I've heard like for a year now that this movie was being made because I'm reading a thing where bob owen kirk was talking about how he was getting trained by the john wick guys and I thought it was really exciting and I saw a trailer and it's just john wick. It's what if basically it's what if john wick's wife hadn't died a year after they got married what if she'd lived and they'd had kids and then like after he got kind of old He had to come back like that's. The only difference like everything else beat for b and style and aesthetics looks basically the same and that was disappointing. I'll still see it. I love bob odenkirk obviously.

I've loved him since mr show since the ben stiller show which I'm old enough to remember and do have loved watching as a kid for the one glorious season that it ran man early 90s. Fox was the best. I would say that early 90s sunday night on. Fox is the best network. Television has been for comedy because you had anchoring you hadn't married with children and then you had the site simpson's there. For sometimes it switched to thursday. But it's it was sunday. It was started on sundays but then you had. That didn't do nearly as well didn't last as long as those shows but in my opinion I mean obviously you know you're a kid. Things are funnier but in my opinion hold up and help shape my comet perspective in a lot of ways get life with chris elliott fantastic show ben stiller show which I don't think holds up as well just because so much of it is based on direct parodies of stuff that was happening at the time like specific tv shows and specific commercials. That's not gonna land the same way but still you can't beat that cast you can't beat who ended up being on that show. I mean that's where bob and david met literally and then helped make mr show the greatest american sketch comedy show of all time and in the running for it's like.

It's in the top conversation top two or three ever I mean. I don't know if it's not. Mr. Shomani python kids in the hall. I who's what's the fourth competitor there. And what else oh. They also had the oh. They had crazy high concept. That might not be funny. You might not look back on. I think it was funny but compared to the other shows. On tv. It was interesting and different like herman's head which was ripped off for inside out. Any. I don't know if anybody else saw inside out and was outraged at how horrifyingly they had ripped off the show. Herman's head which was a show that it was a sitcom and the premise was there's a guy herman and he's trying to make it in the big city in publishing. But you cut back to him in his head between his like parts of his consciousness and it was the horny fat guy who was his lust. There was the nerd and glasses who was his intellect. There was the twerpy nervous guy who was anxiety and then the hippie lady who was his emotions and like sensitivity. Then there was a show called whoops which I was describing someone. This show last weekend and they couldn't believe this was a real show. It was essentially gilligan's island but the gimmick was instead of them being on a desert island.

They were the last people to survive an accidental nuclear holocaust and they all lived in a house together in a blasted wasteland and this was a multi-camera sitcom with a laugh track and there was one episode I saw as a little kid. I still remember where santa claus shows up and he's got survivor's guilt because the elves the reindeer. Mrs claws were all killed in the nuclear blast. I'm seeing for other best Sketch comedy shows chappelle show chappelle show is definitely in the running. I'd sure. I think it could probably take out honestly replace monty python with the chappelle show. At this point. Comedy has a shelf life monty python shelf life is over the chappelle still is still funny so throw that out there chappelle show or maybe yeah chappelle show mr show kids in the hall. I think you should leave might be in the discussion but you need a lot more episodes. There's literally six 20-minute episodes that's not enough audio is low god oh. Me what do you want me to do what do you want me to do. I've got the thing turned up. I don't know what to do you want me to put it farther up. Here.

The state was okay state's not as good as ben stiller show mad tv is pretty good and mad tv when you look back on it. It was definitely it was willing to go places that you can't go anymore so it has that kind of going for it just as a curio but sketch by sketch. There's a lot of dog. On man tv come on keem peel. I would say is probably better than the chapelle show as a like on a sketch by sketch basis because and the premises are very crisp. But it's also a little airless. It's a little over intellectualized in a way that the chappelle show isn't and that makes the chappelle show more viscerally connected. But anyway this is all the way saying. I love bad guy bob owen kirk like nobody's business but watching that trailer and just seeing him just do the keanu thing with the same guns and the same choreography and the same even the same sheen and the same lighting schemes and at one point and the thing where he gets the guns out that have been kept in the in the bunker and he's got a bunch of gold bars. Those are just like the coins from it's like god once they figured out that they could replace squibs with choreography and and then made John wick the exemplar of that they just decided like with all things. They were just going to monopolize the entire action space and they're going to turn everything into. John wick so. I'm a little disappointed in the trailer but I will certainly see it although when I saw at the end of the trailer it says only in theaters february 26th. I'm like okay guys good luck with that. You guys and tenet can sit together and talk about how that goes kids in the hall.

I didn't say somebody says kids in the house better than better than chappelle. I didn't say I because there's hell's shield in the top three you kick out monty python. You don't kick up kids in the hall kids in the hall. One of the things that's most impressive about kids in the hall is that I would say unlike any other show. I can imagine any other sketchup. I can think of you can watch an episode of the kids in the hall and you can guess who wrote each sketch and you will probably be right if you watch the whole show and you like get the comedic sensibilities of the different act of different performers and and and writers you see who's like oh. This is this is a this is a kevin and dave's sketch. Oh this is one of those you know one man show scott thompson things. This is the weird sweaty experimental film that's bruce mccullough that's very cool to me. Monty python has that too but as I said mighty python is just it streets behind as pierce horizon would say it is streets behind have I heard of saturday night live pretty funny. I mean yeah. It is come on. I thought kevin and I thought. I always thought that kevin and dave collaborated on all those old-timey like kind of avid and costello. Premise sketches like the one where it's bob and dave and they're like in a diner or something like the citizen kane sketch which is a great sketch. This isn't cade it was it is a gate. It was citizen kane.

You need a mortician sudden. Eruptions of bloody violence is one of the best ways to get my comedic goat. I will admit tim and eric is fantastic but when I think of sketch shows I sort of like when I'm trying to think of like the archetypal and pinnacle sketch shows. I think of ones that conform to the sketch concept you know like I honestly feel like tim and eric is almost a liminal thing. It's not even really a sketch show like those are not really sketches in the traditional sense. They do not have premises that play out in the way that sketches traditionally do but it's fantastic. I mean also formatively influential 30 somebody says when did snl nosedive. Snl never knows dove anywhere. This is one thing that I will will submit it is as bad as it's ever been. I will I will stipulate. I just watched the kevin kevin bateman the the jason bateman episode from saturday. I just watched that on monday and might be the worst one I've ever watched but that's not because of some sudden collapse of quality snl.

Because it's been on the air non-stop for fork in 40 years has the same entropic principle embedded within us that everything does. It's the same reason that simpsons is terrible because it's still odd and so the the quality degradation of snl is not some drop. It is a steady decline with you know within it. It's it's a trend downward that within it contains highs and lows both within episode both within sketches within episodes. Episodes within seasons seasons within tranches of seasons but the trend line is down and that's that's anything over time will it show that trait because the energy it's beginning is being dissipated and now in a specific context of a program like a tv show. Like the simpsons or snl that that big bang is like the premise you know the container the creative container for the energies of the people making it and that container has limitations and over time you hit the limits of them and the way you avoid the show. Becoming bad is you stop making it and when you don't stop making it horrifying things happen and you see this like new simpsons is an abomination and in fact at this point you wanted to get logicky on it. I think you could make a strong argument that the simpsons is on balance a bad show because it has been actively bad for twice as long as it was good and that means that just sheer sheer volume of output if you're gonna keep it as one thing. If you're gonna say this is one show and you can't really say it isn't because that's how all shows work. There's a name of his show a premise of a show at last and then it's gone. This you can say the chick but like nothing really changed you know it wasn't one thing it wasn't one guy leaving.

It wasn't shipping theseus It's a ship a thesis. A schwarzwalder was writing on like the 20th season or something like the people who made it great were there. There's still guys who write for it now who wrote for it originally like ba. What's the guy we had on the show me and virgil interviewed um What's his name.

He's he's been on since the beginning draining's still there. I I've been to a simpsons table read we got invited to it. Mike reese is his name mike reese invited us to a simpsons table read and I got to see them do it and it was a graining was Graining wasn't there but james l brooks was there so there is a continuity you can't say. It's not the same product what happened time passed. The thing that killed the simpsons was not ian maxstone graham or da or merkin or any whoever people blame for for or graining for selling out. It was only for allowing it to continue so if you if you compose the idea that the simpsons the simpsons is a program right. The simpsons is a tv program we're not going to talk about what dividing within it. It's a holistic thing a television series that's been on for almost 40 years now and it has a number of episodes within it but to have different quality. If you look at it from remove and say is this a good or a bad show.

There is an argument to be made that semantically like in the narrowest sense. It is a bad show because I subscribe very much to the notion that binaries are composed of infinite gradients but for the purposes of denotation. Once a certain inflection point of attributes has been reached. The thing gains a characteristic that can you be used to describe it by other people. Like that's how we get to language is the accumulation of traits you reach. You have like say x number there's x number of traits.

Once you reach y you enough of them have been obtained that this counts as a thing we can say so it's a show is it good. No. It's a bad show. It's a bad show put on the simpsons random episode. It's probably going to be bad and that's purely because they left it on which is why getting mad at snl for anything or the simpsons for anything other than refusing to stop is wrong. But the thing is when you do that you're not getting mad at the simpsons. Creators you're not getting mad at even lorne michaels you're getting mad at capitalism once again and for always you're getting mad because the profit engine of the entertainment industry has dictated that these things should continue to go on our favorite shows that were great a lot of times. We were protected from them being remembered as bad because they weren't profitable to make anymore and they stopped making them before they got bad that's like the capitalist regulator that can protect our good shows from turning into bad shows. Because that's the only real gatekeeper that we have in mass culture is is profitability. So capitalism kill the simpsons and skilled snl. Although with snl I would argue that it started at a much lower quality.

The early snl is not that great if you put on an average 1977 episode. Even given the fact that comedy tastes changed over time. There's like maybe a couple of good sketches there. It's just now there's no good sketches no and I would say that until recently you could usually bank. Maybe one decent sketch an episode and I think that only in the last couple seasons is that no longer the case yep put more names in the black book of capitalism. The main thing I resist in snl discourse is try to to um is trying to validate any previous generation of snl compared to the current one. It's just entropy that distinguishes them and the reason for that is I remember most of these things like in some way. I've watched a lot of this and and this the real the stuff that sticks is very rare. But one thing I know for sure is the close. The stuff you see when you're younger is going to stick more and that means you will never be able to judge it accurately you'll never come close to being able to evaluate it.

Because the stuff you remember liking you have forgotten all the garbage. All the garbage just ran through your head unless it was so bad. It was memorable. It just ran through the sewer grates into the into the sewer and then floated away into your subconscious. What got stuck in the pan in the gold. Pan is stuff that you remember and remember enjoying and remember to join with the with the simple-minded easy enthrallment of use which adds all sort of color and emotion to your memory.

They're all positive. No modern thing will compare to that but the thing is with most stuff you're not comparing one to one whereas with saturday night live sketches you're comparing the same thing and that means it'll never ever ever live up and so no one can truly judge snl sketch comedy or quality because their memories their comparative memories are purely Just a collection of their greatest enjoy encounters with the show which will by definition be when they were younger. I will say though that one of those things that's wrong and bad is as politics gets more. Culture gets more political. It's very bad for a show like that because topical political comedy is maybe the lowest form of company currently popular and that's not necessary and that's and that's only because of how ubiquitous politics is and I mean there's a reason that we helped create a genre of political comedy with chapo because you know we're funny. But I don't know if any of us would have made it through the gatekeepers of comedy to be able to be professionally humorous. What kind of gave us an entry point was that we had a relatable subject that people cared about and that we could triangulate our humor off of and that that would give us a hearing with people that we wouldn't get if we were just trying to hit people at a purely comedic register. So we were essentially cheating. We were stretching out the meatloaf I'll admit but the thing is like now people want that so you know they were going to want it either way. I'd rather they get it for me. I think what you can really pull from. Snl is just like like a baseball team and being a fan of snl. Like I've said before is much more like being a fan of a baseball team than a television show. You you don't. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad. You know. It's your team and you watch it and you take you keep your eyes open for talent and you you know see it develop or whatever or fail to develop. So the thing to remember is like performers like who who has stood out you know who who are and one of the one of the real. Signals of the current degradation is how thin the bench is talent-wise right.

Now snl was never was never was not always this political you'd have a pl. You'd have a cold or you'd have a political cold open like. I don't now every every cold open is political and I don't think that used to be the case but then again. I don't really. I wouldn't have remembered a lot of them because cold opens usually aren't very good spoken like a true brewers fan indeed oh boy. I didn't want him to win the cove championship. Anyway.

There are were some great old political sketches though and there was some kind of subversive stuff. There was a sketch on There was a classic hartman ronald reagan sketch at the during the height of iran contra where the joke was is that he was pretending to be this guttering old man but behind closed doors. He was like the mastermind of a globe spanning money and gun laundering operation and that's the kind of like coming at it from an angle thing that they have never been able to figure out in my in am like in my era. In my like more recent memory of the show. They very much get stuck on like a a play on the guy and then they just run with it and that means it's essentially the same sketch every week. I'd say. Hartman was definitely like maybe the greatest saturday night live cast member of all time in terms of all-around talent and and crucialness to the show's success. One thing. I will note that. I said this before they did it on last on saturday show is that they do. They do recurring sketches not recurring characters.

The characters are unmemorable. It's the premise with a different skeleton of jokes and that's what that's how you use a recurring character. It's this a recurrent character is a premise essentially and a skeleton to you for put more specific jokes on now. They just have the premise without the character. They have not bothered to create characters people like because they know they can't. They know they can't get something over in the wrestling sense the way that you could with like the rich meister or wayne and garth or or even like one of those christian. One of those 15 awful christine kristen wig recurring characters. None of them can get over a recurring character so it's just the sketch over and over again. It's amazing so the green is people. Now celebrity. Jeopardy does not have care first of all celebrities. Jeopardy is like 10 years old now and I'm talking about current snl. So that's not even relevant but secondly trebek isn't really a character in that sketch. He's basically a straight man and impressions don't really count anyway and it's not a very good impression will. Ferrell is definitely one of the like top five too. Farrell was farrell held the same role of like glue that hartman did. He was less of an impressionist and more of a more of a wild man but a very similar very similar position comedic point guard I guess or no. I mean.

I don't know. I don't know enough about basketball. It is amazing to me that keenan thompson is still there. I believe he's been there for 16 17 seasons. I think this might be a 17 season that's got to be. It's got to be a record right like tim. Meadows didn't stay that long and I kind of respect it because I'm assuming what's happening there is that he has just like made the zen decision that okay like this is my job. I'm not going to be famous. I'm not going to be a big star. I'm not going to have my own franchise. This is my job like somebody works in an office. Somebody digs ditches. I do these sketches. I like doing it. I have fun. It's better than real work. I'll just keep doing it and I respect that for tim meadows he was there forever but it was because he couldn't get a character and he needed to get a character for him to do what they all did in the 90s at the height of the like right after wayne's world went like every sk every every recurring character was a potential movie and that meant a potential movie career and when you saw what like mike myers went. It was like oh farley even dana carvey before master of disguise that was what they were all angling for and like the last.

One to get it was probably will ferrell. Maybe andy sandberg but he was never really an snl cast member. I guess. I don't know it's weird because he was doing lol the same thing and they're all lonely island movies. It's it's not quite as one-to-one as like. I was a superstar in the girl mary katherine gallagher and now there's a movie about that. But he he finally got the ladies man which had some pop in which people liked. Even though I never thought leon phelps was that funny and so oh god and he goes and makes the movie and they're like magruber but that was a failure and they go okay. What is this fails and then he's gotta hang around hollywood. I mean he's making it he probably makes a living but it's certainly less stable than coming in punching the clock whereas keenan he knows there's nothing out there. He's had projects they've failed. I think he had a sitcom that like didn't go past the pilot or like a cup first couple episodes and so it's like here there. Be there'll be dragons. I'm gonna chill here and as long as he's not tormented by that and doesn't think of it as a failure of some kind as long as he's at peace with it. Then he is he's the most successful snl cast member ever. Bridesmaids doesn't count because it's not based on a recurring character that's just somebody doing movies. After they were on snl she had a mil it's very interesting. Kristen. Wiig had a million recurring characters. She was the last person to have like a real stable of recurring characters in the 90s tradition you know of snl and when even though she did become a movie star in some way they never made a goddamn one of them into a movie. That's how bad they all were.

It was amazing how how she was just being put on everybody and I think like they must have killed in studio because the thing is it doesn't matter what they put on people. It's there people are going to watch it. That's the secret of all of this that's the thing that that that lauren knows that's the thing that has turned him into a demon is he he knows oh if they'll watch it whatever it is even if it's bad. They'll watch it to talk about how bad it is the fact that it's on is why people watch it. It has reached that level so they they just took the fact that like it healed in the studio to mean oh everyone loves gilly and everyone loves the nervous target cashier and yet nobody even thought of putting those onto a movie screen they had to do other. Because it was like this stuff is poison and I'd say that's it that's been the last one and the fact that like macgruber. I think is the last direct transition and it failed. I don't think it's ever happening again.

Ted. Lasso just happened was ted lasso. An snl. Character was ted lasso. A jason sneakers character on snl by the way he's been off snl for years. Now. I mean just basic basic stuff. I don't get you people unless you're not unless you're not trying to disagree with me. But it's a weird way to put it. I guess this david s pumpkins was insanely forced oh guys okay. This is gonna just be the snl sketch one but this is just gonna be the snl stream. But that's fine it was bound to happen. Eventually I'm having fun This is a nice wind down from talking about political. All day um so the david s pumpkin sketch was actually one of those recurring premises.

I talked about so like a year before that episode. Larry david hosted and there was a sketch where it was a bunch of fbi recruits at hogan's alley. Doing the the target shooting where you have to distinguish between threats and and civilians and they're like dummies that like come up with a gun and like they're animatronics basically and some of them are Some of them are criminals to be shot and other ones are civilians not to be shot and they pop up a few and they're normal and then one of them pops up and it's larry david in a bright orange suit holding a big brick style 80s um cell phone wearing sunglasses and he goes hey oh. This is literally going to kill me david brian kevin roberts that was it. He goes hey. I'm kevin roberts and I'm the biggest in town and then the guy shoots him and the trainer goes where I was at he goes. I was confused and it's basically the david s pumpkins thing of you're expecting one thing. Then. It's this weird off like off-premise thing like oh and pray with us. Pumpkins isn't really funny this guy's not really either a threat. But he's also a weird what and then the person kind of like fig not figuring it out and um and that's it that was the sketch and then david s pumpkins is the exact same sketch as just during halloween and it's popping out of the halloween things instead of popping up from the target range.

The only big difference is one you know tom hanks he's a legendary snl host and it would and he's always going to be memorable a little bit when he's on the show. Like his black jeopardy. Sketch was one of the few that kind of had had legs outside of the you know people saw it in the immediate aftermath of its airing but but then also the fact that it was a halloween episode and hal and holiday. Episodes usually have a little more cultural resonance because it's one of those things that reminds us of the season and then we talk about it to reaffirm that memory um and then three because it actually had a punch line which is very very rare for any snl sketch. Snl. Sketches almost never have punchlines. Now they just set up. The premise do jokes about the premise and then just stop that's that's been the the model for snl sketches for a very long time. I mean it's they've never been good at ending sketches. It's just not a part of the process of writing a sketch in six days like that's the hard part and you don't have time so it makes sense that they just give up. But this one actually had a punchline.

It was when they cut back to the couple after they don't see david pumpkins with the dancing skeletons. He pops his head up and goes any questions and I go ah. That's aha that's actually like kevin roberts doesn't do anything. He they just do it. Do. It do it and then quit and for that reason david s cumpkins popped and became a meme but it was literally some. Stepped on re-premised garbage like these guys are literally just stepping on their own product in order to make the the runtime but I mean the main problem with snl. At this point is the fact that it's written by the same college educated um soy creatures that every show is written by like every show is the same voice. It is the voice of twitter every show every every every topical program and increasingly even scripted like long-form stuff. Like for example. The boys is just the voice of twitter one way or the other and that is very innovating and it's hard to enjoy anything like that and yeah like there's a factory that produces these people like they all go to college. Like they'll they all go from their middle class homes to a nice college experience or their upper class homes to a nice college experience where they learn how to express themselves and and and work together and not get me too.

Then they go to ucb used to be a second city. Now it's ucb and then they get caught and then they either write or they perform or home combination and they're all just regurgitating the same. I mean they're the same people like this is a big country. A lot of different experiences and these people are reproducing a comedic reply to almost the exact same experiences of living a relatively unprecarious urban educated existence that is mediated through that is heavily mediated and that is deeply invested in a in a performative political self-conception which I mean liberalism which I mean broadly the democrat brain and because of that nothing can be good. Nothing can be good. You got that's why people got to go to stuff.

That's not going through these gatekeepers to even come close to anything good and I gotta say that I never really got nathan for you but having watched um how to by john wilson which apparently was it is on tv because nathan fielder discovered it. I'm I'm gonna have to go back and watch that show now because talking about how everything is bad and comes with the same voice that show how to with john wilson is and the thing is and this is where this is where singularity of vision comes in. You could very easily say to me well. John. Wilson is obviously one of the people you're talking about yes. He is. He is absolutely some middle class person probably who went to college and then got a professional job in the city yes and and and shares like a the same like sort of mediated version of reality that we all do like the self-created bubble of entertainment. But he's one guy or like a few people who are like helping him generating a relatively coherent personalized comedic vision. What all these other shows are as a bunch of people who might have that in them but by the fact that they're all having to work together on the same thing with the same parameters around it are not going to do anything other than we're down to the lowest common denominator between them which will be the most bland and tasteless and insipid version of that experience that they're all sharing. Whereas this is somebody who's having the same experience but is able to express it and the only reason I even found out about.

It is because nathan fielder another guy who that is true of found it. Joe pera is a guy like that too like none of these people don't fit the demographic profile of who I'm talking about. But they ch what's different is is that they are able to articulate a personalized artistic comedic response. Oh man. Righteous gemstones are so good that's another small group of people. I mean conor o'malley of course is another absolute king in that regard. Of course. I'm saying a bunch of white guys because that's who I see online because I'm a white guy there are others. I have not seen them. I'm not denying their existence. The thing they will share. I will stipulate is a is a relatively core coherent and relatively personalized artistic comedic vision eric.

Andre isaac is a good example is the demiurge to the gnostics. What capital is to the proletariat yes that's a perfectly encapsulated way to put it thank you then my urge in the practical sense is capitalism. We don't live in the world we live in a simulated reduced bound version of the world. That is that's physical manifestation is generated by a spirit a geist a principle that drives everything that drives the the maintenance and the intensification of human um of human transformation of the environment. What's the code running our ever expanding reordering of the material world around us. What is the thing driving us to build this world instead of the boundless world that it could be capitalism. But its structures are so real that they are as real to us as our bodies and as much of a a prison as the materialist world is to the gnostic as as far removed from the real world. The real pandora around us as as eternal union with god in heaven is to the gnostic who lives in the material world. Someone put it very well just now in the comments right. Now. What capitalism is about is about exploiting the resources of the world using technology to produce capital to produce surplus super plus beyond the sustenance of the human race which of course is then to be held by the the holders of the capital that built it the whole the owners under communism. What we're extracting and trying to pile up and distribute is time.

It's free time free time that is not in pain like because as I say there is unalienated labor but even on alienated labor sucks like even even though cleaning your toilet is less alienating than being a janitor. It still sucks to clean a toilet so that part that like unpleasantness associated with being alive on earth that's gonna be there. That's that that's part of work that is almost until you but until you have technologically removed the need for it. It's still there but the less the the point of like a human species working towards its own like greater betterment would be if we acknowledge that the goal of all this technological progress that we have the goal of all this economic activity that we're doing that we're friendsly doing all these scaffolds we're building shout out. John wilson should not be to build up surplus to be held by people who by virtue of a sucking literal magic trick claim ownership to it. It would be to free people from unpleasant labor for the longest amount of time so that they could do things with that material world around them with that technological understanding with their understanding of other people to build something and turn work turn the time that isn't alienated and work into art into play both like living under communism living in an unalienated technologically advanced society. Work has been replaced by art like art can be unpleasant.

Too like art has physical exertion and gunky parts but art transcends chores right transcends work. It actually takes the things that's gross and turns those gross things into more adherence to the task more adherence to the moment and eventually you get to a point where where labor has been replaced by people literally spending their time on earth creating art and until that point playing when that before you're able to transition the actual like working of the gears of social existence like the actual growing of food and distribution of resources and maintenance of social order through through coordination and you know infrastructure. Once that's taken care of everything else is play. But then when you can turn the process of doing that that of extracting of giving people food of giving power of allowing for transfer of movement of people over time and place over over technological innovation. Then you have turned it into art. You've turned you've turned work into art.

That's the that's the that's the alchemy that we're seeking. We are essentially alchemists and that is the magical. That's the magical formula we're looking for is the one that turns work into play. I feel like I on a personal level have done that. I have performed the magic trick on myself. I have. I have. I have cast the spell and drank the potion but now having done that the only the only place my animal spirits can truly be satisfied is in the process of casting that spell on others casting that spell across the world as far as my my powers can go and they're not very far. I will have to join my magic with others. I'll have to join my my my my want.

I'll have to space doc with others. I have to say I definitely feel like I understand ellen. What alan moore was talking about in that episode. A lot more than I used to I used to thought I kind of got it. Somebody says fictional characters you know what this is okay fictional character that best reflects obama. I would say the imagined viewer of a prestige television show which is a fictional character. A character created by fiction created by imagination hear me out here you've got prestige shows right prestige shows because of television shows. These aren't pure works of art as much as we love to talk about guys like david chase and and and matthew weiner as as auteurs. It is a very collaborative process that is deeply enmeshed in a capitalist matrix of profitability related to its authority. How many episodes of a show you get depends on people watching it. It depends on selling underwear and light beer think about that a movie is a movie. Here it is take it or leave it oh. A show isn't a show really until it's over and how long it lasts how much time you get to tell a story how you get to tell. It is determined by how many people watch which is not determined by quality as we all know quality is merely a part of it. What it mostly is. Is is a is an ability to hit people at a common denominator where enough of them are entertained that they want to keep watching and with a prestige audience.

What you do to find that out is you read the recaps because the recaps before twitter. The recaps were how the internet like the hive mind of the internet that like collective college educated urban liberal how they responded to stimuli and how they expressed themselves in the social media matrix like barfing up now that we have the internet to literally embody and reflect the mind of our like creative class. We have the technology to hear the echo of the audience at a moment by moment basis. We don't have to rely on nielsen ratings. We don't have to wonder about whether or not people are filling our name out in the book that they keep for like a five dollar. A month stipend from the nielsen company.

We get it in real time the echolocation of people responding and the com the the recaps and comment sections. In the early internet websites. I would argue are where people went to find out what these people wanted and then they made these shows mad men the sopranos well. The sopranos really made it first of all but remember the sopranos could have been after could have gone off the air. After one season the sopranos were tacking off of the media response to them almost immediately because it became this huge phenomenon almost overnight so they were never not captured like beyond the first season. Everything that came later is fully enmeshed in this so even the sopranos count sopranos brazen bad. The person viewing it that they divine through the response first in the form of those recaps and the comments on recaps and then the twitter conversation once twitter enters into it.

The viewer of that is a highly successful because remember we're after rich college educated urban liberals. We're not after the ones who are paying back a million jillion student loans and running around gig gig economy jobs. We were the ones with time and money to spend on the kind of products that we advertise more importantly are willing to spend more for things like a streaming service or a cable channel. Then you can because the more of them we get the fewer of the everyone else we need. So we want them as rich as they come who are still going to be sitting around watching television. So then we're talking about people who by definition almost are professional class people people who work at nine to five and come home and want to sit down and kind of vape out and because they're not able to jet ski around the world like a very very rich person and also there aren't that many of those people so you're talking about upper middle class professionals of the urban milieu and what do they create they created psychopaths. They created tony soprano.

They created walter white don draper. They created psychopaths empty vessels of pure self-seeking self-interest because that is who they saw in the mirror. That's who they saw in the reflected response to the show to the shows because while the people writing about it aren't the most professionally successful ones they wouldn't be writing recaps if they were and they wouldn't be typing responses to recaps if they were the the people green lighting stuff and making art in television can see past them to the richest versions of them. So. I would say they pre imagined the people who the guys who created and wrote and and and directed the the creative direct. The creative shape of those early prestige tv shows the people they had in. Mind subconsciously is barack obama. It's barf sack o crumble. He is the he is the prestige television watcher in chief and didn't it work barack. Obama watched the show and said oh. I really like that batman. David chase show the wire. It's really good. It guaranteed an audience. It guaranteed money in the bank so they essentially conjured into being the guy that they had in mind like prestige. Television was essentially a giant black mass to summon this beelzebub into existence to rule over us more like barf sacko crumbo.

That's what I say yeah trump was summoned by television as well. Someone trump is celibate trump was in a mirror process. Trump was summoned by those people left to fend for themselves in network television after cable came along who had to figure out a way to keep these rubes watching the over the channel. Shows well. These are the people who don't have the money to watch hbo or cable that means by definition. We have a ceiling on how much we want to pitch to people because all of our ideas of what smart is comes from a college experience. The people who don't have the money for cable tend to not have so we can't speak to them. We don't know how to talk to them. We can only condescend to them well. We might as well say as few words as possible. Let's just train the cameras on them and let them entertain each other phew and out of that process of programming towards that this the person they had in their mind the disgusting pig they had in their mind. They summoned this other team to rule over us.

So it's yeah. The those are the those are now like the the warlocks. Those are the those are the the antichrist two now rule. It's like. It is like the second coming only they're both the antichrist. It's it's revelation where they're both the bad guy which would make sense if you were a gnostic because that's not really god that's yellow boweth and who's this person. That's probably another conjured monster. That's that's it's he's there to keep you keep you in misery yeah.

Trump was summoned into his place in the political firmament by an incantation of barack obama remember he it was him making fun of trump at the correspondence dinner that made him decide to run for president donald. The the hype the dark lord himself spoke unto the world and brought forth a demon for him to battle and destroy the world with their thrashings and the problem is if that's our thesis and and that's our antithesis. I cannot imagine any synthesis emerging that is not a even more deeply satanic monstrosity like that would be like forming into a voltron like blurbing into each other and creating a new monstrosity not good. No our hope can be only that that that like synthesis that that that dialectic between trump and obama is embedded within the larger dialectic of american politics and that a thesis antithesis will emerge to that that is our hope. I mean there is an antithesis emerging. The question is will. It gain um the ability to resist and assert itself and build before we are pulled off of rickenback falls into the misty. Waters below that is a question for another time bye.
