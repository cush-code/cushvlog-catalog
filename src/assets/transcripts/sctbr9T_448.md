The why is it. Why is it hosting burning ah there we go they were hosting. Burning. Bob is that a is that a gamer of some sort someone who engages in the deadly mental onanism of gaming not approved by me. No thank you although. I shouldn't be one to talk I am essentially a gamer. I mean fundamentally. I am a gamer like if you if you if you like trace my you know career trajectory. It is essentially that I gamed so hard that. I became a professional gamer and the game of course being posting because that's a game. It's got a score. It's got a. It's got an object. It's got players. It's got ranks. It has emotional stakes but no real material stakes that's gaming. It is a sink for one's pent-up and unused energies. So I guess. This is my admission that I am in fact not only a gamer I am an ur gamer so the election's still going on. It's actually the exact nightmare scenario that people were worried about right. This was the liberal and left wing for in many cases worry about this election because of the nature of the ballot collection process.

You've got these states where trump is up on election night but coat's going to take a long time he's going to declare victory and he's going to call on his supporters to go out and and committed and carry out a coup on his behalf and stop voting that his judicial goons will back him up and what is actually happening. Trump is doing everything that everyone said he would do he's not taking the high road. He is. He is saying the stuff that before the election people said was going to cause a civil war. I want people to go back and run and maybe. I even said this because like. I said I didn't realize until. I realized you know. I hope. I didn't. I always. I think back. I thinking back to this stupid issue. I feel like I was pretty consistent that I thought this was all horseshit but maybe I like was I even I feel like at this point. If I give it any credit. I feel like. I oversold the case but honestly. I felt like I had to give some credit or people just wouldn't listen to you they're like well.

This is so absurdly ridiculous to think this isn't a real threat that we don't live in this country with the fascist police state and the proud boys and the nazis in the street. You can't tell me that there's a realtor and so I felt like. I had to like extend just a a bone to even like be able to get a conversation going or get people to like listen. But now it's like okay. The barn door is closed because this is the scenario think of someone before on election night who said what if this happens they would say he will do a coup that's what they would mean or there'd be. Some sort of fighting in the streets and blood in the streets would be the number one thing they would say they would say violence how it would come out. They might not essay but they would say violence. What have we actually seen where are the proud boys that were told to stand back and stand by where are the militias the three percenters and the oath keepers and the promise keepers and the the patriot prayer boys where are they with their guns. The biggest crowds. I've seen are a bunch of pennsylvania just they went through the protest and they broke out a karaoke machine and what does this lay on to. It lays onto a situation where all these issues that we've wrapped so much importance around. Like this is titanic titanic battles. About the future of the of the race are identified as sports fandoms. These people get together they basically have a tailgate party and you see videos of some dorks chanting and they're like this is voter suppression.

This and it's like yeah sure the intention is bad. These are people who don't respect you and don't think that you deserve rights and yeah. All that stuff is true but what is their power to enact their world. What is their power to enact that world. Their power to enact that world is is their vote and then what else though what else what else really besides posting. Maybe if they go on facebook besides amplifying things and getting other people to vote. Maybe what are they doing being obnoxious to people in viral videos are they actually applying any base on their consumer consumer. Interactions in society to to make the world more racist. I mean some of them are doing like hate crimes and some of them are doing shootings and once again that's terrible and awful.

But you have to put those things in perspective or else why aren't you a psychotically tough on crime conservative because if like one life lost to violence is like evidence we have to drop everything then you're dick cheney. Things have to be put in perspective that was how terrorism worked. People in the bush years were saying my god terrorism what's the at the end of the day what's the big deal people would say my god you're saying you would allow a terrorist attack in america. So it's like well it wouldn't be ideal but like if the cost of not having that is this awful war like. I'm sorry maybe we take some they would say you would that makes sense but in this case in this specific instance no any violence carried out in the name of politics. We have to orient our entire politics around stopping and I'm saying that was a big part of whatever the telling me oh yeah well you know they they're waiting for their moment. This is the moment this is literally the scenario that everyone was talking about.

This is dip to the t everything has gone as they have said and what has happened. Guys like rupert murdoch said oh yeah arizona's for biden and you we're not gonna reverse the call what did mitch mcconnell say he said you know there is actually a difference between um you know counting votes after a vote and recounting or getting new votes like it's just keep counting them they're they're all regular votes what about the case and the cases don't even have like a beer. They're too incompetently put together. Jared kushner literally was like googling how to steal election on election night. That's how much planning had gone into this. Trying to say hey is there a guy like james baker can we find like a incredibly powerful and influential political fixer who's been you know right in the top levels of american politics for 30. Because yes there are millions of crazy trump supporters but their craziness is the way that they're crazy about being a the belief because that's how you reinforce the emotional connection. You have to the idea of yourself as a fan of something but are you going to risk your.

[07:34](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=07m34s)

Life at the end of the day because how many I mean in europe. It's one thing with the soccer where it's actually very political. Like you know in in cultures where polit political life actually had some like teeth to it as recently as world war ii and afterwards um even if it's dissolving now there as well as it is here. But what like we have riots sometimes when a team wins. But some guys turn over a car that's it there's no huge apocalyptic confrontation with the cops. There aren't deaths there isn't any real confrontation with the state. There isn't any kind of ethnic pogrom. It's just a spontaneous expression of people's over pent emotional connection to a pseudo event that they're participating in virtually and that's what they are doing. They're doing what you would do. If your team won or lost or. I guess waited for a really really long instant replay call and you really cared. That's what we're dealing with and what that means the good news people said. I was really blackpill yesterday. I don't think that's the case. I think blackpill is some like everything else.

It's part of the culture of like having an identity and a take that like takes the place of asking yourself. What you're gonna do about politics because like I have said you have to make politics part of your life as a citizen and as a family member and as a friend and as somebody who lives in a community in a country because you are a human being but with the but the but the actual content of that is determined by your experiences not a black pill. Oh. I took the black pail now. I get the game all day if you're gaming all day you're deadening the thing in your in your soul. That says you should try to make things better black pill is. It's a pill. It's a. It's a zoloft you're gonna have to answer those questions. People say it's blackmail because it tells them you can't find it here. And that is a blackfield. That's the truest black pill because you're saying this thing that I have pseudo that.

I have identified with as like a zone of of political participation and engagement and like building my character and ethic as a human being and building real real. Like actions around my reputed mental values that I hold the things that give them texture and reality that cannot provide me with a political meaning well. Then political meaning doesn't exist by definition because that's the only place you can get it and that's one of the reasons we're in. This mess is because people feel that in their guts but it's not true because even if it's not electoral and it might be there will still be something you can do that can turns into politics if enough people do it and I know that that's not great. But I know that sounds like maybe some anarchist. It really isn't it's just an acknowledgment that this thing is not the society. I mean. I know that's cliche. It's literally the matrix. But it is. It's like it is the matrix. There's a reason that people love talking about the matrix because it is just a perfect metaphor. For the experience of this again. We have all accepted it's up like yeah. I know it's the matrix but I know it's the matrix but and I would say that for the last four years I don't blame anyone for thinking. I know but it's a matrix but because we didn't know what was working.

We didn't know what was happening. We only knew that everything was up in the air. We were trying to figure it out the only way we knew how which was to consult the only forum the only public engagement that most of us have which is the online space and we went looking for answers and that was the only place we were even. We were only going to be able to find them there. So it was totally made sense to do it and I think things were learned by doing that things were built that had material consequences but now is the time to recognize what's going on okay. There is no but the good news though is that there is another place that you can try to build zion and that means you have to build institutions and you have to find institutions that connect to the people you know and who you have trust with and who you could build out with like say labor unions and things like that not spontaneous street demonstrations. That's what they're doing right. Now. That's what everything has been for the past four years spontaneous personal expressions of an overflowing sense of political a need to politically define oneself driven by the trauma and horror of the living in the moment and feeling like you're a political subject but ara's conception of ourselves. Political subjects is illusory and so when we go out and we perform political identity through demonstrations riots karaoke protests. It is inherently limited by our limited ability to recognize um to coordinate action because without coordination.

The action does not reverberate out upward and reinforce it like anything driven kinetically will re hit. Friction and momentum will be slowed and eventually the drain and that's like and and those particu eruptions can be very powerful and have short term be like traumatic and involve death and violence and these horrible narratives and real trauma and horror. But they will not. They are not the building blocks that people think they are. They are not the steps in an ascension that people think they are. They are random they explode the ripples go out and then the waters still until another eruption comes out because none of these are building anything beyond the sedimentary layer that over time might reach a tipping point but I think definitively. I'm sorry it has not been reached yet and I think this I think the way this is going the way this recount is or whatever the hell count is going the way that there's just none of the stuff anyone was worried about has come to pass and the way that we are just sort of suspended in like in a eternal election night.

I think that we are in for like a weird. It's weird. I don't know how to put it like. We're not gonna get an exhalation. We're not gonna get an exhalation but we're not gonna get a any catharsis. It's gonna be a ruined orgasm just an internal edging like a a election day that never ends but I think because that level of tension can't be sustained. I think the tension will turn into something else like the emotion can't go away but it will it will mutate and I think like all that the the anxiety is turning into something else because I don't know how the hell we see this totally muted response. This non-apocalypse carry come out happen in front of us and not respond by lightening up somehow which is I think why biden won honestly permanent election day. Baby just suspended because like this was supposed to be the apocalyptic confrontation we were going to banish evil or evil was going to roar its head at us one way or the other like if you're a conservative or or a liberal. That's what you thought blm antifa will be at your preschool feeding your child. He'll all meet or You know the proud boys will be bursting into your your local health food store and making and calling everyone soy based you'll be able to do nothing about it. But that's not gonna happen and there's not gonna be a you know you're not gonna get your chance because like I said both both urges are inherently sadistic. It's like yes you're scared of being punished but you're also excited about inflicting punishment so that's that's the the lure of it.

[16:12](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=16m12s)

That's like the emotional edge of it that makes it enjoyable the reason people do it because obviously you don't have to and we're gonna have to find a new sort of I guess. We're gonna have to change the channel and switch genres you know election day is gonna go on and now it's no longer the like the big budget um apocalypse movie. It's no longer. The roland emmerich end of the world movie that we were all in until election night. It's like I don't know some sort of comedy type situation. I don't know we'll find out it'll be funny though it's just going to be this thing the thing. I'm looking forward to is just is hopefully the the the need to like assert culture. I hope that goes away but honestly. I'm a little worried that because a lot of people are gonna take the election I mean wow. There's more racists out there than we think and so many more minority racists than I thought existed especially since I didn't think minorities could be racist oh boy. I might have to go you know what we need to do. We need to get rid of all this anti-white or anti-minority sentiment. All this racism we need more strided cultural hectoring for people to not be racist. We're going to have to hit the hit the accelerator but honestly I feel like without trump to goose people towards that like as you know a market incentive. It's gonna wane and we're gonna see some more fun programming as we said. I said we will said on the show. We just recorded. They're bringing back entourage. The man show we're gonna have all the fun like bush era knuckleheaded hijinks. There's gonna be no more anxiety cartoons everyone's gonna just sort of get get 70s about it like if that was like a like a 60.

It's not supposed to be like a 68 you know national anesthetic horribly illus anise horribilis then biden's going to be like that 70s come down that 70s come down where everybody just turned into hedonists and that means more fun and more fun more more entertaining entertainment stuff that doesn't have to that that does not stuff that is not marbled with politics like cut with politics to make up for the lack of entertainment value like. I think. That's what that's the best way to think of political content in modern art. The stuff that you know that the gamergate people hate wokeness and culture specifically television programs and stuff like that as I have said you know as capitalism is as totally marketized entertainment. As a concept it has made entertainment materially worse. It's made it. It's it's by removing the artistic element of it. It is no. It is not it is less and less every year art because artistic intent is levened out with money more and more and that means that it's it's it's pretty. I mean you'll have good stuff but like the trend line like the rate of profit. There's a reason for that those things correlate is going down and that means like if you think of it as like you're a butcher and you have these like it's. It's the it's the it's the it's the um.

It's like the golden age of cinema and you've got just this beautiful flank steak and you're making these like porterhouses for people. They're just like oh my god and there's all this rich deliciousness over the years. Though your stock your. Business gets bad you can afford worse less and less impressive funds of meat by the end of it. You've got this very disgusting like ground beef. How are you gonna. Serve this to people. It's rancid well.

[20:44](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=20m44s)

You cut it with stuff that there are a number of american cuisines that are basically that like scrapple and and ghetto. They're they're ways to stretch meat to make people get more of it to be able to Get. More out of less meat more food out of less meat and what they cut it with is something that isn't art but looks like art and politics is that politics is experienced as an art because it's experienced as an aesthetic experience and not as a lived experience as art is but it does not have the individual you know like human expression of art. It's it's directed to a very material and cynical end which means that it cannot speak to like a human a real real authentic human expression which is what art is. It's an authentic human expression and so it cannot be art but it's experienced like art. It's like. It's like high fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar. You know and you throw that in there and you you bulk up the burger. The shitty meat is still there. There's few there's less of it. There's nothing to cut it.

They've got to cut it with something and because of demographic trends and because of the way that the consumer economy is directed towards college-educated people because college-educated people tend to have more money and therefore are the subject of advertising attention has to reflect the politics of those people who you are directing your your advertisement stores which is how you have a entertainment product in the first place in the case of television but like it expresses itself similarly all across you know. People with college degrees are more likely to be able to send their kids into the arts et cetera et cetera and so that means you get more people actually in the business of that doing having these opinions and that's not there's not there's no conservative conspiracy. There there's no cultural marxists. In the in the wings. There isn't a profit out of it and leaving a charred skeleton. So I haven't looked at the chat in a while didn't look at the chat at all yesterday content versus art. Exactly content is it can have artistic elements to it but the fact that it's content means that it's our artistic. Content has been inherently adulterated in a way that not all art is all artists to a degree because everything is commercialized but but that experience of expressing art is commercialized to different degrees and over time it becomes more commercialized that means it turns into content.

The needle goes. It's like if it's if. It's art up until here then it's content over time. Stuff tends and now we're at a point where not everything is but a lot is and more and more over time will be. I didn't say it was a dichotomy. I said it was a spectrum. It's not a thing. It isn't a collaboration of things with certain tendencies emerging from them. You've got two different things that break into you've got a trajectory of things over time that break one way or another and then you have a periodization where before they were this and after that there's something else that's like the way that the means of production change over time and then the relevant social structures that emerge from them and vice versa. You can't get me with the false dichotomy thing ever that's not gonna work. That's the beauty of dialectics nope degrees oh boy trump is speaking at 6 30.

I might have to log off a little early tonight. I think that's okay. I went ahead 45 minutes last time. So. I think it's okay if I go 45 this time. But I think I might have to log on for that.

[26:09](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=26m09s)

I haven't watched him speak in a while he hasn't sounded good. Lately they have to have him suited up. I actually kind of suspect that he's going to be down beat but that'll be funny too. I will say shout out to trump because it looks like he's going to get the result he wanted which was. He gets to stop being president without having been branded in his own mind anyway as a guy who lost the presidential election especially to joe biden because he has convinced himself that it's stolen from him and more importantly. He has convinced the vast majority of people who voted for him that he is right and so that means he can maintain his position as a guy who gets all the attention of being president and all the imagined positive attention of being president without having to do all the that he hated doing so once again. This guy the irony of ironies donald trump is the luckiest man on earth in the sense that he has pursued single-mindedly a single desire in his entire life and achieved every possible stepping stone that you could conceive of accomplish with that goal in mind and he has been miserable the entire time.

That is what I have before referred to on this program as the hedonic treadmill and it's a and one of the worst things that can happen to someone is to always get what they want because at some point you have to reflect inward on the fact that getting what you want doesn't work. But if you are s focused enough and narcissistic enough you could just you can thread that kneel and never have that moment and never not be able to drown that moment out with the blaring television piping the ordering the assassination of a iranian general. I gotta say though him just like going we we claim the like and that's the other part of this that is hilarious because you had yes this army of the darkness that was going to emerge from the suburbs and just claim the government and I know people say well. The cops were the real ones. I'm sorry these guys all have pensions they have to have they are as atomized. As we are.

They are reactionary and they have power to club people and they get to like carry out higher levels of violence against the population. The guys who have the same opinions and would want to do that but they have the same. Minorities in their in their rumpus room you really think they have visions of some imperium but the other part of it.

The other flip side is trump had to actually do the thing and his idea of doing the thing is exactly what everyone's joke version of it would be. He literally just tweeted it and expected that to do the job because that's what his entire presidency has been because the actual wheels of power have been grinding behind him the just inexorable pull towards an eye annihilation. You know the background hum of of neoliberal just austerity strip mining the human the the planet and our species being and he's just the whole time and that has been because that's what people talk about and all he cares about is what people are talking about because he's watching television.

The entire time he gets to solve every problem through tweeting about it and here is a problem that must be solved. It must be solved or tweeting about it and that means what that means that his dumbest acolytes like blue dobbs does exactly what those pants sweaters before the election were terrified was gonna happen. He goes on national television and tells the treason followers to go to the cities and stop the count and but what about the actual people who would have to do something like state legislatures or federal judges or anything like that who's doing what a guy like mitch mcconnell. What are they doing. They have institutional prerogatives institutional ambitions that transcend the trump administration. They are part of the deep state that's the funniest part is that for most of these deep state hates trump so that means that he's a real threat to them. It's like yeah. They don't like him. They would rather have a guy whose motives they can anticipate because they're broadly theirs which is of like a ruling class self-directing. His is a personal ego completely unbound by adherence to any norm or project beyond his own validation and that's not ideal. Now you need him you need him. You can't win without him and now the people who make up a big bulk of the of of the voters and a lot of the people in power have an ideological connection to him and they they root for him and they take his framing on a lot of issues.

[31:19](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=31m19s)

But you still would much rather especially at this point after you've got what you wanted four years. Federal judiciary completely stacked six three supreme court majority for the next decade and now my god. This election think they might keep the senate and more important than anything. They kept those state legislatures. Those ones that they won in the 2012 freedom caucus tea party wave the ones that were supposed to go back to the democrats in the big wave. We were going to get for joe biden with this huge spike in voter turnout to repudiate the disastrous trump administration. They kept them which means bad maps are going to get worse and it means that the the electoral path for even the neoliberal democratic party to wield power let alone any fraction of left-wing voters within it will wink away with time.

Why would they want to put any of that in jeopardy for him personally and his network of paperweight off your desk and hock it for five dollars. You're gonna go and have a sp. Secret meeting with them about you know adrenochrome harvesting or something and they're gonna try to sell you a time share. You don't need them and you've got the fact that you've got this rolling crisis that there's nothing in the leo liberal playbook to fix why wouldn't you want to let the democrats do what you did in 2010 22008 which was taken on the chin for the failure to reconstruct anything out of the economic collapse and best of all. There is no direct incentive to you personally as a member of this class of people to help him because well like the impeachment was a no-brainer. No republican or at least no republican who didn't live in utah was going to vote to impeach trump because they would have lost their job and they all liked their jobs. No one in the important crevices of republican power over like the electoral legislative judicial system has that threat none of them are going to personally be blamed for long. This happened my god they're blaming fox news you're off the hook. All of them by the way have essentially accepted that he's going to lose by.

I mean that's the other thing that's another reason that the civil war idea was never going to happen because neither side was going to be able to keep up the head of steam about an election being lost because you know when I think about it as I pick up my ar to go out and like maybe eat lead. Some has to happen and two they all think that kind of stuff could happen what for an election like I remember when obama was president like. I would get mad at him. He was on the tv but like I still had a tv and I like watching it and I still do it's just gonna. It would just eak it away now if he wins and trump could still win. It will be not because they stop the count and a bunch of ballots are just invalidated. It'll be because the actual count requires a recount or there's a narrow enough discrepancy that they can do actual bush be gore again and if that happens then that's par for the course the same way you can't complain that you lost the electoral college because that was baked in that level of voter theft of election.

Fat theft is by definition baked in because it already happened and you have no excuse but you sure say that that's a coup or that we've ended democracy and nobody will believe you if you say it and so you'll say it with less and less force as nobody takes that principle seriously and then you're back into the slog so really. I think we're gonna. See this sort of like ease tension like just sort of prolonged brezhnevia shrugged towards whatever that it's not terminal. It's not like I'm saying everything's going to collapse. This could go on for god oh. God. You have no idea how long you've gone at least four years of just like with either trump or biden. In there what becomes of q. That's a very good question. I think there is going to be if he loses. There's going to be some serious disillusionment. But I think the real hardcore and this is always what happens when prophecy fails. Not everybody sticks everybody who's committed enough sticks like. I was talking about all these things are in degrees. Not every q person is a rabid cue person a lot of them and they will say this when you talk to them.

[36:28](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=36m28s)

In these interviews. Everyone gives them they'll say look. It's like an astrology basically like you get up in the morning and you know you read your. Horoscope nobody really thinks that shit's true but it's interesting and you think about it over the course of the day and it like makes you reflect on yourself and it provides you with like some texture to your social experience. Cube. Here is the same thing you can read them in the morning and it's like a horoscope like be on the lookout for the letter l and the number 88 and then you do during the course of the day and it's a little entertainment and when that happens like eventually you're just gonna move on to sudoku for the real heads.

Though it's gonna become a religious thing and like trump will be a submarine and left behind a clone so that he could find the holy grail under antarctica in a submarine like okay fine. But I think that it will be stripped of specifics and like that ambient q stuff is going to find another poll if trump loses. But it will tend to to go towards like a reactionary like anti like a reactionary like socially hostile direction that's for sure. But I think that the specific contours are gonna. It's gonna depend on what's thrown up by history just like q was.

I will be interested to see how the cue congresswoman does like is she gonna just start calling everybody up for and be like ask them under oath if they eat children that would be very funny. My guess is now that she's in congress she's gonna settle down just like the tea party people did and the funny thing is is people like to say that's proof that like oh yeah the tea party was a failure. Like no it wasn't. It absolutely reoriented the demo the republican party broadly to the right which is all it was ever viable to do that's how these things work like. It's a pressure group exerts like an influence that like over time ratchet affects a a party in a direction ideologically and creates new new barriers for like for litmus tests for candidates which ideologically then cohere onto the actual people who run for office. It's a success q will do the same thing like these people will change the ideological con the ideological content of the mind of the average congressman and that will have its effect that's certainly true we'll see.

I would say yes someone says glenn. Beck's chalkboard was proto cue correct problem with that was that it was not collaborative. It was watching someone play a video game which isn't as fun as playing the game yourself and that was the quantum leap forward that was like the thing that boosted q and made it so enduring. Because oh this is a game you can play yourself. You have to have to watch some guy do the controllers which is what is fun like you get to do your own blackboard do the home game the bet the glenn beck home game and now he's a up on trump absolutely. How I mean how do you not recognize how do you not recognize your audience enough to know that that was going to be a bad play unless he figured and I think correctly that his shtick it's not like he could like he could not have been pro-trump because trump was a direct replacement for him. Like his figure in politics was it's like a sun going supernova like he's this little planet over here. During the obama years he was consumed and he would have been consumed. There was nowhere for him to go but his attempt to go anti-trump was a hilarious bit of cope is to try to like pivot away and it failed and then he came crawling back and then that that made him the most pathetic of creatures. Somebody else keeps asking me about what I think about custer which is an odd question. I'll leave it at that because I'm gonna go and and watch this trump talk because I want to see the li. The live stuff like we're like the entertainment value of trump is going to wane pretty quickly. Once he's no longer president and I want to get the last good drops of juice.

[41:01](https://youtu.be/sctbr9T_448?t=41m01s)

I mean custer was a very glorious buffoon and that just a a a parody of a human being which is what mark twain said about francis fuston but it it attracts for him. What I think is interesting about custer is that in his role with fighting the sioux both with washida creek and then finally little blue corn. He was essentially acting as a mercenary on behalf of railroad interests like he was not ordered to do any of that stuff. They went out there as part of a a collaboration to to engage the sioux in a war that would see them thrown out of that territory. This is a provocation this is a bad guy all around.
