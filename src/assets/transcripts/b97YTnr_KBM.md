Welcome to the chat room we got lots of games. I've done that one before but it's still funny to me anyway all about the rest of you. We've got posts that you can find for any you may need. If you need your posts. We've got your machine or your disease whatever. I don't know.

It's never a big g r fan good morning sunday morning thank you. It's a nice crisp fall day. It's something so crisp. I'm loving the crisp loving the crisp got a new flavor today cranberry lime. I haven't had that one before it's okay probably wouldn't get it again if other options exist. But I always like to try new new flavors. It is an odd combo. I want to give it a shot we're not talking about the fly we're not talking about the fly that's stupid. We're not talking about any in fact. I'm not trying to talk about that stupid debate at all other than to say how funny it is that they're so desperate to make things normal have.

I seen the movie the apple. I actually did a charity um commentary track for the apple with josh olson and gareth reynolds from the dollop and will a couple other people. I think during earlier in quarantine. It was pretty funny. I had some good bits in that one. If I'm remembering correctly it's an amazing film one of the greatest works of the canon filmmakers in the 80s. What is soy facing wow you have not been logging on very long. Have you ah. That's us baby. I have no idea what's going on with the second wave. I I'm not plugged in in any way. I'm just out here. I mean yeah.

I know the seeds are going buckwild and I thankfully don't live near them anymore. I used to live right not. I think the ones that were going buck wilder in burrow park. I think the the ones in the ones in crown heights are a little more chill. They have not been beating people up anyway and that's where I used to live but anyway. I would rather not be around a bunch of people who refuse to wear the mass in public so but yeah. I'm far enough away from them that I just keep. I keep my distance and good luck good luck to all that. I say. I do think it's funny where they're trying to act like and trying to impose health. You know public health. Standards on the seeds is like the warsaw ghetto. I don't know how the hell you keep pulling that out of your ass and have expect people to keep accepting it as true and not eventually just rolling their eyes and giving you the old stroke off move well. You somebody says it's a total rejection of modernity. Not really they drive cars they use cell phones. I mean if they really wanted to reject maternity buy some land and farm it like the amish do this thing. We're like no. We don't we won't have any connection to the to the larger culture or you know society. But we also demand modern infrastructure.

Sorry you don't get you shouldn't. Anyway get to do that in my opinion okay. That's so the thing about the thing. I want to talk about to start off with is the is the case in michigan about the attempted the honestly. I'm sorry hilarious attempt attempt to kidnap the governor of michigan and put her on trial for crimes against the constitution which was broken up by the fbi thanks to a paid informant. If these guys were muslim would anyone take this. Seriously for a second is what I ask would anybody would anybody who is freaking out now about how the nazis are about to come. In night of the long knives. Anyone would anybody be saying that this is the exact same playbook. The fbi ran for a decade when people cared about terrorism which of course now they don't which is hilarious if you're old enough to remember after 9 11 when terrorism was the defining social anxiety for like for for a good five six years. Now it's off the radar and so we're all scared of each other. The we we we're done going out there. Like iraq was the last the last frontier. We can no longer impose our will on the world and we all know that at some level so now the new enemy is within and so a lot of people who should know better are freaking out because the fbi had some dude who wanted a playstation who got some yak some yahoos to say hey you wanna you wanna abduct the governor and they go yeah. Let's do it and now you got guys saying oh my god. There was gonna be a coup in michigan thank god the fbi came and stopped them the fbi. The guys who killed fred hampton and maybe mlk they're your friends. Now. They're the good guys. They're the ones saving us from the from the nazi hordes. I mean I understand the psychic need to have to feel like to feel like you are aware in a way. Other people aren't about how bad things are you know because it does seem like everybody is just sleepwalking through the apocalypse and I totally understand that and people want some way that they can signal to others and themselves that they are not like the everyone else they're not as as stupefied as everyone else. They're they see through they're cutting through and so one way to do that is to convince yourself that we're on the verge of some sort of nazi overthrow of the government and the thing I don't get about those people though is if there if there was a if there was a coup tomorrow. What would you have done to have stopped it. Even though the people who are so certain that we're on the verge of some nazi takeover.

What would you have done to stop it. What could what position would you be into to to oppose it if it happened. You post you'd post you can post just like the rest of us and right now. I think a lot of it is because a lot of people are are coming to terms that they're going to vote for biden and they're not happy about it and so they're convincing themselves that they have to that that that the threat of a trump-inspired night of the long knives is too too present too real to do anything other than vote for biden. Even if you don't like him and the thing is you don't have to go through those mental gymnastics. It's not as I have said a million goddamn times. It's not that big of a deal who you vote for if you want to vote for biden just do it whatever not my problem not anybody's problem but trying to but but insisting on a mental realm where you're under constant attack.

From these these these nazi hordes and then trying to insisting that you have to convince everybody else of that too. You you in the interest of just assuaging a sense of of you know violation of principles that you're going to vote for this awful deal. Liberal you end up making it harder for everybody else to concentrate and figure out what the is going on like the people who say I actually saw multiple people say it was an attempted coup if six yahoo show up at the governor's mansion and take her hostage. Does that mean that they're now in charge of the state of michigan is that what people would think would happen is that honestly what people would think would happen shhh. I think another part of it is people want a people want. Some sort of resolution to all this people want a fracture point people want to stop having to go to work. You know people want to stop having to pay their credit card bills even if it means they're running from lord humongous. At least things are different. At least they don't feel like they're continuing to carry out.

These social obligations purely out of momentum out of just the the fact that there is no other alternative and how horrible and and empty that feels you know a a apocalyptic revelation of underlying conditions that breaks our social obligations. I think that's something that people are secretly on all levels craving and like what I really don't get from like a lot of left left wing people who I think generally will say yeah the cops are not your friend. In fact the real problem isn't even you know the the paramilitaries. It's the police well then what how do you explain the fact that the fbi broke this up like what do you what is your. What are you imagining here that like the fbi are are the one good police police force or that in this one case they did a good thing or does the fbi do what it always does which is try to raise and a um pay bump and justify budgets which is why they do it which is. I mean yes. All those fake terror attacks that the fbi set up and then thwarted in the in the bush years. They certainly did have a political purpose and that they stoked the hysteria about terrorism. But the real front of the brain motivation of everyone involved was to was to have a good quarter was to justify their their payroll line and that's what they're doing I think if there's one thing we can do and there's very little.

We can do which is what's so terrifying and so innervating and sad about the moment and why people want to find an a grand narrative. They can cling to if there's one thing we can do. It is sort of sit with our real conditions as shitty as that is and that will help us find a way forward individually because that's the only way we can move forward because there ever all sense that there is a collective is a fantasy. It is. It is a illusion that is propped up by our engagement with a social media that has the that appears to be like some sort of cross-section of america that appears to be a group of people who are in communication with each other and can hypothetically activate and organize coordinates through coordination. But in reality it's just everyone screaming individually into the void and then making what amount to social groups out of it.

The other thing is I think people think that if the right wing is this real threat if the right wing like paramilitary extreme is that important that means the left wing must also be in some sense and it's not oh who is lord mungus lord humongous lord humongous from the road warrior walk away walk away from the gasoline someone's calling. I said someone's calling me a hypocrite probably I am everyone is you can't not be. That's the price of living in this. At this moment is it is that principles are principles are abstract. Someone's all right are you not concerned.

The gop has the electoral college sufficiently gained to lose at this point. They can't to the point that they can't lose if that's true we'll find out and if it is what are we going to do about it. That's the question what are we going to do about it and if you look around you'll see that there is no capacity to resist that right. Now so build capacity is what we have to do but that doesn't seem what people seem to be interested in people seem to be interested in in getting people anxious in making people aware of an of a sense of anxiety of a sen of just this to be on an edge that can only be satisfied at the symbolic level because it's so overwhelmingly at the level like worrying about something like if the is the electoral college and and gerrymandering and voter suppression and vote vote theft and all the other things that republicans could do to maintain power can you do anything about that as a person you can't but you can fixate on it and obsess about it. And while you're doing that what are you not doing people are looking for instant ascension. I think that's it people think that because the problem seems so intractable in their personal lives and in the world around them there's so little social context to their existence that if we focus enough at the highest levels like where the real because we understand that these things emerge from huge systems and structures that are beyond us. If we can concentrate hard enough at that level. We will be able to phase transition am I saying that the birth of a nation didn't have an influence on people joining the kkk or top gun influence dumbasses joining the navy.

No it probably did both of those things absolutely happened but birth of a nation is not why the kkk rose to prominence in the in in the early 1900s. That is not why it happened. The military buildup of the reagan years was not caused by top gun and political movements that are based around stamping down symbolic outcomes. Outcroppings of material conditions will never affect those material conditions oh who's manking everybody manking. That's such a weird thing to make a movie about about the the screenwriting credit for citizen kane. I'll watch it probably just seems like a weird thing to make a movie about mank folks ah paul paul you hear about mank mank paul mink. It's banking season. How bad is the sorkin movie going to be. I mean. I already know what the justice is going to be. It's going to be those damn yippies those those those those children.

Those unrealistic punks abby hoffman and jerry rubin. They undermined the work of real effective political activists like tom hayden and the thing is if that's the case. I don't know how mad. I'm going to be because the yippies did suck. I'm sorry they were bash. It was embarrassing. I mean it's the purest like middle class like lifestyle politics which is part partial to the to the to the new left. In general. I mean the fact that jerry rubin became a like stock broker or whatever that's hilarious pretty pretty almost it's too on the nose. Like the fate of most of those guys is amazing when you look at what happened just the way that everything got subsumed by by the culture. The 70s culture of like individual pursuit because it was always an individual pursuit. It was just in the guise of politics which is true of politics now too. I mean we really are in a uniquely a unique historical material condition where it is almost impossible to to effectively make effectively live political values. What we can do is express political values socially in ways that almost always end up being reinforcements of some personal branding exercise and I include myself. Among this. It's because there's no the slots aren't there for anything else way less pro inter.

Apparently abby. Hoffman was less pro-intervention whatever that means than I am okay. I I'll take your word for it. I don't hate anarchists. I just think that it's not. I don't think it's. It's helpful. I mean. I'm just saying not even not that's wrong not helpful i. I just don't think that it is a. It is a lens that that is effective that it ends up reinforcing all the worst patterns in in like leftist political organizing and and thought but people within it can be very well intentioned and can be effective organizers and effective comrades if you want to get cringy about it. But they would probably be more so if they weren't anarchists.

 got some weird comments here today threatening murder and such. Apparently pence pence might have it which if you watch the debate last night that makes sense he did not look good. He looked rough he was looking very very pink. He had the eyeball he had the big red eyeball the which biden did earlier in the campaign remember he first one in one of the primary debates he came out just had a perfect red eyeball. I I look forward to this as as the new normal of candidates pretending not to be sick at debates and then just having parts of their body fall off the only thing. I took from that debate is that pence is not going to inherit anything from trump. He is an absolute wet towel lamo no absolutely no base it was watching him what felt like looking through a time portal to the bush era. He was like a free. He was like a dehydrated george w bush. All of this charisma removed his and all that's left is just that squinty eyed dumb sounding. Keeningly whiny evangelical tone which even evangelicals clearly at this point are sick of and want somebody who's just gonna big dick people. The man is swagless. The man is absolutely swagless oh god the 25th amendment thing just these democrats.

Trump just said he's not going to do. A stimulus. People are dying here collapse in the next couple of months barring another infusion of stimulus because people don't have any goddamn money like genuinely are out of money and she wants to have some sort of parlor game discussion about whether he's fit to be president less than a month before the goddamn election. She doesn't want to talk about that stimulus and honestly it's because she doesn't want to do a stimulus either because she has made the political conclusion that he will be blamed for it and therefore don't let it happen and that that's cruel. But it might be true but only if you actually make people aware of that and reinforce it and instead of reinforcing it instead of talking about how he's stonewalling a needed. Wild goose chase about his health even being.

It's like these people are absolutely cold-blooded scum who have no concern for any human being's life who play politics strictly as this lizard battle for power and influence and yet among democrats. Even then their instincts at doing it are. It's amazing like they're bad and then bad at being bad amazing. I mean the 20. I mean what the heck congress has nothing to do with the 25th amendment. The 25th amendment is if a majority of the cabinet signs a letter saying that they that the president is not fit to to um have ought to perform the office that's where the start of it is. It's the cabinet you think the cabinet you think trump's cabinet's going to do that. No there's nothing. There's no role for congress except to take make this the story and the thing is all trump has to do is keep putting out those hilarious videos where he's doing proof of life about how you know you didn't know it. But I'm actually a senior citizen. I you didn't know and I didn't want to say it. But I'm actually. I'm a senior. I know you thought. I was 32. You thought. I was too young to be president because of how wonderful strong.

I am all he has to do is keep doing that and people will be like nancy. Pelosi seems like a hysterical maniac. I mean hell they might lose who knows they could like. I said trump winning trump winning in these conditions trump winning while dying of kovid that would also be very funny. So it's not like that's off the table as a possibility okay. Somebody said about the right pot. They wanted a clarification when I was talking about the right populism and it was after trump said no dice to more stimulus. There's this persistent kind of wish slash warning. I see people make that the right wing because the democrats are so wedded to neoliberalism and refuse to do any kind of real populist rearrangement of the economy that that's going to leave a space for the republicans to do it. And I think the fact that we have not seen another round of checks. This close to the election with a guy like trump in power and a guy like mnuchin as treasury secretary guys who do not believe in all any of the arthur laughter. About debt. I mean none of them really do but these guys really really don't.

It tells me that the party itself is for a number of reasons constitutionally incapable of delivering this kind of populism with trump and i. I don't think as I have said whoever comes after trump is going to be more beholden to the republican party than trump is which means they're even less going to have less leeway to try to actually provide some sort of hair invoke social democracy which means it's just going to be more. It's going to be pure culture and I understand why people just want want some way out of this. This horrible vacuum sealed hell of endless culture war while everyone slowly starves to that. But I'm sorry that is what politics two-party politics is going to be for the foreseeable future until unless that dynamic is interrupted by a third force people of humans. Not political parties that are that are fused to capital at the top of him fused do.

I think trump ever smoked weed absolutely not. I don't think he's he might not even have done coke the fact that he does those weird. British. Antihistamines tells me that he's got like he doesn't drink we know that I think he's got some sort of weird phobia about losing control and so he has to do drugs that aren't illegal that are prescribed the same way he has to get fast food from He has to get food from fast food places where it's all always looks the same and it has like the he it ha everything he puts into. His body has to have come from some multinational corporation. That's that's that's what tells him that it has. It is a controlled product anything else where to come from what's in it who knows he doesn't want it. No no no no so yeah adderall. Probably. We know he's on all the weird decongestants But I don't think he does. He's he would not do any illegal drug because where to come from where to come from and now he is completely he is in a god-like high on the. Steroids he's on which who knows how long that will last.

Although now he wants to push back the next debate which tells me that he's still sick in some like he's aware not just that he's sick. But he's aware that he's sick because I don't know. I would think that if he was genuinely feeling better he would want to have the debate and he'd be like yes. Let's do it next thursday. I can show america that I'm still there and the fact that he's like let's do it a week later. I don't know man. Gotta raise the eyebrow there. He's very right now. I think he's absolutely terrified of going out like stan shara. He actually said in that video he put out today. You know people say you're vulnerable talking about the seniors. You're vulnerable and you're not vulnerable. You're. The least vulnerable but in this case you're vulnerable and I'm vulnerable. He actually said that it's creeping in there man.

It's death of ivan. It's death of ivan ilich territory for him. The eternal footman is holding his coat and snickering but whether he'll actually go or not. I have no idea am I going to go in like sanshira tell me be straight with me am I going out with stanchira has anyone heard from chris. Christie is he still in the hospital yeah cranberry lime puller weird the best thing about that stan. Cherish story is that you know and I know at least in my heart that it's not like he was worried that he had any kind of empathy for stan shara. It's that as soon as dan sherrod died of kovid in trump's mind he became a loser he was a chump even if he might have liked him as much as he can like another person which is very very little. As soon as he died. He was garbage and so now the thought am I going out like stan. Shara is am I going to be a loser which is why he's the most miserable man on earth because he is he cannot conquer death which is the only way that he could ever remove that the misery of his of his every moment because this misery is driven at base by the knowledge that this this sensory castle that he has invested all of himself into is is temporary stancher died like a dog a bystander oh yeah mike lee say mike lee saying america is not a democracy that's actually classic john birch society. That used to be a refrain of the john birch society is that america is not a democracy.

It's a republic and they would They would you know you always do it like a town hall or something the cranks because somebody would say something like we're a democracy and someone would go ah actually. We're a republic so this is just. This is old school paleo conservativism making a comeback and it's in defense of you know the counter-majority and impulse that is now controls government and I think the strongest argument against that like beyond obviously like even if you take the premises correct like democracy is ruled by the mob and the mob is not is never going to be able to understand. What is the best interest of all because they're too selfish and narrowly focused and too impulsive because they have not been refined enough to exercise discretion and virtue the way that the the the men of of worth do you know. This goes back to the ancient rome but I'd say even on their own premises look at what this counter-majoritarian republican institutional framework has given us who is in charge right. Now.

These are the dumbest on the earth who have led like just look at covet as a as by itself. A singularly incompetent response to a a a public health crisis. These guys these republican institutions are not they're not sending their best because you only reproduce privilege and that means that you're just getting habsburgs very shortly even with even if you start with purely a meritocratic framework. You will very shortly get nothing but carlos. The bewitcheds don juniors and because they're guaranteed spots regardless of their ver regardless of their merit and living the way that these people do essentially is designed to prevent you from ever acquiring merits of any kind ever acquiring virtues of any kind because you are denied any opportunity to exercise them because money lubricates everything and it makes it makes taking the easy way out almost always the smart choice in the near term and you do that long enough and then you're at best what wyatt coke making terrible shirts and thinking that you're. A fashion designer qb halloween was not.

I'd say it's probably the most enjoyable of the um of the adam. Sandler netflix movies that I've seen mostly because it was such a self-conscious reference to the old happy. Madison movies that everybody liked or more more people like it was. It was a it's a weird mishmash of like billy madison waterboy happy gilmore alex just like packed together a little nicky. I guess and he and he finally found a new. It's like he has a different voice. In this one. It's sort of It's a different kind of of of way to talk funny which hey he's like 65. I give him credit for being able to to mix it up at this point but that whole republic. Not a democracy thing is so funny because it's so transparent about maintaining existing power structures like it's saying that these are inherently the correct power structures basically because they persist which makes sense given.

America's you know providing presiding ideology and even religious ideologies which is because this is the land of where we made our own destiny right. This is the land where people came from other places to inscribe the land as we wanted to because it was. It was a continent's worth of free real estate explorated from people who were not part of any kind of understanding of the public that wherever that money ended up wherever that power ended up wherever that land ownership ended up aft through that process by definition is the correct where is where it should have ended up and attempts to change that distribution are interfering with god's will in a very real sense interfering with um even if you're not religious interfering with a just the just distribution and the most efficient and most correct distribution because it is the distribution that currently exists best baseball movie major league of course. I did see color out of space. It was it was okay. I didn't love it.

I I did think that cage was fun and the fact that he did a trump impression like his dad because the whole thing is. He turns into his his abusive father over the course of the movie and that his abusive father voice is clearly him doing a trump impression that was a fun choice. But it's also it shows you how the trump era has totally destroyed art in a lot of ways because he is not a person who really we should be thinking about that much and I know that's hilarious for me to say. I mean in terms of making art you know making stuff that's supposed to speak to deep like if you're trying to adapt lovecraft. You know you're talking about existential questions man's place in the universe and to bring him into it. It's kind of It's a little even if it's entertaining which it was. It's also a little depressing because you just think oh like this this figure. This pathetic figure is now the lens that we're going to look through all of our most important questions through.

I talked about the john brown show previously. I did not like the first episode at all. But I'm willing to accept that. I might be misinterpreting it honestly when the character at the beginning said some people call him a white savior that kind of soured me on the whole thing. And I probably it's going to be hard for me to evaluate it fairly after that. So I'll have to watch a few more episodes to see if I can get the taste out of my mouth from that and for me. It's not even the thing that bothers me about that isn't like it's insulting john brown oh no my boyfriend john brown. I love him don't say mean things about him. It's more than just that. I don't think that that is a that that is such a contemporary framing that having it come out of the mouth of a character from the 1860s to me. It's it's it just flashed to me like oh god. No this is another one of these movies. This is another one of these shows.

This is another one of these things that we're all seeing which is how can we take that the past that alien country and instead of trying to understand it try to turn it into now so so take it out of its context and just flatten it into something that we can recognize and doing that to me robs it of any of its magic or or what makes it interesting which republican governor tries to secede first well. You got to figure what's his name the roller chair guy texas dude not dan patrick. He's he apparently. He's the more powerful figure the lieutenant governor but abbott texas you gotta figure is gonna make and make make waves about it desantis in florida but honestly. I think it would all be all those efforts even if they got like scary even if it involved. You know like demonstrations of force like like greg abbott rolls out of the state house and reviews a bunch of national guard tanks going down the roads of austin or something as a show of force to you know claiming nullification or something. It would all be auditioning to run for president not to actually secede because these guys are all con artists and that honestly is one of the saving graces of the right wing in this country is that it it is increasingly being dominated at even the highest levels at the political level. Not yet at the level of capital but at the political level by by true believers con artists and people who are both people who have con themselves so that they can con others and what that means is that they can't coordinate any better than than we can.

Everybody's got each other got his hands in each other's pockets so yeah. You'll definitely see secessionist murmurings. But it's all just going to be people auditioning to either run for president or get a fox news show or a line of catheters mailed home directly to your home. I don't think the republican party is going to fracture someone asks if it's going to fracture the republican party. I think is is coming together. I think the republican party is is actually coalescing and it's yeah. It's going to be a the party. Anyway is going to increasingly be a rump of of wildly reactionary old people consumed by conspiracy. And the queueification of the party is inevitable um. But that's just part of a greater trend of as politics is going to accelerate further and further into spectacle and as conditions deteriorate.

More and more and people are forced to create more and more elaborate fantasy narratives to explain why things keep getting better keep getting worse no matter who's in charge and right now you and it's like you blame the other party you know and that's the reason that's a big reason half the country. Stop paying attention is because that's absurd you have to have convinced yourself at a basic level. You have to fool yourself into buying into this thing to make that next step that oh no it's just because those other guys the half. The country is like okay bye-bye and so the republican party is gonna. It's gonna is going to pack tighter together the democratic party on the other hand. I think there's a actual fracture lines there. But I don't know how how much how resilient this is I kind of assume. Honestly. The system's resilient enough and republicans getting worse and worse will basically be the glue that keeps the fracture from happening like the awfulness of the republican party sort of works to prevent any kind of real fracture among the democrats no matter how far the party moves from its base all part of this all as expressions of the same phenomenon of of generalized deteriorating conditions. It's it's.

It's brilliant nobody drew it up like that either that's the amazing thing like at this point. That's what this system does exists to continually diffuse popular hostility to actual power holders by directing anger towards scapegoats either an enemy political party or a other within within the body politic that must be expunged um and then everybody else just checks out but nobody ever sat down and drew it up that way it. It's water finds its own level but it was written up to prevent popular investment in government and that it has done just the way that has happened has changed like the original.

The founders originally imagined that there would not be parties and now we have coherent polarized political parties which have rendered the constitutional system incapable of actually governing but it has not led to the popular participation. The the bursting force of the ravel rabble that the founders feared because the parties themselves over the years have emerged as middle middlemen between capital and the public and have fused so behind the scenes in such a way that they that they act as one organism which was something that was never conceived of by the original founders but which helps to carry out the original idea which was to keep people out of government. It's kind of amazing and that's what happens when the system can continually adapt because social pressure is continually vented off which is what american exceptionalism is based on our ability to vent off social conflict which is going away our ability to vent off social conflict is reducing over time but at this.

But now we have this new thing the internet and I think when I've talked in the past about how the frontiers closed in and there are no more places to imagine american expansion you know nowhere else to to to tease out the american dream. The new one is the internet and that's why politics is now in practice synonymous with self promotion because it's the only place where realistic social mobility is possible in this country is if you get a little bit of micro celebrity of course talking about myself among others and that's where now the battle will be and that's where the the social venting is occurring. That's where that's where we are venting off the the the current amount of social alienation and dislocation and the capacity of the internet to absorb. It is. I think yet unknown so that's why I can never buy anybody who says. I can't buy any claims that like continuing decry continually declining material conditions will produce x or y or z a result because I honestly don't know myself enough. I don't have enough confidence myself in what what capacity the internet has to just soak all that up.

Rank choice voting is not a bad idea. I mean all those like all those clicks and whistles are fine but they're not going to do anything by themselves and the best example of that is australia. Australia has a lot of the features of their electoral system that people in america pine for and they have awful politics. They have less of a live political. They have the australians have less of a live political spectrum than we do even though they have rank choice voting hell. They have compulsory voting. There's rank choice voting in the senate. I know that's true don't. They have it in the senate someone. An actual australian told me they had right ranked choice voting in the australian senate. The fact that they have senate by the way is hilarious. Why would you do that why would you do that. I'm literally having people saying they do and they don't at the same time okay. Why why do I even look at this chat people are just gaslighting me. Oh ireland has ranked choice voting my god. You want to talk about a a moribund political spectrum holy. I actually respect that about ireland is that they don't even pretend like their two main political parties have ideological differences. It's really just what side of the irish civil war you were on. That's it which is what we had for a while here democrat republican. It was basically what what side you fought the civil war on and they've just they've just stuck with that as the defining characteristic it's kind of impressive is sinfain the official opposition yao because I know they have a unity government right after the last after the last election is shin family. Official opposition and things get if things get better.

There. They might thanks in large part to the absolute office bungling of the british regarding brexit. It will not be because of any electoral structure or voting laws. I have no idea what's going on brexit after corbyn lost I as a treat to myself. I said well this is terrible but the good news is. I don't have to pay attention to british politics at all. And I have not if something big happens if if like If if if they reunite ireland or like scotland secedes let me know. But I am not paying attention to that cursed island anymore. It's interesting like scotland now probably I bet if they did another referendum. I'm sure. I would bet now that scott that independents would win in scotland But that's why they won't have one. That's why they're not gonna do it. They're not gonna. Up again the way they did with brexit. They're not gonna have any more votes they don't know they can win and if they won't let like if if if westminster doesn't allow them to have a referendum. Then what are they going to do about it hold their own like. Catalonia did how'd that work out for them. I gotta wonder though like what's the point though you're gonna rejoin brussels so some other. Foreign powers can dictate your your the terms of your austerity. The boys I'm watching the boys. It's okay cgi better actually the cgi there is not as terrible as it is in a lot of other things. I think because they make the blood really dark which kind of hides the cgi-ness of it.

But you can still tell and it's also very very on the nose. It's one of those shows you can tell is inspired by someone's twitter feed which to me. I have. I already will go on twitter I i am not. I think a lot of people generally get off on watching shows that are reflecting their twitter feed to them. They're like aha. It's like validating and I i end up just cringing and going oh god don't talk about this stuff please. Fargo is now. It's three three episodes in not encouraged. Not encouraged not liking it not a lot. Not a lot of good shows right now. This is an interesting question if I watch the movie that I really like the effects like I thought ah these guys are doing squibs thank god and then I found out it was cgi when I feel tricked. I think I would probably. I would feel. I would honestly feel kind of dumb for a second. Like oh. They got me like in the commercials where it's folger's crystals you know. It's not the it's not store and you're like oh god maybe. I'm a rube. I think more than anything. I would. I would. I would chalk it down to over time me just like the the the the my level of like ability to discern this stuff declining as my exposure to the real stuff goes away but after that grappling. I would probably just be like okay good. I'll accept this fine whatever I'll stop worrying about it. If the technology is here. Then I'll just accept it. He loved big brother did did pence is pence been announced. It's confirmed of course. He does of course. He did of course. He did of course. He had it of course. He had it does that mean that oh by the way how did that plexiglass barrier do for kamal. I guess we'll find out.

I gotta say I understand every argument for why trump might still win from the unreliability of polls to the fact that there's been a big surge in republican registration in a number of states. The fact. I just saw an insane poll that says apparently 54 of people say they feel like they're better off than they were four years ago which is absolutely baffling to me. You could leave your house and not worry about contracting a disease that might destroy your lungs. Four years ago how by that alone do you answer that question yes and also of course you know We're already seeing it in the in the states that are doing early voting where in texas they're limiting each county regardless of how many people in it to one collection point for for mail-in ballots and in early voting in in ohio lines are on the block. All those things are real but man everyone having corona in the white house to me. It just it feels like that. It feels like that thing at the end of a movie that the turning point and of course. That's why it might not be true because we look for things that confirm our narrative and then that ends up taking the place of actual knowledge. But one way or another we love to see it and it's very funny and that's really what we should always be focusing on if we're going to be paying attention to this stuff at least have fun with it. I think that's my main argument with the people who want to feel like they're on the verge of being crystal. Knocked is that how is that fun. I mean I get that it's pleasurable at a certain level but that seems to be a perverse and an unwholesome pleasure as opposed to just yucking it up.

Oh. So he didn't. He doesn't have it you people what I can't get a straight answer out of any of you about whether the australian senate has a ranked voting ranked voting or if pence has coronavirus. I I cannot depend on you people. I'm being gaslit. I am being gaslit by you people and you know what it's not okay. I actually like this because this does remind me that like this experience of just reading something very fast and getting conflicting information and then just having to in your head decide which thing you believe that's essentially twitter that's essentially online. It's just there's an illusion of control there because it's moving. That is it's not is moving as fast and as you you can control your. It's easier to control like your input and and what you're seeing. But it's the same thing. It's just bleep bloops hitting you in the eye and then you having to have an emotional response to them man. It really is bad. It really is bad stuff. It really does just make it impossible for you to live. All right.

Someone is saying that australian voting is preferential and they also have proportional representation. So one way or another has a lot of the features that people demand that we add to the american electoral system in order to make it more responsive but has not made its politics any better all right What what how long have we been going because I know it's getting dark out here. But I might just log off before. I have to turn the lights on okay. We're over an hour all right okay guys before the lights don't go out completely before the before the darkness comes in and swallows us. It's time to take it sleazy see you guys later on the flip floop.
