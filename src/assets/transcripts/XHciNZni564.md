Accident host mode we are out of host on ladies and gentlemen. We are go for launch. We are in this zone we are all over the place all right. We're here. We're we're here folks yeah. I'm thinking. We're back yeah. Yeah. Hi folks we're back we're back in Brooklyn. It's nice so far although they say it's gonna storm like crazy again. Today. I don't know if that's gonna happen though people are still out though god bless them. I was out yesterday. We'll see what happens how's everyone's doing. How is everyone feeling. What is your dread excitement percentages where are you at what is your marbling are you are you dread marbled with excitement or are you excitement marbled with dread shout off in the comments. Let us all know fifty/fifty. I think that's the reasonable thing honestly just because as I have said everything is up at the damn air I mean there should be you should always have more dread just because the trajectory as it is and power differentials as they are and the culture as it is and the neoliberal subjects that we are. The likelihood is that things will end in some sort of reaction and reestablishment of the salves quo. But the hope really should be of how how much has been built. What kind of structures or even just consciousness is built by by the events and that is still way up at the air.

That's the thing that people really need to get their head around is just how early this is. They have not done anything to stop this the only thing because people are trying to find a way to be outdoors again that doesn't feel selfish and also a way to assert humanity in the face of what looks like a thoroughly dehumanizing non recovery to an economic collapse. So I know I tell everyone to stay off the internet but I of course can't I'm latched to the wheel and lash the mast so I got to go on. There. I got a look at this stuff and it gets me all. I guess be bummed because I see the things that everyone sees that make you feel despondent and you see the brands. You see that the woke brands talking about how they love our lives and how they respect a black culture regardless of how much how many how much slave produce is involved in their their company's bottom line. You've got DeRay and obama out there trying to create some sort of touchy-feely compromise for everybody and you've got things like those white people at the protest literally bowing down before black people to ask them to forgive them for racism. All of it is wildly wildly cringe and so I don't blame anybody for feeling that cringe because you know given the situation we're dealing with the given the the the the in real-time collapse of the entire economic political and political order of this country. A lot of people wish that we had something else wish that we had a different movement wish. We had a movement that was more that was more specifically economically oriented and to that I have a joke.

It's an old joke that I'm sure a lot of you have heard and it's a physicist and engineer and an economist are stranded on a desert island and the only thing they have to eat is a washed-up can of corn that they found on the beach. But they don't have any can openers I mean. It up. They don't have anything open it and the physicist says let's put it in the fire and see if it bursts and they go no they'll burn all the kernels and the engineer says no well. We'll get a piece of wire trying to pry it open. Then the economy said economist says all right so assume we have a can opener. That's the joke joke is that economists demand perfect conditions even though the world doesn't work that way and trying to figure out.

Your. Politics on the Internet has a similar effect of being an economist does which is to fixate you on theoretical concepts that don't relate to reality and the fact is is that if you sit around waiting for that perfect class first movement to emerge it's not going to it. Sure isn't going to merge off the internet. It's not going to emerge from people battering their arguments down to perfect razor sharpness and then using them in battle upon the planes of discourse and then enough people are going to come around to your point of view and everyone decides simultaneously to act on this new idea. That is I hate to say it a liberal way of thinking about how change happens you go to war with the army you have as Donald Rumsfeld said and the army we have right now is an army that was roused from slumber by the grotesque and public violence of police specifically violence of police against blacks minorities because lack of informing minority communities are systematically disadvantaged by capitalism need to be and as such need to be more policed need to be more control and that means that that alienation that we all feel towards the system is more keenly felt and there are more layers of disenchantment from political and economic authority.

Then there are more broadly throughout the culture because there's other things that people have to grasp onto. There are other ideas. There's the flag. There's there's there's the political party system all of which give people a sense of some sort of control over this stuff that it's much harder to feel when your only real interaction with the state is through its most violent stupid evil agents and so in a country of neoliberal atomized subjects that was always going to be the most likely place for sparks to fly. But it doesn't mean that it has to stay that way. And I think that's what people who get locked into the internet analysis machine miss is that there is nothing that says that this has this movement.

This this uprising whatever you want to call it has to maintain narrowly focused on issues of police police misconduct or that a police reform agenda can't be the leading wedge of a new movement that is broadly challenging to capitalism. One of the and I think some of the proof of that is that we have already gone in the span of a week from the vacuous anarchists demand to abolish policing of a Polish police which is meaningless in an occur in a capitalist system. You that is that there's no more perfect definition of putting the cart before the horse than that. One. That is that that's that's the kind of thing that withers away as a state loses its coercive class character you don't do that first because you still have a capitalist economy and you have a capitalist society but now you're already seeing that turned that that sort of adventurist anarchist slogan being refined into an idea around ideas around defunding and disarming police which is an actual concrete agenda that would have actual concrete effects many of which are going to would be challenging to capitalism significantly so because you know the managing. These. These public spaces managing these these urban centers that are now the only place where America's elite and the world elite can can sink money in safe investments. That's all depend on police power and the degree to which austerity has ravaged the budgets of municipalities and cities and made it harder and harder for people on the margins to survive that money has not just gone away that money has gone to the police. It has been a tidal shift of resources from from social services to police you've got police taking up over half the budgets of a lot of the big cities in this country. Even if like a city like Los Angeles has wildly fewer cops per capita than New York does about half as many and it's still it still takes over 50% of the municipal budget. A significant reduction in the number of number of police number armed police and the amount of money spent on policing by definition is gonna be a read tidal. Shift back towards towards or it can be anyway if it's directed that way toward social services because unless you're cutting taxes while you're cutting unless you're cutting municipal taxes. While you're cutting police budgets and no one is calling for that they better not be.

[11:00](https://youtu.be/XHciNZni564?t=11m00s)

Then that money is gonna go somewhere and it can go to somewhere actually productive that actually creates community durability. Viability and autonomy and an ability to to to create more importantly than anything creates a sense that the political process has meaning in people's lives. The idea that they could actually get something from the state get something from their City instead of just getting a gun to their head instead of just getting told to move along instead of just being policed that it matters like actually something to be. There's a positive element to the state project that they that people can participate in and the concerns about policing turning into a private concern. That is a real issue you know. I mean there's these you can't fire all these guys and just expect them to just you know go work at McDonald's or something especially well. There are gonna be rich people willing to pay them to be their private police.

But for now anyway private police do not have an authority to exercise violence at the level. That public police do that the public servants do and that's not something that we that will just change that's something that has to be changed and presumably a political political project of a political movement that is effective at the level of reducing. Policing would also prevent some new system of being being imposed whereby private police have now the authority to exercise deadly force that publicly state. None of this is of course determined. None of this will happen one way or the other. All of it is determined by us collectively how we respond how we act and how we organize ourselves in the face of repression.

We're already seeing now a shift in the level of authoritarianism that is now being accepted. I mean obviously you had Trump threatening to call him the cops calling the military before kind of backing down on that but today a judge in New York state ruled that the NYPD can hold anybody that they hold that they that they arrest at a protest no matter what it was for. They could hold them for more than 24 hours which is a violation of habeas corpus and that's so that they can get people off the streets that they could Ketel enough people in jails to to prevent them from continuing to exhaust the cops which is what they're doing right now. So we're already seeing the forces start to be marshaled and the question is going to be how we respond and I don't know how but I just know that there's a chance that that we have a worth. There is a mass disenchantment. The fact that the fact that a police station got burned in in Minneapolis last Thursday night and that would did was not responded to nationwide by some collective gasp. Some collective freakout that we are gone too far.

It instead helped ignite nationwide protests that says something I think and now we don't know what it is yet. But there's there's something in the air as they used to say. The likelihood is that as the quarantine is lifted as people are able to go outside certainly as public accommodations open up the degree to which people are willing to put time and effort into something like protesting is going to go down and there's going to be a subsequent lack of a reduction in in a number and size and intensity of protests. But you can't discount what responses are going to come from the overreaction of the police and of the state which is also happening at a alarming rate. There's a dang cheeto in the white house folks can you believe it and my mind honestly. My greatest hope here is that is that the segregation of American life that makes working-class activism so difficult and may have meant working-class mobilization so difficult. The fact that there is this genuine stratification not just by class but specifically by race in this country that that stratification creates this entire complex of anxieties and neuroses around race that are then played out in public that this could actually that this process that this this protest wave could help break that down do.

It agree to to make the possibility of to make people feel on both sides of the divide that there is cooperation possible that there is a common interest that police that the police are really there to. At the end of the day control us all and that our awareness of their coercive and authoritarian power over us is uneven than often depended that dependent upon race but more than anything dependent upon class life by what neighborhood you live in by what the police assume of you when they come and see you and it's harder and it's harder and harder to quarantine. These these these thoughts is that why everybody was posting David Dee's cartoons today did he die did the chemtrails finally get him was the chemtrails there was a GMO corn. Goddamn re Peter a real one I gotta say everybody who was talking about like Oh Biden's done for him because Biden's a stiff and it's gonna be 2016 all over again I mean that might have had honestly think Trump might have got reelected if the appeared emic hadn't happened.

But at this point the real problem for Trump is that he is too stupid not to realize that when a thing like for example a bunch of mass protests against police brutality breakout that it is in his interest to appear a impartial mediator and to not appear to be on this one side or the other because that means people who are not fully committed to that side are more likely to blame him specifically so that means there's probably going to be plenty of suburban white people who are horrified by what they're seeing and are dropping their monocles while they watch their TVs at at rioting who nevertheless see Trump as responsible which is all his fault or largely his fault because at the end of the day he is just a dumbass. I mean sure he's smarter than you know the average political reporter but he still does not have I guess. It's the self-control. He doesn't have the discipline to hold his water ever because as he imagines himself as the president. That means he is the embodiment of the state and that means that if there is any any any protest against state overreach that he can't spin to being about him or about people like supporting him like the like reopened. Protests were he and his only reaction is to is to fully defend himself and justify himself and do comes in the next four months or whatever until the election five months six months eight months.

[19:32](https://youtu.be/XHciNZni564?t=19m32s)

I don't I literally don't know when is it. Twelve months from now is it a year from now where am I who is it. I'm smelling toast no matter what happens. It's all gonna continue to stick to him. It's gonna. It's like a big sticky chocolate covered baby rolling down a hill that was just mowed and he just keeps getting the freshly cut lawn clippings all over him until he looks like Swamp Thing and of course he's not going to acknowledge the results. But I don't think it's gonna matter. I think the the stuff with espera and Matt especially proves that those of us who sort of assumed that there is not really any any real buy-in at the top levels of the military with Trump specifically like Trump personally is is I think I think that's been borne out. I think that if Trump will probably say the election doesn't really isn't legitimate if he loses. But that only means anything if if he has anyone with guns to support that claim. And I think we're seeing now that you know barring some wild intervention that's not going to be the case because these guys like I've said are pretty unimaginative bureaucrats which means that they like most bureaucrats most people at high levels of the media in politics. They have this childish belief an investment in the political process as it exists which means that they don't see Biden as a existential threat that they they have not drunk the kool-aid whereby Biden represents some sort of communist attempt to take over America. He's just another he's just another member of the team. He's another.

He's another professional political operative in the political classes job. It is to manage the American Empire and he's surrounded by the people who have shown in the past their willingness the bility to go along with the program and so that means there's gonna be no taste at the top levels to go to the mattresses for Trump. They'll just say okay okay Donnie and then they'll they'll tell him to leave and because he's a big fat baby who more than anything is afraid of being humiliated. He's not gonna even put up a fight. He'll walk out. They'll call his bluff and he'll leave now what his supporters do is another thing. But my god. We're already seeing how do the Boogaloo for the most part. They're posting about how if someone comes to my neighborhood. I'm gonna shoot him okay what if they don't what do they don't come to your neighborhood. What are you gonna do you're gonna complain you're gonna whine about it there's a video of a protest going past a bunch of suburban crackers with guns and they couldn't even make eye contact let alone even yell anything even though they had machine guns in there I know they're not machine guns assault rifles in their hands so they don't have it they're too soft. So there might be some isolated violence but there's not gonna be some sort of significant put resistance.

Now if Biden gets in there and the economy continues to be in the traitor and coronavirus continues spasmodically and and civil unrest continues. Now you might see at the state level. Like sabre-rattling at the level of you know maybe a secessionist movement but honestly that would probably just be some governor trying to be president in 2024 trying to put down a marker to be the guy to run against Bible because everyone's too soft and more than anything they're just not imaginative enough at the end of the day. They're just hogs but as that as must be pointed out. Predictions are very silly to make at this point because all of these conditions that obtain right now that lead to that outcome. They might not obtain two days from that they're sure should probably not going to maintain a month from that and so who the knows it's gonna be wild baby. These are the most interesting times you could really anybody has seen in a bit that's for sure but the the thing without the army guy is coming forward to sign up for the first time push back against Trump.

I think is really interesting because obviously it's absurd to say that their job is any different than the cops job. Their job is to do in the rest of the world with the cops. Job is to do on America's streets which is maintain the rule of American Capital and world capital. But the job has those jobs create different cultures around them. Like for one thing. The actual military is much more diverse than America's police forces and beyond that the fact that they do this outside the fact that they do this in Iraq and Afghanistan. It creates around it a ideological cocoon whereby the justification for doing that justification for lighting up a car full of people of civilians and Baghdad or Kabul is to defend the home front as to defend a certain idea of America that is abstract because they don't have to deal with it. Whereas cops who more and more have taken that Imperial mindset and applied it to the country this country. They don't really have that they don't have that buffer zone that justifies their actions. Their buffer zone is much more likely. It's not protecting America against the world is protecting their suburb against the city the bad city that they work in and that leads because it's closer to the bone and because that that sense of threat is closer. It means that their willingness to countenance authoritarianism and suspension of democratic processes is greater whereas the army guys the military people sort of have a noblesse of leisure about it now of course.

If crisis gets hard enough. They'll throw out the window that's all goes out the window if the crisis becomes deep enough. But if it maintain some if it's some political crisis. It's merely at the level of politics as in between Trump and Brighton between Democrats and Republicans. There is no constituency to back Trump because it's the same thing to them generally for the most part now for the cops. That's different matter like if there's if there's a military coup it would be if there's a crisis for the election say like if there's a if the election happens and it's truly disputed on both ends and there's no accepted winner. It's there's not going to be a coup on behalf of either candidate. It would be sort of a Thailand style deal where military comes in to to adjudicate this political squabble because we in America genuinely think in both on both parties that the military is a non political entity and that means that they have a credibility to do that that would be higher than on behalf of one party or the other like if you had a military coup if you have a like if you got 40% unemployment. Two million dead streets still combat zones between protesters or oh. My god maybe even insurrectionary forces at that point who even knows and the police and there's an election that has a none conclusive result. I would say that a plurality of Democrats and Republicans would would be relieved by a military takeover but only if it was on behalf of the military and on behalf of the United States and not on behalf of one of the political parties.

That's the distinction I haven't done a Q&A for a while if you guys have any questions. Let me know so yeah. I'm done I'm done with. I'm not gonna try to prognosticate anymore today. That's the limit of the amount of predictions I'm willing to do because like I said the conditions that are going to determine events are not predictable. I've got a I got to put on my knee and Malcolm in Jurassic Park. Hat here never repeat and vastly affect the outcome well Pelosi will not lose come on. She represents one of the richest districts in the country could she be like I stood as House Speaker. The house may be but that's a different question but the real the real moment that we know that this this phenomenon happening right now will have genuine lasting. Impact is when it starts affecting labor when people start coordinating work stoppages and denial of capital intensive spaces that that's gonna be the big shift and that's happened before I mean 68 is the obvious example but the thing that's on our side compared to 68 is that is that our political party. The left political party in America is so attenuated and so removed from any kind of legitimacy for anyone. Besides you know sort of the most neutered suburbanite that their ability to sort of negotiate out of a revolutionary situation. The way that the Communist Party did in France is going to be also attenuated but not necessarily it could. I am very excited about Reagan land I cannot wait to read it.

[31:19](https://youtu.be/XHciNZni564?t=31m19s)

I really if I I kind of say. It's a bummer that Pearlstein doesn't like me but because I still think he's the greatest story and even if he's at the end of the day I forest rangers Bureau of Prisons US Marshals ATF Treasury. The Department of State has a security service. Like there. There's armed guys I mean almost every one of those agencies that they could put a uniform on and throw on their I'm not saying that doesn't mean that they. I'm not saying that they aren't Blackwater I'm just saying that absence of insignia does not inherently mean that they are well yeah. There's postal inspectors who have guns the thought. Of writing a book people to ask him ass about a book and I got a say my big problem was writing. A book is just the degree to which the printed word really does feel dead you know feel like. He gone Spangler Brent is dead. It just feels like everything is moving so fast now that the idea of like sitting down to write something that then people are gonna what read on their Kindle or buying a bookstore. It just it feels a little 20th century but that doesn't mean I won't do it.

See the thing I know the reason I'm not that freaked out about. Tom. Cotton is that I really think the thing that electric Trump and the thing that has bound the Republican voter base to him is not any policy. It's not anything to do with specific even really even political ideas let alone policy. It is a style. It is an effect and it is a mastery of politics as a spectacle and all these guys that people talk about as the heirs to Trump. They are trying to piece together like out of the chicken guts of his public statements and and policies a coherent political ideology but that's not what get people in the door. You know now that might change you know I mean if crisis conditions persist. People might get even Republicans you might get much more fixated specific agendas but but if that doesn't happen once again we're in the land of if then because of how fluid everything is.

It's not gonna be some from Missouri. You guys know that Josh Hawley is known for his wine collection and it's his ona philia the Yale that this guy is trying to be like like lonesome Rhodes for the 21st century and the fancy lad who went to Yale. He's not gonna. It's not gonna pop people talk about Crenshaw but honestly Crenshaw is more media savvy than those guys. But he is media savvy. In the old way he's media savvy in the way that appeals to the media.

Trump does the opposite Trump makes the media pissed and that's what appeals to people because they hate the media and I honestly don't see anybody on the Republican bench in office who fits any of those criteria like I said if it's gonna be somebody in the political arena my guess would be. It would be some red state governor who like starts trying to threaten another sport Sumter and does like a like a 1860 style brinksmanship with the federal government over you know health care mandates or you know federal spending or remittance of taxes or weapons enforcement or drug enforcement. Something like that and then that is what builds the supports are around. Him is his status as the guy that people can rally around against the hate of Democrats and party power way more so than anybody in the Senate. What oh did you see you hear that stem-winder on c-span that Holly put on about like about outsourcing gives a you know like Don. Jr.

Is sort of like the that's the false Demetri showing up during the time of trouble disorganizing left-wing ideas in rural towns to where that organizing is worth. It organizing is more worth. Any organizing is worth more than going online obviously not you know not in a in a unconsidered way not not sort of not flaunting not without consideration. I mean it needs to be around specific issues and the more that it can be specifically around class honestly.

One thing I would really like to see is if people do live in relatively downscale communities of that are more white than aren't that don't have a lot of I don't think it should be that hard to connect the treatment of cops by black people to the treatment of poor whites because cops kill a ton of white people every year. But those deaths are felt at the level of race because there is not an alienation. There's not a conscious alienation between white people. The United States as a political project whether it is for black people it stands in for oppression that is felt and the the echoes of are still present every day. White people don't have that but they are still oppressed and still shot and still abused the hell out of by cops to the degree that they the cops can get away with it and that largely has to do with their inability to fight back their lack of a rich dad or the lack or the fact that they got counted found in a town where the cops expect people to. They don't respect people and are willing to assert any violence against them. So if you have poor white relatives or you're you you live in a poor white community. You're poor white yourself. You don't have. I don't think you should have to do a lot of convincing to make people not like cops and to think that instead of this being one more case of racial guilt from rich white people went to college trying to make themselves feel better. This is a recognition of that the cops are there to beat people up who don't have any. Money I want to push back here and see a lot of poor white people probably do deeply love cops but not all of them you're not.

[38:58](https://youtu.be/XHciNZni564?t=38m58s)

Gonna get all of any group yeah. 1905 19:05 baby and the thing about 1905 is that it ended in defeat for everyone everything got rolled back. It was only meaningful in retrospect and that is the thing I think the code that paralyzes people. More than anything is that they don't want to risk their lives. They don't want to spend their time and money and energy and emotion around things that are gonna fail because then what was the point but it was doing it. That was the point it was always doing it. That was the point the the journey to sound like a Hallmark card is the destination in the sense that it's not only where you get the purpose and meaning.

It's also where you learn what to do. I people abolished police thing I understand the argument of wanting to have a maximals position because you're negotiating. But it's really a question of who you're talking to I guess because you do kind of lose credibility. When as soon as you're challenged you admit that you don't actually want to abolish cops because then people wonder well. What are you like maybe you look fat less as the thing. That's the danger with the abolish cops thing is because anybody nobody really thinks that nobody realistically thinks in the near-term without some sort of collapse and recreation of the American system and even then down the line. You can abolish police as a concept because like Camden Camden New York exactly like what Camden New Jersey what Kanda did they did not abolish the police but they did fire their entire police force and replace them with people who did not get do not want to be psychopathic murderers.

They wanted to help them that actually wanted to help people and guess what crime went down. Police files went out in Camden has not had a riot and Kennedy's never had much demonstrations so that's a model. But it's not abolition. But I think people want to feel that they're part of a revolution because once again they want to feel like they're gonna win and so saying something like abolish. The police feels feels radical and challenging in a way that means that their effort to get that is his revolution and that makes them revolutionaries and I understand that you need that individually personally maybe to motivate yourself. But that's different than it is an actual organizing principle for a movement because you get to move. It's that it and it would be so dramatic and it and more importantly it would require to work so much more investment an architecture of of social and community organization and a safety net like the cops you can when you drop them when you cut out.

The safety net and everyone falls into the pit of hell that creates social problems that have to be dealt with at the state level. What policing and prisons do is mean that you can just write a check every year and forget about it. You don't have to intervene in the economy in any way you don't have to regulate the markets. In any way the thing will be taken care of by the application of those much police force as it's necessary to maintain property values. If they don't have that ability. They can't throw everybody in jail and they can't intimidate everybody with guns. Become they get the situation where people are radically alienated from the community from the sense of morality and willing to do anything to survive or just not even caring about your.

Plenty because and I think that's the thing that people who shy away from concrete demands. Miss is that a demand is not ever by itself. It always has things that are invented within it and assumptions and necessities around it that spiral out from it and a reduced reduced disarm police force that is essentially a social work workers well. That's gonna require either a shit-ton more social workers or a shit-ton more social services for people who need social workers. Either way you have changed the distribution of resources in the country. You've empowered genuinely as in given people more control over their lives and what jobs they can do and what jobs they can seek and what what what lives to pursue at the low end. Though at the lowest the most economically disadvantaged parts of society instead of just shoveling more money at cops and ignoring the problem because that's the only way that we have convinced ourselves that that the state can function because if you think you can just do that one thing and it's not gonna have knock-on effects. Then you don't understand how these things work and you have because prop frankly probably because you've been arguing online too much you idealize and isolate all ideas and all policies as opposed to seeing them all inherently intertwined. I kind of like it.

[44:53](https://youtu.be/XHciNZni564?t=44m53s)

I don't like the way of wings out in the back my hair. Someone said my hair looks nice thank you I do like that. I still have a little coiffure although it's going away but by the by but like the way that it does this. After a certain time. I don't know why my hair like curls out I get these little guys here in the back and I can look silly and I like it yeah. I'm I've been sittin it like Nicholson in the shining levels of hair loss for a few years now and I'm crossing my fingers that I can hold on for a while because I mean he looks good in that movie. Everyone he's the goddamn dime come. The helicopters are out I will say the helicopters I've seen in manna and Brooklyn and are not nearly as low as the ones in DC where that other night I will not be doing anything to my hair. I will not be shaving it and I will not be applying any sort of chemical or drug.

Today. Here I stand I can do no other. I'm just getting a little kind of weather away part of my broader. My broader plan to come to terms with my finitude with my own my own insignificance my own my own temporary nature. I don't even know what you Glacius is saying I don't care at this point. I have stopped caring completely about all op-ed writers. All journalists really of any kind. All commentators all podcasters. Everyone is squawking from the sidelines everyone is justifying their own inaction or justifying the state's actions. Either way pay no mind list to the degree that I don't have to. But I don't have to talk about another show and I try not to think too much about the I have an embarassment kink. Don't you have to be embarrassed for it to be. Kinky. I'm not embarrassed yeah Matt Matt Iglesias yeah. I'm sorry if I did not make that clear someone was asking about Madi Glacius I don't care I don't care what that egg-headed. The only thing I care about naina Glacia says is that when people say we look alike which thankfully since he's shaky he took the coward's way out when he went bald and he shaved his head unlike me. So now we don't look anywhere near like. But we don't even have the same head shape I have a nice broad.

Middle European has a square head and he's got a perfect oval. They're completely different heads answer just saying strategy of tension in Italy. I the thing the thing that I think is different about that whole deal is that the strategy of tension was part of a decade's long program to keep the Communist Party out of power. In Italy. There is no similar threat now and before the Floyd murder there was no real even looming threat of a left-wing organization of any kind along any axis so unless you're thinking that there's some some like scheme to justify a crackdown. Then I don't see the point although honestly I am very skeptical of all that because the nature of this thing is that it doesn't need excuses for anything. When a necessity emerges. We have so foreclosed other possibilities that we do it like look what happened with the kovat oh. Our service economy. Our service based economy has been destroyed because we also stay indoors what do we do well.

We could redirect economic resources outside of markets not even a possibility. Not no one in any level of power would even think it and more importantly very few people on the ground would consider it either so that means there's no need to justify doing that and that means if the next crisis comes along and the next brutally horrible inhumane practice. Like the one that has already left a hundred thousand people dead is probably gonna lead to millions dead in this country within a year that was signed off on without anybody even arguing it even in the August new york times. This is why oh my god jerk me off for eternity with the new york times the rope but we need the robust. The marketplace of ideas was anybody in the New York Times suggesting hey maybe we don't have to go maybe. We maybe we can suspend the economy for a minute. Maybe we can experiment with with not commodifying everything every moment of the day since we can't create we literally can't create economic activity. Right. Now no didn't appear anywhere which means when the next things comes on says well.

Now we have to sterilize the whole the homeless or something it'll be framed as a necessity because we've already foreclosed alternative so you don't need to push it. Along you don't need to create a crisis to justify something. Every crisis justifies the response because the alternative has been destroyed. Both practically. Vincent Bevins talked to this talk very well about this the way the Cold War existed to destroy alternatives to capitalism and ideologically growing out of that reality. So that's why unless I see like concrete evidence. I don't buy any of this. About about provocation now individual provocation individual cases like cops breaking windows cops cops burning their own vehicles yeah for sure because they think okay that'll justify it. But that's in the context of a protest that's already occurring that's not creating it and even then it's small-time. It's some they could go smash the window. Then I'm gonna get to waterboard.

Somebody pay no mind idiot am I worried about the protests being co-opted yeah of course and a lot of people are pointing to derail Obama to co-opting it and all these awful brands tweeting their support as proof that it's not a threat. But all that proves is that they're scared and they feel the need to protect themselves. They feel the need to protect themselves from anything that might come from us because the other way around the idea of like well because these brands are saying. This is good that means it's not a threat to them that necessitates them having some kinda greed of control as opposed to them responding to a new situation and trying to cover their asses because they don't know what's gonna happen and they want to stay clean. They want to make sure that nobody's pissed at them and of course they're gonna do that. But it doesn't mean it's it.

It's only gonna be as effective as we let it that that strategy of co-optation and and and reduction and moving away from radical asipi moving away specifically from economic concerns that'll work that a degree that we allow it to so assuming ahead of time that it's not going to fail assuming ahead of time that it's all been co-opted. Assuming a Halle founded oh all it did was they took they gave the cops like net guns and now you know half of them are black water that might happen but it's and frankly even if it does in that happening. We could still create durable institutions that have an ability down the line and further points of conflict and further points of crisis of asserting a new unified opposition. Like the potential is there in every moment. The potential is there in every moment and that is what is lost online because you're not in a moment you're in a realm of ideas and in a realm of ideas. You can create a perfect model of what's gonna happen based on what's happening in front of you well.

Because of X Y & Z then Q R and X are gonna happen but that forgets that between those two points in time a bunch more things are gonna happen that you can't predict that aren't in your model and they're. Gonna change the conditions so that's why all this stuff get only gets worked out in the streets and everybody trying to gamified ahead of time to protect themselves so that they don't get their hopes up. So they don't look like they're they care too much. They don't get cringy is on a fool's errand. They're deluding themselves really more than anything because time is the element that's missing from all internet. Tom political are given time defense happening over time events happening changing conditions creating new events that were not predicted by the original set of conditions that then create new conditions that then at every point moving you further and further away from the model that you created of events that was frozen and fixed and not moving through time and that is the dialectical process because that is part of that one of them big dialectical pressures is between time and Matt obviously ideas and matter but also time in space things not only in themselves but things through time things change through time by entropy and by chaotic interposition of other objects that damn and I'm the LaGuardia flight path.

But this has been more robust than usual. I have to say yeah like the degree to which people can find out that they have that they can depend on one another and that they that like their armored nests and their isolation and their misery can be alieve alleviated and that by helping other people they find that they have helped themselves and vice versa and that those connections what they do is. They create. They create an incentive to maintain connection and then over time and Trust which is the basis for all organizing along all up the reason that they say everything has to be a market relationship. The reason that libertarians and the Liberals have insisted that all relationships mostly market-based it's because the assumption is that all of us are isolated from one another inherently and completely. But that is a that's an imposition that that they that is not the condition of humanity that is the condition of humanity in the specific matrix of late capitalism that we live in now that makes it hard to break away and it means that a lot of that means that your attempts to resist it are going to be contained within a neoliberal framework because that's what you grew up with and that's all you've known but a bunch of people together doing that at the same time like I said changes conditions greater the pressure. The greater the conditions are shifted and that gives breathing space and that gives moments where you can refine oh I am NOT. A monad we're not almost isolated in fact that's an insane idea my sense of self and worth cannot.

It's not self generated by by by posting my way to an identity. It's by finding myself in a context of other actual people and giving and taking in equal measure and then getting back as you give and finding that it is a virtuous cycle of engagement where you gain trust and you gain affection and you gain purpose and you gain the ability to organize and strategize because you don't have to get through all those baffles. Those layers of who is this person what were they from what's their agenda here are they a neoliberal are. They is. They are not see are they are. They woke all that all that happens is because that that that that veil exists because we only know each other virtually and overtime you will figure out oh this person's for real. This person's full of there's more of them all right wrapping up here.

Guys got a couple more questions I can answer I mean the PERT. Someone is two disagreeing with me about predicting the future. Buddy I'm not gonna stop I always end up. Tangent I read a Harry Turtledove novel. I trust me. I know that it's impossible not to do it and then it helps you think but it only helps you think that the degree that you can reel it in and maintain maintain a a real clear-eyed sense of the the fluidity of the moment.

I will be grilling soon soon. It's gonna be storming. I guess the next couple of nights. I would have grilled tonight but yeah cuz like I came out and it was nice and sunny and it's already getting. They say it's gonna storm all night. There's a tropical depression coming so when the tropical depression is over though the grill is set. I'm gonna do it. I've got everything I've got a steak. I'm gonna throw that puppy on there. So I promise that next nice day when I know it's not gonna rain. There will be grow stream and I guarantee you it'll be anti-climactic because after all this talk and all this meaning. It'll just be an cooking a steak on a grill probably badly realistically. It probably won't be very good. I've never done it before. I'll probably ask for advice from the more experienced grillers in the chat and maybe that maybe we can crowd crowd. We can crowd coordinate our way to crowd cook our way to a decent steak all right. I'm probably gonna sign off here. In one minute very done I got to go eat get some food and get indoors cuz. It's definitely gonna rain. It's a grill. It's it's a it's a it's a Weber. It says it's the oh. It's the big kettle charcoal I got charcoal.

I'm good all right guys I will notice though. Since the protest started the clapping has stopped and it really does tell you something about how people wanted to feel. Useful. People wanted to feel like they were doing something good while they were just Altaf eyeing and now there's something else to do and that's need that needs this impotent need goes away. It really does show that a degree to which we fixate and gravitate towards empty gestures to alleviate a sense of powerlessness but the only thing that alleviates powerlessness is seizing or claim attempting moving towards taking power or at least challenging existing power formalized ritualized actions. We'll never do it and that's why nobody's clapping right now because they've been out there at least a lot of them. I know I've seen them coming going to Barclays because I live very close to the basically the epicenter. So I've been out there. A couple nights and there are there's people are like flowing like a river. So no more clapping in your house. Now we're clapping in the streets and that's much better because the cops doesn't give a kick your face in if that you clap too much in the streets. Alright folks stay frosty talk to you soon bye bye.
