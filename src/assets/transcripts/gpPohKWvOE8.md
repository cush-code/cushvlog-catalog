So dappled back here. It's always causing a problem so there. I am I'm on the cv. I'm on the television whatever you want to call it. I'm streaming 21st century streaming who would have thunk it. That's funny you think about oh.

We never got flying cars you know we never got moon cities or underwater bubble cities like epcot. But what do we got instead. We've got twitch streams and I'm not saying that to disparage them really none of that shit's in there if you think about like all that high modernist sci-fi how much time do they spend on entertainment. You know things like image transmission and the internet there's nothing even close to the internet in any of that mid-century sci-fi. But that's because they didn't realize that at some point the deal was gonna break down and people are gonna have to replace any kind of meaningful existence with a speculation an interaction with entertainment so what is shock that's where all the actual sci-fi happen instead of having a moon city. I get to sit back here and talk to my phone my telephone and have thousands of people watch me over the course of of the broadcast and its afterlife on youtube. An entirely different place to watch videos and that's because if we had moon cities if we'd actually been able to muster that sort of social resource to do that we probably wouldn't have twitch realistically. We probably wouldn't have gaming as we know it as a culture because it wouldn't be necessary it wouldn't be compensatory. We wouldn't be needing to compensate for lack of purpose and meaning in the rest of our lives which were either underemployed hyper-exploited or in in some way disenchanted. I mean presumably if you're on the moon it wouldn't be just to be on the moon it would be in the moon to do something to be part of a project. I'm actually kind of I don't know I'm over. I'm over space travel.

Realistically it seems like it's cope. It seems like it's delusional cope by cultures and specifically super rich people to try to imagine that there's some there's somewhere. We can start over a new america like oh no the american concept of of endless resource. consumption to offset all social conflict that's no longer viable in a closed circuit. It's no longer viable on a world market. It's no longer viable with with way too. Many way too much demand put of a biome for for items for pleasures for gigas for szechuan sauces and they're like for little minions eraser tip things so what if we do it find another one what if we go find some other new land to conquer a new city on a hill where we get to offload all of our social conflict once again by just grabbing what we want. It's not realistic and more importantly even if it was. It doesn't solve anything it just puts it off a little longer puts off the final conflict a little longer but that might be worth it if it was even close.

But it's so far get out of there come on not for the moon enough with mars. Let's let's try to figure out this. I mean I don't know how we're going to terraform another planet. If we can't keep keep earth terraformed the planet that was already terraformed. When we got here. It was literally terra and we have managed to un-terraform it. That's how planet it was brilliant indeed how about you try re-terraforming before you start terraforming somewhere else okay chachi so yeah like put chips in the heads of all the rich people where they if they if they leave earth's atmosphere their heads explode.

I want to ask you guys a question. This is relative to god help me it's a tweet but I thought this one was one of the rare ones that you can use to to reveal a larger point and it was something that jonathan shaite said today that got a lot of people upset. He was talking about aoc speech from last night when she uses a lot of intersectional language. The language of like the contemporary left as we understand it online certainly and someone calls that an outreach to millennial language. It's millennial language stuff like decolonization and xenophobia and fight in anti-racism like these concepts and chad says. I don't think it's millennials. I think it's elite institutions now that made everyone lose their because they saw the word elite and I mean shaytan dumbass who likes causing people to get mad at him. So you can't take his word for what he's trying to say like elite is there to infuriate people because god damn it people love bristling over the concept of being elite and they hate it and they want to thrust it away like a hot potato because that's the fantasy that allowed america to shred its class. Consciousness over time is that we is that we've made that we've made being common a fetish of even our richest citizens which makes it much harder to see class as it actually functions in society but anyway so you know the number of people.

I saw tweeting today who said well. I've just got a degree from a state school and I understand this. I just went to a small liberal arts school. You never have and you know if you. I'll give people the benefit of the doubt that if you read there's a perfectly reasonable argument that if you you read him from what he's trying to say elite means like ivy league institutions like very selective schools and that's not the useful way to talk about it so jonathan shade he's an idiot. This is just a chance to talk about something that's real even though the actual conversation is being had by dullards well ignore what they actually said and pull out what is useful that they could have said so you can actually make something interesting out of it that you could talk about because if you stay in the playpen fighting over the words of the actual and the meaning of the actual moron's words then you will just be as dumb as they are. So. It's the way trump has made everybody stupider by having to live in the world where his utterances are your entire daily emotional reactive life anyway if we strip the connotation from elite and we talk about like what realistically we're talking about when when because what's what's what does what does it mean when what is cheat trying to say jade is trying to say it's not millennial.

As in this this whole group of people. It is a subset of that group of people now if he means elite by like ivy league people that's wrong. But there is another way of thinking of elite shorn from class and shorn from the the prestigiousness of the institutions and the ties that relate to them that is potentially realistic like do you guys know what the percentage of adults who have a four-year degree minimum have at least detained. A four-year degree is in the united states. What do you think it is what do you think the percentage of adults with a four-year college degree is off the off the top of your head don't google it. Someone says 30 someone says 15.

Someone says 35 25 it's 27 percent yeah as as in 20 in 2020 20 20 27 percent that's not how you would imagine if you lived online and talked about politics online because the people conversating on all points on all of these questions whenever they come up. Almost universally are among that 27 percent so chait is idiotically and and provocatively and stupidly bumbling into a real observation which is that aoc comes from a milieu of a subset of millennials meaning millennials who went to a four-year college and absorbed the the social vocabulary and etiquette of college and I think that's a meaningful distinction. Now it doesn't make them a different class that's that's these people want to like because they want to spend all that time online and the only way they convince themselves. It means anything is if the discourse is the only thing that matters in the world and that means that the fact that these people are now like at a separate class position relative to culture to people who didn't go to college. Then. Therefore they are the new ruling class that's absurd but it does mean that there is a cultural distinction that has to be just talked about when you're talking about all these other questions because there is this distinct belief among a lot of people that the that the college-based vocabulary of american leftism all the stuff all the intersectional.

We talk about all the stuff about all the language of of oppression and the language of white fragility and like racial centeredness and all this stuff that you learn in college that it's bad that racism exists and is bad. Those are the two things you learn in college. misogyny is exists and is bad like that's the one two punch that's what college teachers. Not everybody who goes to college has that feeling a lot of people get alienated by that because it's so hegemonic they get no annoyed by it and they become like the the elite the culturally elite of the right or or of like some third position trying to aggravate both because they're so alienated from either and that they say that that language alienates potential allies among that vast swath that potential those those non-college educated people those non-educ if they're seeing you do this stuff and they're getting mad at you and just even though they would love to sign on to socialism.

You are making them either turn off completely or turn to conservativism and reaction as a response and the truth or falseness of that theory can never be tested because no one involved in the theorizing. It is a member of the group. They're talking about because all these conversations around like how to talk about subjects and what subjects to focus on imagine. They're creating an imagined non-college educated person. Because all the people in the inside this bubble are whatever their opinions are members of that subgroup. They're not being observed or if they are they can't no they're in a black box because if they were on the other side they would be there like the reasoning seems to be these poor non-college-educated but good-hearted people. See you awful people with your awful bitter sectarian wokeness and absurd blaming of whiteness and whatever and making it and then they turn away because that's what I would do if. I was in their position but they're not in their position. None of us are we are in the bubble and what's going on outside the bubble we can guess at it but we certainly can't have any kind of confidence enough to act from a premise and act like no no. I need to fight the battles of the internet. I need to joust online with these people because there's this audience of trolls that I'm imagining are there that's in your head dude.

It's it's just a different version of the same phenomenon in concert in among liberals like the reason biden's. The nominee right now more than anything and the reason that there's all those republicans at the convention. I mean yes obviously it shifts. It signals the general shift to the right of the democrats over time but in the in the in the near now like at that level of like decision making by voters. It's because they don't vote from a position of um what they want to see. They vote for what they imagine someone else. Generally a more conservative person than them because they believe america is a conservative country because of their cultural surroundings because we segregate by income and by by cultural attainment and so they say yeah. I don't care about colin powell. I don't care about john mccain but some guy some disaffected republican watching mike.

Now he probably doesn't give a but one way or another. It doesn't matter because you can never know you're not him. You're just putting yourself in that position. But the whole point of them being in a different position is that they're not you does that make sense. It's all wish casting what it is is. It's people laundering their own anxiety that they are in a bubble by projecting out a fantasy of another woke people do it too their their counter. Their counter rejoinder is always no like working-class people are basically. They're all good-hearted. They're all waiting they're yearning to be connected to this network of beliefs that I all learned in college and that take a long time to get to for a lot of people because it's counter-intuitive premises especially from stuff you learn growing up especially if you tend to be white or male and it takes a while to work through the process you have to be committed to it. You have to be committed enough to privilege you have self-selected. You don't know what they're thinking. About any of this you don't know that they're just waiting for some some real like son of the soil to arise some richard jojeta guy to lead them to some unwoke socialist paradise.

You have no idea. It's all in a box and what it does is. It allows you to deal with ignore the real problem. The real functional problem that is far beyond any questions of what people are talking about or any issue that is on the agenda or or any controversy or any podcast or anything. It is that there is no connection between these two groups. Culturally. They are separate and the majority we certainly know of the non-college educated in this country do not process the alienation and horror of their lives through a political or class lens which is the only way the class consciousness emerges and traditionally what made that happen was the close quarters and this and the and the the social context of living as a working-class person which doesn't exist now and never really existed in the united states and that is really the difference when you talk about american exceptionalism. It boils down to the fact that our vastness of land and resources excorporated from natives who are not part of our political calculus could be exterminated meant that we never created the the the the pressured situations or very rarely anyway like in pockets certainly at immigrant pockets for example of of the east coast yes but generally did not generalize a a single working class experience and and the class and the class got sort of bleached out of america as distance allowed people to live separately enough that the accumulated experience of living near fellow working-class people dissipated and that's the real challenge and instead people would much rather because it's more fun and you can do it online.

You can do it in your house you can do it in your underwear. You can do it while jacking off you can't do it. You know it's easy. There's no There's no there's nothing stopping you and it's and it's and it's a nice place to dump anxiety and this and sense of purposelessness in life But it's not gonna nothing that is attained on that level. Regardless of how it boils down to the like. People say this stuff starts online and then it goes in the real world right but it can never be stopped online. It can only be stopped in the real world. Not all gremlins are nude that's absurd greta gremlin is never nude. She's dressed in delightful silk and fineries um.

Somebody asked if huey long could have ended the great new deal by by splitting the vote in 1936. I honestly considering fdr's margin in 36. I suspect and the reality of like the already existing like mechanism for red baiting that was being twirled up by by the powers that be the upton sinclair campaign in california being like the the practice run. I don't think he would have stopped fdr from getting reelected. Hoover and biden are very similar because they're both going to be in a position where they're going to be dealing with the precedent. Crisis that cannot be handled with any of the available tools that they use their entire careers but with no willingness ability or willingness or ability to change them so something's going to have to break off and and shatter this political log jam oh boy.

So the u.s. So so it does look like china and russia are trying to wean us off of the dollar globally. They're they're apparently cutting their their percentage of transactions that they're doing from 90 to 50. And I know china just bought literally tons of gold I mean I still would assume this is hedging because nothing in the current situation makes me think that china is in a position to make that change right now But they're very. I mean they're very wise to have an alternative like if the if the greeks had really like it really taken the concept of of leaving the euro seriously they could have won. But the thing is that the the the germans knew that they didn't the the germans knew that they were bluffing and since the germans knew they were bluffing. They were never going to get pushed off their position even after they won that referendum it didn't change the calculus and the thing is is that the way to beat that was not to have bluffed or at least to a bluff at a higher level of commitment as in really making moves towards getting their own goddamn currency going again instead of just saying we might do it in the future. If we can't get a deal because they'll be like yeah. No you won't because at that point it's too late it would be nice if they came back to the drachma because that's a great name one of the best named currencies. I would say the drachma is great drachma wonderful. The zloty in poland also delightful the dong of vietnam.

How can you not love that let me think. I'm gonna i. I was like colonists the costa rican currency. ruble is just kind of fun to say rupee. Also shekel kind of seems anti-semitic honestly. Maybe it's just the k in there. It's like a comedy sound that you would use to make fun of somebody who really loved money. Lira is very nice and I'm glad turkey still uses the lira so that it's still around. Frank is one sounds like you're sneezing too typically self-absorbed oh yes. We're french and it's the franc no off kroner is fun. Kroner is like all of the currencies in europe like that aren't euro or all by like the relatively you know high hdi countries that figured rightly that the euro wasn't in their interests like in scandinavia and it's all cronus. Oh yes the quetzal in guatemala. That's nice scudo. That's a good one dinars are fun give me that dinaro. I wish this. I wish somebody had the cistercy the old roman cistercy. I always liked that it was very very dramatic name for a currency. Gilders are good ducats of course. I have a ton of dinars. Somebody sent me a bunch of dinars. So. I have if they do the revalue I am going to be a billionaire. one thing. I don't like about the chinese currency right is that it's the yuan right.

But also it's the renminbi pick one. What's wrong with the ruwan just make it do you want get out of here. Get out of here. People should need to get over the idea of aoc running for president the president's not going to save anybody the circuit's broken it's not going to happen. Wish casting presidents is just is just learn helplessness at this point you'll need to just get over the idea of the presidential. Bernie was different in a qualitative way and worth supporting for specific reasons. Everything else is just trying to imagine you can you can have lightning strike twice and I don't think you can and when we saw the results with bernie and the failure to activate that group. I was talking about like bernie didn't do it your. Like argument over a jacobin article isn't gonna do it one way or the other either like some 30 caller account saying like that. It's that it's actually ableism not to follow back. It's not going to job. It's gonna have to start from the st scratch ground up that does not mean not electoral. It means electoral at the local level. The only place you've seen any movement anywhere and that's good that's where it always starts oh new rights started there. The new rights didn't start with president barry. Goldwater got his ass shellacked in 1964 but then they won started winning town councils. School boards incredibly importantly. School boards local elections and then congress. Then they could start getting senators and then boom they got reagan. They did not start with the president.

The presidency started moving things. It was a momentum thing and that was what bernie was always supposed to be so the better he did the better. It would work that strategy of of activating the movement like in the core where they get the core of the earth to start spinning again with the nukes. That was what bernie was supposed to be and I don't think. I don't think he absolutely failed. He certainly six 2016 definitely started something and 2020 continues it. It's just that it wasn't sufficient to do what anyone imagined. They were going to do in their head which for most of the part was delusional anybody who thought bernie was going to get her universal health care passed. I'm sorry was if they needed to think that to keep going good but it was not realistic. The fight was supposed to build a social base for socialism that was the best we could hope for and so we got less than with that. But we got more than nothing.

But it's still that's the process the idea that you could just put another figurehead on top of this process. Even though it has failed to get into its own you know circulation. It's failed to start the process. It's failed to kick start the the perpetual motion. Then it's not going to matter so if you want to care about elections and I don't think people shouldn't. I think that's silly and childish then care about ones that can be won at the local level and I know it's horrible to think of that considering how late it feels. But we have no idea how things are going to break. We don't how things are going to break loose.

We don't know what those conditions are going to be you need. All you can control is what position you are in when those things happen and that means finding this the smartest application the most effective and efficient application of your energies and then applying it so that whenever things change whenever the the the fault lines crack and things start rolling downhill that rolling up then you're somewhere that can meet that moment and that. Is the thing that I can't tell you and that no one can tell anyone that has to come from in them side. They have to clear all the gunk off of their windshield. Sit quietly look at the wife around them for really instead of just reacting to shadows in their mind really look at the conditions of their life and move forward and you say how will I know you'll know. But we don't operate at that level that level of clarity. We operate at this the fog level where we're always constantly entertaining and exercising a distraction on our own minds in order not to have to make look through that clear pain at what's within and what's without we would rather filter it through this layer of irony or distraction or or mythic heroistic self-conception or or to carry off social media conflicts with one another that we charge with epic emotional and immoral weight for no reason. That's why the pale king someone says pale king hours yeah.

The pale king was about like the spiritual the magical implications of the concept of boredom because boredom is sat with if boredom is is actually engaged. Instead of annihilated. You can get to some pretty profound realizations without anything getting not without needing any intervention without needing to to have the right moment appear to you where you get like aha that happens sometimes but you can't guarantee. It's ever going to happen. What you can do is actually try to be bored for a minute and listen and you might get a little closer to figuring out what to do yourself.

Someone wants me to rate amy. Klobuchar's feet posts. I will not. I will say is let's dispense with the fiction that amy klobuchar doesn't know what she's doing. She knows exactly what she's doing. This is the second foot post she's ever done. This one is clearly intentional. She is like all these people an attention monster who whose ego is unsuspiciously huge she ran for president for god's sakes so you know that she is aware of every meme related her. She knows everything about throat about she knows everything about throwing the staplers and eating with the comb. She even tried to do a horrible disgusting joke about eating with the comb. She's fully aware of everything that's ever said about hers which means she knows about that her army of simps and she wants to. She wants to throw a little gasoline on that feet sip fire and I say more power to her not hurting anybody which she certainly would have done much more of if she was vice president and whatever she's doing in the senate which I'm sure is monstrous wallerstein world systems theory very important very good stuff.

I think it's the only real way you can understand how capitalism actually spreads and interacts first with like different systems of local social order and then eventually spreads throughout them. The capillary action of trade like building veins that bring blood in and actually change the the act the structure of societies just through prolonged interaction. Someone asked what's the deal with feet. I have a theory about the feed thing I have no idea if it's true like most of the things. I say it's just something that kind of makes sense to me and that is that the foot fetish the rise of the foot fetish because like foot fetishes have already always existed but they've gone from being marginal things like a creep in a james arrow novel with a bunch of shoes in his arms or something to something. That is now the most common fetish and one that is just sort of offhandedly is like if you want to suggest some sort of vanilla kink for a for especially a white male character or a male character. A straight male character specifically foot is the perfect.

It's the first one and it's like. It's mildly kinky or creepy but it's not full. It's like the way that geekiness used to be this actual thing for actual social outcasts and then marvel made it just everybody same thing with the foot fetish. What fetish is the marvel movies of of of kinks and the reason for that and my theory is is that the modern a guy who grows up now and has grown up like in the last 30 years has for the first time in history been able to access from the age of puberty the age of horny all of the pornography they've ever wanted which in my opinion is a terrible thing and very bad and I feel like I'm of the last generation where nudity was a scarce resource like.

I have distinct memories around like videotapes that I owned and like taping things off cinemax like that kind of thing because it was it was scarce you know. It was an incredibly precious resource back in my day but of course what that means is you know. If your contact with something that you desire is less then your enthralment of it is not removed and I think that if you can see like boobs put it into a computer from 13 and just see every boob on earth you're going to eventually boobs are eventually going to be boring. You have to find another thing and it has to still be like part of the body that is in general and in public hidden and nowadays that basically means like ass or feet and then so your brain basically rewires its desire circuit around the dead area where boobs used to be and connects it to feet and that's like the process of like being desensitized to pornography that makes guys you know addicted and make it hard for them to have sex for real is because of that process. So that's my theory. I don't know if it's true. I have not someone asked if I've read christopher lash. I've only read excerpts posted on twitter but I will say that 

I wanted to mention him because in reagan land lash makes an appearance because when rake when carter was really like carter was over a barrel with with gas lines and inflation had no idea what to do and his numbers were tanking and he could not get anything passed in congress pat cattle his like his wunderkind pollster who would help propel him to the presidency and who later on became like he was like the favorite democrat at fox news. During like I think during the trump bush years he would just come out and talk about how the democrats sucked their losers and trust him. He was the carter guy you know but anyway pat cattle had this like revelation because he read lash and you know oh my god the real problem. With this the real problem we have here is not the fact that you know gas is incredibly expensive and people waiting in lines for it or that savings are being destroyed by by inflation and the jobs are going away de-industrialized and and all that it's there's a spiritual void at the heart of america. And he wrote this huge memo to carter saying we need a letter we need to address america about its soul not about its material conditions and then carter was blown away by the thing and he read lash and then he had lash be read by all of his like top guys hamilton. Jordan and all those the the georgia mafia guys then and I had no idea.

This happened like a month bef. I think or so before he did the crisis a confident speech that it came to be known as he went to camp david and went off the grid for over a week and had meetings with different groups of of like spiritual and governmental leaders like he had a bunch of governors to ask them like what's going on in your state. He had a bunch of religious leaders and he had lash he invited lash to david and asked him like what should. I say what should. I do and lash told him you know all the stuff about the heart and he's like well. What about like you know what about energy prices and what about credit and stuff he's like.

I don't know and eventually. Jimmy has like this satori moment like. I know what I need to say and he he get they get together and they write the thing and when they present it to the press before they're going to do the big thing like they present the idea. Before they they They had the actual speech. They handed out lash to the reporters. At the at the conference. They handed the books out to like give him an idea of like what they were actually gonna be going for and then he gave the speech which was very well received at the time it's remembered as him kind of eating. But and like it's it's an emblem of his impotence as president and his lameness and the way he presided over a domestic limp failure but at the time it boosted his approval rating but of course you know then things happened. Hostages got taken that didn't help um and I just think it's really funny that now you got people like oh people need to read lash people need to relash. It's like maybe some of the stuff I've seen is good.

I certainly get like the vibe of what he's going for you know like the and I do think that narcissism is the condition of of the self in neoliberalism. It's like hegemonic everyone's a narcissist to calling people. Narcissists is almost banal because it's the only way that you are rewarded for operating or that the the ideology of the world. Around you makes sense. Narcissism is the only lens through looking at human a contemporary life that comports with what you're told. It's supposed to be so yes. Of course. We're narcissists and that means that we we we tunnel blindly towards what we think is a greater good that is actually just our own worship of self and even when we become political we end up importing that narcissism with us and that undermines our attempts to build solidarity yeah. That's true absolutely But I think it's funny though that at one point in this country at a crucial hinge point in american history. In fact the the one of the most important the one that set this the one that broke the back of american labor and led us towards hegemonic neoliberalism. The president the president united states and his top advisors had all redlash and and we ended up.

You know what he kind of looked like he kind of looked like the real-life version of Oh. What's his name oh god damn. It john. The guy saul star from deadwood what the his name john hawks. That's it He looks like the john he looks like a real-life version of the john hawks character from winter's bone terrifying teardrop yeah. That's it it looks like teardrop from up on their on their head. I am tom country man hello I am tom countryman. I'd like to be introduced to your country. I love it here hot dogs and sodas pop is he really the undersecretary of state for international security. Oh. He's one of the deep state guys even like when they got a guy who looks kind of rough and tumble.

He's still a langley ghoul amazing democrats never disappoint man. Laura loomer in congress would be great. I mean the funny thing is is that even if she doesn't win and I don't think she will. It's apparently a relatively safe democratic district but hey it doesn't mean she won't is that she even if she didn't get in like even if she got in. She would not be the craziest person elected because I think loomer. I don't think she actually goes full cue and on which is not true of the rifle lady. The rifle car restaurant lady from colorado or the one from georgia both of whom are likely to win and they're both nuttier than laura loomer which think about that just get that in your head is is q and on this generation's fry core what they're all geriatric senior citizens who are on the computer all day.

Yes. Actually. They are this generation's fry core because the guys who would have done that then are doing that now fry core yeah f r e I core it sounds like fry but that is the correct pronunciation. I'm not going to roll my r's or anything cry core. It's fry core oh.

Someone's wanting someone wants to to monday morning quarterback the soviet the the the the polish soviet war. It's one of those that's like the polish soviet war is kind of like. like post-soviet war is pickett's charge for tankies or or whatever you want to call them because I think they like that name now. I'm not trying to to criticize anybody ussr fans ussr the version of the ussr people. The version of like lost causers for the conf. For the ussr. They just think oh if they hadn't if they'd just driven to warsaw and the funny thing is is if that if anybody that up it was stalin which if you're also loving stalin. Then you've got to figure out a different reason that that war didn't go so good. Let me guess it was trotsky well. The funny thing about people being called revisionists is that I mean if your stance is this ussr was was good until gorbachev showed up well. Then you're abreznavid and brezhnev had revised a bunch of. It's all of it has to be revised. It's a question of what you're revising it to the idea that anything can be fixed in time and not applied to the circumstances of the moment.

I don't know man. It's not very what's the word it starts with a d what's trotsky's whole deal. I would define trotsky's whole deal as a guy who couldn't make the tough call a guy who wanted to have ice cream for dinner a guy who did not want to accept the moral responsibility of being at the center of a historical moment and that's what the world revolution was for trotsky. It was the thing that was going to come cut through the impossible choice the gordian knot and just slice it for him and since it never happened he was never able to be effective and the thing is is that at a certain point if you can't answer the question before you you have to re-examine your premises and like say take take take the whole question of like industrialization or like creating a modus vivendi with peasantry using the market system bucharan versus zenovia broadly conceived trotsky of course wanted to rapidly industrialize but at the same time he recoiled what he knew it would take to get that. Peasants and he didn't want to make the choice because that choice was never supposed to have to have been made. That choice was supposed to have been obviated by the world revolution following shortly after the martian revolution. Both lenin and trotsky were operating in october of 1918 from the premise that it would be the beginning of a world revolution and for a minute it looked like they would they were it looked like it might have happened.

Then it didn't happen and they had to improvise from that point. But they could not look back and that was the problem like you either have to say like stalin eventually did all right full steam ahead. There's no going back the history runs runway and this is the moral horror. If this is horrible it might that doesn't mean it's not necessary or you go like bukhara and you're like you know what maybe martov had kind of a point maybe russia really wasn't ready in the absence of a world revolution. Maybe russia really wasn't ready for this and you know this kind of the consolidation stuff like the capital accumulation that's not really supposed to happen under us that's supposed to happen. That's that's the dirty hands of capitalism like our system is not built on blood. The way capitalism will be that's the whole that's the whole brilliance of the teleology the way we met what we're acting on the morals we're acting from is that we don't have to start a world and the blood we shed will be righteous blood the blood of revolution the blood of punishment of criminals. It will not be wholesale exploitation and and and in human instrument human instrumentation human instrumentality because that work will have been done by capitalism and but that would have required taking a step back and going maybe. Capitalism has to come back which is essentially what pokharan was arguing for even though he wouldn't say it that way he was like look this. Up make a deal with the peasants and this will eventually like dissolve back into something like the bourgeois democracy that technically we all used to think you needed to have before you could get communism drop all our. We all used to think that until we decided we didn't think it anymore because the germans didn't successfully revolt and then after that we could we couldn't take warsaw and it's you got to make a decision so now if you haven't stalling and those guys made theirs. Bucharan made his but he couldn't make the choice. I think that was trotsky's deal and that's why trotsky is a choice of very educated people because even the thought of making a morally monstrous decision is repellent because they they enshrine their own sense of being the good ones. The the bet the ones who have absorbed the theory the most successfully and therefore have comported personal morality with like acting in the world to be most in sync yeah pilot.

The eva leon I I'm talking about discrete choices and decisions. Obviously. They're all they're all predetermined to a degree but people don't operate from that assumption. They operate from a illusion of free will that actually ends up being the stochastic stamping of space-time that propels history forward. You have the shape determined by materiality that is unbending and then you have the random application of actions caused by the diluted human brains operating without full recognition of their environment. It does not somebody ask does it make considering counterfactuals pointless. It doesn't because what you end up. I think you can't really distinguish when you're talking about counterfactuals. You should it should always be in reference to one another what are more and less likely or possible or realistic counterfactuals and that can be determined by saying what major change could have been caused. What's the biggest change that could have come from the smallest number of people either changing their minds or like randomly dying before they are involved and somebody else replacing them you know like and and and from that you can kind of get the the aperture of genuine like choice that any given moment allows the people making decisions.

 jill biden man that's a hell of a speech. I didn't really watch it. I just watched her looking like looking like she was A merry widow honestly like my husband of 27 years is dead and now. I'm back on the town dr joe biden. I think she is a lady macbeth figure because I don't think someone who really loved their husband would put him through this because there's no way she couldn't put her foot down until and made him not not become president. I mean the guy is is clearly at sea and aware of it and as such probably very grateful for the few friendly and familiar faces that he sees every day and that ground him and keep him anchored if she said. I'm not gonna. Go with you on this he would be terrified so she's doing it on purpose because she wants to be first lady or more maybe. She wants to be edith wilson but that doesn't mean that she is not a a hottie. She's definitely hot so well done did bill. Clinton look real or like a deep freight fake man he sure looked He looked bad that's for sure and man all that charisma because I mean.

I've seen the old speeches and maybe it's just because there's no crowd. But I think. I think it's honestly his life force is finally draining. The agreed chrome has run out. I guess after epstein's death. is that he was just sallow and gravely and not he couldn't inflect anything that thing really was like a just a. It was a funeral where it was a funeral where the bodies were also The guests like the people doing the eulogy were also the corpses and the people attending were also the corpses. It was just like some sick undertaker just stacks up all the bodies in the morgue and has them all sit in the at the pulp at the at the pews and then have one of them stand next to the cam. The the casket and then guess who's in the casket. Us we're in the casket. Very grim stuff people are loving. This new game fall guys. I've watched it.

It looks very easy. I think I do very very well. Very quickly. You just run you have a little guy run down a hill that seems incredibly easy. Why would that be difficult. Seems like it'd be incredibly easy. I would I would win every race. I might pay five guys. I'll definitely play here's the games we know we're gonna play in the very near future. fall guys sure katamari damasi the rolling up game that looks fun and universal europa universalis. I'm gonna play that I'll say it right now me and trill byrne aka everett aka age of napoleon are going to try to create a a unified italy under under venice. maybe even a continent spanning empire so that's going to be fun. I want to be a universal doge even if they have to call me a king in my mind. It'll be the doge oh oh yes napoleon total war. We should play that too for sure also. I want to try to see if I can like max out. The ottomans is there a game where you can try to have the mongols take over europe because that's the thing they actually could have tried. I don't think they necessarily could have succeeded because they would have been too far from the step. All right looks like crusader kings 2. You can try to have a mongol conquest of europe. I think I'd like to try that no no I know that they didn't. They were not stopped in europe.

They could have stayed but it wasn't profitable that it wasn't. It wasn't the most useful place to go. They had other ideas. They had other things that are more focused on but there's a way where like they could have stayed. But I think it would have been problematic regardless all right dudes. I'm going to sign off a little early today keep it frosty and stay hydrated bye.
