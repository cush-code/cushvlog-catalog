He said you can go sleep at home tonight if you can get up and walk away. I stared back back with the underground breeze blew back my hand. I remember throwing punches around and preaching from my chair tell me who are you. Where are you. I tend to want to know oh. I really want to know uh trying to spell this for the twig. For the tweet phenomenology. Always the tough one to smell phenomenal. Come on all right. Let's try this twitch. I'm here in the field. I find someone real. I don't believe you feeding yeah yeah. I don't need to fight. I still spelled it wrong man. My brain does not work. My brain is not turned on as john tommy was so sad in that terrible fake improv uh sitcom that he did which I've seen every episode of and I'm truly kind of ashamed of myself. It's one of the worst things. I've ever seen has anybody seen that neighbors it was called. It was on hulu for a while and it was absolutely brutal. There we go there we go. We can bring people over now from the twitter sphere. Don't cry don't raise your eye. It's only teenage wasteland all right so today.

I'm gonna get uh a little out there uh this is going to be uh one of the weird ones. This is gonna be one of the more speculative uh phenomenological as you can see in the name uh ones we've done in a while and this is because I'm kind of feeling like I'm getting towards something that once again is only me trying to make sense of the world to myself and then throwing it out there to see if anybody is uh getting what I'm saying enough for me to feel like I'm on the right track as opposed to just you know descending into uh psychosis which is always a concern. It should be anyway for anybody living in this  society uh so. I just got to throw this out there. It's very very uh mushy and uh it's just a story. I'm trying to tell myself like it's gonna be you know very. It's. It's it's gonna like attempt to be like biological but in a way that is way beyond my understanding of actual biology. So I'll just be pulling. Stipulate that as the beginning is that this is all based on speculation about human biology and consciousness that I don't have a background for I mean. I don't have a background for anything. I talk about but just underlining it here so that you know you don't get too alienated by this.

If I'm if it does feel like. I'm uh disappearing from uh legibility okay. So I was trying to think about myself and like what feels to be the sort of crisis at my center. The thing that prevents me from living in the moment with the knowledge that I have about you know the the the fundamental and unbreakable unity of existence and therefore the impossibility and irrationality of the very concept of death and I know that intellectually. But I have find myself unable in the moment of my life to inhabit a space where I feel that it's true like. I still have a pit of anxiety in my stomach. It's not always there and it changes depending on the moment and sometimes it's almost completely gone. But you know because I'm living a fall in life and I'm not an ascended being. I have not had a full conversion experience to a coherent uh world with like a a super a supernatural charge to the perception of existence as opposed to the perception of the the um. The uh intellectual like you know self conception of existence uh so like. I know this stuff. But it's I'm still like you know haunted. I'm still. I'm still happier than I've ever been. And I'm still uh you know they essentially my entire life. I felt like I was in a coffin and now I feel like I'm still in a coffin.

But there's a  there's an opening and I can move it. I can get it open. Sometimes it gets smaller and sometimes it goes bigger and that's never happened in my life before. I before this I was absolutely pine box nailed down like  crematorium like that was it and now I feel like there's an opening and I've just been trying to figure out okay well. How do. I get the opening bigger and I'm doing some things.


But and there are other things that are preventing that that like provide me with a sense of anxiety that is related to you know senses of guilt senses of responsibility for other people's senses of like the hurt I've caused and the and the to people and and my essential accumulated karma. You know like how do I cut through this in a day-to-day basis and I've realized that the real root of it is is. I think what is also the root of generalized neuroses under capitalism and that is fear of death like actual emotional fear of death. Not a place where you have intellectually decided that death like oh though that's an irrational number and you wiped it off of the board. I'm talking about feelings. I'm talking about your your gut. I'm talking about if you want to get back to 70's brain lateralization theory. The right hemisphere right like. I don't know. I'm sure that all that hemisphere  has been completely debunked by now. But it was very popular in the 70s and I've been thinking about it lately uh and I really do feel like for myself. I feel so psychically imbalanced towards the intellect and towards thought and away from the actual experience of emotion like. I have emotions. But I feel like there is the space where god lives is the space where emotion is felt without uh intellectual sort of uh uh narrative narrative and and disenchantment. Because like the intellectualization of life is the disenchantment of life it is taking the experience of life which is emotional and I will argue that emotions come from our experience of our unity not our separation and that uh and that intellectualization cuts us off from them in a real way uh and so thinking of it. In terms of like brain hemispheres to me is very handy. I don't know once again if there's any real uh science to back that up at any point. But I feel like if there is such a thing as being left brained.

I am  left brained and my right blank brain does feel my emotional connection as in and I would say that the distance the the distinction there is one of distance from the point where uh consciousness comes into being because I think emotions come from our connection to uh our bodies and the thing about our bodies is that yes they they exist as separate from the world but that perception of separation uh is a story that we tell ourselves. We cut off at a arbitrary point between ourselves our perceiving ourselves and perceiving the things around us because we have the capacity as anyone who has experienced altered or heightened states of consciousness knows. We have the capacity to experience with far far far more acuity than we perceive at the at our regular like resting consciousness like in our in in when we're perceiving ourselves. As individuals. We have a very restrained uh uh uh range of perception so like our brains our consciousnesses teach us where to shut it off so that we can perceive ourselves as separate so that we can survive because as I'm gonna say there's two types of fear of death. There is the fear of death from an emotional level which is the fear of immediate harm which is an evolutionary necessity for any being to persist in the world and orient itself towards survival. But then uh as consciousness increases as degree of perceptivity increases as our ability to perceive increases.

We get a distance from that like an actual physical mental synaptic distance from the experience and then we have to tell ourselves a story about what just happened and that is where we create a consciousness that is where we create. We create the world that we live in and where we are the soul  perspective we are god. We are everything now that is illusory. That is fake. It is made up not of anything from us but from with things we encounter. This eye that we have is really just the collection of the things that we have seen and exposed ourselves to through our perceptive apparatus through our lives. That's it and then there is a thing within us that orients us through that to tell a story to weave these things together into a story about what we're feeling but that story is not connected to the things that we experience because it passes from unconscious control because our brain is doing all the stuff in our body. Our brain is doing all the stuff in our body. It's breathing it's making our heart beat. It's making the blood it's making the blood go. It's making the white blood cells do their. It's making the synapses synapse. It's all doing that our brain is doing that but we don't think about it and so our sense of ourselves as a separate being from our bodies is across the chasm of our perception of our body which is where we cut off the line is where we say before this we're not going to actually experience. After this we can make do but that is through this tunnel. It's through the it's through a glass.

Darkly. It is by definition uh of perception has jumped the track into another tunnel and you're using the symbols of everything around you to make sense of what's happening to you. And so you make neurotic assumptions and you build an intellectual identity that is unable to conceive of death because it is not connected to the uh. The body which is itself connected to something that would render that concern absurd. It's not a thing that you would spend time freaking out about. It's not a thing that would pull you away from the moment because it wouldn't make sense and that is life socially lived where there is enough actual emotional content to your life which needs to have other people reflecting it. In order to be reinforced. There is no room for intellectual uh uh uh fear of uh annihilation because we aren't feeling like something that can be annihilated. We're feeling like something that is part of something we're feeling connection when you feel connection death is not there death only comes death only gathers his coat and stands by the foot of the uh of the of the chariot. Uh once you have um removed yourself into the mind remove yourself into the interior not connected and we can only do that the degree to which we're alone and that is why the the process of civilization is alienation away from those that we exploit so that we could be away from the horror but that means time by ourselves. And we have reached the end point of that where we have all spent so much time by ourselves and what and that we have lost that social uh uh soothing of the fear of death leaving us with just a mind just a brain that is going to die and then an anxiety about that that we carry with us at least. I think that I carry with me and in that mind at least in my mind. I can know in my head. Oh. This is a this isn't a self. This is an illusion but I cannot inhabit a body that believes that because I spent my entire life up until very recently accumulating this  lead ball in my stomach by walking around thinking that I was a self by walking around thinking that oh my god I'm gonna be gone someday because there's two types of fear of death as I said the fear of immediate extinction is just survival and it's also in the best interest of whatever group you're live with and humans are  a social species. So that is the point that fear of death is one that uh shows the harmony between group evolution humans as a species an individual human evolution within that species it's a mutual goal but once you get to uh fear of death and that abstract when you're not in danger when you're just living your life when you're just doing your your work to sustain yourself whatever that means but you're still thinking about dying.

That is where the neuroses comes and that is the social engine of the extraction away to capitalism the pursuit of the ultimate panacea. But what that has left me with is because I spent 40 years doing this. I have 40 years of accumulated uh lit life in this crouch in this fear ball. And I don't feel the accumulation of the fear anymore so much. But it's still this remaining slug and I've realized that like whatever kind of spiritual awakening. I feel like. I'm coming into which also sometimes feels like you know mental imbalancing or whatever uh that it is an attempt to uh essentially uh neutralize this ball by actively seeking to feel something other than fear to actually feel with my body what it is to be a connected being and that means being connected to other people obviously but that's only so far you can go because we are way way way more socially isolated than we could should be for our mental health for our ability to sustain the balancing act of like ma uh uh using a illusory uh neurotic intellectual consciousness to navigate a flash machine through space as opposed to the two things being uh you know synthesized which is what we want. That is the end state. That is this that is that is what uh hegel talks about the the the the the great absolute. That's where you you do it and so. I have now realized that like the goal needs to be as a person to attempt to bridge the gap to bridge the gap of time between uh the self the rational self and that emotional self because we can't kick start emotions with our mind we have to have experiences so we can use our  consciousnesses to get us in situations where we can have experiences. But it's the experiences that are going to do it that are going to give us the feeling that are going to unloosen the anxiety that is what drives us away from each other and what I think is.

The responsibility is responsible for the entire culture of uh of doom whereby we are alienated fully. We don't believe in capitalism but we also can't stop uh pursuing it because we can't imagine any other goal but selfishness. We can't imagine any other reason for being on earth than to continue living on earth in pleasure. A pleasure that allows us to ignore the  feeling ignore the tension ignore that illusory and unnecessary fear of an annihilation that isn't real and so how do you get that one way as I said is to have a social existence. Because social life validates this by itself. It isn't.


It's a perpetual motion machine of uh of presence because it pulls you. It is. It's it's so. It's gravity literally and you're not thinking because you're thinking about what matters and what matters is decided by what's in front of you. It's not decided by you waiting in a room looking at a computer trying to define yourself. It is insisted upon by others who if you are drawn to people with love and with an open heart are going to be drawn to you and you you know virtuous cycle stuff so that's one part of it.

But that's not something that everybody can access in fact in fact very few people can and people are forced to spend much of their time wildly alienated in terrible awful work that makes them feel nothing other than a presence but a presence of suffering which means they're in the worst conditions whereby they're they're being more physically exploited and that exploitation is robbing time from them that they know they'll never get back. It's time that can never be brought back and you know that all you have is time because you think that there is something to lose with the end of your consciousness and we all feel that to some extent but it becomes overwhelming when all your experiences in life are pulling you in that direction. So what else can people do and what else can I do as someone who is very privileged to be able to pursue this more more on my level my on my uh terms but of course. That's it has its own pitfalls because if you get to choose then you have the burden of choice and that's not saying poor oh cry one poor one out for me. I'm doing better than most because of my privileged position. But this is the the terrain of the struggle now is choosing and that means feeling and it's hard to feel. It's hard to feel even if you're not alienated with every moment of your life and most of us are deeply alienated uh so what else can you do. I think there are people who for whom it is easier and I would say people whose brains are shaped a certain way.

Because remember. This is all like an actual biological thing right. This is your brain's ability to push electricity through itself to uh feel things right to feel the world around it to find to to feel the inside to be able to map the exterior and interior terrain of the human body and then also map the exterior of the the outside the other and then even though if your perceptive capacity and your intellect and your imaginative capacity as a human with your  super super highly tuned uh perception machinery if it can experience beyond itself. Then it can really access the entirety of human history of the universe's history. You are able to find yourself the groove of history. You are you talk about free will versus determinism. You can find the groove that brought you to where you are and you can find the tessellating and exploding array of billiard ball connections that made everything happen and made you where you are now and that robs you of the ability to hate others. It robs the ability of you to feel unnecessary guilt. It connects you directly to everything but you can't live that way it's impossible to live that way. This is a state of gnosis.

This is a state that can is always associated with heaven because it is not sustainable but it is something that can be glimpsed. It could be a fire that can be held that can push back the darkness but it is that is what is being sought. That's what we're seeking and our brains can get us there because our brains by definition are the ones determining where we stop sensing where we stop feeling the extension of consciousness like no no we're not going to feel the blood going through our veins. We're not going to feel the electrical current. We're not going to uh feel the air outside the air molecules outside the skin. Even though we could we're not going to feel all of that we're not going to feel we're not going to have to think okay breathe okay a heartbeat. We're not going to do that and we make a we we draw a line and we can access that other side by feeling because feeling is where it jumps the rope feeling is where it jumps to intellect that's the black hole the automatic brain functions turn into conscious functions but there is a gap.

There. There is a there's the space between because by the time you fee think something about your feelings they've already happened. By the time you are when you cry your brain is making sense of the tears. It is not making you cry. The body is crying. The brain is making sense to itself of why you're crying and that means it's always guessing and sometimes you guess right. But a lot of times you guess wrong and then you act on the wrong guesses and that is what pulls you away from ever being able to access that feeling and be able to access.


Those uh those depths of perceptive capability so how can you jump the track well. Some brains jump the trap naturally their their grooves grow faster. They're. The the sparks spark faster. The uptake is fast. The reuptake is faster. The machine works at a higher rate a higher rate than is compatible with functioning day-to-day that is where you get uh mental illness. It's also where you get religious belief because uh the the relationship between religiosity and temporal lobe epilepsy is pretty well established. This is parts of your brain that are perceiving at a higher frequency than the rest of us or the rest of your brain and that is where the that's uh mental illness is essentially your brain coming into conflict with the consensus reality of everybody else's brain and being unable to function at that level of abstraction like you can't your brain is too connected to deal with the disconnection and then uh there is drugs which also skip the skip the uh the rail for you because instead of instead of your brain doing it naturally and instead of the net the last one. I'm gonna say uh it just does it bio uh mechanically like uh. It's. It's like a booster in mario.

You're not thinking about it. You're putting something else in your body that does the thinking for you and it goes okay well. I guess we're going to perceive a lot stronger. We're going to perceive a lot more and oh. Oh my god. We're literally one with the universe and that means our our consciousness is non-existent that means that our our literal ego is meaningless and then you still have to live in that body with that idea and with all the all the desires all the things you want and all the things you don't want which make up what it mean. What good is how do you understand extinction as as good as as positive as something to feel good about if all of your other associations with those feelings are about this world and this small window of opportunity to indulge in sensation. Even though the indulgence of sensation is just supposed to be grist for the mill of the universal consciousness experiencing itself but that's dangerous drugs are dangerous because since you're not willing it through you're cheating say you knock your brain into a different groove and we know for a fact that psychedelics literally rewiring your brain like that you get ahead of the bullet and you change its trajectory.

That's what it does and now the sudden you find yourself in a situation where you now have a new reality. You now have a new understanding of the world that allows you to walk around with your day a conversion to a new to living in a new universe where that feeling is gone and instead you feel you can walk around being an individual but also feeling the pure full light of universal grace. But it requires to sustain it. It requires keep doing the drugs or doing stuff in life.

That life won't let you do or that the the your urgency of trying to keep yourself in that feeling is going to prevent you from doing is. The momentum of your mind is going to prevent you from doing because you have new grooves now your brain is now new structure and you are now. You are you got to where you are with one brain and now you have to navigate the rest of your life with a different brain. And if it's too different then you get to the point where you can detach from reality and it becomes negative. Then there is the third way to breach the chasm and that is concentration breathing meditation focus of the mind clearing yourself as much as you can of the thoughts of the over brain finding the deepest rooted thoughts and following them into the  black hole of sensei of emotion and that requires stillness. It requires connection to the body through breath and it requires patience and so you know I've been meditating but not as much as I should and I know that that's something. I have to do more of in the future because I really do feel like we act negatively to the extent to which we're acting out of a panicked horrified uh desire to escape from that feeling of death which we don't have to feel so much and there's a one-way ratchet.

The more time we spend the loan the more time we spend in our brains. The the more time we spend uh not having experiences not connecting not feeling yeah. The more we freak out about our impending demise. The more we need to grasp at whatever is most immediately satisfying. So we use the logic the evolutionary logic of short term. I'm in danger uh fear of death which is necessary and and advantageous to the species and to our ourselves and we operate it uh without that being the condition and what we end up doing is suicidal. We end up driving towards death all right okay so any of this makes sense once again. I'm out on a limb.

I know I kind of got. It always gets a little uh. I always end up going off into different tangents and I want to make sure that enough of it came back because sometimes I'll forget to come back and so. I know that if I do the balance wrong with the drugs for example I could definitely get to a point where my brain is no longer able to function with the world. I have and I'm too selfishly frantic to keep feeling good because that's the thing it has to be balanced or else you're not seeking. Uh you're not getting like the harmony you're getting just the feeling you remember you're trying to chase the high so that's dangerous but what that's why what all this always requires and this to get back to the original idea. What all this requires is will because as I said your brain is making everything happen in your body.


It's making everything every every uh white blood cell attack a cold uh germ. It's making every piece of bone marrow produce blood. It's doing that. But you're not aware of it. You're not conscious of it. But there is consciousness to. It it's just a lower frequency and you can tune into those frequencies and then you can tune into the frequencies beyond the arbitrarily imposed self and so what is the meditative path towards enlightenment but the concentration of will instead of wanting all the stuff that's around you. I want to uh have people like my stream. I want to eat a delicious sandwich like even though. I'm trying to you know reduce my ego even though I'm trying to uh sort of push through uh to like a a new understanding. I still want stuff. I still have ideas of pleasure and pain that are associated with my life and the things that I've heedlessly pursued for the majority of it and I'm now surrounded by. I have to deal with that on its own terms uh and those with those desires are dividing my attention and my and my ability to perceive drugs is one way to just jump over it with oh. I'm still desiring all that stuff but also I'm feeling other things more and that's concentrating my mind in one another another direction. But uh if you don't want to cheat you have to concentrate your will to the point that those desires fall away and you can't do that for a long time. But you can do that with with focused time spent meditation essentially and then when you're there when it's just your will and your body you can push that  electron a little farther than you thought you could or that your brain expects you to you can push that electron into the dark tunnel and you can walk that line to a pr.

A sensation you're feeling it. You're feeling the world beyond your arbitrarily imposed body and you're feeling you're you're you're tuning into the frequency baby. The universal hum put out by the galactic transmitter but that requires will requires focus and what makes people do things with will belief and that's why there's a bit of there's. A bootstrap. Thing to this is that you have to believe first so that means why you can't reason yourself there. That's why you cannot use reason there because you don't believe things because of reason. So what you can use reason for is to pull you towards situations and engagements and to keep your mind as clear as possible of uh of like the clutter of direct like the  you know like when you get mad you know why you're mad you can pull it down and you're not mad so much and that helps too and then it really is. You have enough of those feelings.

You you you light up the top of the  uh carnival hammer game. You light up the top thing enough times. That's cumulative and then you get a uh a flip a switch because that is ever all all progress is uh. It is an accumulation towards an inflection point and that is it you experi you accumulate experiences of a of a character defined by pursuit of the ideas of universal love and boom. You eventually reach an inflection point of experience and emotion that make you able that are a lot that allow you to walk around just without even thinking about it with with a belief in in the transcendence of the spirit. And that's that's how uh that's what you got to do that's what we're all that's what we all have to do and of course. We are all made. It's impossible for any of us to do it like you have to be incredibly lucky and have the right the right experiences to be born at the right point the right time to have any likelihood of encountering the ability to live beyond anguish and beyond that that that uh neoliberal uh uh stimulus response nexus the the pleasure pain thing that has us all trapped. We have to change our conditions to allow it to happen. But this is the same bootstrap dilemma that's at the heart of belief. Uh we have to change the structure to allow people to have these experiences to allow people to live differently.

But that means we have to change the structures even though we are all defined by them and even though they pull us apart and that is where belief comes in again you have to believe you have to believe in the world enough to stop believing in yourself so much and then you need to believe. Uh that because change happened to you change can happen to others and therefore all effort is worth uh worth doing but that means finding where you can apply your pressure. So that is the paradox of belief none of us believe in capitalism. But we do believe in ourselves in our our uh self-interest enough to pursue our uh pleasures throughout it to cooperate with it to find something. Like yeah capitalism's failed. It will not give us anything we are doomed. We are controlled by demons but if I do x y and z I and the people I like will be able to have uh some more a little more at the trough and maybe maybe have more pleasure ourselves. Since that's the only thing that matters that is the logic that is you know that is why if if there is no human soul if or if it's been stripped to its too much to its up to its if it's been stripped of its ability to imagine any value other than uh uh uh exchange value like exchange value the value form being the only thing we believe it. The only thing we believe in like there's plenty of work.

Written about how capitalism is a really is has taken. Capitalism is the end point of western christianity. Protestantism turns to capitalism and we and we worship it. There's no there's no question that it is and that's because the one thing we believe in the thing that actually makes us act even though we have all these thoughts and even though we have all these ideas and even though we might consider ourselves communists or socialists. Republicans democrats whatever we might. We don't think politics matters whatever it is. What we all do. Most majority of us is cooperate with capitalist institutions and pursue capitalist desires because those are real to us. Even though they're not real they're as fictive as any other social fiction because those desires are don't need to be filled. Those desires are generated by a delusion. Those desires could be written out of the equation so they are illusory. But we believe in them we believe in them and it's the only thing to believe in in a material world in a desacralized world where we are separated where we are fundamentally rent from the world around us. When that division between that when we imagine that the train tunnel between feeling and mind has been blown up and there could be no transversing it. If we believe that then the only thing that we can pursue in life is whatever we conceive of as our uh pleasure and the thing is we don't even know what it is like.

I'm a  hypochondriac. I've always been a terrified of dying and I pursued a lifestyle basically guaranteed for me to die young and I could and that meant that I could keep doing that that meant that as I sensed oh my god look. I'm having a heart attack oh my god oh. I can feel the tingling I'm gonna. My heart clearly is not gonna last very long well then. I might as well do nothing but have another burger might as well do nothing but sit on my ass what what try to do something else why for life for time. I don't even know. I'm gonna get. I don't know when it could end. This heart attack could be a real thing.


I can get it by a bus why would I not pursue the most narrow pleasure. I can at the time so even though. I have this idea of what my long-term interests are. I'm doing the opposite of them without even knowing that's what I'm doing. And so we are all doing that no matter what we might think of ourselves we might be horrified by capitalism. We might find ourselves. We say to our bones. We don't believe in capitalism. We want to see it overthrown. We say. I don't want this. I don't want oh oh but convenience and personal identity and and and and the ability to to recreate yourself on the market. I don't want any of that oh look at you. You've succeeded so much in capitalism. Like you're you're you're a  uh you're an example of the of the greatness of the system. I don't want it. I would trade it all. I would work at a collective farm. I would. I wouldn't even be anime appraiser. I would do a bad job on a collective farm if I could find some way to be helpful uh but with that not being a real possibility with revolution being extinguished with me living in capitalism's uh dying. It has swallowed the world and is now choking on it. And I'm I'm in its stomach while it's last. Uh sulfur scented breaths are being gasped out. I might as well pursue whatever I can call my my uh my best my my most. Uh the thing I can live with the most indulgent path. I can live with like one of the big reasons.

I was never able to get a real that I never really pursued a career like i. I wasn't somebody who like got a degree or something is. It was like an application and knew what. I wanted to do as a young person is because I attempt assimilated very quickly. How or horrible everything is and how the only way you can succeed is by being evil and I didn't want to do that. So instead. I ended up just being stunned and being just being a a a a parasite like an emotional parasite without even knowing it. But I wasn't doing bad stuff so. I felt like. I was a good person and then I go oh.

I get to be a podcaster and I get to have good politics and pretend that I'm like changing the world by having people hear my ideas and then I get to have all these other pleasures too hey that's great. I'll take that so it is so like the neurosis of liberalism broadly and there are and even beyond like liberalism. When I say liberalism broadly. I mean every american like the neoliberal subject so all the republicans too. It is you're in the belly of capitalism. It's dying you. There's no there's nothing else but your mind which will extinguish and pleasures to be accumulated. How are you going to do it and then it is deciding what balance of indulgence and penitence you want to go with. So the right wing is essentially the culturally the right wing are those who say maximal transgression and indulgence will be my religion. I will in fact worship satan I will invert all values and worship myself as god the libertarian uh evangelical protestant uh capitalism. That is what I will do but on the other side. The liberals though who are also in capitalism also want to keep enjoying its benefits. Also only imagine their own self-interest is the real the only real thing in the world. They want to enjoy themselves but they because they think so much because of their social conditions that have had them sitting around in parlors. Uh doing ritualized manners to each other because that's what replaces morality in uh in bourgeois society at the top is manners.

It's not. It's not religion. It's not good or. It's not morality. It is manners and so elaborate manners are how you give yourself permission to enjoy yourself. For the time you have because you'd feel too guilty about just directly crossing over to be ells above.


I am saying nothing nothing is inevitable is exactly what I'm saying. I that's the point of all of this is to say that these are these cannot be mapped. These changes cannot be mapped anticipated. It is a stochastic process. It is being driven by the bouncing of all of our consciousnesses off of one another as we create these different levels of consensus reality. Some of which bind us some of which make us enemies and we're negotiating and those uh borders all the time and it is that friction that powers history but it is randomized by the fact that it's made up of individuals with their own wet work their own brain chemistries. Their own environments that are always going to mean that the response cannot be predicted chaos theory baby needing a libidinal release exactly on the right culturally which is the only politics that matters. It is libidinal display through transgression and indulgence for the liberal including most people who call themselves the leftists.

I'm not talking about anything economic here oh no I believe in uh acab. So I'm not a liberal. I'm not. I don't care about that you could be a real. Ml. You could like pass the test. You are still a liberal in this sense that this is the social arrangement you live in. This is the post-class world that we have created where we are consumers and we are members of subcultures on the left. Here this political left which includes all liberals and basically all leftists including myself. You are balancing indulgence with libidinal release through uh the self-righteous ritual of uh of uh renunciation which we inherited from calvinism and the puritans you can even see these two ends. These two things the indulgence of of the conservative id and the superego of the liberal that is the two paths of american protestantism. The bottom half those who had to work the land by just killing indians and uh enslaving blacks who labored at the point of the spear and therefore didn't have the luxury literal luxury of creating manners of distance from exploitation.

Uh they don't. They have decided that yeah like well well taking over the plant well taking over the planet like by well well dominating the continent. While while imposing this this vision. At the expense of these others. These humans who we are going to pretend are not human so that we can dominate them you know digging up. That earth literally birthed the demon that enhanced that uh that possessed them all and now they're safe worshippers. The other american protestantism which was which came from new england. The people who left who left england not because they had to not because of economic necessity debts or poverty because they were uncomfortable. They were socially uncomfortable in the world of early capitalist britain where they were expected to be high church anglicans where they expected to ignore the debt. The dying cry of the human uh connections that were happening in the severing of social ties in that era and with protestantism is the leading edge of it and so they freaked out over here and so they created their own religion. American protestant tradition that by even the early republic had gone from fire and brimstone  to a detached like john quincy. Adams was a unitarian so by that generation like his dad was a congregationalist and he was already basically a deist. Uh john quincy adams was a unitarian. By the late 1800s they're all  theosophists and spiritualists and they are. They aren't even christian anymore and now there are some variety of fully uh fully secular or new age like non-christian like outside of what you would consider the the eastern western spirituality. Even though that's what they inherited culturally uh. It is now the the dominant form of of political protestantism.

It is hyper secularized radicalism and it is all radical and they do really believe that they're they want to change the system. They think they do at every level like the people who think they're going to do it through a  vanguard revolution or a maoist insurgency or even by pushing the dems to the left. They're all trying to write in the world. The virtue that they can't imagine anywhere else because they cannot conceive of anything but the here and now and so they get their libido pleasure by trying to turn the world into that they're inscribing themselves as the elect the same way that the puritans did by uh turning uh new england into the the new jerusalem by bringing civilization to the wilderness. They're doing that again they're going to re-conquer this. This um capitalist savage land this land of white supremacist barbarism where the uh where the slavering satanic dog of of white uh supremacy has broken loose and conquers the land we are now going to settle it. The new savages are uh our uh maga people. The new savages are uh applebee's uh appetizer platter aficionados and so that is where you get the set of the holy war. That is coming now the holy war between these two wings of american protestantism that are going to fight over who gets to be subject to the horrors of the coming neo-liberal murder order. We know that the  walls are closing in. We know that there is no prosperity. We can only play pleasure in the here and now so if we're in the political realm. Our pleasure is by imagining that we can make our enemies be punished.

We can make the horrors of this world fall on their heads and not arms and it's a snake eating its tail. The same way rush to united states versus china as a snake eating its tail and the thing that they have all have in common is none of them are acting politically because they do not act socially. We are not there's no left because there is no organized left. There is a consumer identity that is expressed through voting and uh participation in demonstrations and participation in uh in volunteer organizations and political parties and that has an effect. But it is not the effect that an actual organized left would have because there is no actual articulation or coordination because everybody is pushing in the direction not of belief in anything other than themselves but in self-pleasure in some variety of politics as pleasure as pursuit of pleasure because pursuit of pleasure is what defines the political experience in this country. Once we got rid of the economic basis for political participation and the thing is is that we've reached such a terminal point of alienation that we basically have to come back together with one another like there's nowhere else to go like we can be dissolved into grey goo and maybe we will. But I think that there's still enough actual like felt experience of of connection to that we have even though it's attenuated and small and it makes it hard to hold the light we all have it and I think that there will be a flare up before an extinguishment.

Even if it does end and extinguish it. There will be a green flash before the sunset and who wouldn't want to if the sun's going to set wouldn't you want to be there for the  flash wouldn't you want to be there for the green flash even if that's all it is but maybe it's not maybe. It's the beginning of a catalyst. Maybe. It's the beginning of a trans of a transformation that pushes against the the tide uh because the structure is not built to to defeat it because it depends on this critical mass of selfishness that could be overcome and if it was the system would be powerless against it because it wouldn't be able to uh use its methods of suppression. Now the question of technological uh sophistication and technological uh mechanisms of control is a separate one but it is one of those questions where you can't answer it for certain. You can only have an intuition and that intuition is going to be bound up and whether you're willing to risk yourself because if you don't want to risk yourself. It's easy to imagine that yeah. No they have they've got computers uh wiring us there's drones everywhere we couldn't stop anything. There's no point in resisting anything. I might as well pleasure myself but you uh and you can say no uh. Like this stuff is something that uh can be attacked from the side. I don't know which one's true. I don't think we'll know for sure until it happens if it happens uh.


But I know that which one you that. I know this that the one you believe is more likely to be generated and motivated not by a reasoned understanding that says well. I've really looked at the issue and my brain has convinced me that this is uh that this is the state of like america that the the human individual versus technology uh you didn't really reason yourself. There there is something else pushing you there and it was either a desire to find it. Power find effort pointless or a desire to find a reason for uh for fighting because when you love you will believe and when you believe you're going to want and when you're going to want you're going to want to make things better. You're not going to want to indulge yourself and so maybe maybe that those things look less uh overpowering. And if they look less overpowering if you even though you think you've reasoned yourself there even though you think no no. I believe that this is an opportunity because I my smart brain tells me that that's not why that's not why you did that you did it because you wanted to believe and then you can motivate yourself. That way you can push yourself in a direction because you now your thinking brain the brain that you deal with most of the time.

It thinks that it had this idea but it was tricked into having that idea. So it's a process obviously. I don't know where I am in the in the thing. I don't know if I'm gonna get to some point of uh. You know conversion or uh psychosis or if I'm just gonna like ride. The edge of this like you know ball uh for the rest. I don't know I do know that the the complicating factor and this and this is very interesting and fascinating to me anyway because I feel like. I know exactly what the complicating factor is but once again. It's not enough to change the the dynamic by itself because knowing doesn't do it. You have to feel uh and it's that.

I have been governed by this hypochondria right and since I was a kid and now even though I understand that like what that was a displacement of and and how uh it's not it doesn't have to govern me that much I still have the hypochondria sensations and it's because part of sensing things more sensing your body more is sensing your body signals more and I have ever since my spinal injury sensed my body signals to an ex to an a clearly neurotic excessive degree. So like I very much could have all kinds of stuff in my body that is like precursor really bad. That is the accumulation of like my lifestyle. You know plaque buildup in the arteries whatever.

But I could be feeling it far out of proportion to its actual like danger to my body at the moment and I'm just replicating that anxiety because in the absence of that like full spark the full flame. There is the fear that if I have I die too soon I will um. I will not be able to apply my mind to death in such a way to neutralize fear of it which is all. It's about. It's all about just facing it and being able to breathe through the the the panic of the over mind with the steady real undermined but that requires a lot of concentration practice. I don't know what if what if I really am dying and I feel it more when I think about this stuff more because as I approach because I can really if I think enough like.

I think fast enough. I can't approach talking myself into believing without having to feel but then as I do it as my feel more. I feel my body more and as I get closer to that sensation of gnosis which is the extinguishment of self. My ego kicks in because it's still there because I still have. This accumulated 40 years of  desires and structured uh structures of illusory identity that don't want to go that aren't ready to go and I have to uh. I have to like breathe through them so that's like the so. It's like a dynamic of intention navigating these poles. So you've got the body and the mind right trying to negotiate the distinction there and then also being able to get close enough to the root in your thought in your thought process because I just think all the time my brain is very literal. That is why I have. I'm abstracted away from my body because why I've been scared of dying since I was a kid why something that was any by any realistic measure far far away something. I couldn't stop thinking about because I could not imagine uh detaching myself from that ego enough to avoid just screaming into the void and annihilating myself.

So I am trying to reorder myself so that I'm always trying to grasp like emotions where they come from and like follow them through to try to to neutralize even my body sensations before they they tripped me up and got me back into a into a terror so anyway. I hope if some of this made sense today you know this is all part of the journey who knows we all know where it'll end up and that's good and that's the thing is that there is nothing to fear there really is nothing to fear but that doesn't uh that doesn't pay the pickle man. When your feelings are not determined by the things you think you have to take that lack of fear and live it by overriding as much as you can everything that comes spewing out of your fear hole. But you need you need you need to but you're not going to get rid of fear obviously and it's going to have to use. It's a signal. It's it's a it's a decision-making matrix. It's a decision maker. It helps you navigate things so you have to have fear without being owned by it and that's way easier said than done. But that's nobody said it would be easy. You know all right well that felt pretty good. I feel like I got most of what I wanted to get out of here hope. Everybody can stay safe and stay stay frosty you.
