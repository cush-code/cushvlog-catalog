We are two mariners the ship's sole survivors in this belly of a whale here's losers. His guts are carpeting yes. We have some time to kill you may not remember me. I was a child of three and you are lighter than 18. But I remember you and I will relate to you how are histories and wean all right guys. I got a tripod here which is pretty funny. Since this I finally have a tripod so. I'm not looking down at you guys like a weird weird pervert. But it's sort of ironic that I have this now for this episode because this is going to be the last not vlog but of the last theory blog I will still do at least two streams a week. I think I'm gonna do a wednesday. I think. I'm thinking. I'm gonna do black reconstruction thinking about black reconstruction although I'm not sure yet starting in like maybe next wednesday or the wednesday after that but then friday. I will do like a fun vibe stream where like take questions and talk to people.

But if I'm going to keep doing this thing I've been doing with the vote ball stuff and trying to like make sense of politics and spirituality and how they mix and all that I have to start writing it down period end of sentence. This was very useful for me as a tech as a mechanism for thinking things through but it has gotten to the point where it is no longer constructive for me. I am doing this to escape the hard and scary stuff which is putting things down and potentially you know looking like an idiot because this format really has been like the whole podcast format to begin with like the reason. I didn't become an academic or a writer even though I had the opportunity to do both boiled down to the fact that I didn't want to do work and you know why would anyone want to do work. It sucks but in my specific case. I didn't want to do work for personal reasons having to do with a kind of a neurotic hypochondria basically that has made me convinced ever since. I was a teenager that I'm gonna die like very soon and what that has always done is it has always given me an excuse to not do anything that isn't fun because I'm gonna die soon why would. I want to put in the effort to get a degree. Why don't I open the effort to sit down and struggle with words.

When I could just post and then once I posted well enough get a podcast and then talk on the podcast and that was satisfying for a while. But I got to a point where especially after the burning campaign failed and my fantasy that I could there was doing something worthwhile with the podcast beyond entertainment like I still think the show is good and entertaining and I hope people still listen to it because it's fun and it's it's entertaining and it's a good product. It's a good entertainment product but it did not fill the the void. I had for political engagement and and meaning which was really just a um. But that was really just a a veiled search for personal meaning which I didn't have and didn't feel in my life and for a while the bernie campaign sort of squared the circle and said oh you can do the fun no difficulty thing and also make the world a better place justify yourself justify your existence. And so. I was like hell yeah but then that broke down and it came it's an entertainment product again. But I had these greater ambitions.

These these pretensions more than anything of intellect or whatever and that required me to figure out like well what am I going to actually say but as I said writing is working and I don't like working so. I found. I found this stream process as a way to do it and I feel like. I was getting to places and I was getting to nuggets and I was getting somewheres but at every point I would find where every point where it felt like ah. I can start writing now. I would convince myself that I needed to keep doing this instead for what. I thought was like. I didn't have enough reason. I didn't have enough information. I didn't have the insights yet but boiled down to. I still think. I'm gonna die any second. Therefore. I have to get it all out now now of course. I'm not dying haven't been but thinking that kept me on the easy track. But I can't do the easy track anymore because my entire life has been seeking the easy track and I'm running on a runway.

I mean I'm not dying but I am getting older and my ability to hold on to this adolescent worldview is becoming un untenable and the only way that I can make that work the only way that I can make my job work in a meaningful sense is if I add craft to it and that means writing as scary as that is midlife. Crisis correct correct my the t starts going down the red lights start going on and if you've lived a life fully those kind of things should be okay. The reason people have midlife crises is because the the the life of the post millennial is in 2000 the post post-20th century. A middle-class and upper adult is one of sustained prolonged non-ending adolescents and not necessarily like being immature in some intellectual sense. I mean not having a real imagined interiority for anyone other than yourself and the thing about living. That way it's the way that you are taught to live. It's the structure of all of our social organs to tell you that it is the undergirding logic of capitalism. That society is the sum total of people's self-interested acts because those are the only kind of acts that truly exist and can be priced and therefore meaningful and that can only work as long as you are able to keep separate two facts that as a educated western person you know to be true one that you're going to die someday your physical body.

Your meat will expire because it is finite like everything and that your consciousness is the only consciousness that you recognize as real in the universe. I.e god you are god and you're gonna die. That is the mindset of the western capitalist subject that is unsustainable just like the society that is made to produce these people and is made up of these people and whose institutions reinforce that mindset is doomed to a final irrevocable crisis when those two realities come together and that's why people freak out around midlife because they are running out of the ability to lie to themselves that they're not gonna die and I personally have clung to politics and the idea of being a political theorist out of a desire to reason myself out of that dichotomy. Like yes. I'm going to die of course. I'm going to die.

But maybe I can help make the world remake the world along the way because obviously like many in my generation. I do not have children. I was. I have not reproduced. I mean part of that is because that narcissistic track makes people value their own pleasure over the sacrifice that's required to raise another person but also even if they wanted to. It's harder and harder to do it because it's more and more expensive and so I find myself without a legacy. You know what I mean and the thing is is that a legacy is not necessary if you have community if you have love that transcends your individual you individuality that is the religious spiritual connection to other people and if you have that then as you get older as the pleasure that you seek becomes less accessible. It is replaced by other deeper pleasures.

Those aren't to be found so make a mark on the world by writing some masterpiece that somehow synthesizes all world history and and philosophy and brings about if not in your lifetime in the future. The the new jerusalem and that premise is as much a denial of death as the one the personal one because this social order is already dead look just like we're all already dead in the sense that the end point is certain. Like here it is. This is a point where every individual and every social order ends and then there is you the individual you know it's here somewhere and you know you're getting towards it. But you don't know where it is and psychosis. Schizophrenia that powers our society is gen is generated by the splitting of the human into a body that feels and senses and a mind that imagines itself separate from that process. Now if the mind is separate from that process it cannot conceive its own end. It is infinite and the mind has infinite capacity but if it's not at every point being re-grounded to the body it pulls you away from not only your body but the reality of the interiority and personhood and godhood of other people because we're all god. Obviously. God is every consciousness in one giant.

Diamond and every one of us is a tiny facet and we are defined by the light that hits us and I think what I've been getting at with all this stuff about like politics as spectacle as as customer service as It's obviously a lot of people say you're really just talking about yourself. I am talking about myself. But people like me are the consumers and generators of political culture people very much like me in class position in education. I mean mostly in race and so when I'm talking about myself and I have been talking about myself to myself for this entire time it has been in an effort to make sense of why I personally am addicted to the spectacle of politics even though I know it is not generative of change even though. I know it doesn't contribute to making the world better for anybody that in fact it only contributes to making my life worse for me and I've been trying to make sense of that and if it's useful. I think it's useful because the people listening to it who are listening to me because I they have a cultural affinity. They have a similar frame of reference to me in a language that I have and can understand my metaphors. They see something there because they see it there too because the neuroses and and hysteria that is the defining characteristic of politics at the moment from q and on to you know blue and on and in between and also all the hysteria and which finding in the left and all the weird.

On the east or on the on the right is a product of the fact that we individually all know we're dying but cannot reconcile that with our consciousness and are living in a society that is dead and is just sort of moving through the remainder of its momentum and that we can't do anything about either of those things even though our point of view that is nurtured by everything around us insists upon our infinite consciousness because the the reality of of of of existence and I've said this before on stream is that everything has already happened. We do not think our way personally individually to anything our our emotions and the thoughts that connect to those emotions afterwards are all generated by our encounters with the world. We do not generate that like you start like you start crying before you're sad like we know that neurochemically you start crying before you feel sad.

The sadness comes afterwards to make sense of the tears and what that means on a social level is that there is this distance between our understanding of the world and the world as it actually exists the physicality of it and in that delay is where we live and we're really just hanging out there. We're not in charge. We are bystanders like we can't make our bodies not die and that means that we're and if you are an educated person who knows as all westerners do that god isn't real and as I have said christians don't really believe in god either. They are making the same um hedonic calculus that the rest of us do of I'm enjoying personal pleasures finite pleasures that are at the expense of others. But it also but all of those pleasures. The piling of them up increases my anxiety because I know I can't take them with me and they will end someday that is an in resolvable conflict unless you create a fantasy create a story that connects those two things and christianity is a story.

 islam is a story. They're all stories and I would argue that evangelical protestantism is essentially the defining religious expression of that contradiction and that wahabis islam is as much part of that and mainline christianity that is now turned into liberalism which is its own. Secular creed is this another version of the same thing and that is coping as people like to say on the internet cope we're coping so if you don't know if god's not. If there is no supernatural there is no eternal. There is no ineffable because we can't feel it remember we only know things if we can feel them. If we have felt them we learn through experience. We connect bits of like symbolic rationality to physical encounter and so since we do not physically encounter anything ineffable anything religious really anything's truly spiritual anything that isn't marketized we reason rational reason to the reasonable position that all there is is individual pleasure and hedonic indulgence but that over time becomes unsustainable because the clock is always ticking and the clock culturally socially planet-wise is now ticking louder than it ever has and that is that causes midlife crises.

[18:35](https://youtu.be/rpMJPhvo49A?t=18m35s)

It also causes political breakdowns because in the west in in we're talking about america here. Specifically. Politics is not a battle between exploiters and exploited. It is it. It is an expression of a reality of class oppression that thanks to spectaclization and media and atomization and all the things we've talked about manifests as a neurotic essentially extended public nervous breakdown of the middle order. What I mean by the middle order are people who whatever their relationship to capital is The reality of the life is that they spend more time unalienated than they spend laboring. I mean obviously they spend all their time alienated but I mean they are not laboring at a pre They are not working if you know what I mean even if they have a clickity-clack job. They're not really working that much they have a lot of free time if what define america and its dawn was free real estate. Now that the free real estate is gone. Our breakdown is happening because of a different free thing free time but not unalienated free time in a post-capitalist. You know post-scarcity world hyper-alienated free time in a hyper.

Commodified hyper individualized spiritually dead world and oh and that means that that karen taught to the manager. Politics is the politics of people individually and then collectively as they talk to each other and express their politics and and go online to talk about it and and and perform them at voting booths and in in public demonstrations is a is a nervous breakdown because everyone knows at some level whether they believe it consciously or not that this society is gonna die just like they are and what I mean by that is not like gonna die apocalypse. I mean that there can be no better moment than the present and that is what drives the neuroses of the last man that we all are which is which is that our bodies are going to die and yet we cannot imagine that and our society is going to die just as we cannot imagine that because it is all it is as totalizing around us as our minds are in interacting with it and interpreting it and embodying it and so if you want to understand what politics are. It is it's that now the reason.

There's so much category confusion and so much argumentation and splitting the hair about what causes the middle class or whatever is because these neuroses overlap on a true actual material geography of exploitation exploitation of resources and humans across the globe and that means that stuck in that middle strata. It's just like being stuck in your body. There is this this there's this gap between the the unresolved unquestionable reality of death and of the end of society and our hopeless and and powerless position waiting for it. That is the reality of the middle class existence where you have the relative ease to have leisure but none of the materials security to ensure secure to secure to feel secure in it. What I mean and what that does is it. Just it's. It's a recipe for individual and then individuals interacting with individual group psychosis things like qna because if you're trapped like that and your body is dead your society is dead.

All we have are our minds our illusionary separate ego consciousness and then the collection of those that we can cobble together into a political coalition and so we think that we can think our way out of it. We think that we can I and again when I say we. I mean me and you can tell me if. I'm wrong. We imagine. We hope we we um we soothe ourselves with the idea that we can think our way out of it because just as we cannot bodily conceive of living forever. We cannot conceive of a meaningful political mobilization because we do not have class consciousness and so we drive ourselves mad and I drive myself mad trying to think our way to out of this think of our way to a point where we choose our end where we choose how to end the system and what to replace it with where we choose the moment of our own extinguishment and our own resurrection and it is the that fantasy and the fact that everything that we see and encounter reinforces that fantasy that propel our politics in a into a neutered and neurotic corner. Now the point of this is not to say we're all. It's all don't care about politics and even to log off.

I realize now that the log off thing was literally me looking me in the eye and telling me what I had to do. I don't know what you have to do with the computer you probably have a bad relationship with the computer because most people have a bad relationship with the computer but how that manifests. I don't know I definitely do know though that my relationship is bad and I know why it's bad. And so I know that what I have to do is cut off my justifications for maintaining my unproductive relationship with it. But the thing is.

[26:13](https://youtu.be/rpMJPhvo49A?t=26m13s)

I'm still a podcaster slash public. You know talking head type person. I'm I I don't have any other skills. I like doing this and I would like to get deeper into questions not really political questions because politics the the grass towards politics was my grasp towards a illusory immortality to history which is where I feel most comfortable and where I feel most intellectually stimulated because I feel like. I understand it like I've said about the the thing that the hegel said the owl of minerva flies at dusk. The the fact that everything is protein and floating at all times in the present means that I do not feel at my most useful comfortable insightful when I'm trying to talk about the current moment. I feel like if you can periodize a a era that has already happened. You can find something there. That's meaningful and because this is all one story you can find the patterns and meanings there that can be applied by other people to the world as they encounter it like I think a good example of this of the of the way that politics is neurotic is on the question of the broad question of social liberalism which is supposed to be the wedge right that prevents working-class solidarity.

One way or the other like on one side of the divide you think that social liberalism is makes class conscious class solidarity impossible because of the inventorate white racism of the american working class and middle class and that that is deeper than class relationships and cannot be overcome or you think that the cynical appropriation by middle class liberals and like neoliberal institutions of like identity. Grievance is what stopped is what prevents class solidarity either way that's the liv that is the wedge and both sides of the left think recognize that as the wedge but the reason that it's the wedge. I think is because we're only absorbing it through the spectacle of politics and we're only expressing it through the only less spectaclized performance of activism and electoralism which that's basically all we have and. I think the reason for that fundamentally is that well social liberalism was the product of the mobilization of the most oppressed like racial cat and eventually gender categories of a society asserting their rights refusing to participate in society without their rights and that's where it started and then it was ratified at the top by institutions that were dedicated to maintaining capitalism and therefore reducing friction points and keeping as many people in the community of consumers as possible.

So it was it was generated from below and then ratified from the top which is one of those that which is one of the things that causes the confusion. About like oh is is black lives. Matter is that an expression of like black oppression or is it a cynical neoliberal ploy.

It's both coming from both ends coming from both sides. But in the middle it is experienced as a marker of um virtue for a segment of that middle class population. The ones who most likely went to college and absorbed social liberalism there because once it was ratified at the top it had to filter down through the superstructures through things like institutions and you had you went from going to college and learning about how like the the rising tide of color was going to swamp white supremacy from professor lothrop stoddard to learning abolish whiteness by that candy dude ibrahim kindy. The thing that happens there is that is that in the middle the the governing institutions ratify a shift that is the product of genuine. Genuine oppressed political mobilization and then it's generated in the superstructure and people encounter it and the people absorb it because of where they grew up what they experienced going up what what career the path. They took the values that they hold otherwise.

 they are accepting it for what they think are reasons of personal virtue. They think I believe like the people who have the signs that say we at this house. Black lives matter you know all love is love. Those people think that they're doing that oh and I should say that this is more common among relatively secure coastal members of this strata and of course I am excluding people who are members of these groups who are obviously motivated by self-interest but a self-interest that is totally understandable and is separate from this neurotic thing that we're talking about I'm talking mostly about white people and while people think that they have gotten to enlightenment social enlightenment through their own virtue. What they're really doing is. They are validating their class position and absolving themselves of the guilt involved in being in that middle strata where you are alienated where you don't really have control over anything to the degree that you can feel empowered.

[32:37](https://youtu.be/rpMJPhvo49A?t=32m37s)

But you also are the beneficiary of a ton of direct exploitation. You are the beneficiary of things like the the the um the gi. The racially applied fha program and the gi bill and and gentrification and all of those things as well. As of course this the labor of our colonial subjects on the periphery we're all in a position where the only things we can find around. Ourselves to distract. Ourselves are indulgences that by definition are tied to the suffering of others and in that situation social liberalism is a way to consecrate that relationship. I'm not bad for doing this because I am not filled with these reactionary social views and what that and what that means is that when we have discussions on questions of social liberalism and how to integrate them into class politics.

They are dominated by neurotic white liberals who are unconsciously for the most part trying to defend ace a thing that is central to their very fragile psychic ecosystem that allows them to continue consuming because when you're trapped in the waiting room of hell which we are our bodies are going to fail. Our society is going to fail. We cannot imagine a better future for any of our descendants if we have them or ourselves. No day will be better than the day we have now realistically. They will only get worse but they're not but the end hasn't come yet unless you fully accept at a spiritual level by embodying your by living in a body by feeling then you will try to get out with your mind and you will build sand castles and sudoku puzzles and riddles that you will solve to avoid being in your body to avoid confronting the reality of the life you live and then those stories. Those those puzzles become life and that is what internet politics is. It is everybody asserting their own fantasies of absolution and liberation that are premised on a delusion of a unlimited consciousness. Now of course once again I'm referring to myself but once again if that sounds familiar. That's why and so what what happened with me is that I realized that when I'm doing politics by doing this by but.

I'm lying to myself that this is enough that I'm helping it's not premised on a desire to help or love like I have talked about it's selfishness. It is reaffirming to myself that I can still do this that I can still solve the riddle of history and consciousness and life. I cannot do that but what I can do is the thing that I have avoided because I thought I was gonna die and that is right and now. I know in a way that I never really did before that. I am not on the precipice of death that thing that I thought has really been my like. I thought my whole adult life that my hypochondria was this curse but it was a mental function. It was a function of my mind to avoid work to avoid alienated labor to avoid difficulty. Because the frictionless plane of pleasure is all you can hope for if you're gonna die and there's no eternity and there's no judgment and there's no connection. If that's true and nothing we encounter will tell us that that's not true at least nothing. I encountered in my life told me any otherwise then acquiring pleasures is it. It's like mario with the rings you've got to grab or no sonic has the rings. Mario has the coins either way you're piling them up but you can't pile them up. They're go away and they are evanescent and every desi. No desire can be fulfilled and all that stuff and so the hypochondria was a way to justify something that otherwise. I wouldn't be able to justify to myself because well if you're gonna die very soon and you don't have time to create human connections and do meaningful work and to live a fully embedded like embodied life.

Then you might as well grab what you can like the god damned muncher. We become the muncher that's I'm not kidding about the muncher being the avatar of this of me. I mean of me if you think you're the muncher tell me. But I feel like. I'm the muncher and it is and it's it. It's a ghost. It's it's without us. It is a. It is a mental projection devoid of a body and what I was really doing was like trying to pick my own and and I can't do that no one can do that and the only way out is through and I thought. I understood that but what I've realized is that I was really just trading one delusion for another and the only real way to build the spirituality that can stand in for a lifetime of of of deracinated hedonism is by struggle by struggle and there's no struggle to this. This is just so easy for me just sitting here and just talking and the thing that keeps me going is the delusion that oh.

I'm gonna. I'm gonna keel over any minute. No. I'm not. I have time unless I get hit by a bus. But then if that happens then all the rest of this is irrelevant. I have time to actually sit with my body and sit in my body and try to make something that means something. I don't know what it'll be. I don't know if it'll be fiction or novel. I'll probably try to synthesize something from what I've talked about on here into like a short volume that'll probably be the first thing. I do. But. I'm gonna have to actually do this and I'm happy and I'm excited. I'm a little scared but the only thing. I know that right now. I have to do is. I have to get rid of this specific outlet because what it the reason that this has been bad for me at this point now. I think is that I as a result of the fact that I flee my body all the time and that.

[40:04](https://youtu.be/rpMJPhvo49A?t=40m04s)

I am able to generate theories and ideas and stories and narratives to justify almost anything that my lizard brain wants. I end up thinking all the god damn time and that's not good for you that is not good for you period and it's not good for me. That's the one thing I know 100. But I think writing could be good for me. Writing could be part of that whole you know soul craft thing that people talk about because that gives you a reason to sit and think through things because the vlog concept was I got to instead of sitting and thinking through things. I got to just have kind of flight of fancy thoughts. All day sit down put them together for a while and then walk away from them but then have to keep doing that and doing that and doing that instead of doing instead of blocking off specific time to apply those ideas which I think will be much healthier for me because it will allow me to live within my body and to cultivate relationships with other people and infuse them with meaning through experience. And so. I don't know what that's going to mean in general. But I just know that for that to happen I need to wean myself off of the easy intellectual fix of coming on here and just off But as I said I will still do these because I need to like.

I said I'm doing a lot of reading for the lincoln project and I want to talk through some of it but as a dialogue not as a monologue anymore and then I said I'd also like to do question and answer streams as a dialogue and then the monologuing can be contained to to a application of craft not just talking which is too easy that's why I sought it as a career. I mean. I didn't know. I was seeking it but I got there and I was able to succeed because I'm good at it. But it's too easy for me. Nonsense is like oh. I'm so brilliant. I'm so genius. I mean it doesn't take anything it doesn't challenge me. It doesn't make me have to live in my body like when I'm doing this. I am a being of pure thought. I might as well not be a body and that is this it's a high that. I then chase the rest of the week and I have to avoid that. I have to think and sit at the same time.

So I hope people have gotten a lot something out of these like theory bombs and most of all. I hope very much to be able to turn them into something more coherent more supported more thought through in written form. Because understanding finitude is understanding limitations. I cannot beat everything. I cannot become the all cons like the all-expressing mind that changes the world none of us can and one of the real insidious things about online politics is that it gives us the idea that we can be everything because it is this frictionless plane where we get to theorize all day and call it. Politics once again talking about myself and that theorization is wasted. It's wasted time for the most part because politics keep getting keep saying this will come from experience.

Not from thought. It is thought is then thought comes afterwards thought comes as a way of making sense of experience not as a way to direct experience and that's why I don't think that saying that we have to accept that this order is dead and that this society is dead is blackpill nihilism. Because of course it is anything that comes after whether it's unimaginably worse or better will be unimaginable because of the totalization of capitalist realism. If there is a hope of the future it will come from us and I think we have the ability to do it. We not only have the resources we not only have the technological advancement and the capital accumulation. We have the brains to pull this off if enough of us step off the hedonic treadmill and move towards a spiritualized embodied life and I think that that that's more hope. I think than you get if you theorize and and doomscroll.

All the time no matter what politics you think you have no matter much of a hardcore ml or whatever the no matter how whatever kind of pill you swallowed the world as it is presented to us in its pseudo form. This ex. This this like synthesized matrix of overlapping neuroses and breakdown mental breakdowns. Is hopeless and of course. It's hopeless because it's it's just an expression of of terror. It's an expression of of our inability to conquer our contradictions and that's because it's pure thought it's because it's pure reason. It's because it's rationality and rationality is by itself totally sterile and so. I realized that. I was not going to be able to to to make any progress for myself. If I stuck unless. I stopped trying to turn this into something that it can't be like what I want to do what I want to do is create something and that requires work and so. I'm going to as.

[47:01](https://youtu.be/rpMJPhvo49A?t=47m01s)

I said pair these back to what twice a week and also I am going to and look you can hold me to this if you see me posting on. Twitter tell me to log off because I am making a concerted effort to just not be on there and I got criticized a little bit for the last vote ball for saying that I was not understanding that like all of these things that I'm describing have contradictions within themselves that get worked out and that new things emerge yeah. That's true the reason. I didn't really notice that is that I wasn't really talking in universal terms. I was talking in specific terms and I know that I have this specific unhealthy relationship with online politics that does not mean that online or any of the events that people discuss online are not meaningful and could not provide the context for the emergence of new new. Plate tectonic political arrangements that could generate new areas of struggle of course that's true but you will not find that by looking at it the internet because of its communist ability to connect people is useful to the extent that people use it productively so twitter useful reddit useful the whole thing useful if it's being used if you're using it. If it's you're not letting. It use you so look for that in the future hope to get something together and hope and I will update progress wise as I'm working on it on here. But if I have another like if I get another vote ball idea you will not see it here you will see it elsewhere.

Heroin is someone says heroin is useful too. Heroin is useful. Opiates are useful like when marx called the called religion the opiate of the masses. He wasn't using it the way that edgelord atheists use it. He was using it in its 19th century term which was as an anesthetic used in surgery as a necessary medical application the heart of a heartless world. He called it not opium but religion but that was the reason that he compared the two they have uses we are not using. We are being used by them though because we are using them as as ways to self-soothe and as ways to slowly kill ourselves because if we can't have a better day than the day we have now then it is up to us to pick our end to pick when we go out.

That is the fantasy of the apocalypse too that we all fixate on that like well. If everything is going to be worse than today and all of life is the accumulation of pleasure and pleasures will go down over time precipitously. We might as well find a way consciously or unconsciously to pick a moment to to say peace but doing that is at the expense of every other person and pursuing that line cuts you off every moment that you're doing it from every other person. It leaves you a terrified guilt-racked sliver of consciousness that cannot reconcile itself to its biological reality. I mean I joked a while ago that like jeffrey epstein is the dmt surge at the end of america hasn't the last guy with the bull horns walking around the capitol building. This feels like your brain sort of writing you off stage and that's what we're all doing but as I said the ones who are doing it the most and absorbing this.

The most and eating the lotus is the most are more than not relatively comfortable and the ones that are being precarious and being made precarious which is a lot of them are encountering class the experience of exploitation and they will in a in a hostile and antagonistic relationship to capital in a way that they never have before and the question becomes how do. They manage that crisis how do we all manage that crisis and I don't know and I think that the black pill is a get out of har work free card it is a way to say nothing can get better. I cannot imagine anything better for me or for anyone else in the future and so therefore I can indulge myself entirely and I can just eat kick. It keep eat skittles for dinner until I die and yeah you could I mean. It's gonna be harder and harder you know as our access to those soothing pleasures becomes more less and less but you can stuff yourself well.

Well you can and it will leave you alone. It will leave you isolated and terrified and there's no way that you won in that encounter even if you thought even if you were right. Even if you looked around you and you were the genius who figured out that everything was hopeless. It doesn't make your life any easier just like being the genius at age 16 who realizes oh my god. I'm gonna die and god isn't real okay well. What are you gonna do about it. You still have to live and I mean my god like people are horrified of like a new waves and waves of viral infections and new covets that's terrifying but I don't know how you could say that that could make you black-pilled. I mean my god like the some sort of hope not necessarily that something better is going to happen but that something different is going to happen then you assuming that it will have to be worse. I'm sorry. No one can know that you can only convince yourself that you know that to give yourself permission to keep doing what you think you want to do once again talking about myself so with that.

I say not so long because like I'll be back not next week not this wednesday. But I think next wednesday. I'll I'll oh man on twitter sorry. I will announce what book what if I'm gonna do black reconstruction or something like tomorrow. I think and know how I'm gonna. I don't know how long we're gonna do it but but that'll be my only tweet and um but on friday. We'll We'll do a hangout stream and we'll just talk talk you. Guys can ask questions and chill but yeah the the I'm not. I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here. I got. I got to sit down and I'm not going to reinvent what you know. I'm not going to reinvent the wheel by writing either whatever. I'm writing is going to be just a shard. A sliver of insight hopefully and craft fingers crossed and quality maybe but it will be of good. It will be of great use to me to do it and hopefully fingers crossed. It'll be of use to some of the people who read it yeah.

We could do a state coins well. We're not we already did the state coins we could do something else though those are fun all right. I don't know how long it's been but that's about that's it's not. That's I got through everything. I wanted to say. I hope it made sense. I hope people don't think well. It doesn't really matter what people think. I just gotta do gotta do what you gotta do all right folks peace.
