Up and I will say have you kept your eyes your eyes on went downtown and caught in the gun. So don't shoot you shoot that thing don't shoot you shoot that thing at me you know you got my sympathy but don't shoot you shoot that thing at me. Don't you shoot that thing at me don't you shoot shoot that thing at me you know you got my sympathy but don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me hello. Everybody. Ah first time long time well tip of the cap to you sir or madam although let's be real. Let's let's just look at the demographics where to cop honestly.

I don't know. I got it on ebay. I think it might be original and if it's if it is a knockoff. I don't think they make a lot of best part about this by the way honestly no no joke better than all the stuff on it. You know this look at that lighting h . Just a nice. How often do you see this kind of kind of nice orange. I feel like orange is a good color for me. I might start wearing more orange yeah. This is legitimately I mean probably the most expensive clothes piece of clothing. I've ever purchased in my life 100. It wasn't that much either but I generally buy my clothes when I lived near kroger. I bought my pants and stuff at kroger because they had good selection and it was where I was getting my my groceries one-stop shop and I have like 500 and my top is generally just. I have 500 different old navy shirts that all cost three dollars and yes slave labor all of it but this puppy I haven't. I have a mic plugged in not good how's that it's not good because sometimes it doesn't connect turn. The volume up is that better okay good. I sound fine yes. It was made by the prisoners of conair. This thing yeah. I just grew up from a place where you wouldn't want to spend a lot of clothing on money on clothing.

It just wasn't done. Maybe girls but certainly not guys. I don't know what girls were doing. It was mysterious realm oh man matt carp. I would like to do an episode I've been wanting to talk to him on the show about a benjamin butler for a while who I think is a fascinating figure so benjamin butler before the civil war was a was a northern democrat. Like in the doe face mold. He was a he was a guy who was part of the the urban machinery in massachusetts of the democracy of van buren and jackson's democracy that was broadly up until the very end of the sectional crisis all about turning the other way towards slavery turning a blind eye towards slavery in exchange for the support of the southern tier which was largely was was hegemonically democratic at that point so they didn't like rocking the boat on slavery. They didn't much care for abolitionists either and then he became a politically appointed general meaning. He was not a career officer. He was a guy who had political influence and was got a commission in the union military due to that connection and that was a common feature of both armies and then he was one of the first general one of the first union generals to free slaves in places where his forces took command. ahead of the emancipation proclamation had to he he actually had to be reprimanded for doing it But it was a war measure. It was like we need pitches. We need ditches doug. We need x y and c here's some slave for slaves well. Now they work for us perfect It wasn't really ideological but it was in advance of policy which at that point was to not spook. The border states by freeing slaves where they were found.

The other guy incidentally who did that and got in trouble for it was john c fremont who had been the republican who is the kind of free boutonniere like a professional adventurer who had been the republican nominee in 1956 and then butler ended up being the governor of a military governor of new orleans. Once it was occupied during which time he was so outrageous to the good people. The fine upstanding society types of new orleans that his picture was emblazoned on the bottom of chamber pots so that people could literally on his face and they called him the beast and also spoons because he was alleged to have stolen the hell out of property from a lot of the big plantations and and and home families if we and by the way he did and good who cares Also he passed a proclamation that said that any southern woman any new orleans woman who did not pay proper respect to union soldier on the street. Like because a lot of them were cursing the yankee troops and of course you know getting away with it because they were women and at that time you know even a soldier could not even raise his voice to a woman in public and so butler declared that any woman who did not respect a union soldier in the city of new orleans would be treated as a prostitute as in could be you know accosted and taken to jail and so that's and then he after the war. This is a really interesting part is that the experience of fighting the war radicalized him the way it did a lot of people. He's just sort of a most the most prominent example of someone who was radicalized by the experience of fighting the war. He started the war as a as a northern doe face who like a lot for who who for like him for a lot of those guys didn't really care about slavery but for whom breaking up. The union was just non-negotiable which was also true of stephen douglas like who's the exemplar of that tendency within the party. At the very end and then he go. He fights the war and comes out a radical republican and he was a radical republican member of congress after the war who who pushed very hard for black equality and in fact coined the phrase the bloody shirt to by holding up an actual bloody shirt of someone who'd been attacked by by a red shirt redeemer in the reconstruction south as a county against the democrats. Although it wasn't really accountable because they were in fact doing that and then condoning it all across the south but a very fascinating figure and his career I think like speaks to it speaks to just how much of a if a furnace of change of a hot house. The 1860s were in this country. The way that social ferment was the way that the social the glacier social tectonics just sort of liquefied like you would have during an earthquake yeah. James longstreet became a republican after the war which is why he's not very heavily featured in lost cause.

Pikachu charge wasn't going to work because it wasn't 1812 anymore you dumb hick yeah. He was a he was a he was he was a scalawag not a carpetbagger. It's amazing I remember learning about reconstruction and that was just the name of the chapter. It's like okay. So these are the scumbags who came to the south and it up after the civil war. These are the traitors to their people among the whites These are the among the locals and these are the the cr. The crooked yankee interlopers from the north yeah 1867 project why not keeping it 1867. Robert lafollette I only really know anything about him because he's from wisconsin he's sort of our our our our long family is the la fallace and they are base basically like the scrubbed-up middle-class version of the longs whereas populism but you know let's not get too crazy. It's populism for college professors which is why one of the big components of the wisconsin idea that la follette championed was a very very lavishly funded public higher education system which is one of the reasons that until recently I don't know what it has been under walker but until recently the uw system is one of the best state university systems in the country but they've been taking a pickaxe to it obviously for years and walker really accelerated oh god these obama taking a vaccine. How many of them would think that that was real what reason would they give especially when we have videotape of barf sacko crumbo himself at flint after the water crisis was unveiled taking a big dramatic pull on a glass of flint tap water that in fact what's this oh he's not he's not wrong he's only known about that. But no he's definitely taking the vaccine that they put through you know in under they they he's gonna take the vaccine that was rushed through development and you could say well yeah mostly that just means removing bureaucratic hurdles.

Yes still still you think they're taking that chance honestly if they are. It's because there's already been a rich person cure for months if not always if it wasn't a bio weapon. I'm not saying it was. But it's not out of the realm of possibility. I mean how the hell does chuck grassley not even get symptoms. The man is 87 years old yeah. It's hard not to see all the vaccine. Jackals just priming the pump a little bit little bursts. The dog is barking again. Dog didn't used to bark this much maybe. It's new or maybe. It's colder. I don't know rupert murdoch is buying twitch. Amazon's selling twitch to fox well not fox because disney owns fox. I guess news corp that's crazy oh thank you for saying. My streams are the best oh god. We did watch a vengeance. I can't believe somebody is bringing up a vengeance. It's this british crime movie that was that's on netflix we. I watched it with felix and will one of the funniest things I've seen in a while It's one of the most british things I've seen in a while.

That's for sure. I mean I'll probably take the vaccine who am I going to lie about. I mean. It's just like when the when does. Anyone realistically think that's going to happen in such a time in in terms of returning to some sort of normality that people are craving like what is the time frame there because it seems like we really don't have the infrastructure or the public trust to carry out any kind of large-scale vaccination program that could I mean. I used to think well fine you know then you'll take it or you won't but apparently that doesn't it doesn't work that way. Apparently you actually need people to take it on a large scale in order to get the results in terms of infection transmission reduction that would facilitate reopening so fine that's not happening then it would be interesting if like the vaccine like mandating vaccine. You use becomes a political issue beyond just a culture war one and you see you know. I get apparently what ben wants to do and this is not very hard to imagine all right not biden. I forgot somebody else maybe it was yang. I don't know I honestly think this is what the london doing some sort of financial incentive to get people to take it like 75. According to a poll say they'll take it but even if that's true and who knows is that enough one and two how do you get 75 of the people to get the vaccine in this country.

I'm not going to stop the streams to do the book because I got to read a lot first. I can't just start writing it now and I want to go. I want to do it as a little book club oh by the way I've decided I am going to start reading to the republic which is sand which is the oxford english or it's. The oxford american history volume on that era and it's been very well reviewed and it's a good baseline to block build off and I'll probably talk about it on the stream. Here. If people want to read along they can. It's called to the the republic for which it stands and it's about the reconstruction era but also the gilded age like the whole thing thwarted together. Then we can I'm gonna read fauna after that. I would love to give people pizza coupons for reading like book it. I remember book it. You get the little book and it was easy for me because I was a little nerd. I loved reading so.

I would go down there and get my little personal pan on the weekly. Somebody asked for my what my take is on the kiev and ruse and I think that's just funny because that's just such a hilarious question if you think about it like kevin roose. What do you think scrappy hustlers the guys they wanted it. More you can tell. I don't know I'm wrong about domino's super thin crust. freight you are wrong sir so domino's super saiyan trust is delicious. I did like those little tiny pizzas oh make looser tiny pizzas oh and I wanted to also give my final take now on fargo having watched the last full season which hilariously is one episode longer than every other season close. The door on this whole idea. The tv is is the thing you should care about and for anything other than just pure entertainment read a book because man the the olympian contempt for the audience. That's in that show pretty breathtaking. And if you're going to say that that's good why wouldn't they have contempt for you. You know. I did watch queen's gambit. It is a show a story about a a gamer girl and her sims. I mean. I'm not the only one to have said that but it's very hard to see it any other way. It's like an idealized version of of the relationship between a a gamer a lady gamer and her sims coming together not in a spirit of competition but cooperative and a cooperative endeavor to to stand here do.

I have allergies weird question but yes right. I got hay fever and then I got a pine nut allergy that's developed in my like 30s too which is very odd because one day I went made a pine nut my mouth started tingling very weird. It does inhibit my bistro salad options. It's true and pesto. I always have to when I when there's pesto on the menu I have to make sure that there's not pine nuts in it and actually a lot of time there aren't because pine nuts are pretty expensive so a lot of times they cheap out. Put almonds in there or something is that true that game of thrones got rome cancelled because if that's true that's kind of poetic justice because rome got deadwood cancelled because rome was going to have a huge budget and they essentially said we'd rather spend it on these. These roman sets than on the deadwood set and then they just shot poor david milch's horse in the head much like the horses whose heads they shot during this filming of luck and so if it's true that then that's like hey sorry we're making we're making middle.

Earth sets you gotta go so. It makes sense that they would get rid of rome that way. I mean roma's I only watched the first season. I didn't really like it that much the only character. I found really compelling every time they were on. Screen was caesar and so when they killed him. I was like why do. I have to watch the second season. I don't like octavian is a little piss ant him also apparently. In the second season. They collapsed the timeline of like the whole like to collapse the triumvirate and like the war the first the war the civil war was like octavian or I mean with brutus and and mark anthony and then the war between octavian and mark anthony and cleopatra whatever.

I had to work in a hard science what would I pick well. I would be a janitor that because I don't my brain doesn't work that way if my brain did work that way. I think it's physics. Physics seems because it's the most like but not the math thing. I can't do math so. There's the whole thing goes apart what's the one where you don't have to do math. I don't know yeah. It's all math no thanks yeah. I mean I've got my mor. I've got the immortal science of course of course. I have the immortal science but that doesn't require any math beyond. cmc music factory. Somebody's had to have had that as a twitter name right cmc music factory disgusting all right. I'm pissed at it and I don't even know if it exists. It's too bad that all the cool 19th century sciences aren't aren't around anymore like I would love to be a phrenologist that sounds wonderful have a chart with a bunch of bumps and be like ah okay. Let me just take this I put here in the hemisphere. Here. This is this corresponds to shiftlessness and easy those body angle body language experts seem like they're having a good time handwriting analysis. That's another good one that's still around that's not real what is my most prominent humor.

I think it's phlegmatic. I gotta be honest with myself. I think I'm phlegmatic phlegmatic. There you go how do you there's no g and phlegmatic up phlegmatic see you're saying oh. It's like phlegm flem doesn't have a g right but quixote is pronounced quixotic so just the fact that that's the thing it's coming from doesn't mean. That's how you're supposed to say it. No it's quixotic. I've been. I've been gasoline on that it is not quite. I'm sorry have. I read eduardo galliano. I've read nazi poets in the americas which was good but that's it. I haven't read 20 60 66 or anything or no that's bolano. No. I have not read melania. That's a different guy. I'm trying to keep my humors I'm trying to keep my humors balanced like to be sanguine though. I think that's the best one evola. That's a weird question evola the only thing. I like the thing that I'm a mute the thing that I think about when I think of vivola is that he would during the during the allied bombing raids of rome he would go for walks out. During them. You know as some sort of defiance or you know ritualized confrontation with death and chance. Whatever the hell was going on in his head and then one time he got around and he found out.

I think that's pretty funny one of my thoughts on tom lehrer. I mean there's something very endearing about the idea of a guy who became a huge political musical satirist a job that doesn't really exist anymore while also being a math savant and a professor and astoundingly he's alive. He's alive still he's like 95. Amazing although when I listen to those like I listen to wernher von braun or something or we'll all go together when you go and you watch a youtube video. And it's it's him in front of an audience and there's all these polite. These polite liberals in suits with very thin ties you can just imagine the ties even if you can't see them all chuckling and I just think man that audience would have been absolutely insufferable. What historical figure would have the best podcast that's interesting hmm well there would have to be a rock on tour of course. I'd have to have I mean obviously an answer that comes up well historical figure. Not really.

That's not really a strong figure. How many historic how many like non how many historical figures. I mean what contemporary historical figures have have podcasts frank ben franklin is a good answer churchill's would just be like like anthony kumias. Eventually I think I gotta say people talk about like oh mark should be good on. Twitter marks would be good with podcast. I think about how much he loved getting into arguments and I just think. I'm so glad he was not because even if there is it was someone with his like you know combination of insight and then you know critical faculties and everything and articulation of ability. If they went online. They would get their brain turned into soup immediately by trying to you know fight it out trying to time to trying to make the args pop. Now when he but you know he was doing it in a context where like the working-class movement was literally being born around him and so there was a real reason that he needed to be incredibly strident in denouncing people who were filled with and their prescriptions were bad. Nixon would have been a great podcast talk about anthony kumia holy mackerel.

Most interesting cult okay now we're talking I mean um. Shinrikyo is fascinating on a million levels just how big it got how deeply it penetrated a japanese mass culture. I mean the guy was a regular the guy shok ashihara the head. The the head of shinrikyo was a regular late night talk show guest he was. He was like He was like like paul rudd on on conan o'brien. Like he would come out and he'd show the clip from mac and me. they had compounds all over japan and one in the outback of australia. They had they purchased soviet surplus military equipment including helicopters. They manufactured machine guns. They of course had the sarin they might have been pursuing the purchase of or construction of a nuclear weapon. They had an astounding amount of of actual practical scientific know-how because they could they recruited so heavily among among scientists and it was commercialized. The guy sold his bath water and vials. He sold a spaghetti strainer. You could put on your head that would give you the same thoughts as shoko shahara amazing yeah and then when you think about the fact that it all kind of blew up. I mean they were planning to create a nuclear war. They were essentially like spiritual. They were. They were like eastern passatists coming at it from the other side cleansing the earth and then rising from a nuclear fire then rising from the ashes and they ended up doing this. Tokyo subway attack as a distraction because they were about to get raided by the cops eventually and finally after they just ignored them doing insane murders for years. Partially because there were police officers and people in the justice department whatever they want to call it who were who were high level and also members of the group.

It's astounding. So whenever I think of an interesting cult just in terms of its complexity. It's it's it's structure and it's it's ambition and amish enrique is up there and I don't know who it was but somebody pointed out that the case of the case if you wanted to like shariko is essentially what people claimed al qaeda was like omishima riccio in its capacity and its intent were what the western media after 9 11 claimed al. Qaeda was in terms of its sophistication of its structures and its ability to access weaponry and and and up to and including chemical and biological and perhaps nuclear. also an army of totally loyal and willing acolytes with a goal of world destruction that was that was that was al qaeda in the western imagination and yet it was essentially destroyed as a threat by arresting a bunch of people meanwhile al-qaeda which was never anything like omg marico as a threat becomes the the focal point of a new foreign policy but of course that's because it was a lie it was a new. It was a new guiding principle of the eternal war economy that needed a new narrative justification after the fall of the soviet union. The south korean cult very interesting yeah the the south korean president was was overthrown. In a like a democratic. It was almost like a democratic coup. It was it was it was a mass demonstrations that forced a abdication of power outside of the structures of government because of the relationship between the korean president who was the daughter of the last korean dictator who was killed by his own security chief in the blue house. I believe and was also in the thrall of this this cult. I don't know much about it because it's very korea specific but it's it's it's astounding how how deeply entwined that ruling dynasty was with with a a family of religious grifters. But I don't know how you know big. The group was or how sophisticated or how ambitious their things were beyond getting money because the thing that really brought them down was you know that they were just gobs of money were going to this group falun gong as japanese or as falun gong as chinese.

Q anon is actually probably a pretty good comparison although of course it's much much much more sophisticated socially and powerful and influential because dealing with more people and tighter communities because it's very popular in like immigrant communities and it's also cia funded which maybe q anon is. A lot of people want to think humanon is an op but the thing about a lot of the stuff that people assume is just conspiracies and is behind you know being manipulated behind the scenes. None of it to me reads as anything other than a symptom of the system. We have like q anon to me the argument that it started from a poster. I mean it makes sense and I think the thing that really matters is that we live in a world where the actual way things turn out and the way they would turn out if they were being manipulated by an illuminati-like reptile overlord class is identical and that's because the conspiracies we generate the narratives we generate are just an attempt to give an articulation and a mind's eye concept of the thing that's happening right in front of our eyes which is full capitalist miseration over over our over coming every aspect of life and to me. That is that is the important thing and that is why I try to remain aloof from real debates about the truth or falseness of specific theories of 

You know conspiracy or or deep state involvement in one or another element of of anything because if it's true or not we have the same task whether it's true or not. We have the same task. It is to build new institutions that can reflect organized power and that's true whether the whether all of whether the the web is is a spook in the Whether the web and and all of our online argumentation and all of our seemingly insurmountable cultural conflicts are spooks in the sternarine sense or spooks in the espionage sense. Either way the answer is the same and the reason that that matters is because you're not going to ever know you're never going to know and more importantly than that even if you did know what would you do with the information.

There's a reason that every conspiracy narrative ends with a court scene a courtroom scene of some kind whether it's q anon whether it's jfk whether it's q anon imagined military tribunals and eventually one day show trials. They always promise are going to be over the horizon or I just rewatched the end of x-files. The original last two episodes that concluded the show in 2002 and it ends with a trial mulder on trial like the conspiracy.

The the happy ending of every conspiracy movie is is a is some sort of trial or testimony before a senate committee or something because the underlying assumption is with the conspiracy theory as conspiracy theory. As practice is that if enough people know then that will change something but all that we're learning from conspiracy theory is a narrative articulation of the thing that's happening right in front of our faces and that we're not doing anything about now the task that you're imagining is going to be carried out by this consciousness. Raising about specific bad actors is actually your attempt to imagine a class project a an attempt to imagine real politics a second way as I said to challenge the existing one and that will not come in the form of appeals to institutions within the that are embedded within like courts in the media because they all they take everything that is shocking and horrifying and monstrous and that leave us with a blood curdling sense of our helplessness before a system of total rapidity and turn it banal and turn it into received. Wisdom turn it into a thing that everybody knows and then we just move on with our lives.

Everybody knows that the game everybody knows the war is over everybody knows. The good guy is lost. Everybody knows dice are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed right. Now the fight is fixed the rich the poor stay poor. The rich stay rich featured prominently in the classic. Christian slater film pump up the volume which is about a proto podcaster. A young ham radio enthusiast who scandalizes his small town by exposing the petty hypocrisy of the of the worthies of the city and of the school board. It really is like a model it's like the it's the media model of change that we all have internalized at some point in which I know. I have of you get on that microphone and you tell the people the truth and they hear enough truth and they just have to do something about it. I think that's what undergirds everybody at some romantic level when they carry out the the the goal of of a media project how good is alex jones in the link letter movie.

I have to say I saw waking life as a kid. It blew my mind obviously and the the scene where alex jones was just hollering into that microphone in the car. His head's turning into a fireball. It was incinerated incendiary and just to think that now he'd end up just like trying to get a republican president reelected unbelievable. I have I have tried to re-watch waking life like later after I got older and I was like holy. This is not good wow wow I am a little embarrassed but you know hey we're dumbasses when we're kids for the most part. Maybe you weren't but I sure as hell was. I was a dumbass still am just slightly maybe less in certain ways god if trump pardons gizelle and maxwell if trump pardons gizelle maxwell as his last act out the door just as a final smoke bomb of cognitive dissonance oh my god. I would die laughing because I mean nothing's gonna happen anyway at least that would be funny.

I mean q is already branching off you're seeing it already richard. Jewell's lawyer in georgia is calling on that phillips lady sydney phillips and michael flynn to run for president on like a election integrity q platform and I mean. I don't know what'll come of any of that my guess is people will lose interest and come back into the fold. The way they always end up doing because doing anything other is too hard and we just don't have the investment in anything other than the the minimum amount of of just spectacle indulgence meaning what to watch and maybe voting but not not the hard work of like creating a new political movement. But I've said before and I think might be true. You might see a return to quietism politically among some of these q people because if you see trump lose the election even though he won it right even though this was huge fraud even though we have the servers after the shootout in germany and he still is replaced by biden unless you want to believe that he's not actually not president anymore which some of them will think the rest of them or a good chunk of them. Anyway. I think are going to be realized oh okay. I'm not. I still believe in q and all this other stuff.

I still believe there's a plan but it is not a political plan. It doesn't involve the parties and it doesn't involve voting because look what that is and that would be funny if that happened. But I think that more likely people are going to get more politicized over time because of how much conditions are going to deepen into immigration like I'm saying. Not apocalyptically. It'll just be the same but worse but but but worse has a compounding effect politically over time and one of the things that the worst does is. It makes culture more politically infused. It makes it harder to have a political culture and of course. There's no such thing as a political culture but I mean political culture does not have a specific partisan bent a specific democrat republican branding and that we we talked on the show about or I talked to felix recently about um how game of thrones was like the last large-scale long-term cultural product that did not have a partisan political branding to it.

Towards the end it became about hillary's slay queen stuff but for a long time there it was the last sort of a political cultural product that people could care about now everything comes out branded and that means that if you're going to engage in culture which even if you don't care about politics now you do have to do because what else are you going to do what else is there to do all there is to do is engage at this level. Everything else is every other area of self-expression is is denied us or even sucker is denied us unless you want to just kill yourself with fentanyl and that means that the political branding is going to adhere to people as they engage with politics or as they engage with culture and I may be. The only ones who will be able to withstand. A a quiet disposition are the ones who turn it into a religion who who don't need the political investment because they have transformed all of their their psychic pain into a a religious narrative spiritual personal narrative for which there is no need to even reference politics other than as a tapestry to to to examine.

I don't know I'm not one of them. We'll see. There is no more christian right. That's not a coherent thing like the republican party is white evangelicals. But those things are so tightly wound together now that there's not really a distinguishing point where you can say christian right. It's just it's like all that stuff has been sacralized which is why a lot of religious leaders by the way in the 70s were wary about becoming political. It was this exact outcome that they were avoiding like if you had shown if you've been able to show a space a robot if you'd been able to send a robot back in time to like that that ramada in suite where all of the pastors got together to set up the moral majority and you showed them donald trump in 2016 and said this guy's going to be president thanks to you and like the political culture that you've helped create I some of them would be fine with it but a lot of them would not have been I bet billy. Graham would not have been and that's not because they were good people. It's because they had standards of decorum that had not been degraded by the 40 years that happened after that moment.

There's nothing christian. There's nothing uniquely christian about it is what I mean. It is the it's the political project for the republican party that they are the same thing. There's no christian. It's a redundancy like the christian right was supposed to be like separate from some other right. It's like no there's they're suffused because anything that would have conflicted with the broader right project in christianity has been jettisoned from christianity.

What's my favorite great lake michigan that's the one I grew up next to. I grew up in a lakeside town. Manitowoc is right on lake michigan. I lived are you a mile from the beach. It doesn't matter that amy comey barrett is an occult. What does this have to do with anything you're talking about like weird personal practices. It's like you might as well tell me that like antonin scalia was a gamer. It doesn't matter. I'm the manager mall is. But when I was a kid I mean that place had like three stores in it when I was a kid.

I would see movies. I would watch movies where kids would go to the mall and there would be escalators and there would be food courts and all this stuff and I would just be stunned because our mall really did feel like some eastern black. Jc penny that was near the that was near the water tower that was prominently featured in making a murderer. Why do I say. Missouri is the south well. It's got the ozarks and it had slavery until 1860 or 1863. I mean what does the south mean if not a slave-based economy. Like that's. The that was what the distinction ended up building like the cultural and political distinction that that brewed into the central crisis was about a mode of production. Maryland's the south too jfk famously said about dc that it had northern hospitality and southern efficiency.

I have no idea delaware to me is not a real place. I mean it is it exists on paper to to launder money. Delaware is just part of like a little chunk of pennsylvania that they just carved off so that you could you couldn't have to pay taxes and you could charge. Your users rates on in on credit cards. I'm not bad sleepy. I'm just a little sleepy. There's three counties in delaware that still seems like two too many why why would what kind of what pretentious asshole's like yeah. No we have to subdivide this further. You you should be.

Here's the size of a county in a normal sized state get out of here how can a billionaire be lumping I think that I think that we I think the republican party is at top the party of lump and billionaires and the way you can be a lump in billionaire is you're a olympic billionaire who does not have a class consciousness who is not operating out of a self-conscious desire to see the broad advancement of his class which is very hard to get and you kind of have to be america to create that kind of thing and we did it and the battle at the top between the democrats and republicans is broadly between these lumping billionaires local like the small business billionaires and they're like mini versions of them that stack down through the countries like you'll you'll have some middle of nowhere town that will have like a in in in tennessee or something and it will have a plant that will be owned by a guy or they'll be like a fracking company owned by some other guy and then there'll be like local like vassals of that guy who own all the chick-fil-as and or chick-fil-a's en franchise own all the mcdonald's or own all the the popeyes and then there's or that's not franchised either. I don't think never mind whatever all the restaurants boat dealerships. It's a strata of rich people who think that they're operating within an economy of in where they are for looking out for themselves. Whereas the democrats at the top are controlled by a self-consciously internationalized finance capital that sees itself as part of a global project and the thing is is that those lumpen billionaires are part of the same project. They just aren't aware of it because they are have been spending their time on that grind extraction industries. Things like that and the other problem is is that their short-term interests are in conflict in a lot of ways with the interests of that financialized global capitalism that the democrats represent and that's where you get the any the only real conflict. The only real sparks between the parties is that conflict picati talks about this mike. Davis has talked a lot about this like the merchants as like the merchant class the lump in what rich versus sort of the class conscious financial wealth like trump's support like trump's big dollar. Donors for the most part are banks or or bankers. They are like the koch brothers or the mercers. They're they're they're they're they're involved in extraction.

The short-term you know turning over of commodities tom steyer. I hope is made secretary of keeping it real because that guy he's got sauce and I want to see him spray it all over the place. It's the rich. It's the It's finance and silicon valley and entertainment against extraction and small and medium manufacturing and and and all and all that my pillow guy is a perfect example yankees versus cowboys. All the difference is that this is what happens when the cowboys fully take over because reagan's revolution was supposed to bring the cowboys into power but only at the level of culture at the ba. At the top level they capitulated to the rockefeller wing completely. They then they sold that to the regular americans but now you know 40 years later 40 years of capillary movement of of people through the political system. It's now captured and the the election of trump is just an expression of like the the broader political culture created by that party and that's why there are some people who say like if you want to bet on revolutionary potential.

If you want to bid on anti-capitalist. Specifically potential. You got to go with the republicans over the democrats but these people are still billionaires. They still want a working class that is hyper exploited and powerless. They have that same in desire they just disagree about like whether or not that could be carried out through like protective tariffs or or free trade or whatever that's the that's the actual distinction and you could say but but that means that we should support them in their free trade. One you can't support anybody that's not real like this. All the idea that you can make alliances with anybody in the system is fraudulent because there's no no one represents anybody but themselves so you cannot. No one can say that we can do anything. There's no we in any of this and then even when it is expressed like when trump expresses it. It's just like look at the trade war with china. What did that do for the american worker and there's nothing in that republican party that could generate anything more effective on behalf of that lump and billionaire.

 cowboy class then what trump has done I mean and the big thing for me is both. Parties now have a vested interest in heightening conflict with china and nobody more than the cowboys. Nobody more than these lumping billionaires that josh hawley is now trying to channel like a houdini in a seance and and so since nobody's no americans real interests are served by ratcheting tensions with china and that is going to be the actual coherent expression of any hostility to global finance. We're seeing it already marsha blackburn today 5 000 years of profanity from the heathen celestial. These guys are banging the anti-china drum that's not going to help anybody and that's all it could be is to help this project of revenge's idiocy where we're going to blame the chinese for our inability to deal with the coronavirus um matt stoller's end game. Like all these guys end game is some sort of confrontation with china that has to at some point sharpen into some military element because we're the we're the biggest military in the world and there are geostrategic questions in china or in in asia and like the makeup of our political class is going to determine in some degree our military response to that and all you're going to get out of this you know lumpin rich reactionary hostility to the totalizing mission of world.

Capitalism is a war with china congratulations. Great great work no war with china cooperation with the chinese against the ruling classes of both countries like I'm saying mid-level officers of the of the people's liberation army and the us military start. Some whatsapps send tick tocks back and forth get talking and the other and of course. The real hilarious part of that is that that war with china is not necessarily something that the global finance at least in the form of the democratic party. As like a as a political gambit is going to be that opposed to either did you see how quickly democrats started yelling about china as soon as biden won things keep getting worse. China's gonna take more of the blame from both parties so there you go there's your big conflict at the top of the parties creating the same dynamic. The same ratchet congratulations all right guys. I'm packing.

Apparently the video is lagging. I'm sorry. I have no ability to control that hopefully the audio will be good by itself. If you want to just listen. It will be put on itunes and spotify. I know people have been asking if we stop doing that we are still doing it. I think it just comes in batches so sometimes it'll be a little bit of delay before they all get there but they are still being uploaded and then you can watch them without having to be annoyed that my lips are moving differently all right. I'm going bye-bye lincoln lives baby.
