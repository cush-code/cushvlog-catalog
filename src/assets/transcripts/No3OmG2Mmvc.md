Foreign just about a year ago. I went out on the road seeking for fame and fortune looking for a particle. Things got bad things got worse. I guess you know the tune oh lord. I'm stuck in a low die again rolling on a greyhound. I'll be walking out if I go. I was just passing through must be seven months or more. I ran out of time and money looks like my plans fell through oh lord. I'm stuck in low die again. I should probably do this button don't want to be too erotic out here.

So today we'll be talking about the first three chapters of blackjack which is a terribly enjoyable book and very well read. James is a great pro stylist which is pretty rare among historians and you got to give it up when you find it. It seems like there are a lot of the sweet spot really does seem like the 30s for a lot of that like really pros. Poem prose poetic history where it's like you know you're getting you're getting a synthesis you're not getting. You know an academic treatise but you are getting also a work of literature and I would put this among here another book that I would recommend for anybody who wants to read something like that is cv. Wedgewood's book on the 30 years war just delightful incredibly easy to read and that's difficult with the with which this with this sort of history like reconstruction for example reconstruction is a great book but you know.

Fauna is he is trying to build like this this house of evidence you know and like stack up this narrative. It's more workmanlike whereas this is more frankly artistic which is something that's gotten squeezed out of history honestly as it's become more and more specialized and professionalized. You know the creation of the academy as such especially the neoliberal academy. The the academy of you know constant production in order to get 

These few signatures cinecures senecures. It's it's. It leads you to the point where you're just. You're just pointing at things or you're just throwing out words that you know people want to hear two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve all right. We might kick that one around a little bit yeah all right. So we'll probably do we'll do the next three for next week same time wednesday. No no we won't be doing it wednesday next tuesday probably that'll be the next three chapters so the first chapter of James's book which was written in 1939 8 as I said and another thing that distinguishes it as a product of that time.

In addition to its pro style is the fact that james is clearly operating in in a polemic mode. He's trying to use explicitly use the story of the haitian revolution creating a historic narrative you know conjuring a a vision of this thing that did happen in the moment of colonial the first inklings of colonial upheaval in the periphery. After because world war one like fatally wounded the empires of europe but it took world war two to to doom them finally and in that inner war period was when you saw the first real explosion of coordinated anti-imperial activism in the in the empire and clr. James is from trinidad which is part of the british empire and he wrote this book as an explicit parallel for the times and he is. He is several points in the book analogizes the slaves of sandoming to the restive african and asian and latin american subjects of the european imperial system and that their task was the same that the haitian slaves was that they were to complete the historical mission begun by the haitian slaves and that the context of the incipient war in europe that was that was on the horizon for everyone to see would be the cause of that or would be the opportunity like the world.

The the crisis in the in the in the in the capitals of europe that was occurring as hitler was continuing his brinksmanship towards the poland invasion. That is analogous to the conflict. Among the the whites of san domingo and what ended up happening is is along those lines in that it was the war that led to the creation of the first really organized effective military insurgencies against empire and you saw algeria vietnam of course india. Obviously kenya cuba of course and that process did lead to a a a sort of liberation you know but it was the same stunted liberation that the haitians got which is. They were able to secure their independence as a nation among nations but cut off from capital and doomed to be a a client state of more powerful capitalist governments in the things that in the in the the trade system that took over for colonialism and perpetuated the colonial relationship that's what the cold war is. It is the it is western capitalism imposing itself as the post-colonial imperial authority that maintains the maintaining the relationship. The economic relationship between the periphery and the metropoles of the old empires that are no longer affordable that had to be gotten rid of and haiti got that haiti got independence but it was cut off from all trade to the united states which refused to recognize it until the civil war forced to pay billions of dollars billions with a b in reparations to france for the for committing the crime of self-liberation because they could because france could do that and the post-colonial third world became a place where every country was a haiti in that they had independence formally within this nation-state formation. But then they were still stuck in the capitalist structure and forced to to trade on the capitalism's demands which means cheap goods to the center labor. Difficult painful labor extractive labor to the ex to the periphery relatively milder labor and surplus from the periphery to the center that relationship was perpetuated by the global brenton wood system that was imposed after the war because the west could do it because russians stopped fighting and allowed them to dictate terms and doomed the soviet project in the long run unless they were willing to actually fight for it which they weren't um and so as in haiti. You saw the development of instead of a liberated population a a system where a few wealthy families in haiti or able to secure positions as colonial operatics of western capitalism and then operate the extractive economy of haiti with the same coercive mechanisms. That were in operation with the colonial authorities not with the name of slavery anymore but with a similar relationship between the government and its ruling class that backs it and the actual mass of people of haiti and then haitian political history is is is is a story of fights within these concentrations of power broken up occasionally by us military intervention. The united states occupied haiti for I believe it was from the wilson administration until hoover.

I think like 19 I think 19 14 or something until 1931. Someone can correct me on that and that's completely forgotten. No one literally nobody knows that and in the united states like a fraction of a percentage of americans know that or honestly would care if they did you know that's the thing about all this history stuff. It isn't really true that if only people knew it's like they would just process it through their preconceived ideas and what they think they want and then they would get the same answer. It's not the fact that does something it's the fact in context.

It's the narrative built which is what james is trying to do build a narrative that could be persuasive that can carry you through battle. But that occupation as you can imagine was incredibly brutal. Like this is america at the absolute height of its race hatred america's american racism in terms of like as a social. Value reached its absolute apogee in america in the early 20th century because of the stresses of the great migration because race hatred was concentrated in the south because that is where blacks were concentrated and it was the breaking of those geographic bonds and mass entrance of of blacks into urban areas that triggers this this massive explosion of race violence. You had 1919 the red summer which is a series of incredibly bloody race riots that occur all throughout american cities and that is that is the latent racism of a society at that point being put under strain put under pressure and you see this explosion and so you see racism become for the first time.

This nationwide self-conscious pursuit which is why you see the second clan at this point and this is why you have you have the clan running the state government of indiana through the republican party that is how detached from the the traditional regional racial obsession that characterized white society. There had bled out into the whole country and it was a crisis that was fundamentally solved first by as always repressing and policing black enforcing people in the land and in the cities too In order to you know relieve white anxiety because you know they are. They do not have representation in the system and so they can't be used that way without it affecting the decision-making of actual governors because it doesn't matter to them they're not at they're not at hope beholden to them at all. But then what led to this what allowed the civil rights movement to happen and for that racism to kind of push away enough to allow for something. Like the civil rights movement and then the civil rights acts and and formal secret segregation being abolished.

Everywhere were where's the surpluses of the post-war era. It was the good times provided for by the establishment of this global post-colonial structure of oppression. This is all a tangent to say that america's rape most racist army occupying for over a decade the first and only black republic in the western hemisphere. My god it was brutal. It was monstrous. It was it was a it was a government organized lynch mob running a country and then we leave and leave propped up those people who were more committed to the project of being rich than to any national. Any kind of solidarity beyond their own disgusting inbred families which is how you see reproduced in this in the the free slave republic the same social dynamics that existed in the The repu the colony I mean do you think that the the ruling families of haiti have any warmer feelings for the masses of port-au-prince than then the old planters did for the slaves in the field and then we propped up the duvalier family as a literal client. Gang to run the country on our behalf and then when they first and then when and then when aristide gets in there and starts to stabilizing the the power structure and introducing you know regular haitians into politics and changing the equation he had to go. It's amazing we. They think jean-paul air steed was overthrown by. American trained military guys on behalf of the ruling families of haiti. Then we put him back in power.

I think this is because more than anything it triggered a big refugee crisis in florida that was not something that bill. Clinton wanted to see and so they figured we put aristide back in but because we did it he owes us. But then he got too big for his britches again and we kidnapped him. We kidnapped him and dropped him in the central african republic. We claimed that he asked us to do that for him but he says that didn't happen and it's who are you going to believe. I guess you know maybe he's just trying to save face. But even if he didn't it's another case where we just went in there to unilaterally decide who's in charge and now the us-backed president who has been triggering massive street demonstrations for refusing to leave office and is worrying a lot of powerful people in haiti that he might trigger. A revolution gets murked by mercs maybe from miami including fbi informants or are they patsies either way. It seems like and now we have haitians in government asking for american military intervention and the us saying that they're weighing it.

The development plan that the us has made for haiti in the last 20 or so years since they since they since the duvaliers fell really was to intervene enough in haiti to establish the the governmental legitimacy and infrastructure to carry out a process of restructuring around um factory. Labor essentially turn haiti into one of those sweatshop countries in asia which had been prevented by that point because haiti didn't have strong enough really institutions to pull people off the land. I mean they had done a good job of destroying the agricultural sector through the dumping of american subsidized agriculture into the thing same thing they did in mexico and elsewhere to destroy their domestic agricultural sector. But it was hard to get a private investment to into the kind of capital intensive. Capital intensive operations that you would need to um that you would need to actually get a lot of labor out of that haiti's urban slum population It was. There wasn't enough infrastructure around it to make that a a decent investment and so the un and the clinton foundation has spent the last few decades trying to proletarianize the the lumpin population of port-au-prince but you got to figure even if the us doesn't invade haiti.

This moment allows for some sort of transition of power that everyone can cross their fingers and hope will tamper down the the anger in the streets and maybe it will. I mean that's what that's why we have elections is to get people riled up and then have their their pent up anger released through the emotional spectacle of a changing of power like you have to do it if you don't do it. Eventually they overthrow you you lose the mandate of heaven unless you have a little fake change every four or eight years or after somebody gets shot in their bed okay. So this is all back.

I'll bringing us back to the first chapter of the black jackets which is about the experience of being a slave in french. Sandoman and his main James main goal here is to give you a true sense of the horror of it of the genuine of the misery that it inflicted on humans and and that and the misery that that that then shaped the culture around that um and part of the thing that makes it so brutal is how james repeatedly highlights the fact that shorn of the mystifications that you'd have in a bourgeoisie like developed country like england or even france at that point where of course you have brutality you have brutal class segregation and you have oppression and filth and misery.

But there is also a there is a ritual around it. You know there are rituals of obligation around it that cloud everything and that make it feel more more consensual because it is because people have like a shared experience that makes them invest in the world around them. Even the parts that are serving their oppression because they don't they can't recognize the difference that is how we build our consciousness. It's not that the reason false consciousness is an incorrect. Term is that it implies there is such thing as a true consciousness. There's not false consciousness is just a shortcoming from when that consciousness which is always false is false in a way that hinders class consciousness because class consciousness is also false in that you're picking a group of people to to identify with psychically that is fundamentally arbitrary.

But it's arbitrary in a way that moves the wheel of history because we're all just guessing and being pushed towards outcomes by the grinding of the gears of history. That's it so for james because colonial plantation agriculture is capitalism shorn of all of its attendant mysteries you get the purest expression of material interests of people operating from a belief only in their own most selfish intelligent conception of pleasure because the thing about the thing that distinguishes plantation slavery most of all from capitalism as it was being carried out in like the burgeoning merchant capitals of europe and north america oh. I completely people are really talking about whether or not haiti should become a state. Oh brother they would never do that because they're trying to do it at the minimum of cost they're trying to and then standing the place up as a sweatshop is the lowest capital input. It costs way too much to make a state. I was saying something about what the fundamental difference between those two forms of capitalism were but then I just lost it oh.

This is it is that capital is not reinvested when the merchants of the cities of boston and london when they met profit on a venture. They maybe had a nice duck that they put some towards the building of a new part of their house. But the majority of it they reinvested and that is what builds capital intensity in the cities and that's what builds the infrastructure of capitalism like factories and and and and you know gives the people who come from the countryside to the city. A put a place to go and a way to be productive is capital reinvestment in slave in plantation agriculture that capital is spent. They just spend it because there's no need to invest at a certain level. You got the land you got the slaves. If you have sugar you have the sugar processing facilities which are relatively high investment but for like indigo or a cotton plantation or rice. You've got a couple of buildings basically and you are not You're not a corporation. You're just a guy you're just a guy and you probably honestly are in a lot of debt. So all your money goes through repaying your debt and then spending it on fancy fancy gloves and and wines a way to create the illusion of civilization in a place where you're just sitting in a dark field forcing someone to work for you and that consumption rice is more complicated because it is more labor intensive but remember if you have slave labor. The that's a different cost dynamic.

It's not as capital intensive is what I meant and so that is why you have the colonial that's why colonial and then slave places are more backwards less developed morse just savage and the culture that they produce is more savage and that is because everybody here is just living by their material in the narrowest sense desi interests and of course. That's why they were destroyed. That's why the slaves were able to defeat them because they were everyone was operating out of this base material interest and at the end of the day there were too many slaves whose base material interest was freedom and those. At a certain point they couldn't even agree what they wanted and so they were doomed and you see again and again the the the the planter class dooming themselves in the long term for short-term advantage. So the first chapter is is mostly about the misery of the slave and how it made santa mango a miserable place but then a second chapter owners which is about the whites of santa man. Really goes very far The great pains to show that the misery of the colony was felt in both halves because while of course the the whites were all living lives of relative pleasure and leisure. They were also creating a culture of absolute miserable. Nasty brutishness they were living as pigs. They were living as pigs and cravats and so this map this this rather than like the the dream of the like.

The the southern aristocracy was always that being a slave owner in america allowed you to be like an ancient. Athenian. You could spend all day doing philosophy and reasoning and figuring out ideal forms of government and contributing to the general good. Because somebody else is doing all the work and and you are you. Your mind was better spent there because you were more advanced. You were smarter and therefore more valuable your time is more valuable but the colonists of saint domingue show that that is absolutely not what happens in in in amongst the absolute brutality of of american and caribbean slavery. Unlike anything that happened that existed in ancient ancient greece there is no culture. There is no culture.

There is just this savage grotesquery. The whites of haiti really do remind you of like the more carnival-esque grotesques of arm of our ruling class. But because it's it is dissension within the white ranks that helps lead to the revolution james takes po pains to point out that there are different groups of white people. In domain different classes you had the planters who actually owned the plantations many of them down downwardly mobile aristocrats basically people who were maybe the disinherited second son of a family from a rural mezzo or whatever the who could get the family name back some some stature by making money in the in the the third world. The big whites they were called and there was very few of them but they had the vast majority of the wealth of the of the plantation of the of the colony. Then you had the small whites the administrators. The overseers the lawyers the shopkeepers the people do who are doing jobs that could not be given to slaves because the education necessary to have them do. Those jobs would make them too dangerous to let them do those jobs so those jobs had to be done by white people and that is where you get the real dregs of french society. The white dregs who aren't trying to rebuild a family name with money. They have or money that they could borrow but are just trying to find any kind of employment and of course to say. Dregs is not to say that the fact that they were poor made them bad.

It just meant that they could not continue to expect to live in france and not have life just get worse and worse over time. So haiti was their chance to do that and there they were of course the the people who were most devoted to um the color line because as james points out racial segregation or a racial segregation of like of spaces and prescribed rights based on race was not did not emerge. Instantly. There were no early regulations or statutes about race in haiti. It. Was over time over the course of the 1700s that that comes into play as the small whites insist that if they're going to be in haiti here taking this.

In this place where they're risking yellow fever all the time and going to be at the beck and call of these these fancy people. Then they have to be assured that they're never going to have to do any of the real work. That that is a pres that there is a prescribed group who who will take that labor and that makes them feel less precarious. Because precarity is the driver of all middle class. Political activities not solidarity precarity because they cannot they're not they're not class conscious. They are self-conscious because they are the product of liberalism. They are the the purest product of liberalism as the middle class and their precarity at this point drove them to assert a color line that led to the creation of an incredibly intricate array of legal rights that are distinguished based on percentage and fraction of of black blood stuff that is absolutely absurd and and to think that people sat there and wrote this stuff down and took it seriously is. It is it's it's grimly kind of funny because of how ridiculous in the bosom of the enlightenment.

These people do in this thing but it was necessary it was required to maintain the social strata because you needed those whites there and that meant you needed that line there. But that con that relationship is complicated by the fact that you have this other group. What james calls the mulattos the colored population. The the the products of european and african reproduction and because of the very very small number of whites in the colony and the need for people in an intermediate. Position that is not slave but is not really master either because there's some jobs. A master can't do but you can't have a slave do and so you need whites for some of them but for others you need someone who is outside of You know full citizenship but enjoys a privileged position relative to slaves but then therefore will feel their precarity and so you get the The colored population people who are the product of relationships consensual or non-consensual between slaves and whites who are not who are free upon birth and are able to buy property and that puts them in a position where even though they get.

They don't have equal legal standing to whites. They are um and they have to. They're forced to perform compulsory military. Service in slave patrols that white people don't have to didn't have to do But they're not slaves and they're more aware of the danger of becoming a slave than they are inspired by the thought of being equal and so. But this is why these systems are so ingenious and the way they emerge is so organic. The colored population is adheres to the white population and not the not the black slave because they can own property because they can they are connected materially to the interests of the slave economy. They can own slaves. They can work in in the colonial economy that depends on slavery they can make money. There they can lend money there and so they have a material interest that is with slavery even though slavery treats them as second class. Just like the small whites have a material interest in a color line that stands in for their their social guarantee of not doing slave work and that is and that's that is what keeps these systems going from from the middle area from the from the fat of it for the people who at any point could hypothetically stop everything from working because they have the most crucial choke points. What's keeping them all in this system is that they feel more than anything a precarity and a fear of falling and that's because they don't feel solidarity and the theory of the theory of.

Marxism is that the creation of of of a class-based experience of exploitation creates a different sense of a different sense of best interest a different sense of material interest that means that instead of going towards despair and rage which is what happens when the middle class sees that things can't get better within the current system. Solidarity allows you to think that no well we can overcome this system and replace it with something whereby we don't have to fear falling anymore and that that feeling is a more is a superior um social mechanism for seizing political power than just middle class precarity by itself because what fascism is and I think we are in a post-fascism where we're inside a cone of misery and despair and that means everybody within that framework of american liberalism which includes the entirety of the republican and democratic party as in people who adhere to a liberal world where they believe that capitalism is eternal. That is that is who we're talking about if you're republican or democrat not talking about how you feel about anything. I'm talking about what's the systems that you're part of and the systems that you ritually engage with and psychologically engage with what they represent.

Those parties represent polls within one reality where capitalism is immutable and everything is going to get worse forever. That is the world that everybody within the bubble of american politics lives now and our politics is an expression of that and if you really believe that then politics can only serve as a vessel for revenge against somebody whose fault it is because the fault cannot be the fault has to be assigned and then if you can act you can only act by destroying and the difference is how much have you displaced your own sense of guilt and responsibility within this system and so the democrats are those people led at the top by those people who are. I wouldn't no. I would not say led at the top. I would say the the majority of their supporters who vote and participate as democrats at the top. It's it's just malik but because they are they're they're shielded from everything everything's gonna be fine.

For them. They have underwater bunkers. They're gonna be fine. They're serving malik everybody if elected by both parties is serving malik. Everybody at the top levels of the media is serving molech. But there are still people staffing these parties at the at the staff level at the level of like workers within the political infrastructure and then of course those people who vote for them most assiduously and who organized for the most those people.

Middle class precarious without the ability to think in class terms and to hope for a challenge to the system that would make it better would make life better. Have decided that it's their fault as highly educated white as white people. Basically that that white society did this because what liberalism is because urban liberalism is is is the middle class trying to convince themselves that it's right and just that they're sitting in a nice appointed room surrounded by misery and that makes you start turning inward and it turns it it and that means that you end up being overawed by your super ego. You end up being you end up sublimating all of your libidinal energy into denial and punishment of the self. It's just puritanism and that is urban liberal that is urban american liberalism now suburban whatever the democratic party in general and the way you do that as a liberal is by finding somebody else to blame who is like you. But isn't you yes white people. But if I'm of white woman white men yes white people including white women.

But straight ones some way that it isn't me or even if yes. I am all those boxes. But I'm aware of it and all of those things exude exempt you from punishment but that means somebody else has to pay and so liberalism is now making some type of understanding of republicans. However you want to define that pay be the first through the shoot it's two for.

It's two guys falling into a meat grinder and they're fighting to see who can push the other one in first so that they can watch them go through and then yes they get destroyed too but at that point when you've given up hope for anything better. That's the only pleasure you can imagine that's the only future that you can find solace in is one where you're watching. Your enemies suffer now the republicans they haven't sublimated. They're they're out there loud and proud because they their political formations their their traditions their definitions of the terms we use to even think and reason our way through the world were forged in the more brutal chambers of slave of plantation economics so they're not sublimated. The the it's everybody else. It's somebody else's fault not me not not who I imagine myself or who I relate to another. It's the other and I will destroy the other and I will see the other destroyed before me and so those are the two strains of sadism at the heart of american politics. Oh also in this chapter 

 james does a little mind blowing for people who might have always nurse. The idea hey you know maybe if the british had not. Had not been kicked out and we'd stay to colonies They would have gotten rid of slavery earlier and we wouldn't add a civil war because it's true that around the turn of the 19th century the british empire started agitating significantly internally to abolish the slave trade which it eventually did in the 1830s and then led and then began to patrol the atlantic ocean to suppress the slave trade after being the biggest slave traders and that's a story that is sometimes told in heroic terms. You know like the abolitionists of america william wilberforce and all that well according to james as soon as the north. American colonies were lost it became in england's long-term ben best economic interest and geostrategic interest to end slavery.

 because they had enough slaves. They could certainly ban the slave trade because they had enough blacks in the colonies that they controlled already meanwhile saint-domingue which was hugely profitable the most profitable colony in the americas but because it was so brutally exploitative and it required so much slave labor being imported because so many slaves died. It was really. It was the fact the fact that it was the most gruesomely. Physically degrading and dangerous slave colony is has an intimate relationship to why it was the most profitable and so old wiley. William pitt over there in england figures out hey we could burnish our credentials here and also enforce a slave trade ban in the atlantic that would allow us to cut off access to slaves to the most profitable french colony and make it more vulnerable to us in our game with the frogs so once again james coming back to material interests and and how how you can see through the bones of social nicety so much more clearly in a place like haiti and in and around slavery specifically where you see every consideration. Social consideration dissolved before the exis exigency of maintaining slavery so having set up the the main social groupings within within haiti on the eve of the revolution. James's third chapter is about how the colony responded to the french revolution which is what really tips everything in out of balance. You'd had a miserable grinding relatively stable status quo in haiti for hundreds of years. At that point. The the the reality of life as a as a slave in haiti was such that even though it was insanely miserably brutally miserable.

I mean one of the worst places to be a human. It was the way of the very nature of the regime was such that resistance to. It was sort of tired just drained of the population. People just literally didn't have the energy they were kept at a state of pretty much perpetual exhaustion to the point of death and that allowed for this thing to stay kind of stable. But then news comes from paris. The king has called the general assembly the states general what are we going to do and it leads to a big explosion of political ferment on the island.

The big whites immediately attempt to use the moment to secure independence for the colony because like all big for their britches colonists they were sick of the mercantile system that forbid them from getting materials from outside of france or selling outside of the french networks and imagine that well with the king's authority now compromised. It we will we'll just be our own dudes we'll rock and then but then the small whites joined along because the threat of the national assembly in paris and this new revolutionary government to perhaps mess with the racial arrangement and one of the big things that destabilized haitian politics. During this period was the the loosening of restrictions on blacks. The the are not blacks. I'm sorry collards colored as they were known um haitians um increasing their access to civil rights and allowing even the handful of coloreds who were the product of two parents who were both free what at the time of birth vote and the white and the small and white the small and big whites who in france are killing each other or rather. The the big. The big whites are in the process of of being of finally being you know held to account by by the small whites of like the urban artisan classes the son culat but they were on the same page in haiti because they were equally committed to the maintenance of the color line meanwhile the 

The colored population is trying to use the revolution to assert a universality of of rights among property owners and of course not among any slave which is what renders this whole pro this whole moment so kind of once again. Grimly absurd. There is a lot that's really brutally grimly absurd about about the haitian revolution and it's because of the absurdity of trying to run a civilized country with pretensions to ideas of rights and obligations and laws on top of just a giant machine of human misery right. There not not somewhere else not baffled through chambers of law and language and geography right in your. Face you have these people you know fighting for their civil rights. Their their universally recognized human rights to be equal to the other slave owners to be able to vote together with the other slave owners on what to do about the slaves and all for a sweet sweet delicious treat that you put in your tea or coffee something that rotted the teeth out of your gums. Kept you up late and that's it.

That's all did it wasn't necessary. It wasn't it wasn't a a needed element of the european diet so at the end of the third chapter an assembly has been called to replace an assembly that had broken up during this tumultuous battle where all the while the colonial authorities who were the other group of white people. I didn't mention earlier the actual military leaders and the the governor the intendant and all that and then the bureaucrats this thin sheen of of legality. On top of this whole process. They were unable to control events. There weren't enough of them. There weren't enough troops there or enough bureaucrats and they were there was an attempt by the colonial authorities to ally with the colors. To check the rebellious coalition of the big and small whites and it was in the as this battle was heating up and as the color population started making moves towards insurrection.

One had already happened and been brutally repressed one by o'jay as this was happening out of nowhere. Some the people that these people have been talking in front of and mobilizing in front of the whole time and it just would not even thinking about what they might be seeing what they might be thinking because of the screen of dehumanization that they had to put up to keep themselves where they were that very thing that allowed that line that allowed them to gain all that power to gain all that luxury and all those beautiful homes and fine silks became the very thing that meant that it would all go up in a inferno as their plantations were burned as they were hacked to death with machetes because in the middle of all this strikes a strikes the the first mass uprising of the haitian revolution and fourth chapter will no doubt. Set the scene for that whole thing and step us through it.

 so yeah three three next three chapters for tuesday tuesday. But I would say that that that the sugar industry is a good illustration of just how the colonial project provided the necessary. Raw materials trade establishment of trade networks and all most of and and importantly um surplus production of lux of luxury foodstuffs helped capitalism in europe not collapse in on itself because capitalism is wildly destabilizing and it creates social It creates massive social dislocation as it occurs. It is it is it bores everything into oblivion and that means that it creates unstable political situations and it creates conflicts within societies and between societies. As the resources are ground into the maw and as people are pulled away from their their established connections to the world around them and the people around them and turned into individuals and they resist. Everybody resists. The old ruling class resists because they weren't. They didn't really sign up for this when they unleashed these forces but and now they're going to try to fight and then of course. The peasants resist because they don't want to be made into whatever the hell. This thing is has in mind for them which they can't even imagine and what gets them off of their tractors and which gets them into the cities and what soothes the ball and sues the anxious minds of the aristocrats and the landowners sweet sugar. Sweet delicious sugar egos gim cracks stuff that is all the product of a trade of raw resources processed by slave labor on excorporated land and honestly.

I would say that that's the one thing that marx under emphasizes and I think that under under emphasis is the biggest explanation for why he wasn't wrong. Marx wasn't wrong about anything why he underestimated the timeline. The time scales that he was operating off of and that was because not only did colonization jump start capitalism in europe. It also provided a like a stabilizing fin as this thing is rocketing through european societies and then the crucial moment came in the early 20th century when capitalism's headquarters moved from europe to north america and in that case and once that happens the inherent. Instability in european capitalism can kind of blow itself up without destroying the whole system and then can be rebuilt creative destruction baby. We love it don't we that's world war.

Ii world war one and two the second thirty years war as I like to think of it. As yes the cold war was world war three that is tracked and we lost. I mean we won but we won then but we are going to lose eventually I might do a book on the 30 years war after this. If I find a good one. I don't know maybe wedgewood again. There's this like thousand page behemoth that I've always wanted to read and never got around to it though if anyone has another one let me know yeah world war 4 is not climate change annihilating us all. It's technology plus its human technology plus its human traitor minions. Destroying the rest of us. The climate change is just the context of them liquidating us as needed and when I say us I mean all humans.

I don't mean us as in americans not right away. We will be the last to feel the blade but what will make the blade send faster is how much we're going to be fixated on making sure that our enemies pay hit to take the blade first that is what's going to. If anything does crack it. All up is is our politically invested populous being so committed to seeing somebody else suffer before them. That if things get disabled destabilized they're gonna want. They're gonna reach for the acts of destruction not for solidarity yeah. I mean we're we're they're going they're at war with us right now and of course for right now we are also the ones that aren't war on behalf of because right now they're fighting war on behalf of the american standard of living basically because the american standard of living is what powers the world economy. It is the thing it's the reason we have stuff. This is the american standard of living and economic development is extending the american standard of living as far into the world as possible. Now of course that's impossible you get to a point where you start having enough people living the american standard of living and the biome starts to collapse which is what we're in and so everybody who enjoys an american standard of living anywhere in the world is on one side of a war with the rest of us and a lot of us are really struggling with the implications of that. How do I live knowing that I'm on the wrong side.

Not because. I do that. I use plastic straws not because of any specific actions. I do but just because of where I am situated in the global chain of supply chain you can't not be in there because it's not you standing it up. It's the It's the structures that you are enmeshed in that stand it up. Your individual participation is beside the point and I think that is one reason people like to think of climate apocalypse in in very mid-century mid mid 20th century terms. They want to think of it as another dr. Strange love ending because they love the idea of of you know extinguishment. Rather they certainly find more pleasurable to imagine about apocalyptic extinguishment than they do of just slowly over time becoming more in nerd to the misery dished out on our behalf and more. In need of a escape a mental justification for why what. I'm why. I'm not trying to do something more why. I'm not risking anything to stop this. I'm not blaming anybody for that. I can see why why you want to think everyone wants to think that it'll just one day that you're always going to be. You can imagine yourself. The victim of this thing. All right folks talk to you soon.
