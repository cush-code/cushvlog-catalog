After that I was and I will pray that that day after today well I can't again just want to kiss why. I can't again this one cares it must be something. I wouldn't miss but a waste of dancing a wee kiss. What can't. I get just one screw. Why can't. I get just one screw believe me. I know what to do but something don't let me make love to you. My mom have you kept your eyes on your eyes and your son you always got problems and not the only one. But when he sugar left he left you on the run oh my my my. My mom take a look now what your boy has done he's walking around like he's on the number one he went downtown and he got on the gun so don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me don't shoot you shoot that thing at me you know you got my sympathy but don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me don't shoot you choose that thing at me you know you got my sympathy but don't you shoot that thing at me god damn it so yeah.

I just occurred to me overwatch is that still around because for a while it was going to be not only was it an incredibly popular video game. It was going to become the next great american spectator sport. Like there is overwatch league that had a championship that was in the barclays center in brooklyn. I believe there was real money behind it like the project had a significant capital investment and then it just seems like it completely fell off. I mean obviously the spectator component was marred by covid but I don't know it feels like video games are so hegemonic as a entertainment genre. I guess you call it. I don't even know like a form like a form of entertainment like technological form of entertainment. They're maybe the most utilized but have yet to really create an independent um like cultural identity gamers still don't think of. They cannot get it across to themselves or anybody else that video games are an art form. They really want it but they they want it to be recognized but they can't rec.

They can't deal with the contradictions that that requires like gamergate was basically the larger culture of of like mainstream entertainment. Saying okay gamers you guys want to be part of the big boy squad. You guys want to be part of like the general hegemonic you know legitimate forms of entertainment things that you aren't a loser for doing things that you don't feel defensive about indulging in you want cultural kudos for engaging in them. The way people do for watching movies or reading books or listening to podcasts or streaming tv shows or writing and talking about those things you can be like that but you have to be housebroken. Like this new cultural milieu is a liberalized space. This is a it truly is a feminized space in that it is a house breaking away a lot of the features of mail like clannishness all being absolved by like the market which remember these are all about.

This is all about hegemonic economies we're video games going to turn into from a toy to a component of culture were they going to make that transition they had to do it though on the terms of at this point progressive capital socially progressive capital which has a vested interest in having as wide a demographic appeal as possible defined by having a pitch for everyone because everyone is a potential consumer and that overriding logic is going to push regardless of what the in the beliefs are of people. Within entertainment is going to push things in a socially progressive direction in terms of undermining ideas of white supremacist white supremacy gender hierarchy all this stuff like this. These things are resistance to fully marketized social relations like they are but but they're reactionary so games were going to get on the well on the playing field with everybody else. They had to have a logic of culture that allowed them to do things like sell nihilistic murder games to alienated young men but do it in a way where the stories that were being told in those nihilistic adventures are socially progressive and even if the actual product doesn't do that as long as you have a a commentariat who can critique these pieces of art right in a way that says this isn't what could be and therefore it gives everybody license to keep indulging in it.

The reptile brain snapped back and said no no that's too great a cost. We will create our own alternative hegemony and then that linked to the greater project of the the right in general. It's just one element of the reactionary rejection of the neoliberal noose being applied after 2008. And so gamergate is this rejection of that which has previously been the object of pursuit and now a new counter-hegemonic cultural identity has to be built and that becomes the entire online right which explodes out of the same dynamic that creates the online left at about the same time and the thing that these two forces have in common is that they are sterilized politically because they are totally detached from material politics and attached fatally attached to the spectacle of bipartisan political battle of the two-party system of of the structure of america's deliberative.

 processes not to the sinews of its economy which are what actually are determining the the rate of decline audio is clipping. I guess I should turn down the volume at least it's connected. I like that this thing is actually connected to something so everybody who is involved in this online right and left efflorescence. After 2000. I'd say 2016. It really is the the trump election is the sanders campaign and then trump winning are really what because that's the those are the contradictions emerging from the system and and the politically active neurotic downwardly mobily educated who are all the people engaging in online politics. Give it their energy during that period of anxiety decline possibility that made people reassess their understanding of their social contract.

But these people are what have what they have in common is that they are disaggregated in any class. They are downwardly mobile yes. They are college educated yes but beyond that their jobs their incomes their relationships to capital float independently independently of each other because the politics that they engage in does not engage those levels of identity. It's fixed at the level of partisan identity enforced by their parents. The parents of this new generation of politically active downwardly mobile college-educated people their parents because they are still homeowners largely beneficiaries of the last social contract forged in the reagan era are committed to the project of capitalism because they see themselves as beneficiaries of it. So their politics is just this. This dance of of denunciation of the self as they externalize everything that's wrong with the system that they know that they're part of but which they still benefit from.

They need someone to blame for The fact that their kids look like they're not gonna have as good a life that the promise of upward mobility that they had assumed would like carry on through. The generations was already being reduced to their in front of them but all they can do is vote because that's all they know to do because these people have been homeowners much more deeply become homeowners much more deeply as like a motivator of self-identity that orders our understanding of the world than worker would be and so the non-home owning educated are this tale in the in the aftermath of a battle between these two wings of of the These two culturally polarized wings of the post-war middle class the homeowners because they are the center of gravity of politics they vote more more of them vote. Their their concentrated identity imprints more on political outcomes that means that their commitment to the electoral system which is all we have in politics.

Now there is no we've been de-politicized. All we have is this skeleton of social of social ritual that connects us to any kind of democratic tradition. They still believe in it because it has done enough for them to make them believe in it. Their kids don't believe in it because they've never seen it work but they can't articulate in independent politics because all they can do is vote too because they don't have a connection to their co-workers their their. They don't have a socially reproduced identity that correlates to a greater self-interest that connects people by degree of exploitation by capitalism or or or position in the chain of production and so our politics is hostage to this and this is why our president becomes more and more powerful in our minds as he becomes more and more drained of any meaningful power in his actual job.

Now none of these are moral positions. This is an important thing to pers to underline because this is where a lot of people get confused because you start thinking well who are the good and the bad guys here. It's not about that socialism doesn't happen because people get better socialism happens because people change their self-perception to align their self-interest with a greater interest that's class consciousness. It is a self-interested movement. It's directed towards protecting oneself from from the pain and misery of life. It is an adaptive and evolutionary move and you can say that's getting better but not in a moral sense. It is an objective process. It is people being put in a position of friction where they either have to fight or cooperate and and they get in a situation where more of them come to the conclusion that cooperate makes sense than fight and then that builds new incentive structures that redefine what people are capable of what really is a possibility in the world. It's it's like a real ruptures is what it's what's important to remember and so we're all in this thing. We are all subjects. We are all consumers.

We are all grappling with that identity. We're trying to understand our our relationship to it and to mold it to try to mold the world through this understanding of ourselves and that is the task of everybody who is in this position of like. Trapped consciousness is to work themselves through the the task of like daily life and I guess find answers to the question of how how to live with this reality and that means dis associating your participation in politics as you understand it with that effort to build build a greater sense of self like to to do the like. The necessary internal transformation that is required of the moment yeah. It's all just the circle over again. It's all I'm sorry. I don't. I honestly don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing. I feel like. I'm in a kind of a purgatory situation ugh yeah. I guess that's the thing to remember is that if I if I'm in purgatory so are the rest of us. So I don't have to worry about being disconnected um so one thing.

I'm doing is that I think I can share responsibly is that I'm dipping my toe into just helping out with local politics here in la like josh androsky has a whole like plan to take over the la city council and I want to be part of it. So that's one thing I'm doing but that's not this. It's something else so yeah kim stanley. Robinson is much more optimistic than younger people and I think that's because that chronological relationship to decay you know like if you've seen the the system functioning just for something other than mere profit if you've ever seen that and lived through it. I think it gives you a certain faith in the viability of institutions to conform to human desires you know through conventional politics but the thing is. I don't think that that means that that's wrong even I think the assumption that oh now we're right.

We see things clearer isn't necessarily true because there's every incentive if you've only seen bad things happen to make an opposite wrong assumption that only bad things can happen that there's some sort of like that there is no possibility and any action for anything good to happen and that's not true but that's the conclusion you sort of subconsciously reach living through the 21st century is I've never been wrong to assume the worst but that's not logic that is the motivated reasoning around your trauma just as the older generation adheres to faith and systems that have benefited them and that they can understand that they can feel like the they can feel the the ghosts of democracy still sort of humming in them and that doesn't mean anybody is right or wrong. It means that from one position or another of faith and systems you still have to paying attention to one another they're communicating with one another. They're operating out of a shared project.

They're not just trying to impose their own conceptual schemas onto the world and telling people that they have to take them or leave. Them is it that you'll have people grabbing hands across the abyss of ignorance that exists on both sides and that warp our understanding of the moment. No matter where we are there's nothing that makes anything clearer the trauma and fear make you want to just end. It make you want to just drive into pure. Narcissistic is self-indulgence because you figure it'll be over soon well that isn't a rational conclusion that is a deeply indulgent conclusion that is you trying to find an excuse to just take the spiritual whipped cream and just put it down your gullet and so that's why there is this I think this siren call towards nihilism.

That says oh if it if. I have to live with a slow steady decline for the rest of my life and things just keep getting slightly worse all the time. But my absolute position within capitalism is basically the same like. I don't fall off the the map. Some people do but not me you know what I mean like the collective subject of our like our consumer point of view that we see reflected in culture that like we identify with are. I you know perspective that perspective is always going to be there and you're and so you're imagining yourself not having fallen off but having survived because to fall off is to be annihilated and that's the end of all suffering the scary option is that you're always you as things get worse and by the end of it you're you're.

Someone who you now recognize would be a monster and you don't want that to happen but you don't have the strength to prevent it so you want something to intercede. You want some sudden intercession that stops the slide while you still feel like you have humanity like you can look back on yourself as a human being and that is the death drive and that drives all the nihilistic politics that we currently face and that's the least of it is like left nihilism. Most of that's fake nihilism anyway like both political parties. The democrats and republicans represent dueling death dreams of the of the panicked homeowning middle class of america as they spiral into oblivion and can't reckon with it and they're going to destroy each other. They're going to go down. Ricketbach falls like moriarty and holmes. That's all that is not that is that is things will get bad for me personally in such a way that I'll keel over relatively young and globally something's. I can always imagine something's going to come in and just snap the reins on me like. I'm not going to have to keep abiding by my position in this system as a sort of a passive consumer atop this machinery. I'm going to have to like face face that and am I going to have the strength to make the right call and I don't know if a lot of people have a lot of faith that they do.

I know. I don't and so there's this hope that something will just erupt that that's there will be some sudden and I think that's I mean of course. I'm just seeing that everywhere because that's my personal frame of reference but like my relationship to like my hypochondria really feels like just a nested connection to my relationship towards like the apocalypse and like the the terminal decline of the system. It's like these things are sort of linked like they both like the recognition of both of them gives me permission to to be be self-destructive. I think peace comes with a resolution of those sense of those senses of like narcissistic attachment to a project. I think that's how you detach yourself from that cycle so that so that what you really are experiencing in your life and and everywhere is not filtered through this like hysterical lens because the consequences are not so terrifying the thought of like dying the thought of your understanding of yourself and your relationship to the world.

Ending is not the thing that sort of chases the edge of your vision and drives you towards distraction. But yeah we have a social hypochondria we're looking for the cancer and it's and because it's a middle-class movement. It's democrats and republicans. That cancer is either white supremacy and its demographic excretions or or the The other. The non-white other of course that's easy for me to say. I have that so of course this is you know getting a lot of boss. Baby vibes from this but I really do think at the end of the day. That's what we're all doing. We're all just picking out our our map of the world that we have shaped from our own shadow and then try to fit it into like a jigsaw with everybody else's and then technology should be ideally utilized to facilitate that that search of a lot for alignment and that's the capacity that we have and it's insanely frustrating and horrifying to see it fail to be utilized as such but which is currently in the hands of this algorithm that is antithetical to the short term survival of the human race.

Not and when I say that I don't mean like they're all going to die just like what we think of as a human being is going to die and it's going to be replaced by something worse until it isn't there anymore recognizably and at every point of crisis and and declension and and seismic shift downward. In expectations of of life experience people are always going to be shaped in their reactions to that by the social forces that surround them yeah. I absolutely understand now in a way that I never thought. I would the the post 60s turn inward on the left because it is like the rational response to defeat like people like the hippies had to deal with the fact that they all sold out right and that's why their kids were all phobic of selling out because they saw what it had done to their parents just hollowed them out but the fact is is that in the absence of any real social movement in the failure for the counter hegemonic forces cultural and material to cohere around any kind of meaningful resistance to capitalism as it is imposing itself on the 

In the 1970s the failure for that to come together meant that the choice was to either sell out or bat your head against the wall in a romantic self-annihilation. Now some people did that but the thing is most people over time aren't going to do that most people battered and and twisted by their material relationship by their life experience by their intersection with culture and hegemony hegemony. Rather they will take the deal and one way of coping with that deal is to say okay well if we all can't get out of there if we all can't change this if we're all stuck in this thing how will we live with it. How will we cope with it and if you can't change anything else you can only then change yourself. It is it's it's the final realization when hegemony has been imposed yeah if people want to understand what neoliberalism is. Neoliberalism is just hegemonic global capitalism. Let's say that because throughout the 20th century you can identify global like western capitalism specifically anglo-american capitalism after world war ii as currents of hegemony in a global system but as part of a system of hegemonies rising and falling one of. Them being the soviets the the third worldest or I mean the I'm sorry. The non-aligned movement developmentalists all this stuff.

Like that's all part of this relatively heterodox responses. The entire world is structured into the world system of capitalism and has to adapt to that they're all creating different localized to geminis and they fight each other out and that's the 20th century until 1989 when capitalism becomes fully hegemonic and I would say that the crisis of the 70s is when global capitalism it distinct from like all the currents that made it up when it came out of the new deal. Coalition politically achieves total hedgehog hegemony over the working class which had been part of the democratic party like a significant power arrangement within the democratic coalition that had independent authority that it asserted culturally and politically that existed from the 30s. Until the late 60s. It breaks up in the wildcat strikes of the 70s and then you see american domestically neo-liberalism emerging which is hegemonic global capitalism which has liquefied now the political machine in a way that it hadn't before and then once 10 years later. The the bomb the so you get the volcker shock and then the fall of the soviet union as a as like the echoing cascade of that decision within a jet within a year within a decade and then even an exterior global hegemony doesn't exist.

There is only neoliberalism. It's just imagine all of the institutions that used to exist to channel a political economy away from profit maximization. All the things that used to exist to to bureaucratically enforce a redistribution of a profit away from private hands and back into a public like a sim a a citizenhood a citizenship a group of a polity like some redistribution of profits that have been extracted in the economic sphere compelled in the economic sphere because it's a perfect machine for ex extort surplus labor. It extorts surplus labor with machine like grace. It there used to be institutions the kinds of things that emerge out of the the double um polyanious notion of social formations that come out of the disruptions of capitalism. There's these cultural structures political economic redistributive structures that emerge out of the the new deal and then the camp post the keynesian state after world war ii that that facilitated a degree of social cohesion that are now dead letters that no longer rail and that's the difference the impulse was always there.

Capitalism was always there in the background doing this but it's its profit. Imperative had been disrupted by this social imposition in the form of our political institutions which had a degree of legitimacy and actual decision-making apparatus of power and coordination of action that essentially harnessed capitalism. But those institutions burned out in the in the big social disruption of the 60s which is the inevitable byproduct of such a rapid reorientation of human experience like you're creating an entirely new type of human being from scratch. You're creating a mediated consumer subject where their relationship to the actual position they have within. Capitalism is fully obscured by all of the social technology and infrastructure that we rely on to make sense of the world and to navigate it and to assign value to things in the first place and that's why anything that has to it will emerge to challenge. This this self-destructing machinery that is programmed now to annihilate its own social foundations that cannot be stopped from within.

It's only opposition can come from new formations counter-hegemonic forces emerging from local struggle yeah. I'm I'm rooting for g apparently they're gonna let that giant real estate conglomerate just go bankrupt. They're not gonna rescue it. I thought they might nationalize it but maybe there isn't there anything there to nationalize like it might all just be like speculative paper so there really isn't anything for them to to seize control of and so they're just gonna let it evaporate and if they do oh. If they do that that's baller yeah of course. Npr was trying to manufacture consent for not letting it fail no.

Of course there were if I wanted to ever sketch out my like most fantastic vision of of like human salvation like my most indulgent notion of of how how we as a as a species could like get our. Together you know like get on the same page it would be the newly energized and desperate working classes of the downwardly mobile people of all identity persuasions in america working through their local conditions as tenants but and workers and eventually like a idea of citizenship that both that comes out of that struggle. Could then reach across the water to the to the straining working class of china and then grasp that and then and then the pink tide of of self-conscious working-class politics and mass politics in latin america. They reached across and then in the pacific ocean where the garbage patch once was was a a new transnational globalized.

 techno-proletariat is able to engage with all of the crises of terminal capitalism from a position of of maximized human leverage against the algorithm and being able to just pry that tick like a parasitic mass of of of real power holders because we do live under a reign of techno fascism right where the fascism is invisible. It's not social the way that fascism was originally and why it's not a good word to use really because it's all invisible. It's all technologicalized. But it's not. The technology is partially material. You know your con the the panopticon and and the techno surveillance and the drone army and and ai and all that. But a lot of it is the technology the social technology of coercion and consent that get us to just do what they they tell us to do every day and that can change that is moldable. That's controllable if people are able to coordinate activity using the technology that they do have access to and then make up for their lack of funds with their demographic advantage who knows who can never know.

No man can know the hour of the day knowing isn't the point believing is the point I don't know maybe the supply chain is going to snap and all the treats are going to run out and everything's going to change tomorrow who knows and it's 1917 all over again that can be the thing you imagine happening to stave off anxiety. It'll be interesting to see how the brits respond to the return of austerity because you can see in the british psyche since world war ii the trauma. So the us our ruling elite and then the middle class voters who make up like the the nerve stem of our mass politics such that it exists in the form of you know the the collected consumer preferences of american voters. It was all forged by world war ii but for world war ii for americans was collectively remembered as this pretty unalloyed triumph. Relatively few americans died. No damage really was done to the united states at all.

In fact its industrial industry was allowed to boost and over time and create this mass mass. This unprecedented mass prosperity that had never existed in america before and then everybody came home and got a house and it was great in the uk they got bombed. The country got the bombed out of it. There was a risk. They all thought they were going to get invaded the whole time. They got them to go into. The subway wait for the bombs to drop and then their economy was deeply shocked in the 50s in a way that the u.s wasn't and so you had this prolongation of wartime rationing because they had less of an economic base at that point than the us did because it had been. Surplus producer by that point and so I think that creates these dueling memories of world war ii and dueling like associations with that high point in american virtue basically like the definition of when america was at its heat peak was this rising to the challenge. This national project the last time we could really think of a unified america and that's what these guys have in their heads.

For the british. There is a degree of sadism of masochism buried into this thing where where where suffering is like yearned for as like a mark of virtue. Americans don't really have that they talk a big game about being tough but at the end of the day they do not value any idea of austerity. None of them. Even the most even mega people like none of them are in favor of austerity. Americans are like let the party kegs roll. We have no reason to ever suffer like oh we had to build a packard the size of a tank whereas some british guy is like tooling around and a thing made a press board dying of black lung after his after he was like inhaling smoke clearing out a bombed bombed 12th century cathedral and so like brexit has always had this part of that appeal.

I think has been this sort of wispolite return of the idea of a fortress where common common struggle and common pain bring with its social cohesion. But we're different people now and that's what they that's what that politics fails to recognize. And that's what right populism will always fail to recognize is that what you're trying to reinforce is a a reactionary social vision linked to this the dying memories of a precarious petty bourgeois affiliated class so all they can think to do is strike out at the things that they think are preventing this this return. It's like all people think can think to do in the us is not get the vaccine we're all in the tailwind of these two. These two faces of of small holder american identity. The people who thought the 60s were groovy and the people who thought the 60s were a drag retroactively of course nothing to do with how they thought at the time that's see how they remember it culturally. So that's why the british are the sickest people in the entire world. We are so sick but they are an extra level because they've they have been I mean that's that's where the pathogen spread like that's where that's where the the aids monkey got eaten was england.

Like that's where capitalism emerges. It's a very specific time and place. It's a historical contingency. It's response to conditions of conflict and over resources in in early modern europe. So yeah. The way the way to detach from that is to say it doesn't matter. The 60s were not good or bad. They were. The 60s were given the conditions at the time the array of forces the overlay of of a interdicting geographic and media structuring of reality on top of america's class relationship building suburbs and ghettos and creating mass media and institutions of like mass awareness. Like like the The news like journalism like the very like that going from paper to visual to to to creating this this simulacrum of america that you could interact with for a good portion of your day. I mean that changes people's relationship to their reality and all this is filtered on top of the basic real class relationships but they're not felt through all of these baffles and so when you get to the crisis point of the late 60s all the forces are arrayed orthogonally to class. They're arrayed along moral lines and bourgeois self-conceptions among whites. Of course. There's a actual like a black liberation movement that is internally coherent and it has driven by connection to a working class movement in a way that isn't true of the new left more broadly but all of them failed to cohere the traditional working. The traditional labor movement. Then the the black radical tradition and the new left failed to go here because they were fundamentally different people. Like I mean they they were not workers. They were not people within a position related to capitalism.

They were homeowners they were people with a relationship to ideas of race and gender and nationality. They were those things before they were ever workers no matter what they actually did whatever line part of the line. They were on this and so that defined their relationship to politics to challenging for power in the moment and a big part of that is because in the immediate aftermath of world war ii the left was checked everywhere and this is a victory a signal victory in the long term struggle of global capitalism to overcome all counter-hegemonic challenges and post-world war two as you could say is a continuation of world war two. The the establishment of the armistice basically between the left and the global capitalist. Order was one that would lead inevitably to the defeat of the left more broadly. But no one knew that at the time because their self-interest within the systems they inhabited overrode any broader awareness of the moment because things that failed to cohere and I would say that the x factor that made them fail to go here is america's frontier. The ability for for europe to find an escape valve to resolve the contradictions that emerge socially from the emergence of capitalism in europe and and find synthetic out. A synthetic application of those principles on the easily contested land of north america because it was in america where the left was was neutered out of the out of the anti-fascist coalition. There was a popular front between the left all the way to the communist party of russia through to new deal democrats who were not communists. People who were communists maybe in some who thought of themselves maybe as like marxists but did not fellow travelers. They were called all the way to conventional democrats. We're all on the same page and then as soon as those shared interests began to diverge. Crisis decision points emerged and there was not a coordinated enough effective global left to compete for them and I think that's a historically contingent event because it depends on other things happening the way they do like does that happen if the reconstruction occurs differently do. We have the weight of the united states tipping so decisively towards the reaction if its institutions are shaped differently following the crisis of the civil war.

If the constitutional order is challenged from a democratic a grassroots democratic political machinery which could contest for power more easily because capitalism at this point is very nascent in its social structure. It is an imperative but it is imperative that is enforced by social cohesion that is non-capitalist and is subject to to a resistance emerging and I think there's there are not just like one or another worlds. There's gradients all throughout because all these are are just every outcome is is in the middle of a range of possibilities and that means all the other possibilities are resent are represented in reality somewhere and could have been real and are real theoretically oh and when I was listing all the things that were militating against the emergence of effective working-class political expression in the 60s. It's not just oh they got treats and they got tv and all that there was also the emergence of the national security state to emerge as a extra democratic technological weapon to carry out the like the directly imperative demands of capitalism. The stuff that could not be allowed to go up for a debate could not could not allow the humoring mechanisms and rituals of democracy to intrude. This is the where I was saying there's coercion and then there's consent and things like elections and and legislation and degrees of social safety net expense and social welfare and bureaucracy and regulation. All these things. They are all there to the extent that they can afford to be indulged because it doesn't really matter. This is basically haggling with the people what will you put up with okay fine but some demands are off the table and they have to be in that has to be enforced not by the marketplace of ideas or by the political mechanisms being allowed to go unchecked but by a a strict rigid enforcement of boundaries in all legal and extra-legal forms from a position that is removed from democratic accountability. That's the important thing to emphasize is that the national security state created by the truman administration and then solidified by eisenhower is effectively unaccountable to gover to democratic institutions of any kind democratic oversight of any kind that means that they operate a government that is independent of democratic will so whose will is it carrying out the united states of america that is to these people the collective self-interest of a system of systems. A system of distribution of resources a system of distribution of power geographically that thing has interests that are discernible. They can then be imposed to the degree that they need to be now how far that goes. I don't know it isn't a factor though it's one of those things that we had to contend with all.

I know is We got. We got what we want. We got the blessing or is it a curse maybe we live in interesting times. It's all shit's in the air man. I feel like I'm white riding a time quake. I feel like I'm in like the the pre-shock see somebody says how come. This is a perfect example of how difficult.

This is to talk about and get anywhere how come holding owning a house is bad why is this a question. What does this have to do with anything. These are individual moral questions. You can get you can put your head up your ass for a decade trying to justify well am I in this specific condition justified in exercising the capitalist framework of home purchasing that's up that is between you and god talking about home. Ownership is in this way is meant to understand why why cap why politics unfolds the way it does what the interests are that dominate politically and interests are self-interests. It's just the difference between political subjects is the dif is comes down to what their definition of self-interest is so good and bad doesn't enter into it. You will find a justification for owning a house if you really want one. No matter how left you are if the conditions obtain you will make the decision that it's good to do and with all of these things if there's a condition where it's good to do it and even abstractly then it's good to do it and stop freaking out about it because it's all bourgeois morality policing. It's. It's the ritual self-abnegation at the puritan heart of of liberal sanctimony which is an ally occasionally in a broader left project and is a necessary component of it unfortunately but should not be allowed to just dominate every thought you have in your head. Now the politics that people pursue because of that self-interested as a homeowner are bad. They're bad politics because the agenda is at the expense of others. It's it's it's using the state to provide a free subsidy for one way of life at the at the punishment and miseration of people in another area in another geographic area like make robbing them in order to dot to using the state to make up for the shortfall in rising wages by cannibalizing from social outlay to anybody else and and laundering it through the market in the form of mortgage interest deductions and like that but them choosing that will happen if there isn't a left alternative.

If there isn't a a class-based social formation that can challenge that person for their allegiance. Because that allegiance is up for grabs. People can change their understanding of of self-interest. It's not immutable. It's just it expresses itself sort of demographically in a bell curve like everything else. Most people are relatively committed to it to selfishness no matter what their politics are because it's what we've all been told is the only thing that's real for christ's sake. We've spent our entire lives getting only benefit only only selfish pleasure only able to genuinely pursue selfish ends not not rewarded in any way for pursuing selfless sense and hope to do into a decision matrix that disallows for cooperative action. It's it. It socializes you against cooperating foreign all right well that was all right. I guess the wheel in the sky keeps on turning and I don't know what I'll do tomorrow bye.
