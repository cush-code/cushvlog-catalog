In between down touch with reality now my personality is commodity and it used to be mr steve austin. On the mic 6 million ways he used to run it guess. Oscar goldman got man so. I got loose circuits so loose use. The mother goose with the eggs that seem to be falling. You know pack my bags because hey folks hey folks how you doing just gonna do a nice casual friday stream. Here no chris no video gaming just me in the chat which I know isn't always great because not all the questions are that good hopefully you guys can surprise me here and give me some good ones just hanging up thank you for saying.

The shirt is nice thank you. I appreciate that. I was thinking about that I mean this is obviously very dumb and facile but all right you know what I want to this is good. Someone says what faction would you have been a part of in 1917. Russia. I would say a quote maybe 25 to 30 percent of all online left-wing politics that isn't connected to you know actual questions of action in the moment but are fixated on points of sort of doctrinal consistency or purity boil down to people fantasizing about what they would have been doing in 1917. I had been a bolshevik man. I'd have been an anarchist whatever. The real thing is the real fact and the thing that everyone should think of before they get into this kind of mind gamery and specifically before they get into the point of investing themselves in these questions having meaning and trying to reinforce their politics through this lens is that you wouldn't have been anyone because you wouldn't have been there. There is no you there is no person. That is you that is outside of the context of your life. If you were a russian in 1917 you would not be you. In any way.

It is a meaningless question and it's one of the things that makes it very difficult to talk about chris history because people want to make it into a story that they can put themselves into. But it assumes that there is a thing. There is an essence to an individual that transcends their time and place and their context. There isn't like what makes you is the sum total of your experiences with the world and the experiences of the world are determined are determined temporally and spatially so you would not have been there you would not have been in 1917. You would have been you. It wouldn't have been you and people really get riled up about affirming like one or another. Political positions related to these questions because they want to have imagined themselves on the right side but you're looking through a glass darkly at an entirely foreign world not just in terms of language but just a vote.

An entire world. I mean russia specifically. My god in 1917 was a feudal world. A a feudal order that had that that had modernity just dropped on its lap that had things like marxism things like socialism sort of transubstantiated into like emotionally invested sort of transcendental spiritual categories. As like the old order died right then like the old it was like a it's like a a phase shift away from like a traditional understanding of the world into a modern one whereas in the rest of europe in the united states that transition was much slower because development happened more evenly and so you could not and being an american by god being an american at the end of the 20th 20th century. Beginning of the 21st century. When you are the most alienated uprooted people who have ever existed on earth. The most the most ironized you can't put yourself in that world because they saw the world differently. They their world was a different world and I understand why people want to put themselves there because it was a time when actions felt like they mattered. I mean and I especially get the fixation around the bolsheviks because we live now in a world where it seems like there's no hope for anything ever getting better and more and the big reason for that is because there seems to be no place for human agency. There's nowhere for an individual to put their shoulder and move anything. Everything feels completely stuck because there are so many of us.

We are so diffused there's and and I think more than anything our our subject. Our subjectivity are literally our being. Subjects of capitalism is enforced at such a diffuse level of technology social technology specifically not just actual physical technology that there's nowhere there's no winter palace to storm and so 1917 where you have a small cutlery of dedicated leather jacket clad badasses who amongst this giant throng of people all running around with chickens with their heads cut off in the middle of this long-form crisis. This this death of one order the only people who are like lenin. The only people who are who are able to see the thread for where it is and direct action. It's incredibly intoxicating and that's why people want to imagine themselves in that position because it is so much more preferable than being in our position. And I think that there's a there's a unspoken fantasy that if you can visu if you can present yourself if you can orient yourself around what you imagine that position was then that you will be able to translate that clarity of action to the current moment and I'm afraid that's impossible because because the circumstances are different there was no middle order in the in the dying russian empire. There was a massive peasants a disproportionately large urban proletariat in the few places of significant urban development. A almost non-existent middle class layer and then the romanov family and like the general staff just sitting on top of it.

Like the police bureaucracy. We are literally all of us middle subjects. No matter what our conditions of employment are our relationship to capital. We have been we've been bourgeoisified in america by the process of like being the place where the entire world's um economy is. Fun. Has been organized around and funneled through for the past 70 years and that means that that that the that the pressure points and the mobilization elements just aren't there because like if you want to look at the difference between russia and germany in 1917 and 1918. One of the big ones is that the middle class had been bourgeoisie in germany. There was a big chunk of workers not just party functionaries and union leaders but also actual rank-and-file workers who had been invested enough in capitalism that they didn't want to see some terrifying revolution that they didn't know what the outcome would be of there was no and so that middle class that bourgeoisian it it broke. It split the working class and defuted defeated the kind of focal point action that that the russians were able to do because they were pushing against a rotten open door.

This. It's a it was completely there was nothing there. There was a few inbreds at the top some army officers and then a mass a military that was mostly conscripted peasants. It was a situation where where focus pressure and commitment and frankly a religious faith in the project could have an effect so people want to want to imagine that for the moment but the moment is different. The time is different. We are different people in every meaningful sense of that. We are different people and so we couldn't we're not them and they couldn't be us.

That's why that's why I find though like defending the bolsheviks and defending the soviet union to be a pretty meaningless endeavor. It really does seem to exist. I mean. I know people have rationalizations for why they think it's important because you know we're fighting against propaganda war and all this stuff but most people aren't paying attention to any of this stuff. What we're really doing is is validating ourselves validating our our purity and our imagined position in a historical continuum of action that means that we would have been bolsheviks in 1917 because we're defending them now see I love. This online leftists are obsessed with 1917 spends proselytizing about 1917. I'm not this is a meta commentary for christ's sake. I'm not defending one of the other sides. I'm saying the whole point is about It's ego. It's not. It's not a political project.

I will say that I think that the bolsheviks were correct that they were the only ones who who could have seized power that there was no transition to to democratic a bourgeois democratic government because the bourgeois did not exist but after the civil war and the basically the destruction of the russian working class in the civil war. I don't know they probably should have and and more importantly the failure of the european pan-european revolution to happen should have made them probably stop and consider what they what they really needed to do But they couldn't because they at that point were were committed and had separated themselves but like people fixate on lenin because he was the guy who saw every angle and he was he was. He was unencumbered by the sort of neurotic fixation on doctrinal purity and correctness that paralyzed a lot of other people and that was because he was fully committed to victory for its own sake which when you're in a country like russia only makes sense if you have assumed like he did the trotsky right view that that there would be a that it would be a spark to a revolution that would resolve all the contradictions inherent in trying to govern a giant medieval peasant society from the top and then it didn't happen and he died and they had no they had they didn't know what to do. But it's difficult to imagine any situation where the russian peasantry doesn't get just ground into hamburger by the 20th century because that's what happened to the peasantry everywhere if you were not turned into peasants in the least violent means although still violent in western europe where capitalism starts developing when capitalism shows up. Peasant societies are annihilated and that more than anything is due to the nature of interstate competition. I mean that's why the the russian state decided to basically enforce capitalism on russia in the 19th century even though most of the people at the top levels of russian society had no real investment or interest in it because they were in a state competitive framework and state competitive frameworks are what made capitalism in the first place.

There is nowhere else in the world that had the number of small and medium-sized states in close competition with one. Another then europe and once the state system sort of spreads and solidifies. Everybody is going to destroy their peasantry if they want to not get taken over and then if you get taken over. Your peasantry is then destroyed by your colonial overlord oh the thing I was going to say before. I saw that question is because I have the suez canal simulator thing here um. It would be funny and like kind of over the on the nose if capitalist if the world capitalist system was destroyed by a blockage in an artery. Considering that that's the number one way that capitalism kills the people who benefit from it. Like literally we're having a world heart attack. You got to get a stent in there or something or else she'll keel over like nelson rockefeller while having sex with his mistress but yeah no. It's not going to collapse anything of course yeah.

There's money to be made is the thing what's the difference between a peasant and a yeoman farmer. The thing about yeoman is that he owns the land he works on which traditionally in in peasant societies is not the case. The landlords are local power brokers who have domination of the land and then worker peasants work on the land in some sort of tribute mechanism that varies from world from system to system. Yeoman is a farmer who owns their own property and works it for themselves which is a thing that I mean.

I really do believe that is the foundational distinction between america's notion of democracy and liberty and and why we don't have. We never had a socialist party in this country and we never had a serious socialist. Vision is because notions of liberty in places where land that have a tradition of of peasant agriculture have a social conception of liberty because it's impo because social relations were embedded and property ownership at that level is not something that the average person could imagine in america because it was everybody who couldn't hack it one way or another for one reason or another in europe coming to coming across the water to make their fortune to make heaven on earth. Whatever they were thought they were doing were able to dispossess the native occupants of the land and then subdue it without having to fight against the traditional land owners that meant that our so our american ideas of liberty are individualized in a way that is genuinely i. I mean I it's obviously wrong. But it's it's allowed to. It's been allowed to persist just because we've always been able to replace the notion of autonomy through land ownership with something else.

Once the promise gives away like we were going to be the place where nobody had to work for anybody else or not for very long because everybody could get land and then once that proved itself to not be true. We had a place where anybody could make their own business and now like small business has replaced yeoman farming as the ideal american subject because it's somebody who's who is able to be free able to able to exercise independent political judgment because the the big horror in american history is the idea that if you're you're gonna get something for nothing you're gonna vote yourself for the public purse which of course is nonsensical because everybody is here. Everybody is part of a political body and there's a general welfare that's why the united states depended upon a subject race as I talked about on wednesday to make the whole thing make sense at all which is why the civil war really was the chance to re-inscribe america's conceptions of liberty which we didn't get. I'm not going to watch the black and white justice league.

That is a way I honestly. I remember the first trailer for it was in black and white and I just assumed it would all be black and white and now they just decided to double dip very very clever of them. Somebody says these go around the block and go nowhere that's kind of the point. It's going in circles because I'm in a guy in a room I have nowhere to point. Anyone including myself are the avengers cops obviously. That's the thing about marvel and that's what that makes it such. A contrast with dc is that they do a very explicit job in the marvel movies of saying that these people are essentially just extensions of the state. Like the falcon can't even get a goddamn bank loan whereas the dc heroes are transcend state power is what's the irl anti-life equation.

I think you all know what I'm going to say it is. It's pretty obvious. It's capitalism dun dun somebody says about asks about the meiji restoration in contrast to the civil war and reconstruction. It's part of the same process. I mean the 19th century is I think my my favorite century to study just because it is. It is when the when capitalism started to achieve escape velocity from settled human social orders and that was everywhere and always an incredibly violent process.

Because settled orders have vested interests. They have ways of life and being that are embedded and time tested and there will be resistance to their destruction and I think it's funny that ed. Zwick made two movies glory and last samurai about two countries that had wars between capital and land between traditional feudal orders or quasi fuel. Whatever you want to call slavery. I know people get mad when you call it feudal but whatever you want to call it. It was it was certainly not it was certainly a ancient. It was not a modern form of social relationships certainly and neither of course was a feudal samurai order and he makes two movies about those two wars and the good guys. In the first one are the bad guys in the second one because at the end what he's really responding to is like the romantic a romantic story and the fact that he's an american and makes him be able to respond to it sort of just as a as a romantic exploit but either way it's the same process. It is. It is the landed in the the invested landed powers being replaced by a a order of finance abstract value. Sushi indeed comped the shit's boring who cares somebody's asking me about wild wild west. I just found that movie to be very insultingly terrible.

It was it was bad. I'm sorry. I mean. I don't know why anyone would argue. I mean it's. I guess like oh. It's about a black cowboy in the west and he's against a confederate so it's like. It's got good politics. But I'm sorry. It's it sucks. It's bad people asking about selma heights. But I'm fairly certain that's not her butt in there. That's a stunt. But there is an amazing scene where kenneth branagh who plays dr loveless as instead of as a dwarf which he was on the show as a guy with his legs blown off and will smith are just trading ableist and racist jokes to one another which I'd be interested in seeing the response. Not. It'd be funny if they got if that scene got canceled now because it's it's very problematic.

Why are there so you good civil war movies. It is amazing. I mean. It's like. It's one of it's our foundational one of our most important historical traumas It's one that I know for a fact is very captivating to many many people and yet there's almost no good civil war movies. It's very weird. I mean yeah. I know that a lot of it is because of the lost cause and how that that just from a narrative perspective let alone forgetting about ideology people. Want to you know graft some sort of nobility to that cause yeah. It's like yeah. We got westerns instead. It's like forget about the civil war. It's too messy. Let's just talk about what they did directly after that. I mean one of the big problems. I think is that just from a standpoint of I mean maybe who knows now maybe. It's too late to ever have a good one. But they always made they always made were able to save money by having reenactors do the battle scenes and civil war reenactors are all like fat old guys so the battle scenes are terrible. Somebody says we need a 30 years war movie that would be pretty intense. I I would like to see that there's there's only been a couple 30 years more movies to my knowledge. There's one with michael kane where he plays like a swedish cavalry officer who shows up to a town to raid it. I never saw that one but yeah I mean you want to talk about something that could be deeply metal. Something about 30 years war would be pretty intense.

I've always thought another interesting one would be um would be bacon's rebellion specifically because when the the governor called out troops to put down bacon's rebellion in the virginia colony in 1675. I want to see if I can find the quote here. I might not be able to find it but they apparently dosed the the clone. The militia that. They sent to put down the rebellion with with jimson weave which is a poisonous hallucinogenic drug. Yeah. I got this quote here so yeah. So they made jim some weed soup while they were going to put down this. This. This rebellion against the governor and the colonial authorities and that there was a quote from someone who put it It was a very pleasant comedy for they turned natural fools upon it. For several days. One would blob a feather in the air. Another would dart straws at it with much fury and another stark naked was sitting up in a corner like a monkey grinning and making mouths at them. So I just love this idea of you've got this like rebellion against colonial authority. These guys trying to you know throw off the shackles and the way they get people to go and and kill them. All is to just get them ripped yeah mk ultra exactly yeah.

A field in england is is is in the same vibe but I think that I think that bacon's rebellion would be even more sort of edged thoughts on the amazon union drive. I mean I'm rooting for it obviously. I don't have I i I don't have anything. I can do. I don't know anyway to help it but I'm certainly rooting for it. It's certain it'll be interesting to see if it. Does lead to more attempts to unionize amazon workers because that actually is you know in a post-industrial economy. An actual strategic node of production or at least distribution that could be leveraged so which is why you're going to see a very concerted resistance to it and that's the real question. It's like. We kind of know where there are the points to to hypothetically organize and and create leverage. But they know them too and they're going to try to everything they can to prevent it.

Somebody says what's the best house in game of thrones saying martell is easy because it's like hey they're like kind of poc and they're they're cool with gender equality and they like drinking spicy red wine and being polly so. That's a little too easy. It's certainly It's not the up so annoying. I do like outhouse manderly because it's just a bunch of fat dudes just a bunch of fat dudes just piling in and being like soups on. We got kicked out of the riverlands and now we're going up to just park our asses by this river and just eat yeah you by the way. This is this is actually 

This is this reminds me so obviously george r martin is never finishing these books. I mean he's had a year off from anything else that he has to do and yet he has nothing which means that he isn't going to finish anything and it's not because he's lazy. It's not even. I think because he's like too anxious or that he's too undermined by the fact that the show ended although honestly the fact that the show has its ending even if it's good or bad. I know as someone who read the books. As soon as the show came out the last episode. It really did kind of make you go eh. I don't really care anymore. I mean. I would like to see more books but I've lost that desire that. I used to have but I think the thing that really did him in is that he is trying like what he has created with that world of his. He got so ambitious about it that he's no longer trying to like wrap up a story. He is trying to like describe an epochal like transition of a social order and that's just too big of an ask. That's just too many plates to keep spinning like especially for somebody who's fixated on like interconnectivity as he is like the way that the benioff and weiss were able to end. The show was by just dropping everything drop like forgetting half the and just focusing and he can't do it.

I don't think he can do it. I mean he's trying to like end a civilization or like lead to a or or describe the transition of one civilization into another one and when you're doing that. I don't know how that's too big of an ask like look at what like um the person. He's most. He's often compared to is. You know the guy who invented what he's doing tolkien. He didn't do that tolkien just had the elves leave. He just said yeah the elves is over. The elves are gone and so now the humans are. Gonna do something and good luck to them like he would have to actually have an entire social order. Be subsumed in some way and how the hell do you even figure out how to do that. It's it's way too big. He bit off more than any one man in a greek. Fisherman's hat could chew what about a death of stalin style comedy based on the assassination of our assassination of archduke ferdinand. I know somebody who wrote that script and it's really good so. It's out there probably never get made but it's out there. Somebody wants me to know about eugene merman that's such a random. That's where people getting the idea of their questions.

It's really baffling. What is my skin care. Routine well thank you for asking. But I do not have one the writing haha it's going. I mean. I don't know i. I have a very hard time I I have a hard time writing without editing while I do it. I have a lot of transcripts and stuff that I'm trying to shape into something. But I'll admit it's. It's. It's been a struggle. I hope. I hope to have I have an idea for something that might help kind of break the log jam in the near future. I'll keep you updated. I'm just the thing is. I'm not really a writer. I never have been you know and now. I'm trying to be and it's It's tough to learn the right habits when you haven't really been doing it.

That long that much how would. I solve the suez boat crisis. Just get a bunch of helicopters and lift the boat seems easy. I do like that they're going back around the cape of good horn or the cape of good horn cape of the cape of good head. No the cape of good hope. I like that we're like it's vasco da gama time all over again. I don't think that I don't think that they will be leaving afghanistan. I don't think that there's I think at this point there is no incentive there's no overriding incentive to get america out of anywhere. It is in right now the the fact that they're failing the fact that they don't. They're not doing what they want to do or. They're claiming to do doesn't matter at this point. I think I think china more than anything is guaranteeing that we will not leave afghanistan like if we're really deciding that china is the new enemy and we're gonna do cold war ii with china. Now that the war on terror is no longer a real useful predicate for our military economy. Afghanistan is still crucial to that too and there's lithium there too oh man forget about it yeah. No they're not going anywhere and honestly yeah.

The heroin is a big part of it. I mean there's there's zero way that we are not getting a huge amount of money in put into the system one way or another by by the opium trade out of afghanistan. I mean the the taliban were were eliminating opium before the u.s. Invasion and now it's where 90 of the world's opium comes from. In a similar way. There was very little opium produced into heroin anyway in the golden triangle before the vietnam war started and then all of a sudden boom became a world center of heroin production at the same time that the u.s network of transports is moving.

All throughout all the mountain regions of of southeast asia just coincidentally I wouldn't be. I mean i. I don't know too i. I don't. I don't really want to get into the whole thing about the uyghurs and everything because it does seem like. It's a classic busy box for americans who have nothing else to do to try to convince themselves they're waging a propaganda war that no one's paying attention to and that doesn't matter. But I would not be surprised if you saw some some sort of insurgency being seated there by the united states what ends u.s. Global hegemony the dollar but again you know it's sort of a chicken and the egg thing like the dollar is dominant because we are the dominant power in the world and its value is dependent on our military us and our state robustness which is tied to the military. So I do wonder how much of a paper tiger.

The american military is because it does seem like it just exists to you know make money for people and build boats to crash into each other and planes that can't fly and that if there had to be a real contest that there would not be anything there to really to to work but of course. That's why we're gonna try to avoid one which is why the whole thing with china is so interesting because you know we can't fight war with china. It's absurd it can't it can't exist but at the same time brinksman's ship with china is also necessary. Honestly. Yeah fake war with china would make the most sense get all the real leaders in a room not joe biden of course but the real leaders in a room and say okay let's let's coordinate this thing.

Let's let's figure out who's going to get bombed where what losses we can accept and then coordinate and and orchestrate a up a build up conflict and then a drawdown that like manages the tension and it wouldn't be the first time that I mean the the gulf war was basically staged just without poor saddam hussein really knowing what was happening that is I 100 percent believe that the gulf war as beltry large set did not. Exist did not take place in the sense that it was a war that the united states provoked allowed to happen in fact set up to happen in order to establish a new military order. In the aftermath of the of this collapse of the soviet union. A unipolar american-led world community that would be able to act anywhere in the world and that would justify the maintenance of america's military-based economy and not have to worry about that peace dividend that that people in power were terrified of having to deal with after the fall of the soviet union because if the united states had really not wanted saddam hussein to invade kuwait there were plenty of times that they could have told him not to do it. Instead. They explicitly told him to go ahead. We didn't care so that he would do it and then once it happened we could go oh. Yeah no never mind. We're you're actually hitler jr. And we're going to blow your ass up and that's the crowning achievement of george h.w. Bush's career.

This guy who behind the scenes for 50 years was knitting together the forces of the deep state and wall street eastern capital and sun belts oil and defense money in and then into a viable machinery for power through the instrument of the republican party and then was able to see through the end of the cold war the establishment of a new unipolar world through the loser because the gdp dropped for three months in early 1992. It's it's one of the great arcs of any american political figure. I we really should do an episode about bull worth that movie is is maybe the most 90s. If you want to understand 90s politics. It might be the single best movie for forgetting that moment to forgetting the sort of pre-911 malaise the the sort of the the the feudal dream of some sort of truth teller cutting through with rap. I do listen to lex g's podcast if anyone wants a movie podcast.

I highly recommend lex g not only because he he has he's a good rock on tour who does a great talk about like his personal relationship to movies. But also and I think this is very important he and also will. I will say this is also you know trying to establish a new mode of criticism is trying to transcend the current critical moment which is that basically the only film criticism that exists anymore is entirely content based the only reason to talk about a movie is to talk about its like the the themes within it. It's politics. That's why you talk about a movie like what the characters relate to like who they who's my friend who's my enemy. You know what's problematic what's not and I feel like that has really reached a point where it there's. It's total.

Diminishing returns what I think is going to come back and I think lex and will are hopefully gonna be forefront on is the return to an aesthetic critique of film where you talk about the way that it looks the way that it's just set up the way that the scenes are the way it's edited. Those those things the actual form of the film and like yeah vibe and lex g had an episode where he talks about sheen which is a thing that you never hear anybody talking about when they talk about movies which is it's the color grading. It's look how you movie comes out no one's going to tell you what the sheen is. They're only going to tell you about like whether it's a good or bad movie in the culture war. Basically i. I think that there's going to be a return of criticism that deals with the actual formal elements of film which I think is good so yeah the lex g podcast. It's on It's on spotify of course. It is an acquired taste because he is a special figure and he's a idiosyncratic voice to say the least But it's if you if you want to hear someone talking about movies.

It's it's not like anything else you're going to encounter that's for sure. I just watched closely. I just rewatched close encounters of the third kind last night. That's so funny that someone asked. It's I enjoyed it. I hadn't seen it in a long time It's good. It's it's. I don't know. I don't know how I really felt about it though. I mean now the thing is like with spielberg now that I kind of imagine him as this like demonic avatar of the new world order. It's hard to really watch anything of his through a non-horrific lens. Spielberg is going to make a movie about his childhood hasn't that been like all of his movies but I i did i. I did. I will say that yeah in in close encounters. I did relate poignantly to that restlessness of the character that that inability to to like accept what's around you and that that that yearning for transcendence and then the fact that he just gets it at the end. Like oh here are the aliens they want to take you to space. It's a little It's it's kind of jaw dropping in its narcissism really. But it's very well shot the alien. The the ufo looks good.

I haven't watched the suicide squad suicide squad trailer yet. I've heard that it's nothing but soy dialogue which I'm very excited about thank goodness. I gotta say I'd rather see the the airs cut because ayers was such a weird choice for that. Like he's a guy who just makes grim cop movies and then they have him doing this thing with all these like and then they had and apparently he made it like a grim cop version of suicide squad that took the suicide part very seriously and then after all those snyder movies were not performing as well as the marvel ones they just panicked and cut the whole thing up because there was a trailer that had like a bohemian rhapsody in it that everybody liked so. I would like to see just the full grim version. The grim the full grim air cut of that just as a contrast you release the dan schneider cut. The tan schneider cut could only be screened like in front of a sealed grand jury. I think yeah premiering on little saying james exactly. I think that spielberg is just demonic because of his complacency. Like his like you contrast him with a guy like 

Like cameron you know his. He is. He is at the top he isn't. He's supposed to be an artist you know and he has he's been. He's been to the top of power. He's he's hung out with presidents. He knows what's there and every one of his films is devoted to telling everyone especially in like the last 10 years or so that everything is basically as it should be like a pan glossy and best of all possible worlds and I don't know how you can have his ability his connection to power and his connection to honestly horrifying figures like his dreamworks. Partner david geffen and put that out there without any kind of of awareness. It seems like he's these movies exist to to to lull you and yeah. That's why I said that maybe his most biographical movie is actually temple of doom have.

I addressed the biden stimulus bill yet. I people have been asking that I really don't know what we're supposed to say about it. I mean I guess the only thing. I would like to say about it. Maybe we'll talk about in the show is we're seeing people act like oh. Fdr is back baby. Neoliberalism is over very very puzzling. I I do not understand this I mean I guess I understand it people want to they want to imagine if they're in media. If they're in left media. They want to imagine that they're having an influence on things. Like yep we did this we we pushed him left or something but it seems like it's it's like we have gotten to a point where where they've starved the grassroots of the economy so much that that stimulus was like just necessary to keep the water wheels turning and the idea that it is some sort of permanent new new a new consensus that is somehow durable and is going to be able to resist the inevitable pressure to like to reinforce neoliberalism.

I it seems it seems unsupported. I mean just writing people checks is the literal least you could do and more importantly. It doesn't actually change power relationships in any significant way and that's what you actually have to look at if they pass the pro act. That'd be one thing if they passed the pro act. I might drop the monocle out of my eye a little bit but I ain't holding my breath but the good news is none of it has anything to do with me so or you or anybody. We can't really do anything about it. I mean yeah like the cobra premium thing is a perfect example oh my god. They're paying everybody's cobra premiums that's just an insanely giant just check to the insurance industry that's just money to insurance company that so that's not you're not changing anything you're just you're literally buying off the top constituencies okay. I'm going to log off here we'll be back next week to talk about the last two chapters and wednesday of reconstruction and then hopefully we'll be back on friday to do another hangout stream. Maybe have chris we'll see bye folks.
