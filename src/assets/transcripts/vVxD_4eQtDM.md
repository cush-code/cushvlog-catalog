Down is as mcnamara was banned. Mcnamara is banned. Folks don't we love it. We love the band from ireland. Mcnamara's banned. Those cats could play jack let me tell you. They're all about it when I first came to london. I was only 16 with a fiber in my pocket my old dancing bag. I went down to the delhi to check out the scene but I still ended up upon the old main dragon and it was cold and nights. I all knew it was chill but there were boys in the cafes and kitchen pills. She didn't have the money there's always lots of chewing on the old dragon was it. Angela lives revenge on click oh and kicked in the balls between the middle doors. At vine street. I was beaten and mauled and I ruined my good looks for the old main drag so guys and gals I am now able to command the 

It's a stream. I don't have to use my phone anymore and this is wild. I get to click on a little button and it just streams my computer camera amazing. It's a game changer. We've entered a new phase. We've entered the phase omega of the of the streams. So today we're gonna be talking about chapters nine and ten in eric founder's reconstruction chapter nine. The problem of enforcement is about white resistance to reconstruction and chapter 10 is about reconstruction in the north and how it impacted the political agenda of the republican party and their willingness to continue supporting reconstruction basically so after the imposition of the the southern republican reconstruction governments the white democrats of the south which was obviously the majority of all of the landowners and most of the white people outside of unionist strongholds. Realized that their policy of basically pretending that it wasn't happening and abstaining from elections wasn't working like in mississippi. They were able to prevent a constitutional um the state constitution from being ratified by boycotting because it failed to produce unnecessary the necessity. What was required is the necessary voter turnout to to make the vote binding but they just changed that requirement and put it back in anyway.

So the democrats in the south realized that it wasn't working and so two strategies of how to go about dealing with the political system and with the reality of reconstruction and black suffrage in in the south. First you had the white line democrats the ones who insisted upon white supremacy as the cornerstone of governance and denied the validity of the reconstruction governments entirely and the in and denied the validity of black suffrage entirely. But more influential and more successful were those democrats who accepted as a fantacom plea the reality of reconstruction the reality of black suffrage and and called instead for a new departure which said all right fine there's black suffrage. We can't stop it what can we do and what they did was. They they joined the republicans or they joined factions of republican parties outside the deep south where the the black vote wasn't completely dominated or completely like organized around the republican party in states like virginia and tennessee. The in 1869 and 1970 the new departure democrats allied with conservative republicans were able to win and take over their agenda. Their economic agenda was totally hostile to freed slaves even though they made grudging attempts to reach out to black voters. But it was attractive to poor whites because it emphasized lowering taxes because one of the big consequences of reconstruction government was a huge increase in public provision which also led to an increase in taxation which squeezed low small holding farmers and poor whites harder. Even than it did the The rich whites um and the other element was agrarian reform the idea being that if we cannot deny black suffrage if we cannot deny black civic equality then we can reduce black labor power by utilizing new farming technology.

 advanced advanced like irrigation and fertilizing techniques and encouraging immigration from either like ireland or even china to break the the late the um to break the black laboring classes ability to negotiate the the conditions of their work. Even george fitzhugh who I've talked about before who was before the war and author of a number of works that controversially even in the south claimed that wage relationships within the white race were wrong and that honestly everybody should be either a slave or a owner because democracy was a fraud that assumed an equality that was not possible. But in the aftermath of the war he saw the way the winds were blowing and he became a big booster for the bringing of capital to the south all on the idea that you're going to reduce the um effectiveness of black labor and political organizing. There's one quote in the book about how someone says we need to bring in the great. The most advanced farming machinery one of the advantages of which is that it can't vote but the thing that stymied a lot of these efforts is as was always the case in reconstruction capital. Like for example one of the big.

 agricultural modernizing projects was introducing mixed planting instead of having just entire regions dominated by cotton planting and that was possible in some northern parts of the south. But in the black belt in the cotton belt. It would have required very expensive fertilizer which would have required capital that during this period the south just was not getting and then you had the fact that the crop lien system where everybody was on operating on credit. The the planters were operating on credit from banks. The sharecroppers were operating on credit from the planters it didn't. It created a path dependency where there wasn't really no one could afford to miss. A harvest nobody could afford to not be putting up cotton.

So diversifying became a kind of a non-starter so places where the these new departure democrats took power in these border areas like virginia by the way virginia had a democratic republic right-wing republican fusion government take over partially because the radical republican coalition headed by that the newspaper writer newspaper editor honeycutt which I talked about last time and which actually did bring together poorer whites and and ex-slaves around a really radical economic agenda. That pat and and who passed a radical constitutional who created a radical constitutional convention and and a radical constitution the union general who was in command of virginia james. John schofield refused to allow a vote on it so into that vacuum. The the redeeming new departure democrats took power and wherever they did they implemented voter restrictions that were just on the right side of the 15th amendment which guaranteed voting regardless of rate voting rights regardless of race that meant um poll taxes and it should be noted that there's two types of poll taxes and you see some confusion with this like For example there was a bunch of there was in the 80s. There was a huge amount of protesting in england about the poll tax and poll in that sense and in american history. Also in some places poll means head and it is a regressive tax on individuals like x if x number of people live in a county. Every one of them owes x number of dollars in in in taxes which of course is regressive because rich people can afford to pay it more than poor because it's fixed by just the fact that it's it's a mop. It's a fixed amount per person but these were poll taxes that said you had to pay money to vote It also reduced the number of polling places in black strongholds if that sounds familiar and gerrymandered districts away from black belt counties once again.

If any of this sounds familiar and in addition to that they also rescinded all of the legislation that the radical regimes had done to help freed slave freed slaves and poor people prosper and and negotiate their own terms of employment. They got rid of foraging rights which are very big because if you can forage it means you don't necessarily have to take a wage or work a crop lien and also the homestead exemption from debt repayments and the rule that meant that the laborers claimed to a crop superseded any other debtors or any other lenders that the that the planter might know and this was all in the deep south where the the republican governments held power simply because of the still significant and unified power of the black vote with a huge explosion in violence and the forming of the ku klux klan. This is the part of the book that if you've read it is the most nauseating and enraging part yet where you see in response to the institution of these. Radical republican interracial regimes a huge explosion in political violence. Massacres lynchings whippings targeted assassinations of community. Leaders also white republicans as well um with specific intent to attack people who had any kind of political expression labor minister labor militancy and very importantly any pretensions to ownership of property and this is like the key element to the failure of reconstruction or one of them and it's maddening because it was not ordained and necessary. It was not like some sort of stimulus response that could not have been either precluded or stopped once it started and it's important to remember that it was made up of this reaction. This the clan violence the people who carried it out were not just poor white trash. They were a whole swath of white society in these places and generally led by the better elements. The professionals the landowners it was a in many ways like plantar reaction to the rise of of black power and one of the most frustrating things reading. It is seeing how powerless people were to stop it.

Even though republican regimes were empowered in many of these states even though you know you had huge numbers of ex-slaves living here now as free people technically as equal citizens with rights. There was very little response to the violence. There was very little tit-for-tat and there was very little defensive violence and and this was something that in the north a lot of people found kind of pathetic. They said why don't you stand up for yourself which is ridiculous because they were in a situation where the the social milieu meant that any white violence would be ratified by local power. Like the local courts local government and any violence by friedman would be instantly cracked down upon with no because in most of these places there's barely any federal presence. There were less than 6 000 u.s. Troops in the south. I believe by this point and scattered throughout the entire region and so even if there had been a desire on the part of the federal government at that point to crack down which there wasn't there would have been very diff much difficulty in having those resources deployed. It was it was very difficult to imagine a situation where if you stood up for yourself.

Anything would happen other than just a total smackdown of destruction of your. The entire area and this violence was very very effective at undermining reconstruction because the people who were killed were generally people who had achieved some degree of literacy and political influence and had shown themselves to be leaders and had in many cases leadership of a bunch of different intersecting civic organizations and political groups which meant that the capital you could essentially decapitate ex-slave political power by killing only a few people because so many of the ex-slaves had no education and had no literacy and as such had a very difficult time negotiating a lot of these these power structures the people who could kind of made themselves targets in a way and were violently repressed and this is why you really can't think of a civil war as ending in 1865. It's just moved to a different phase. People say oh. Robert e lee was so gallant and and honorable because he didn't send the army off to do guerrilla fighting well. They didn't do it then but they did it later and it's important to note.

They were allowed to because where state governments decided to crack down state governments here because as I said the federal power to do anything was was pretty muted where state governments acted where there was a reconstruction a radical government in place that had any kind of legitimacy and efficacy. They were able to crack the down on these guys. The two most sterling examples were arkansas and texas which both saw their radical governors creating interracial police and militia units at the state level that just arrested the and threw people in jail and it led to in texas. Governor edmond davis had six thousand clansmen arrested and it had an effect people didn't fight. I mean the the violence was was so widespread because impunity was assumed. I mean these people are cowards if they think they're going to get in trouble.

They're not going to do it and I would like and one of the most horrifying and the single most violent incident of all of reconstruction was the colfax massacre which occurs at this time in which a struggle between local factions in in colfax louisiana leads to a black militia essentially taking commandeering and taking control of a city town square there in colfax for a number of days until they were just overwhelmed by a redeemer militia that massacred over 200 of them. With no repercussions but where there was a state response. There was a reduction in violence. There was a capacity to do this but there had to be a mechanism of where where the state was willing to enforce and back up. Black claims to rights and the big effect of all. This violence is that it brought a big decline in black turnout as you can imagine and it led to democrats gaining yeah of course. Edmund davis of course texas public school history called him a tyrant yeah.

No he was a he was a pimp sorry edmond davis pimp benjamin butler pimp because guys like that realized something that is lost in history and was even lost at the time to the the liberal republicans in the north which is that they wanted to see this as a political struggle. They wanted to see the battle over who will be in charge of these governments in the south as a political discussion. But it was not. It was for the republicans the the former slaves and the scalawags and carpetbaggers who were trying to govern these. These con these states they were operating by political rules. They were trying to. They were trying to raise votes and they were trying to win elections for the white power structure. It was an existential war. It was a war that had never ended since 65 and when you have that kind of situation where one side is willing to go beyond politics and the other one is constrained by political conceptions the the side that is willing to take the most extreme. Measures will win unless the other side understands the the the real terrain and acts accordingly and there were attempts to do that but they were half-hearted half-hazard and not coordinated and this is why my big dream my big what if at this point it isn't. Even that lincoln lives so much as that butler is vice president because if butler's vice president and lincoln still gets assassinated. I have a hard time imagining that we get any period of reprieve for the planter class and certainly not the confederate high command.

I mean this is a guy who when he was the military governor of new orleans hanged a guy for pulling down the american flag and stepping on it. Even though everybody assumed he wouldn't hang this guy they were like there's no way he's gonna hang a guy for taking the flag down. That's insane he's gonna like try him and then he'll the guy will give a speech and then he'll he'll commute the sentence and they had they had a big. They had a big deal. They let the guy give a talk he said. I'm doing it patriotically. Everyone is waiting for butler to give him the old give him the the lindsey buckingham gladhand. Tmlxg and instead. He's like no hang the lincoln's blood on his hands that that he would have been nearly as as conciliatory to these people as andrew. Johnson was but what this really boils down to more than anything is that by this point and this is the important thing by this point at this point in time after the initial failures. After the railroad lobby had essentially bought the republican party. There was just no commitment in the northern republican party to do anything other than let the south sort of figure itself cigarettes own out there was no real commitment to the display of force.

The the transgression of norms that would have been required to actually do something but eventually they kind of had to the grant regime though was very slow in dealing with things and this is where we got to talk about grant a little bit. I know that I've said that grant is underrated and he is relative to his traditional position in american history and certainly compared to the dunning-school horseshit. But he was not the man for the job. Not the man the times demanded The very fact that he was the nominee spoke to the rise of this conservative sort of fiscally oriented section of the republican party over the radical spirit that had sort of gutted out and and had essentially gathered to ensure that benjamin wade didn't get the nomination in 1870 1868. But he had his upside and one of them was that he actually did. Eventually crack down on on the clan but that in that the impetus for that came from congress in the form of the ku klux klan act which was shepherded through the house by benjamin butler and which led to a massive number of arrests in in the areas of peak clan violence in the piedmont south and led to a huge reduction in violence. One thing that didn't happen under grant was the 15th amendment which is very interesting because one of the reasons that black suffrage was not the silver bullet that a lot of northern republicans assumed it would be like republicans who were very leery about getting into questions of redistribution and positive liberty. Because of their liberty you know their liberal ideology put all of their faith in the battle let black people vote and they will be integrated into the political system and we will not need to change the relationship between subjects of a government and and the government itself in terms of like. It's what it's what it's what its provisions are and one of the things that made that impossible is that the 15th amendment while bans discrimination on race for voting. It does not.

It did not actually remove impediments to voting that existed in northern states or make voting a actual right which it still isn't we kind of think of voting as a right. But it's kind. It still really is more of a privilege in the constitutional sector in the in the constitutional sense. Like equal provision of the ballot is is considered anathema racially but other than that states are sort of at their discretion to figure out who is allowed to vote which is to hold over from the old constitution old early constitutional era and was one of many things that should have been done away with by the civil war. The civil war should have proven the ridiculousness of that and but it didn't because the array of forces weren't sufficient to to change that relationship and northern republicans were incredibly scared of the urban immigrant population that they have their cities catholic foreign language people democrats and then as a result many northern states that were governed by republicans had voting restrictions on the books things like tax requirements for voting and property restrictions and they didn't want to give those up. They didn't want to undermine their control there because the republican party was much more centered in the north and the south and the southern republicans had very little influence in dc. Northern republicans controlled the party and controlled the direction of the party and they wanted to maintain their power in the. States that they and it should be noted that even though the one of the knocks on the 15th amendment at the time was that it was a special amendment that was especially designed for blacks and did not cover everybody. Most ex-slaves in the political arena and said no this should be universalized because that is the radical wellspring of of the black.

Political tradition in this country comes from the fact that there's nobody that black people can sell out. It's not because they're better than the rest of us which is sort of I think the unspoken assumption of like the liberal notion that suffering is righteousness in the political sense. The reason that that black americans have been like at the forefront of the general move towards social progress in this country is because they cannot sell anybody out because there's nobody that they can make a deal with power to get a worse deal than them in exchange for them getting slightly better conditions. They're at the bottom of the totem pole. Now over time you get structures within the the black community that reward people at the top and create like a comprador situation. Somebody's talking about jim clyburn and yes he's essentially a comprador for the internal colony in black america but in general. Like the black political tradition has is disabused of a lot of the ideological mystifications of other communities because what is screened away in those communities. The inherent oppressiveness of political institutions is revealed or that it's screened to them by the fact that they don't suffer the worst of it that there's some sort of wage skin wage social wage that is a inducement to accepting some element of america's ideology which isn't something that that has been open to the majority of of blacks since the end of slavery and so while the 15th amendment was not all it could have been It was still a huge leap forward because even a few years earlier as we've talked about on the stream. The idea of enfranchising black americans men but any black americans was absolutely unthinkable anywhere in the country and the 15th amendment. Made black enfranchisement national policy so that does speak to the fluidity of the moment and the real possibility for for things to have been pushed further. But the reality was that without a commitment to challenge the entrenched planter class and their refusal to accept black political subject subjectivity.

It just wasn't going to be enough and it wasn't helped by the fact that as I said southern republicans in dc didn't have really any influence in congress. They could there was nothing that they could wheel or deal about because they were coming from a part of the country that was economically stagnant all of the all of the incredible amount of economic expansion. That's I'm going to talk about for the next chapter. All of it was happening in the west and in the north the south was completely stagnant. During that period. No capital was coming into the south relative to what was going to the west and north so that means there and that match with the fact that the local the power and the money that did exist in the south was all oriented around the planter classes and the democratic party meaning that there was no structure for campaign donations and and can and party in infrastructure funded by local. Political elites which you had in the north meant that there was no money for them to come north to spread around. They were at the mercy of a republican national republican party that was kind of sick of the whole thing. And one of the reasons was because these guys were increasingly. The the northern republicans were recently orienting around capitalism and and economic development as their agenda and away from black rights a lot of the more and more they were feeling.

Like this we fought the war to end slavery. Slavery is over to have the vote now let's make let's get. This bread and and their liberal fixations including their mania for private property and a limited government to prevent that private property from being being messed with led them to some of them to actually resist things like the enforcement acts and the klan act that allowed for the suppression of some of the most horrific violence in the south But my man benjamin butler said to these idiots if the federal government cannot pass laws to protect the rights liberties and lives of the citizens of the united states in the states. Why were guarantees of those fundamental rights put in the constitution at all and he was able to get the clan act passed and the enforcement acts over the complaints of these northern liberals and it had an effect. It brought down the level of violence so that's chapter nine all right so chapter 10 moves north. We've been in the south. This whole time now chapter 10 says hey well.

This was all happening in the south what's been going on in the north parts of war and what has been going on is you is that the economy is exploding thanks to this railroad. This crooked railroad-based economic investment scheme. There's a huge boom in railroads mining lumber manufacturing and more importantly than the fact that these things are expanding. They are consolidating like these in mining for example for for most of the mid 19th century. The the vision of a minor was like um you know a prospector going and finding a hole digging it doing it when he wanted to stopping what he wanted to controlling the conditions of his labor. By the early 1870s. Most of those people had either stopped mining or been bought out and been replaced by large corporate mine interests paying wage laborers to go deep underground if anybody has seen deadwood the whole arc of george hurst coming to town and buying all the claims and bringing in cornish laborers that that's that's the process we're seeing in the south. Even the land which was the dream of westwood expansion yeoman freedom in land owning. Even the land in many parts of the west was being consolidated under the ownership of a few big owners.

California is the perfect example of this california is one of the most agriculturally rich areas of the country and even in the 1870s it was already coming under the control of a handful of families and that never went away. California agriculture has been controlled by a cartel of of agro agricultural families ever since and the thing that's doing this is eastern money money from new york money from europe coming to invest in railroads invested mining invest in cattle as we talked about with the with the richard white book and to invest in lumber and while these companies are buying out their competitors and increasing their share. They are facilitating that by just also buying the out of the entire political structure republicans democrats everybody is getting in in the forms of outright bribes in the form of retainers.

There was a senator lyman trumbull from illinois who was on retainer well in the senate from a railroad company which was at the time legal and even more than that just the distribution of stock to stock in railroad companies to political politicians who would then vote to give land to that very railroad company absolute self-dealing we talked about how this kind of corruption undermined the the reputations of the reconstruction radical governments but whatever was happening in the south was dwarfed by what was happening in the rest of the country because there was more money by from 1862 to 1872. A hundred million acres of land in the united states were just given to railroads and a number of ex-slaves pointed out. Pretty aptly how the hell are those guys what did they do to earn that land when you're telling us that we can't be given land because that would be wrong that would violate social private property rights that would because because we haven't earned it.

We have to learn how to you have to learn to work even though they literally had worked to land their entire. Goddamn lives and had every bit of their labor taken from them. But it's because the railroads had money. The railroads were going to build create jobs. The railroads were looking to the future black land ownership which was going to be subsistence. Land ownership was not going to be the kind of productive large-scale agricultural output that they were looking for was not. This is not productive but the republicans while they were doing. This in the north were also extending the state building project that was happening in the south als north elsewhere. Also these governments were starting to build much more public schooling and hospital and infrastructure and that had existed before. But all of that meant taxes went up very much which also pissed people off and also all of the corruption pissed people off too 

One of the more perfect stories about the way that the liberal middle class reacted to to the scandal of railroad corruption and this is also in the richard white book. And phoner talks about it too because it's very just very perfectly emblematic of not just the time. But the the the function of like middle class morale moralism in sort of manufacturing consent and and reinforcing capitalist rule so in massachusetts which was ho the it had been the the center of abolitionism. It was the center of liberal republicanism and and that middle-class tradition of property rights and horrible fear and dis disdain at irish immigrants who were filling up boston like crazy. Those massachusetts performers who had the state on lock. At that point. They decided that they were going to fix railroad corruption not by regulating the railroads which would have been an intervention in the private sector but by creating a a expert panel to ope to see over the railroad contracts and to compile information about them and it was led by a prominent blue blood and literal descendant of presidents. Charles francis adams jr who over the course of his tenure at the top of it turned the organization into a captured instrument of the railroads and in fact speculated in railroad stock. While he was at the top the same corruption that all the dirty pauls were doing.

He just did but from the dispassionate position of a unelected technocrat by the way why is everybody talking about world war ii in the chat. I just noticed. Everyone's talking about is that people playing axis and allies. What's going on this is about whether they should have dropped. They dropped the bomb what's going on here or that or if the soviets could have taken. Japan. We're not going to let the soviets take japan that was not going to happen. We nuked them to stop that from happening so in the middle of this.

The working class is for the first time in american history coming into coherence as a political force. But it is very much divided by geography ethnicity language conditions of work. Some places like pittsburgh at this point are still places where workers really have conditions of labor that are closer to an artisan whereas in other places like new york city you have like the creation of real like you know 19 what you think of when you think of those dark satanic mills. Massachusetts too of course and so that thing those things all likes make it difficult for them to articulate a coherent politics. But there are certain political issues that come out of labor organizing one is greenbacks the notion of replacing goldbach's gold specie as america's currency peg with just printing money fiat currency and of course. It's very interesting to see read. These 19th century. Conservatives freaking out about fiat about the very notion of fiat currency when now most people take fiat currency. Even conservatives take fian currency as sort of you know necessary of course. There's a lot of libertarian types who fixate on the gold standard or bitcoin but if you're in power you kind of under assume that this is there's no real alternative to fiat and but but what's different between the fiat that we have now and the fiat that that was being proposed by these early working-class political movements is that we have the federal reserve. Now we have a fake structure of impartiality to control the money supply outside of democratic control. What the greenback's movement was was hey how about we decide collectively how much money there is which was of course absolutely anathema to wall street to the bank of england which was at this point sort of in the same position in the global trade. Nexus that like the imf and stuff has now the civil war really did open it. It flayed the skin the ideological flesh off of the notion of money and revealed the bone like before there was this fantasy about what money was before the civil war and then when the civil war happened and they just printed a bunch of money and people took it and it worked. It really did show that yeah. No money is money is valuable to the degree that the that the body issuing it has some sort of claim of authority where it's being exchanged and these these liberal conserva.

These republicans these pro-capital republicans were desperately desperately interested in closing up that wound which is why at this period you're seeing. Even though you're seeing this huge economic expansion. There's a deflationary pressure because the government is in the process of calling in greenbacks and applying a gold standard. It took years it took until the mid 1870s. I think to actually get to a gold standard because there have been so much money putting out through the civil war that had to be kind of pulled back in um but not like all at once because for one thing working people were like no more. Money please but the other big issue was the eight hour day which was becoming synoquinone with freedom if you if you could not be a yeoman. If you if the dream of of total property autonomy was was dying for a lot of these people if you had to work then you should work a reasonable amount eight hours to work eight hours to rest eight hours of what we will and that led to a movement in congress to limit federal employees to eight hours which passed over the objection of a bunch of these liberal republicans who thought that was an a horrible intervention in in the 

In the free market. Black workers of course were largely cut out of the labor movement due to racism and and due to the their perception as threats and also the fact that there weren't that many black laborers in the north. The black people made up at this point but less than two percent of the northern population and black laborers in the south obviously were dealing with their own situation and were still largely agricultural. But the where black workers did organize they did kind of naturally end up being a little more conciliatory towards capital because there was no solidarity extended There's a story that founder repeats about a massive strike by white stevedores in baltimore to get black. Shipyard workers off of the docks and led to the firing over a thousand of them and then a local white merchant helping a group of black. Stevedores get access to their own shipyard so there was an idea that well if we're not getting any help from the workers class. Maybe we can get some help from well-intentioned capitalists and of course the idea of a well-intentioned capitalist. That's a fraud. But it's a fraud that is propagated by things like race hatred as a wedge that defeats working-class solidarity. So the labor movement caused a huge amount of cognitive dissonance in a lot of republicans who had been committed to ending slavery in part because they thought that if they ended slavery that they would basically solve the labor problem in america that the labor the labor the only labor problem in the united states was the existence of slavery and that if we did have a nation where everybody was equal in the market and was able on the market to equally sell their labor and their goods and exchange that that would be essentially the the state of nature because that was very much. The underlining the underlying ideological fantasy of liberalism is that there is such a thing as an economic state of nature and that the economic state of nature is a free market exchange and that the government is essentially perverting the world perverting the earth violating sacred laws by intervening in the market in fact one of the big arguments that the liberal republicans made against greenbacks was that repudiating gold-backed debt was dishonorable and that denying the intrinsic value of gold was unnatural.

These guys all thought they were the most you know brilliant rationalists in the universe but like this is all stuff that falls apart on the nearest examination. It's all tautology. But if everybody is jacking themselves off with the same tautology and that tautology keeps you at the top of an economic pecking order. It keeps you from having to get your hands dirty. It's more powerful than any idea which is why history is not made by ideas ideas come. Later ideas ratify a state of affairs and ratify the hierarchy within it. Because no one will ever adhere to an idea or at least no critical mass of people in power will adhere to an idea that undermines their position of power because the only thing they really believe in is the power they hold. The only thing they really believe in is not having to work for the money they have because who would who would want to nobody wants to work so this. The fact that you have these white laborers saying hey this sucks We're being exploited. We're we're actually slaves in a way it. With the their heads of these republicans it it it caused them to have to confront a lot of their priors and what they did to solve that problem that that crisis of ideology was to just stop thinking ideologically. And this led to the and this is part of the process that leads to the end of the ideological era of the republican party when it was organized around the principles which it was from its founding in 1852. I believe until like probably you could say 1868 that it becomes a organizational party like exactly the way that van buren's democracy turned into you start with a attempt to advance a ideological position through a party structure but once that party takes power once that party embeds itself in power structures and creates parasitic relationships with power the way the republican party did with the emerging corporate interests at the time it no longer needs its ideological motivation. It is able to motivate people to vote for it to to fill its ranks through its organizational enticements. In the form of patronage jobs for people all throughout the levels of government and more importantly for the point of view. The party than the patronage is the kickbacks because 19th century spoil system work. Like this the party gets in power whichever one. It is.

You're a van buren democrat. You're a you're. A you're one of roscoe conkling's republicans in new york and you're a good republican you're friends with like your local alderman. He gets you a job as a postal worker. You are expected to kick somewhere between 10 to 20 of your salary to the republican party. Now you might also have to pay the guy who got you the job but that's between you two. The the party depends upon this circulation of money back into its coffers and this led to the creation of a segment within the republican party called the stalwarts who didn't give a about how corrupt. All this was because they were looking after the power of the republican party now for many of them like roscoe conkling and james blaine it was largely self-serving. These guys were political entrepreneurs but butler was also a a stalwart and even though butler I don't think is in any way a principled person. When he was a military governor of new orleans. He confiscated cotton. He basically made up a a pretense to confiscate all the cotton coming in and out of new orleans and then auctioned it at very low prices to his brother who was one of his adjutants. But he was also interested in the the the spoils system because it gave the republican party power and he actually wanted that power to be put in the service of extending freedom to ex-slaves and also to the laboring classes of the north and the thing that they these stalwarts the way the star wars got people to vote for that republicans was. The ones who weren't just benefiting from the patronage was not necessarily through ideology as it was through resentment. The civil war had just happened. It killed 300 000 northerners. The people who killed them were basically all democrats. The democrats were still the other party in america. You could do well in most northern states that sent thousands and thousands of boys south to fight the war by saying vote for us. The other guys literally shot your brother.

They called it waving the bloody shirt and it worked who I'm not voting for the party that literally killed one of my relatives and while they were doing this they were also attaching themselves remora-like to this emerging corporate capital structure. Demanding kickbacks to the party itself not just to the individual members of the party at every level of economic transaction which kept them detached from any specific interest and answerable only to themselves but still dependent upon these capitalist structures in order to to fund their their actions and this this situation. This corrupt confluence which led to the creation of a bunch of political machines especially in cities like philadelphia that were essentially identical to the old tammany hall machine in new york only with republicans instead of democrats why are you talking about pmc again. Why is everyone talking about pmc you should be talking about pmc because we're leading to the revolt of the pmc from within the republican party and that is the rise of the liberal debt republicans as a faction in the fir and during the first grant term and this is a group of reformers intellectuals journalists the people who are like the closest thing. We would have to that kind of class in the 19th century when you know capitalism is still in in a protein state attempting to draw the line of social progress and emancipation and civic equality because they were seeing the these. These middle-class reformer types protestants merchant class.

The people who had been the engines of abolition they were seeing that there were two that the drop that the anti-slavery cause ideologically had like two strands to it. One strand was a recognition. It was it was a recognition of human equality. It said slavery is wrong because we are all people and it is wrong for people to be deprived of liberty. But there is another side the other the other side of that which was motivating them just as much because remember. This is the merchant core and not if not merchants all of the people who lived around the merchants. Like all these intellectuals and academics and reformers they all lived around finance capital even if they were not directly involved in it. Their their livelihoods depended on finance capital that other strand said that slavery needed to be abolished because it interfered with market efficiency because it was a feudal remnant. It was a backwards approach to the economic management that what what the future was was liberal. Subjectivity universalized liberal subjectivity and once the war ends and the project of building. America's capitalist structures becomes much more central in large part because the war itself creates a bunch of capital war is always the thing that sparks in capitalist development in countries. The second industrial revolution in england was a direct result of the napoleonic war america's industrial efflorescence was predicated on the the civil war in the same way so with that as the new focus of of these. This merchant class that universalizing that that that ethical argument kind of lost its purchase because there's no more technical slavery everything else oh. They're you know. Black. People are still being killed and and whipped and oppressed in the south sure but they have the vote it's up to them to fix it. It's up to them to get their money everybody's equal in the market and what and what these people wanted. Was to stop reconstruction or at least let. It stop pushing forward on it getting rid of the tariff and imposing free trade instituting civil service reform so that you couldn't have the spoil system for distributing patronage and replacing elected officials with appointed experts and the guys.

The guy that these guys hated more than anybody in government was you guessed it benjamin butler. They even had a word for his politics butlerism which we could talk which if you look at butlerism. Now it is the closest thing this era had to a egalitarian socialist political project. Benjamin butler was essentially the only guy left standing by the 1870s who was holding the string the the that led guys like august village and the german 49 and the german socialists to fight the civil war. The things that john brown envisioned when he was trying to end slavery and that was a actual expansion of politics to everybody. It was if we are a democracy that means it is government by the people not as the liberals thought government by the best and most refined people who just so happen coincidentally. Not only are they the most refined They are also the people who are on top of all the money so not only was ben butler a very much in favor of vigorous suppression of the klan in the south and and the support of black whites from the federal level. He was in favor of irish independence. He was in favor of women's suffrage. He was in favor of labor reform and greenbacks also. I should point this out as I said earlier wildly crooked. He was a spoilsman through and through he was not. I don't think you could say a good person by any in any kind of existential sense. He was somebody who through the course of his career was pushed in direction that led him to find value. In this you could then and that was really the argument. These guys made is that a guy like butler is a demagogue because he's just using the poor to try to get power for himself.

But even if that's true the politics that he proposed it meant taking seriously the challenge of slavery and of the war to defeat slavery which was to recognize the essential conflict being between classes and that the war against the planters necessitated morally and politically a continued war against private property as it currently existed in the united states. So the way liberals dealt with this conflict the problem of reconstruction the problem that hey we we ended slavery. We created civic equality. We created equality in the market and black people in the south are still very. What's the what's the deal. Here there's two things you can take from that. You can say well it's because it's because the market is not independent of power and politics. There is no natural order you actually have to build and maintain political order and until now in american history. We have had a private property regime a fantasy of yeoman autonomy that was predicated on there being a class of workers who did the most intense the most brutal labor. The most extractive labor who were not part of the political body and the existence of those people allowed for the creation of some sort of classless fantasy. That's what calhoun imagined and once you end that once you bring this proscribed class into the political spectrum into the political world you have fundamentally changed the political. What politics is you have necessitated the transformation of the state and the abolition of the constitutional order in my opinion and change the relationship between people and government and people and political power and economic power towards socialism. The other answer you could say is actually they were inferior the whole time which is what most of the liberal republicans went with liberal republicans looked at the wreckage of reconstruction. The failure of reconstruction by that point said this is because the blacks just weren't up for it even though the conditions that doomed reconstruction were the conditions imposed by their prescribed nostrums not recon not redistributing land not dispossessing the clanters not freely distributing greenback currency not abolishing smallholder debt not doing the things that would have allowed for racist ass white southerners to go you know what I don't really like black people. But hey the war ended and now. I have more land and I'm not in hawk to some. No no no it was their inherent inferiority oops and so the liberal republicans split off from the republican party and in 1872 did an independent convention in cincinnati and this was filled with all of the most sterling liberal lights of the time and also all of the republican office holders who had lost out in party internal battles for power.

Basically it was sore losers and nerds. It was everybody who got boxed out of the the the victorious machine in the state they were from and these who were fixated on the ideological purity of liberalism and they nominated horus greely for president who was a had been a a crusading abolitionist newspaper writer and hater of democrats but who after the war had decided that any attempt to impose equality on the south would have been a violation of natural rights and and and property rights and all the sacred things that make up the american the incoherent and idiotic american creative liberty. And so even though he was pro-tariff and the liberals were her were wildly against the tariff He ended up becoming the figure that the liberals could coalesce around the one they could all agree on and then the democrats who at this point because of disenfranchisement of confederates in the south were in a situation where it was hard to conceive of them winning an election by themselves. Also nominated benjamin horace greeley and because there was no coherence at the top of the ticket. The only real consistent issue they ran on was ending reconstruction and grant ran on the bloody shirt and continuing the fight to for equality and he got he won. 

Grant won 55 percent of the vote which was one of the biggest landslides of the 19th century. It was such a bad ass kicking that horace. Greeley actually died like three weeks after the election and what it really shows is that even at that point even if at the top of the republican party which at this point is being totally dissolved by spoils on the one hand and liberal orthodoxy on the other. There is still an appetite for the war to have meant something for for the struggle and for the sacrifice to have had a meaning that transcended the mundane of politics and it speaks more than anything to me to the potential that lay dormant in that moment and that we that was lost not for the reasons that the dunning-school talked about of course but also not even for the reasons that like liberal sort of tragedists would say a lot of just bad bad rolls of the dice. Sometimes you play d and d and you get a bad roll. But I think the fecundity of the moment more than anything speaks to the fecundity of every moment that no matter how hopeless things seem in the moment that there's always a chance to push through and figures like like the existence of a guy like benjamin butler and his trajectory of his career. I mean he was a guy who he made his money in the civil war by by selling flour to the army who leveraged his relationship with a local bank into getting a commission. Who was by any stretch as much of a self-seeking entrepreneurial scumbag as you'll find in 19th century american politics but because of the pinballing randomness of life and his the encounters that he had over the course of the war he found himself in a situation where he was the national spokesman for a road not taken and the fact that it wasn't taken. I don't know to me means that it could have been okay so next week.

We're gonna wrap it up last two chapters and then I think we'll take a little break. I'm not gonna stop doing the wednesday stream. But I might not have a book for a couple weeks just to like do some other reading. I need to do but we will gonna know it might be black reconstruction although I might take a break from reconstruction right. Now. I will do black reconstruction. I promise it. I just might not do it next just because it's a lot of reconstruction. Maybe cleanse the palate with something maybe do a something about like the german revolution.

I don't know so what were you guys talking about world war. Ii. Oh were the americans useless in europe in world war. Ii. I mean I wouldn't say useless. I think the thing about like the germans winning the russians winning it like obviously. But I mean they were sure got their asses kicked there for a while. I mean if there's a situation where the united states isn't the industrial dynamo. It is because it was the industrial capacity of the united states that beat the germans more than their military involvement in the war that did it. Grant was very much an eisenhower figure. Eisenhower grant in washington are all I would say in the same basket of presidents in that they are figures who emerge from a war a a conflict a distribution of the status quo to validate the new status quo and and who's who's um whose symbolic role as like deliverer of victory allows them to subsume all of the contradictions of that moment into themselves and sublimate them which means that they are all kind of by definition reactionary figures. But like in a relative sense you know like grant like I've said did a lot more than the liberal republicans wanted him to do but was not um. Was still a reaction to radical republicanism and a desire to see it not ascend anymore the same way eisenhower. Even though he you know he validated.

The the new deal consensus for the republican side was a suppression both of like at that point the sort of I guess declining radicalism of the new deal because by 52 thanks to the second red scare and the taft-hartley act. The the radical edge of the new deal is is very much guttering out by that point but also of the sort of resurgent right populist. The the the taft wing of the republican party. The the ring that is now the whole of the party who were neutralized by the cabal of wall street. Financiers who voiced in eisenhower on the convention which is literally what he did and just like washington washington was an avatar of american liberty but then in power he validated the federalist concentration of capital and the the the alienation of rights away from the states and away from the land into into money yeah rip peter sleeping a reformer without results. He was definitely a reformer but no results for peter saleem worked at the opera and the last thing.

I want to say and this is something that I said in one of the white streams. I think talking about the liberal republicans and this liberal movement here that takes over that it becomes the center mass of politics. Historically anyway and it's very important to note that the liberal republicans and the people they represented were always a very small percentage of the population. They had no real ability to control events as you can see by the fact that all they could do is get a doofus old editor who was dying nominated who got his ass kicked um but they were influential in retrospect and influential off of the scenes because they were they were the the the articulation of the culture. These are the people who wrote about stuff. These were the people who wrote all of the good press that we looked through to understand the past so they structured the culture even though they were not necessarily in control of it and they are even though their ideology is now the ideology of the right wing. The people are the class itself is still around and they over the course of the 19th century went from being having this like reactionary politics of hard money and los angeles. By the turn of the century. These are all these this type of person. It's different people they're people who have grown into it. They're they're younger people who have displaced those older people are progressive because by that point they could no longer sustain the illusions of the liberal republicans because capitalism by that point had definitively failed to provide what the liberals had insisted it would and so they decided that a more interventionist model was necessary and that's where progressivism comes from.

But the fundamental reality is that they can never truly challenge capitalism because of their betterness within it and now we have a situation where you've got this pmc that people freak out about and they do have that same class position. But the difference between the historical iterations of these people and the current moment is that there is no working class for them to bamboozle or undermine we're all in essentially the same class position in this country. In that we do not have any class awareness. We don't operate from class consciousness it was coming into being in the 19th century. It came into fruition during the new deal era and then it started to decay in the 60s and 70s and and it's been finally over the last 40 years abolished because you've got to remember. Every cycle brings new people like not not new classes necessarily not new relationships and proximities to capital but new people who are responding to the world that the previous people had made so those young. Those progressives who come into the ranks of the intelligentsia in the 1890s are coming into the world made by the in in large part the liberal republicans and they respond to that but they respond within the structure and now everybody is responding to a structure that is where structure is dissolved where the individual is. The only thing which was the dream of the of the liberals like they've got it but I don't think any of them would look at the society we have and say that it was what they wanted.

But that's because they were never doing what they thought they were doing. They were. They were convincing themselves as every point that they were generating this culture but they were really doing was advancing. Capitalism and capitalism doesn't give a about any of your niceties doesn't care about the culture that you're trying to preserve. It only cares about surplus value and the extraction of surplus value over time is a series of traumas that deform and reduce and undermine every structure of of meaning within a society and leave it atomized and and miserable even and and no one will who is exercising. The will of this thing can stop it because they don't know that's what they're doing. And that's that is what ideology does. Ideology takes all the bad feelings that accumulate from being part of a extractive exploitative isolating economic system and creates a culture that validates them one way or the other and right. Now we're in the situation. We are with like the polarization and the the epistemic bubbles because we have finally achieved a situation. We have re-established a situation rather that existed before the civil war where you have two poles of capital that generate their own cultural frameworks that are totally separate the the land-based extractive capital culture of mega and the coastal finance capital of the democrats.

I did see the thing about tenet that was pretty funny. Although apparently like it was not in 2000. It was in 2006. I don't know. I don't know that much about it. I don't try to get into the 911 thing because I would go insane. My opinion of the people in the bush administration would be no different if I found out they did 9 11 or not all right folks.

 well friday. We'll do another chill out. I don't know if I'm gonna do. I don't know if chris will be free to to game but if he isn't. I'll still just hang out and take questions. Bye folks.
