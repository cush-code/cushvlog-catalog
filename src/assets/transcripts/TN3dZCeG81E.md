It's a dead man's party who could ask for more. It's about dead. Man's party leave your body at the door leave your body in this hole. At the door. It's a dead man's party who could ask for more baby. It's a dead man's party leave your body and soul at the door. It's a dead man's party who could ask for more. It's the dead man's body leave your daddy and soul at the door.

Hi folks so recession gonna happen very shortly just letting everyone know. Obviously. It's pretty clear if it happens before november katie bar the door when we look at those midterms holy. Luck It's gonna be a bloodbath if that happens we'll see obviously. I don't predict things anymore. But this crypto trap crash certainly feels like a a tremor. The fact that like amazon has been sliding into the oblivion for the last month I mean it was inevitable right. The question really is is can the sort of You know large-scale monetary intervention that they did in march of 2020. Work again or can you only hit that button. Once. If not then we're in for some very interesting times to say the least but who knows I like. I said I'm economics not a strong suit like bredjnev. You know. I was like. I'm not really the economics. I'm not too strong on the ideology yeah. I'll talk about that all day but anyway um that's why I i cannot. That's why I never invested in any crypto. That's why it has nothing to do with morality so much as I have no idea how to do it or how to do it in such a way that wouldn't destroy me. I all.

I know is every time I go to vegas. I try to do a three-team parlay and like football. If I'm there during the season so that I can you know hey maybe a little cash and every time. I've done it not only do. I lose the parlay which is not that hard because you only need one of the teams that you pick to lose. But I got it perfectly wrong like if I picked the opposite of what I thought was going to happen. I would have won if there's a way for you to I guess.

That's what hedge funds are for but you got to already be a billionaire for that to work yeah. It is it's interesting because you know how if it happens again I'm not predicting. I'm now saying if the real question is can the print money button still work in that context in a context where inflation is actually happening for the first time. In 40 years you can talk about why inflation is happening but it's pretty clearly happening and even if most of it is exogenous and it's clearly not based on any like specific american policy because it's happening everywhere like that's what's so funny about I mean. Obviously it works because people are dumb but just like trying to try to raz poor brandon over inflation when it is happening. Everywhere is is not very fair and you know that what we've been talking about on this stream for years now oh my god years now is the is the fact that like the weird stasis we're in is being held together by a a economic status quo that even though it is steady and slower is miseration the immiseration is steady and in doubt and steady and slow. I mean if anything you'd have to see like a private sector bank bailout like an actual attempt to do some sort of like corporate based debt jubilee or something like that it would have to be corporate based because there's no way in hell. The government could be expected to pass anything anymore that's by design like the the thing Obviously we know that the wealthy rule right and that they dominate politics and determine what is acceptable policy but like the real tool. At this point. is less like a specific proposal specific policies benefiting specific industries as it is the effect that money has to make anything other than the routine corruption of bribed legislators operating on behalf of their patrons go through but that means that in a time of crisis you can't do anything except what they've been doing which is the stuff that doesn't require legislation like fed policy.

So everyone is everyone has to wonder like hey the bad news is you know we might be seeing. This deadlock break up the good news though it's not like anyone was enjoying themselves you know like that. Is we get addicted to our misery you know and it makes us scared of anything else because we can only imagine it being worse but you know fluidity. Kind of by definition includes a range of possibilities and you can't say anything else than that without doing the thing. I was talking about which is talking yourself into paralysis. I don't know we'll see where we're going. We won't need roads So I did this stream mainly to announce that yes I've decided just in time maybe for for global capitalism to enter into its it's terminal swan dive again. Not predicting this is all just in the air and it might be for the rest of our lives who the knows that we are going to read for the book club the leo panic and sam grinden classic making of global capitalism and we'll do for the first for next friday.

And I did this to get a little bit of like extra time for anybody to get the book or whatever next friday. I'll talk about the intro and the first chapter and then we'll figure out after that. like what pace to go at after I kind of see you know how how long it is. I sadly do not have the book. I had to get it with the e version which I i appreciate the convenience of but we'll never fully enjoy like if I'm reading on my phone. Even though I'm reading a book which you know is the thing that is better always and every time better than being on the internet. It still feels like I'm on the internet. I think I might have a follow-up if we're still streaming you know if everything hasn't fallen apart I think after this book we might do a book that I do have a copy of a physical copy first class passengers on a sinking ship by richard lachman which I think will also be very appropriate. Yes you should be revolted. I mean even with the e-readers though and I I've had the e-readers it still feels like like I'm having the infernal demon stare into my soul instead of you know the contained and and long-form expression of a human mind which is what a book is but one way or another. We're all going to have to find god to deal with this. That's what I really do believe broadly defined and and syncretic and and dialectical which is why i. I have absolutely no truck with neo-traditionalists with people trying to bring back the old religion to me that is a sign that you kind of recognize it's the same thing as and it's not surprising a lot of the same people. It's the same psychic phenomenons.

The people who decided oh the problem with the reason we're here. I thought the problem was you know we got these bad republicans and then we've got these ineffectual or crooked democrats but the democratic party like as as a structure and as a social base. I should say a consumer base is a more effective is a hypothetical device to challenge power and then we've all found out last five years No. I mean it never was we've lost that opportunity a long time ago but every generation has to discover it anew for themselves because they will never be convinced by past events that they didn't experience because of the motivated reasoning that goes into our political considerations. We can have all the jaded veterans insist to us that no this is all a dead end. None of this can work but the alternative to that means if you want to do politics you have to challenge the state with your body coming to existential conflict with power which is a terrifying prospect that most people not their fault not because their beings are going to prefer. And so if that possibility exists to organize legally within the framework of the state for change in a way that feels meaningful you're going to take it and so there was nowhere else that this youth energy was going to go then into electoral politics that is one of the funny things about people who insisted like the sanders campaign was sheep dipping people away from revolution. No it doesn't matter how more radicalized people were by 2008.

Only very few of them are ever going to want to do the work of entering a cadre organization and go through political training and undergo the discipline of like a leninist party because it's boring because it's tedious. They would rather do something else and the prospect therefore of voting for a candidate in a major party that you can imagine actually winning. An election is going to be more appealing to once again regular people and those people who are in the cadres it doesn't make them better. Some of them are better. Some of them are political holy warriors. John brown's of our age god bless them but a lot of them are just neurotic in a specific way that just manifests itself in a political obsessiveness. So there was no way that the 2008 that like occupy or the oa crash was ever going to put some revolutionary position into existence. We were two yes the the crash destroyed like any hope of generational advancement but in the here and now there is still benefits to be to be gained as a totally uprooted subject somebody who cannot fend for themselves who the prospect of living outside of systems of capitalism and and the culture of capitalism and so therefore are addicted to it in a significant way and so they're going to find a way to change things that doesn't put them in a jackpot. So they're going to vote.

In elections. It was going to be some kind of left challenge to hillary. However it was conceived of but like now the experience of it. Failing has made. People have to come to that crossroads and look down and be like okay so what is political action what is political subjectivity it with this new knowledge. This knowledge of a thing that was always true that others from previous generations had experienced but that we all had to experience for ourselves in order to be disabused of we have to have the experience of it we have have to have the memory of doing a thing and having it fail and and remembering. It hasn't happened as opposed to looking backward as something that happened to other people and a lot of people realize oh. This democratic party is is a is a totally useless vessel. It can't be a It cannot generate class power well as again that brings you back to square one okay if the legal methods of political mobilization are lost to us. Then what do we have to do to be political that brings us to the imperative to be illegal and nobody wants to do it.

So of course. Some people are going to squint at the republican party and because they have not experienced being inside the republican party they have not experienced how culture interacts with with capital to guarantee that all the base no matter how what their you know Beliefs are about discrete issues. Be it medicare for all or anything else are always going to be directed towards the ends of concentrated capital. They cannot be organized orthogonally to it any more than they can in the democratic party. But if you haven't had that experience get on the ride again do it again trade. Bernie sanders for josh hawley trade aoc for jd vance or if you're super edgy mtg and then have the same experience again being comforted the whole time that your sterile engagement in a political spectacle is meaningful political action. A lot of the people who are having that experience are being having experienced the the dead end of of of materialist capitalism. The dead end of like a secular world that agrees collectively that only the material is real that there is no agreed-upon framework for conceptualizing the invisible but real interconnectedness of beings otherwise known as god.

Without that framework we just dig monstrous. We just build statues to ourselves and they crumble immediately because they're made out of. Because we're we are we're turning inward. We're hurting those around us and then using that hurt that we experience from others to justify our behavior towards them and then just making a life that just manufac just is buying buying literal refuse driving feces and then stacking it into different shapes. That's they've experienced that and they're like no thank you. But what do they want to replace it with the exact same sterile structures of power serving religious authority that brought about this moment that brought about this new reality now again who I'm talking about this is a fraction of people that is much magnified by being on the internet. It's it's. It's it's not a politically significant force.

 in fact it's it's it's going to be as it's going to find itself to be politically much less powerful within the republican party even than the left quote-unquote is within the democrats but it will have a similar long-term effect on the republicans actual agenda which is basically nothing and the reason for that is that it doesn't matter what anyone's discreet opinion on any issue is the only way that they can express their belief on an on any opinion of their opinion on any issue and the only way that they can stack different issue preferences in order of importance to determine what to do is to pick between the democrats and republicans and the democratic and republican parties make policy according to organized um interest not disorganized interest an 880 million americans with just a a pringle tube worth of votes contributing to the election of a bunch of people who are spending every day and whose election was only possible with the and acceptance of a class of people who are fully aligned and conscious of their interests and have more than their votes to give have money. This cannot be defeated from below because you can say oh look all these people believe in this stuff and we can run someone who says they believe in this stuff well even if you can beat the person who's going to just press the culture button which at this point is much more central to people's political identity. They get in their their position as minority will neutralize them. But yes we can't the the the catholic church. The catholic church has been the un the catholic church has been the catholic church's power in italy spain ireland has never really been challenged. It's been shaved down over the years but the cultural influence of the catholic church and it's though that influences written reinforcement in like state structures in the mediterranean is still potent and has only recently even begun to really decline and yet those countries no one believes in.

God. In fact it is being under the rule into modernity of a power serving political religious structure that has made them discarded not their not even their their narcissism necessarily their experience of the of the church and those guys have the same birth rate problems that we do and then you got a guy like orban yeah. He he says awesome based stuff about soros but his government is literally just about taking eu subsidies and dumping them into the hands of his patriotic network and if you have religion being supporting these sort of cynical neoliberal sorry you're not escaping it. This way political structures it will only breed cynicism. It won't breed belief in anything man somebody's talking about india india scares me. I gotta say that was I think we talked about this when we talked about um ministry for the future. By the way the first chapter of the ministry for the future the 20 million dead heatwave in india.

 we're getting like a stage rehearsal for that right now which is very terrifying. I mean it's only may and it's 120 degrees We're getting near that wet bulb number that we're all terrified to think of and of course in ministry of the future that leads to this new like global commitment to to ending climate change and also leads to the overthrow of bjp in india that like the hindutva thing is discredited and overthrown and I gotta say in the world we live in. It seems much more likely that continued climate crisis in india is going to lead to a full-scale genocide against the muslims there because who are you going to be madder at about. You know it being 100 degree 120 degrees every day your family member your older family members dying who are you going to be mad at who are you going to be more viscerally angry at if that happens what the global north or or your prime ministers or somebody who you can hit right now somebody that you can lay hands on because if we understand politics to be about ex like yes it's about seeking an interest but that interest is defined by a libidinal drive.

Like socialism is supposed to align those so that your your will to power and your libido is aligned with the broader project of overthrowing capitalism and we did have like that alignment did occur in places and places in america and times. But it's unstable and it was defeated over and over again and now it barely exists anywhere. I mean india is a place that does have it like a huge communist party but you know that's also because it's a gigantic country and there's the bjp is bigger because voting is one act that feels good to do.

But the less comfortable you are the less satisfying that vote is or the of your urges. The more you want to do something else something additional and the thing you're going to want to do. It's going to involve conflict with someone the attempt to overthrow and to dominate somebody and I say if you if you're if you're outraged at your life. Conditions immediately transfers into a rage at capital and its representatives then that urge to do violence. One way or the other can be directed productively but if you don't have that framework that heuristic for processing your pain then whoever then who you're going to blame for it is going to come after the ques is going to come after the more important question of who can I take this out on and that's that's at this stage.

That is what we have turned people into so yeah. We're having a fun time tonight as I said this is all terrifying but also the present is terrifying. You know. The only thing that's really changes is your ability to imagine the continuation of your specific and and comfortable misery but discomfort leads to a bunch of things and it's the fear we well. I think. I mean I'm talking about myself here. But I think what often happens is that we we. I we basically identify discomfort and make it identical to annihilation because we are so addicted to the narrow. The few comforts we can stack together but there will be the discomfort can come with it greater satisfaction than the meager. things you can scrape together by you know trying to stay on the beam and that's why we must always function. At the end of the day.

We are all required not by some transcendent moral obligation but by for by actual self-interest fully considered to be optimists because optimism requires action requires interaction requires vulnerability exchange love and those things regardless of your material conditions enrich your life in a way that can't be found in the in the isolated life of someone who's feels spiritually castrated and that means that if the terrible thing does happen the terrible thing that we're all terrible that we all can't even speak of not some swift apocalypse as I said that would be a that would be blessing rather a a a mid 20th century vibe. Let's put it that way a early 17th century european vibe or early 17th century worldwide vibe. I said say since this is sort of a replay of the crisis of the 17th century in a lot of ways you'll be actually able to deal with it. Even if it destroys you it will destroy you only physically which is inevitable for us anyway which is built in. But we will meet that death with purpose which is all that we're ever seeking. I think that if anyone saw the northmen I think that that it's a great film and it's very good at showing the alien psychology of the pre-modern world and and by doing so it shows something that we do not understand which is to live with a socially reinforced fully committed to existentially spiritually grounded and incontestable purpose.

We will all die anyway as the most hollow sentiment when being asked to ground be ground into meat for capital. That is not what I'm talking about what are you talk what are you talking about I'm talking about adapting to changing conditions by decoupling oneself from the treadmill of of narrow short-term. sensory satisfaction which is what is going to grind you into capital because what capitalism is and the thing that makes it different is that it is fundamentally existentially self-enforcing in a way that no previous economic order ever was thanks to technology's intervention into the dynamic of class rule. The coercion that formerly resided largely in alienated social structures institutions and literally people is now internalized and it is fear of death because of our lack of faith that keeps us compliant what. I'm saying is that the fact of death that it is inevitable means that the task of coming to terms with it is not up is not optional. You cannot not confront it.

The treadmill we're talking about that keeps you on You know one foot in front of the other. necessitates a project of continually avoiding so yeah. We're all gonna die. Anyway is how you stop allowing yourself on all of us allowing ourselves from being ground up because what's the worst that can happen and if that's it and you can find a symbolic language to carry the knowledge around with you. That death isn't you know the end of anything that that you know you're basically a ghost already. Then the end of you know the narrow band of pleasure that we're allowed is not the end of the world as we imagine it now because a life without pleasures material pleasures is by avoiding like oh. I mean without those things. We can't avoid anymore we can't avoid having to confront it. I think once again I'm speaking for myself but like as long as I had a pleasure in front of me or more realistically the prospect of a pleasure in front of me. I could think about that pursuit.

I did not have to sit with the emptiness that modern life creates because here's the thing if you sit with it long enough. It fills up because empty is the same thing as full right if nothing means anything. Then everything means everything that might sound like gibberish but I really do believe it. I think that's that is what you end up with in in silence which is what we all seek to avoid because we're scared of the emptiness and so scared that we would rather spend the brief time we have avoiding it then grappling with it and like that's what the phones have done for us. There's no time left that you have to just be with yourself. You you can spend your entire day in like god knows. I did for years never having to be with yourself to be able to to follow a breadcrumb trail of desire away from your center but the thing is if you spend enough time with it it.

There is a transformation now the problem is for you that that knowledge to be translated into action. It has to be socially reinforced and reflected which is what we have destroyed. Those structures don't exist anymore so instead like those previous people who just walked around with purpose like they couldn't avoid it like in northman. He he's runs away from and he's like hanging out with berserkers doing raids and he's avoiding you know the vow he made to his his father and then he is he's path idiot which is a voice. We all feel and hear. But we cannot manifest it. It can only be this the cacophonous modern stream of consciousness. It cannot be alienated into like the thing that the voice that we need to hear which is a voice from outside because any voice that we know is. Our own we also know where its interests lie and we know that it is self-serving and so that we can second guess it and then spend our time neutralizing it. This isn't like the first act of the movie.

I don't think this is really a spoiler also. It's based on amaleth. It's already out there aka hamlet. You know what happens in hamlet come on yes he was high on mushrooms. He didn't know that that made you high. He doesn't know what high means what are you. Talking about it. Just thinks it's why would one mushroom just you eat and why would one mushroom poison you and why would one run one mushroom make you see bjork.

I'm I'm saying is that his brain is is unmediated in a way. Ours isn't which means that he can have a confrontation in the form of bjork with his subconscious now of course. His destiny. The thing he should be doing is not a good thing that someone should do. He's offered the choice to you know choose love and he doesn't choose it because he was acculturated into a savage warrior society that murdered and pirated and that wanted to create people who would murder and pirate. But once he's back on the path. He loses the the angst that he had had and he just hurdles towards this annihilation that fulfills his destiny once again spoiler alert but as I said hamlet and this is why I'm with marx that we cannot do what grab grow on us to do and just will ourselves into a different mind space because the culture we're in conditions us at such a level that yes the the basic like communion with the universe that we all feel was in viking society transmitted into this kill command. But because it was socially reinforced because it was is you know imprinted at a very young age like the the initiation scene where him and his dad go into the cave and and roll around He can't challenge that that is deeper than anything else it has to be changed not in his lifetime but over lifetimes.

New social arrangements have to be built that create different understandings of the world that confuse our sympathetic nervous system's connection to the universe with a practice of love. What do you mean northbound is not real history of course that it's the myth they told each other and we know it worked. They conquered what they just took over northern france and the french just said here. We'll give it to you don't stop stabbing us they took sicily. They took it away from the moors took away for the berbers ran ireland and england for a while considering that it's the that is an effective regime of coercing consent not through force. But through social reality we all live in social realities that do that work now. It can work one way in a plunder society where all of the males are able to avoid being or feeling exploited within their social structure by acquiring from others by expressing violence outward but a contained social order. The modern social orders we have now for example. They can't do that social reality changes because changes have material reality modernity creates the condition where a universal subjectivity can be kept in your head and we all have it to one extent or another. Like racist. Of course you know think oh look look at me and my look at my phylum of humanity look at how I've all got them laid out according to haplogroup and and their worthiness.

According to that that's all cope that's all them trying to claw back something that they cannot fully dispossess themselves of which is a notion of a human subjectivity eyes looking back at you and that is that globalized networks of of economic extraction were necessary to build that cosmopolitan social relations in a d sec. Or in a secularized context. That is a place where sectarian religious worlds could be dissolved was necessary. Those those those isolated religious worlds had to dissolve the fight for the working class. Was was the spiritual project that was supposed to reawaken them and reform them and if it had maintained itself if it had maintained its forward momentum it would have but as soon as it began to retreat from conflict with capital into accommodation within it It's the spiritual project died or began to die you know once again. This takes generations to occur but yeah we're all going to meet in the in the in the sweet by by anyway.

No matter what's on the horizon we all have to still live and we should live in a way that allows us to attune our desire for purpose with our love of others and that means abandoning politics as a release valve as a pla as a spectacle and reformulating it as a as a daily act because that means that no matter what discomforts dis dissolution and danger come that purpose will what it will do is will. It will tell you what to do in the moment and I think that's the thing that scares us about this is that we we have we have made peace with our lives as they are and we know how to respond to the questions that we are asked every day to press a lever a yes or no to avoid the worst and to get the better to avoid the electric shock in the skinner box and to get the pellet. We know what answers to give the thing we're scared of about different arrangement. More than anything is that we won't know what to do. We won't know which door to go through and felt purpose pursued purpose as opposed to felt and pursued rejection distraction. from that purpose that comes from listening to the to the void within listening and waiting for it to fill cuts through the paralysis that makes us so afraid to leave our comfort zone and even now even if things stay where they are stay stay static. The pursuit of purpose like that can make it so that maybe the questions that were so soothing because they only had one answer all of a sudden.

Another answer becomes possible. Another answer becomes pursuable and then we break our relationship to our lives away from being fully dominated as we are now so yeah. I mean we're all waiting with fear and trembling. We can take the time we do have to try to listen to try to sit with ourselves and see what arises because we've been robbed of a of a common symbolic language. To make sense of that you know we can't bjork's not gonna pop up but that doesn't mean that we cannot because of our own experiences in life. find something that works for us in the moment and then we can then use for future action. This is my chair is good. I have a new chair. It's got a back so. I'm not. I'm not tipping on this bench so very comfortable now because here's the thing if if york shows up and you think that if you think oh that's bjork that's my subconscious telling me what. I should be doing. Then. If what it's telling you you should be doing is scary. You'll never do it until forced to by outside actions you'll never initiate progress towards it. You got to think that bjork is different. You got to think bjork is is somebody else.

You got to think it's. It comes from something else and I think even like the most you know universalist mushy. New age conception of god can have that in it because if we do accept the notion that you know god is everything and we are connected to them because of our You know our role as a single you know pinprick into a like a giant night sky of of god eyes or or like that we're all any any hippie. use to describe it. We're all fast it's on a diamond or something like that then. There's still a that is a connection to something that is so vastly beyond our ability to conceive of but that we still interact with at a visceral cellular level that is also too vast for us to interact with like how much of our mind is doing stuff without us knowing it and has to because if we had to pay attention to it all we wouldn't be able to do any of it that information is there. This is what we're talking about when you talk about subconscious so it's not just our subconscious. It is a beam from a greater a higher consciousness a higher being and its orders can direct us with that same certainty. Even if we know that it's just our minds because we know that even that is not just us because we're not in our heads alone. There is no yeah. The self is obviously an illusion. I mean you are just the accumulation of what you have encountered.

Symbols have power to you because you have seen them reinforce. Otherwise and your definition of terms is entirely embedded in the context that you've encountered them which is why everything ends up. Conscious politics ends up being this sterile conflict between these fake binaries because they can only see their reflection in the mirror and try to punch it. That's all politics can be absent a material imperative but again this is not a process that is going to happen because some. You know writes a book about it or or starts an app.

It's gonna happen because people in their millions and billions are going to have to by necessity address their relationship to their lives. Now they're not all going to do it and they're not going to do it at the same time and in the same way but some of them are you might be one of them and even if it all comes to nothing and we're all swallowed by the sea. Your end will have had meaning which will have meant that you will have been redeemed in the fight and that's all that we can seek because anything else that we seek is a delay of an inedible of an inevitable reckoning with the fall from from material embodiment to disembodiment to the end of the body and that means it's going to be people coming to these realizations individually in the greater project of trying to survive. It was well conceived in theory but it doesn't work in life comrade has to wonder is it even worth the effort if you're ever less than certain about the world. Please don't let this worry get your way into your work and if you would stick up for me in the face of great adversity know that I would do it all. The same for it was well conceived in theory but it doesn't work in life me. I will not write it off not ever having tried what's happening in sri lanka. I mean the future of mr kids happening. Now you know like you don't really have to do a lot of.

I used to be an idiot and think oh man. I hope. I don't die while things are still going going down because how am I going to know what's going to happen. It's like you can figure it out man. All you got to do is look around you and just imagine what is happening in some places happening in others. Somebody's asking is children of men. The best film of that decade I mean I absolutely think so and one of the best films of the 21st century I saw that film in the theater and I I was at the end of it absolutely like stunned and I cried and I was shaking because I felt like. I had seen like the future and I knew in my heart that I was not going to do anything about it that.

I wasn't going to be able to meaningfully address it because of my deeper knowledge that it was unavoidable and of course you know. It shows that the value of art cannot be reduced to its political utility because like I said. I saw this movie it cracked. Me open did it make me into some sort of political jihadist who you know sacrificed for the greater good. No I i found myself following the the electoral politics breadcrumb trail and the the emotive internet. political culture breadcrumb trail just like everybody else including tons of people who saw that movie all that art can do is provide like a single brick in a wall of life experience that will eventually come to a point will eventually be turned into something that can be lived in yeah. Somebody says that the master is like the ultimate movie about america certainly post-war america like if you think of that movie as in as a way. It's like as as the post-war american male psyche trying to assimilate the trauma that it had just experienced in a culture that refused to allow that to happen a culture that said okay. I know that happened to you guys. That's a real bummer but now that's over come back to america live like you're.

A normal person live like that didn't happen to you and then you have this psych. This schizophrenic split that occurs between you have the person who has who in response to that trauma decides to become entirely mind entirely rationality or or some pseudo version of of mastery of of of the carnal and the person and the ma and the the the the rampaging and unleashed libido and the the This. The spirit sort of chased out of the body and the whole movie is this you know this lock. This this binary star system between these two who just can't stop wanting to be near each other even though they can't stay together. Just like the is the fractured post-war mind held together but in this state of of constant polarized excitement. I stopped logging movies on letterbox just because I don't know letterbox was kind of bumming me out the whole culture over there and I felt like. I had. I was doing one of these awful websites to be honest enough so he says imagine how much worse it was in europe well in europe. One way or the other. They got to confront the trauma because they couldn't escape it. It was their countries and that's one of the reasons that politics there you know maintained its vigor.

Someone says their co-workers want to get into nfts. I guess they want to buy the dip good luck. That's all I can say yeah somebody's asking about american vulcanization. It's not going to be state by state once again. I I don't know if it happens. I doubt it would be states by states civil war style. It would be it would be or it would be archipelagoes of urbanity in in seas of of exurban reaction and you'd have different local regimes in power there and forcing different social rules serviced by you know a single largely privatized supply chain and like there'd be you know. There would be places that you could get like a whole zone of control across geography. But a lot of it would be you know serious style. Just think that's way more likely than like fascism from the center. But you know hey. I've been wrong before certainly. We'll see somebody asked about the american carnation revolution.

I know that I've joked about that before I don't actually think that's terribly likely. But I gotta say this this thing with the texas national guard. trying to unionize is pretty interesting that's unprecedented. That's another thing that's never happened before. I mean obviously. It's not a huge movement. But you know it shows that that you cannot assume the the solidarity the total internal solidarity of all these structures of power and if you can't then you know opportunities open up certainly. I mean I'm not saying like that's going to mean anything probably won't.

It's just interesting because you know what happened was that as an election stunt the governor. governor hot wheels what's his name greg abbott sent a bunch of national guardsmen up on very short notice to secure the border and they just stood around it was a total photo op and they got pissed. They got pissed to just arbitrarily be sent there and and told to do that and you know you. I think that when you look at this kind of question too schematically you think oh texas national guardsmen being told to go defend the border. They were probably psyched. They were probably doing chants and marching in jack boot unison to to carry out their white supremacist power fantasies. Some of them might have been but a lot of them were guys who were like hey. I gotta cancel my barbecue or like. I can't go into work and now I gotta stand around in a and that will have the effect of det attaching people. From these you know these ties of like cultural affinity. Oh man somebody wants to know more about fort bragg. we're gonna do an episode. Soon a deep dive about fort bragg holy.

Now of course it could just be yeah. That's what the us military does you put enough military guys together and certainly enough special operators and they will eat themselves like the the concentrated psychic poison in a place. Like that cannot. It's gonna go places but I would say that in addition to just the general you know cannibalistic vibe that a place like that probably curates there's at the very least significant drug arms and maybe human trafficking going on there. Now that could all just be the kind of organized crime you would imagine to see in a city full of armed dudes who are getting paid government salaries and it's happening under the brass's eyes without their under knowledge that's probably some of it. But again we know for a fact that any significant or organized crime organization in the world has ties to the us.

 you know deep state intelligence community. That's not conspiracy theory that's not paranoia that's fact you know like it's. It's you don't even have to go back to air america or the. We know we haven't pretty well confirmed that the dea or that the cia and elements within the dea not only created the zetas and you could say once again oh. Those guys got their training and then turned on them okay fine whatever they still trained them. They still were in contact with them but also supported with like intelligence the sinaloa cartel and its war with them. The amount of the access to unt unlimited basically and un traceable funds provided by organized crime and also the the guarantee of loyalty that you have with an organized crime organization. is completely unprecedented. You can't buy it elsewhere if you're working as a guy. If you're working with with an organized crime group. You do not have to worry about them betraying you to the communists at least during the cold war. It went because you knew for a fact that what they cared about was money so as long as you're paying the most and uncle sam always has the deepest pockets you're assured of their loyalty. So if there's a you know If there's any kind of heavy-duty organized crime happening at fort bragg.

It is someone probably knows about it at a high level and it's serving some interest that doesn't mean they're sacrificing people in a vault underneath. But I mean. I don't know. I would say that it's likely all those things are happening at once. You've got just you know the regular domestic violence that happens when you have a bunch of troops together in one place who've been traumatized by war. Then you add to that it's just the ambient aggression spilling out and also you know people just doing low low-level organized crime and then there's probably some people there who are doing like real. You know like moving weight and it's all probably happening at the same time and then everyone's covering for each other. The fact that there was a one person whose guy one troop whose body was found in his bunk in an advanced state of decomposition are you. Kidding me guy you went up beheaded by other troops on a camping trip damn near damn near behind ever beyond everything that tom damn near beyond everything yeah.

I heard that trump wanted to bomb mexico. Of course. He did because he doesn't know he doesn't know about the deal. He doesn't know that because this is how this is how it works is that you've got people on the political side who genuinely think we're war with there's a war on drugs that we are pursuing towards an end and then there are people who work there every day and whose jobs don't depend on elections who are informed of the deeper reality that this stuff is permanent fixture of the world economy we couldn't get rid of it if we wanted to and we don't want to my god oh my tons of untraceable cash. We get to arm guarant reliably right-wing forces in countries that we're exploiting colonially and we get to flood our de-industrialized urban and rural areas with pacific pacifying drugs that also might have the effect of knocking off some of that surplus welfare population where is the downside oh and justify giant military and police budgets federally and state and incarceration where is this and where is anywhere in this a disincentive where is there any disincentive from somebody who doesn't depend on elections to want to end this if they could and again. Even if everyone was aligned in the government you know what. It wouldn't even work. It wouldn't happen and it's that knowledge that persists and what you had during the trump presidency was trump was just in there like a little kid in a helicopter moving all the bells and whistles and moving all the he'd seen on tv the opinions of an actual grumpy old republican ah these drug cartels what if we just kill them all well well let's let's just kill.

These guys it's like -h yeah very nice. No you can't do that yeah the worst thing to happen and it was totally inevitable though the worst thing to happen popular politically is is for this concept of a deep state to be branded in association with the republicans and of course. There's a bunch of morons who then think okay now. I gotta support the republicans because you know they've got. This folk conception of the deep state that is more accurate than the liberal fantasy of deliberative government. But their version of it is this inevitably right-wing fantasy that is just the the er fan the ur anxiety of of fascism. The other the alien other perverting our institutions from inside it's an error. It always ends up being anti-semitism because there has to be someone to blame. What what what the left offers is a systemic critique that eliminates blame and eliminates.

The need to assign. Blame allows you to identify systems and points within systems to attack collectively and you know people can say oh this or that piece of popular culture. This or that political project is a psyop. It's a fed alex. Jones is a fed or whatever maybe but I can totally see how it happens naturally or you know naturally just as an outcome of of capitalist alienation the the the cons the the subsumption of all politics in narrative spectacle and what we what we absorb. Narratively we have a folk understanding that people are in charge of things of events that systems are invisible in our telling of our lives and our world to ourselves what we read in the newspaper. What we see on television what we see in movies. They all tell us that the structures are secondary to the wills of the people within them and so that means that our when things go bad our ability to explain to ourselves.

What's going bad requires a cast of specific villains and only conservativism. Specifically you know fascism conservativism and crisis bourgeois liberalism and crisis. The whole system in crisis can offer that liberalism offers another version of bad guys. White male millionaires white male rich guys. That's why their solution is oh diversify power and of course that's that's not going to get there any more than than your. Q trials would the left alternative to both of those is a systemic critique which is gone. It was there in glimmers it had to be expressed largely through the democratic party. So it was baffled. It had to contend with a culture that was personalized but it was there it was it was a voice. It was an echo and now it's been quieted all right. So that's today's next friday.

We'll be doing introduction in chapter one of panic and giblin's the rise of global capitalism. That's right folks. We love it when capitalism rises in a global fashion since we're now perhaps living in its decline. No no perhaps about it. We're definitely living in its decline just where in the phase is the only real question all right take it sleazy. Next friday talk to you then you.
