There we go 16 times and what do you get another day older and deeper and dead save. Peter don't you call me cause. I can't go I owe my soul to the company's store. Now now some people say a man is made out of poor man's made out of muscle and blood muscle and blood and bone and steel and the right one won't get you. Then the left all right folks how you doing so. I know that a lot of people have said after my post-election stream when I laid out the case for the The incurable deadlock between two purely culturally effective political parties that cannot be resolved by any appeal to material conditions because that's black pill and that that's doom scrolling or whatever that means and especially since. I just kind of ended with if something comes it'll come from below and I can't say what it is. It's like god damn that's a kick the groonies what and while I still can't say how it'll happen or who will be participating in it because that's gonna have to occur in the moment. I do think now having thought about it a little bit that I have an idea a sense of what the general's general shape of such a thing would be. So. I could lay it out and given a description of how I think something might emerge that people could keep an eye out for and involve themselves with if it comes into their view personally not something that imposed about from me or something that exists now that's for sure but like just structurally just to give people a something to think about while they're trying to tend their own garden without getting too doom doom scrolled or whatever the hell so let's go to the election. Let's start there looks like biden has won looks like the threat of the com trump. Coup literally did just turn out to him be him asking someone else to do it and everyone being like nah. Things are fine we'd rather we wouldn't rather we would not like to risk either our lives in the form of like his supposed shock troops who were going to come and flood the zone and initiate the day of the rope or that are careers in the form of the people at the top of the political and judicial structure and you might say well you silly person like they have no consequences. I don't think that's true considering how it wasn't close enough for that to be the case. These it's like. It's not a florida. Gore voice situation. There was no room for a a real grab that would have been normalizable.

Maybe like some not something that the snake could digest and so it all pivoted away so we're getting biden and I know a lot of people are breathing a sigh of relief and some people are pointing to everybody who is breathing a sigh of leaf and saying aha you cuck. You said all you could you could say all you want about how you didn't like biden and you weren't voting for him. But you are rooting for them and that's the same thing you're secretly just through your discussion. The way you frame them you're brainwashing your audience to vote for biden you. Party I will admit at those culture at that cultural level. I am a member of the don't be an college. A middle-class white kid went to college at the right time had the right combination of life experiences to connect to the college experience in a way that conditioned me towards having certain social views about cosmopolitanism and things like that and I know that those are you know um I know that those are real issues with real policies related to them. You know police funding and you're talking about racial justice or something like that and you know immigration but those all connect to real things with real consequences. But for me they are felt effectively. They are felt emotionally. They're not really part of my like material interests because I'm a white male but I know it's not. It's an to just let people get exploited and racist and done racism on um and fair enough. I cop to that. I have those views because that part of the conditioning I keep. I've kept because it's. It's not people like the new theory is like those set of affects are like neoliberalism. It's no. They are the cultural like architecture of the broad cosmopolitan. Point of view which is contrasted with the parochial point of view. That is manifested in the don't be a rooting for biden. I'm sorry. I was cop to it although I have to say though.

I have absolutely no faith that this is gonna be a better outcome than trump having won reelection in fact. I think there's a very good chance. It's a worse outcome. I mean nothing to be done about it. There was never anything to be done about it by any of us be realistic but I i when I look at the next four years the way this vote happened. I really do see no reason to have any thought other than um. The divided government means that nothing of any consequence is passed beyond like the beer. The the the very nearest like minimal amount of of recovery money and and and such and that we will allow ourselves to go through a second cleveland term response to a crisis where we just sort of allow it to continue without any kind of significant government intervention. The only big if we get any big legislation it will be something like entitlement reform the the grand bargain that mcconnell is waiting and salivating at the prospect of passing in which with a democratic house led by nancy pelosi instead of a crazy group full of tea party psychos under boehner who wouldn't take a deal when it was given to them by obama. They might actually be able to get it culturally. All the wars that we think are over are only going to get more intense and more annoying. I mean I think that the the particular keening were of them will go down because trump's not there to like keep the keep. The liberals psychotically activated but just the general drift is gonna ratchet towards more conflict and there's gonna be more police violence. There's gonna be more demonstrations about police violence that there's going to be more political violence in general that people are going to spectaclize and assimilate into their political view and it's going to harden things and that means that those newly introduced republicans who showed up the ones who aren't just going to stop paying attention are going to become more convinced of their republicanness. But more importantly all of the people who came up to stop biden are in the midterm going to stop paying attention. You'll see another red wave like in 2010 and then a failure to recover at all from the collapse. Unlike the fake recovery we got under obama that was then covered with obama's personal charisma and like narrative power to shape shape. Our you know relationship to the government just joe biden's rickety skeleton presiding overall like a dance macabre we he gets destroyed by whatever comes after trump donald trump. Jr. John taffer my pillow guy maybe tom cotton or josh hawley. I mean it's gonna be a battle royale but whoever it is. It's that and then you get locked in like a full suite of anti-democratic things that legitimately limit franchise and that allow for the full like securitization of life. The full privatization of life for the coming break up you know into the techno cantons and the and the dissolution of central authority which is the engage game of that faction of capitalism.

Political expression and the democratic party will be unable at every point to stop this because as I have said their drift cannot be reversed. They can only double down on what they have been doing like you see it oh. Trump won because america is more racist than we thought well. We're just gonna have to scream more about racism then okay that guarantees that all those people who started who voted for trump in 2020 because they think that's a bunch of talk are going to double down on it and meanwhile new all those working-class people you're hoping to bring into the gov into politics. They're going to see you screeching and howling and they're going to mostly tell you to shut the up because they didn't go to finishing school. Meanwhile the democratic party will just be the party of college-educated professionals and the problem with them is that they don't stay in big parts of the country that are demographically rewarded with congressional representation and political influence places where that make up 270 electoral votes and that are where people are where senators where two senators can be elected by a couple hundred thousand people. They leave those spots. They go concentrate in already dense urban areas and contribute to already lopsided political victories that mean that their influence over legislation is basically non-existent. Those people in the middle those are the people who are left over those are the older folks. Those are the ones who didn't go to college or came back from college and said it was a bunch of dumb and didn't go off to seek their fortune in the big city and they will just be republicans and that means you will not even be able to get to 270. You know it doesn't matter how many votes you win by in the popular vote you'll never get another. Electoral quote victory and you'll never be able to change get rid of the electoral college either and the response will only be to double down on identity because that's all that exists and it'll all exist for republicans too. It's a mirror image thing like they will be doubling down on identity. Like all during the trump administration. People have been complaining about how the democrats and leftists in general are talking about identity. Too. Much so was trump to a different group of people and the issue is is that for the non-college educated when you talk about those issues it redounds to the benefit of the don't be a is a more visceral and understandable reaction to this kind of stuff because you have not learned the undergirding ideas and in fact a lot of these people say you should never have to tell anybody those because it's not their job to educate you meaning that you're guaranteed to hear the up. So. I mean that is that's a bad that's a bad case and it undermines hilariously.

The only case you could have made for biden which was harm mitigation right. You can't make an ideological case for voting for biden that he's going to make anything better and you can't and in his case you couldn't even have made a harm reduction argument in my opinion. But of course the harm reduction argument was in the process it was in the assumption of well. We're going to take all these voters in this crisis election and they're all going to vote for democrats and we're going to get a blue wave that gives us the senate and yeah. We have the filibuster. But hey we'll be able to get rid of the filibuster. And I know we don't think it's going to happen but it could and just the prospect of that fills them with this idea that there's possibility and they convince themselves that that's what they're voting for when they vote for biden. What they get is the result of this party presiding over these conditions which is college-educated people basically being guilted by the tv and and like their fellow college. Educated people into getting rid of the the bad orange rude man many of them if they're wealthy enough sticking to voting republican down ticket because they're still class conscious along those lines and they know that their interests are in low taxes since that's basically what the government does but lower high taxes. What else does it do that's kind of it because everything else has been pushed off the table as a possibility as an intervention that that the government can do into the market and they're either going to be doubling down on that cultural shift or say well trump's trump's gone. Now I've normalized trump so nothing's gonna shock me anymore and I'll just wrote republican again. You'll have those you know younger ideologically committed democrats who are either you know class traders liberal class traders who think they're on the side of the of the downtrodden even though the democratic party is a capitalist party as integral to the maintenance of capitalism and its exploitative system as the republicans are but they don't think of it that way. They think they're the party of the downtrodden because they're the party of minority views and I and you know the the yeah. Minority rights against the oppressive majority like that's that what left means it doesn't have anything to do with distribution because once again distribution is not on the menu but those people will be concentrated in these cities and that means they'll never be able to exercise power over the federal government which means as as capitalism gets more savage and extractive and and social cohesion and social obedience are undermined the techno surveillance. Machinery of of of control will be instituted by the republican party. Essentially the which means it probably be will be have like explicit racial character to it now say the democrats win. Though like this is the real grim is that say you break out of that somehow without under. I don't think you could but if you could break out of that somehow without changing the undermining under girding reality that the democrats are not a working party. They are a workers party. They're a capitalist party if you could somehow get them to winning get them to power in in an event of a crisis. All you're gonna do is is is is the cliche joke about you know rainbow painted nose cone predator drones.

It will be the the violence will be maybe more just less distributed by explicit racial categories but it will be as oppressive and stratified along class so like there's not even really a harm reduction case for trump because that's they're all it all ends badly because say they somehow parlay a bad trump response in the second term to covet to like people just kind of shrugging their shoulders be like things are so bad and these are the only options. I guess we'll give them a shot and then they will just be presiding over catastrophe from the point of view of stabilizing capitalism at the expense of us like chuck schumer saying people are killing themselves because we're evicting them. Let's give cops the power to detain them if they show evidence that they want to self-harm that will be the democratic response to crisis. Instead of you know build a wall and and lock up these. These these immigrant children. It'll be a like a little drone buzzing over your head that'll blow your brains out if you if you frown too many times. But it will be the same essential machine for the same essential. Purpose pulling the last marrow out of the bones of the system before it collapses. Now once again.

[15:33](https://youtu.be/2XB22E5Tdo8?t=15m33s)

This is long long time frames but if we're talking about a political party and like the the relationship between political power parties over time in presidential elections we're talking long time scales and we all know that the time scales geologically and ecologically are getting narrower. So. I'm not saying in anyone's lifetime. Even I was listening to this but in in in generations. This will be the trajectory either way and as I said that cannot be changed from within itself because of how it's structured because because there is no class politics that is going to be able to inject itself into the overall dynamic between democrats and republicans because as I have said the we have now reached a point where the the end result of the democrats no longer being the party of material advancement for the working class or the downtrodden or whatever for for 40 years. The democrats ran this country basically uninterrupted even with eisenhower and nixon in charge.

The democrats ran this country because they went every two years out and said we're the party of a bigger paycheck. After the 70s. They could never do that again not in real sense not with any kind of conviction behind it either in policies or in people's memory of their ability to to to deliver on those promises so they've had to find something else to stand in for the party of the downtrodden and because their new constituency was college-educated people who have absorbed ideas about the character of alienation and oppression in this country that have nothing to do with class and everything to do with discrimination along identity axis that narrative is now the accepted idea of what it means to be a a party of the of the little guy. It's to defend them against unjust unjust an unjust oppression that prevents one from fully participating in the market. Like that's the real crime of racism and sexism and all other of the patriarchal boogeyman is not any kind of violence against human dignity so much as violence against the ability of a human to inter gage in market relationships. The way like everyone else does for one's for one's own personal pleasure seeking as the homo economic as libertarian automaton that we're all supposed to be and the reason the democrats. I think are doomed in this dynamic. No matter what is that over time as politics gets louder and louder to deal with the fact that things are going to get worse and worse there's not going to be a big influx of these college educated people into the electorate they're already there. They're baked in what's going to happen is you're going to have like what happened in 2020 which is a investment by de-politicized socially reactionary working people because they have not absorbed the manner system that they got in college and they're going to see the options we have and they're going to become republicans and that means that you will have this situation where the demographic advantage of the democrats along all accesses except racial in the case of black people but even a long income is going to go away.

A big chunk of the people are just still not going to be voting at all. They will be deeper into despair but those who do vote are going to vote with more anger and it's going to be directed against the people who want them to keep their voice down. Even though everything is terrible. I think a good example of the dynamic going forward is does anyone know the name. What's their name this woman who is elected in an up in a lan in an upset in the congress. This name lauren bobert the one who owns shooter's grill. The q anon lady in rifle colorado her. Her story is interesting because she has the story of someone who historically would be a democrat. She was born in florida. When she was 12. She moved to denver. She said that she had democratic parents and she they lived in poverty. Her mom was on welfare. She went to mc worked at mcdonald's and she was 15. She got a ged. She's like a she got pregnant in high school and dropped out. She. She got her ged this year like a real american like striver and that background according to everything we've absorbed is supposed to make you some you know a democrat. But the reason it isn't is because she's white and so it's like well yeah but she's racist. So therefore of course she's a republican but the problem is 

Nobody is just racist for no reason that's. I know that's what we've been told that 16 19 projects and ten tiny houses coats have told us that racism is this intrinsic thing to american life. It's a stain and I would say like race distinction is but racism. As an operating principle that guides your behavior is not I'm sorry and I know you're going to say yes but at the sub-atomic level. It's there every moment it's like yes it is. But I also think that when it's at that level its manifestation isn't really noticeable isn't worth freaking out about isn't the thing that you should be tearing your fleshover out about. I'm sorry. She's racist for some reasons but look at her life. You know we're supposed to use mitigating circumstances when considering people who do bad things like she had a shitty life. She blames people for it. Why is she blaming black people instead of If she's racist. I mean who maybe she isn't racist. I don't even know one way maybe she does just. Blame elites for why things are bad but why does she think that it's democrats why does she think republicans aren't elites. It's because the only thing she's ever known about this party is that it's about this set of of ostentatious displays of concern for other people and that you're supposed to not want anything for yourself which is of course what upper middle class polite liberals see politics as but somebody whose life has been like bad somebody who's struggled somebody's been in poverty. They're not necessarily worried about how empathic they look to other people because they're trying to. Survive and liberals and democrats don't seem to care about them. So I know that sounds like oh he's justifying racism oh my god once again.

I wouldn't vote for her. She shouldn't be in charge but if we're talking about people in general. These things carry out over time and if you take this bobert woman and you look at her background and you compare her to someone like aoc and it's like oh. She's like aoc. Aoc also struggled. C also worked she was a bartender. It's like yeah but she was also a congressional aide and she went to boston college majored in political science. This is a person who has received the etiquette lessons that you're supposed to and it's like look this bronx. Latina look she's a good socialist yeah because she went to college and if the question is is the future going to be sorting the party into the part into the party sorting people as they come into politics while things are getting worse and worse into the democrats or republicans to fight over it and it's aoc versus. This bobert woman considering how shitty everything is there's a lot more people in this country who are going to be in robert's position than in aocs that are gonna have the chance to go to college. You get a four-year degree in some in political science. So some people are like why does he keep talking about college like this that the there's plenty of non-college educated people in the democratic party and there's tons of college-educated republicans. Of course. There is the reason I'm talking about college is because when we're talking about the electorate in general we're divided into these demographic groups and then try to analyze their voting behavior and we put those on top of one another and it gives us a sense of like what people are the politically engaged people in this country. Anyway what they are politically what they view how they view things and and and and how like the experience of being an american is is is absorbed and those are all things that people do feel about are. Those all are ways that people absorb things like college education things like race age.

 gender those things income all do but the problem is in america because we've got thanks to our ability to spread broadly or more broadly than historically has been the case um our lucr after world war. Ii. We created this thing that was kind of non-existent before called the middle class this lumpin look small bourgeois in america or at least it became lumping as we got suburbanized and atomized thanks to media and geographic sorting um what's it talking about yeah so our lump in middle class. The one they are the ones who vote generally. So like this is the electorate that's one of the things that always made fascism like the question about fascism sort of interesting because like fascism emerged in the 20s and 30s as a way to counter working-class political mobilization and they did it by essentially mobilizing the lumpen bourgeois. The lump and lower classes in germany and italy. The thing is in america. There is no left-wing movement among the working class. The working class is politically inert so it's all an intra-middle-class movement like people say oh all.

[25:39](https://youtu.be/2XB22E5Tdo8?t=25m39s)

These young men are turning into proud boys like well yeah. But it's they're not. They're not emerging in to conflict with a working class classified conflict. It's just another. It's a show off with other college kids. It's other middle class strategies and the reason. I think college is so important as the one demographic descriptor not only because we're seeing things pulled towards college very dramatically over the last couple of elections. But because of all those markers were talking about college attainment. Gender race the only one of these that really gets even even income even income. I would say the only one that's the only one the one of these that gets closest to actually pegging someone towards class. As it's lived. In america is a college because the thing about class america is that even though our lives are totally determined by our class class is not a lived experience because we are not conscious of ourselves for the most part some people are but the vast majority are not. We do not walk around conscious of ourselves as members of a class. We are much more conscious of ourselves as those other things men gender and and racial but college haven't gone having gone to college marks you as having gone through a essentially an ideological car wash and most importantly that because basically a ton of working-class people's kids went to college after world war ii and came out with professional jobs and moved from the working class to this. To this middle class. This lumpin lower bourgeois that means that a lot of people grew up in middle class homes means they went their parents went to college which means they absorbed college from their parents and then they went to college and then they came out having gone through the ideological car wash and and that means that they are somewhere in this middle. Class. Like there are some who are going to jump way up and like the rich of course send their kids to college but also they're demographically irrelevant well. You know some people jump up in the income from before they before what they grew up from. Some people do rise from the working class to go to college. They are the minority but they do and then some of them go off to be very wealthy. Some have significant collapse. In fact the whole generation of these millennials is all kind of nose-dived but they have nosedived back to sort of being in like a income or even working class relationship that is similar to people who didn't go to college but having gone to college and the reason.

That's important is because the experience of going to college creates your conception of yourself as a political subject either because you went yourself. Your parents did instill those things in you and then you didn't go because you didn't like them or your or if you didn't go to college you absorb culture because everything that is made to be consumed in the media is made by and for people to go who went to college because they are professional because art is a professional endeavor. Now professional credentials are required for professional endeavors or were at least traditionally in in our system now and that though and that so artists are overwhelmingly going to be people went to college and from the point of view of commerce people who went to college since they make up this middle class. These are the this is the group of people who are most numerous and have the most money because the poor there's a lot of them. But they don't have any money and also how do you even talk to them. Since there's very few poor people who make art that is seen by the masses and the rich who yes they can be owning all these things and they can have their kids like you know become actors because they're bored but you know bill gates can only see aquaman how many so many times by himself. Even if it doesn't cost him a lot of his fortune to go see the movie you need a lot of people watching movies you need a lot of people exposing themselves to advertising. You need a lot of people watching the shows so it's all pitched to the middle class. So they're absorbing all these moires too 

But the experience of so everyone had who is politically active is what I'm saying is is that way because of their exposure to the psychological regimen to the value system that is created by college. This is what moldbug calls the cathedral and it's real. It's real but the thing is is that it's assumed that this thing exists to make people democrats and well. It is true that that is the intention. I would think of the majority of the people who make up the collegiate structure. That is not the full purpose it crea. It creates political subjects. It creates people who see themselves politically and now the people within it want to create democrats. But because the experience of college is not you know it's not a factory. It's a bunch of individuals going into it all of them with individual life experiences individual backgrounds. Individual personal lived standpoints whatever the however you want to put it and it means that they're gonna respond to these things in unpredictable ways so that while college in this cathedral makes democrats on purpose.

It also by accident makes almost as many republicans because they go to college where they have absorbed. College in their media have go grow to detest those values and then decide to hold the other values. The worldview which is cosmopolitan which is worldly which assumes in equality of all individuals the equality of rights of all people and and the necessity to create some sort of social justice. Like that is really it um and a lot of people absorb those views and think yes that's good a lot of people and and I think that broadly those are correct in abstract. The problem is is that they are not as they are encountered in college and in the culture produced by college. They are turned into this brittle list of personal virtues that are expressed through concern not through actual policies that are going to help anybody like that's. The key part about this is that this this this soul washer that we built to send people through and have them come out valuing you know diversity and all these things is in a system where you're literally telling them at the same time that you're telling them that there's propressed people in the world and that you know it's the duty to make things better for everybody you're telling them that communism cannot work that the competition and is irrat and is competition is like the the essence of human experience that that the economy is a system produced to create like maximal value through people seeking their self-interest in the marketplace and on top of that but and so but in that system in this system that is immutable because remember we're not teaching you any marxism.

Like that's. The big joke about right wingers is that there's a bunch of marxists in the academy. Marx has been purged from the academy for decades. Marx is not taught as a serious option. Marx is taught as a historical curio and a dead end that didn't take into consideration. Such intersecting issues is patriarchy and racism and blah blah and that means that when you absorb this stuff you're not just absorbing equality. You're absorbing that the only problem that is caused by inequality is personal. Manners is people being mean to one another. It's not systemic re-inscribement of the social exploitation because that's not the thing remember society is not. A system for exploiting the side of the society is not the haves sucking the life force and species being out of the the half knots exploiting those with only their labor to sell to by vampire like sucking their surplus. No no no it's equal exchange of of of desires across the the equal marketplace. And if there's if black people are or immigrants are disadvantaged or women. It's because people are mean and we're gonna make them nice and that's not a viable answer and people you either ignore that fact because you're caught up in like the drama of either having experienced those oppressions and wanting to see them corrected or being. If you haven't feeling guilty that they're being done on your behalf and one either way you have an emotional investment if you don't have an emotional investment. Like say you're a white male. You're more likely to go yeah.

Maybe the they're they're just less maybe they're just not as good like if this is all if this is an open contest and they're behind. Maybe. It's because they're shitty like if this is a race. It's like oh they're they're being held back. It's like. I'm not holding them back. I'm seeing them advance like they're all over the place and yet they're not cutting the mustard. There's no answer for that other than No.

[35:20](https://youtu.be/2XB22E5Tdo8?t=35m20s)

It's because you're racist that's why they're doing it. It's circular it cannot. It cannot get towards actual justice and so this machine creates these numbers of these well-intentioned liberals who think they're being nice people. Even though they're really doing is taking a bunch of excuses to be mean to other people and to hate other people to displace their anxiety about being at the top of an economic rung or whatever they want to punish them and so they inscribe their hatred. Upon you know knuckle jagging the neanderthals men being trash and then they they decide to to you know hate them and then or you join the team of lazy minorities they're covering for so the way this works basically is that america has this weird middle class that's not distinct in its relationship to the means of production. It contains per it's people who coined the term professional managerial class. I prefer lumpin petit bourgeois because it's a very specific american flavor of this where it has never gathered together into any self-conscious thing because class was being abolished when it was being created as a concept that was lived by suburbanization and mass culture and so no one has ever thought of themselves as a class. The way that like the small bourgeois maybe did in germany and so they have to be turned into aware of of their place because the thing about these people in the middle class is that the broad middle class the reason that it's such a weird category and it's such. A liminal space is that they're not as the working class are purely exploited by the system and they're not as the ruling class are pure beneficiaries of the of the extractive system. They are both largely victims and perpetrators.

They might have employees people that they hire on like a freelance basis or even as direct employees they might They're members of professionals. They're managers of other employees. That's a big part of it is management like you have people who you could fire. But someone could fire you. It is a liminal. It's a spot between and this has always existed in every society but in america. We've been able because of the post-war boom and everything we created this huge explo explosion of these things and it created the need to create things like the jobs. David graber talks about because people had to have something to do my god. We've got too much free time. Here. We've got too far free time and we can't just have people sitting around they're going to get ideas. So everybody has to get busy becoming managers and and and consultants and all this horse and then their kids live. These lives where their parents and them are the experience of plenty boom and bust you know the lean years and fat years and and you know the good and the bad side of being in this middle spot in the capitalist pecking order But they're nonetheless they are the pr.

They are being exploited and therefore they suffer alienation as the working class do and that working that alienation at some point turns into or can turn into depending on how you experience. It can turn into something called class consciousness where you're like oh. These are not discrete symptoms of displeasure in my life. These are all epiphenomenal to a single daily moment by moment attack on my spirit and soul which is that I have been denuded of my species being at like a basic level control over my time on earth by and by my un requested my necessary my my my curse. Like my I'm like. I am as a surf was bound to the wage relationship and for many people that never occurs and in the 19th century like the the working class as mark saw coming together and then was ratified to see come together later the the collective experience of coming to a city living in a in a district of workers and doing the same job with other people. Just the the mere social exchange within that relationship produces a resonance of experience between people a checking of notes that finds one answer and then that is class consciousness. There is no mechanism to create that american now it was broken by the prosperity really of the post neutral era. So the but the so the people who are now we're being born to the boomers and to the exeters. They emerge into a world that has been denatured of any kind of real class consciousness and they find themselves in this. For the most part. These middle class people in this liminal spot between the two and so they might never put this in a class context or more specifically in a political context. They might not ever think oh. These things can be addressed by a political project. That's what now if you grow up around middle class people that's basically impossible like as a kid. You learn.

These are political concerns. This is a political world. Your parents have political views so you know the things that are good. Now this is probably all a bunch of cultural epiphenomenal. Like you know abortion or if you're like the anti-abortion movement you know like all these people in the 70s. They're terrified of the fact that people that the the working that the that the nuclear family was being pulled apart when it was being pulled apart by the fact that you couldn't have a nuclear family anymore. You couldn't afford it. But we're going to put it on the blame of women wanting to be able to control their reproduction because they now have to engage in the wage relationship forget that it's going to be abortion. So like even though abortion is a real issue that has real consequences. The reason people are mad about it the reason. It's a political football is because they have a false conception of what it means what they're really mad. About is something driven by the economic system that undergirds it. But they can't see that because they do not have a fully formed political consciousness college is where people take those generalized feelings of anxiety about society. They might have as a young and idealistic person especially if they are going to college. They think we're going to learn something about the world and it's where they're given a form because in college is when most people encounter for the first time concepts like communism socialism. The wage relationship you know economics that kind of stuff and that is where they are then able to emerge and go oh oh. Damn. There's this whole thing about the economy and how that structure stuff wow now of. Course. College then informs you as soon as it reforms you that yeah. You know these things are real and also you know the country you came from.

It had a lot of violence in it and it's had a lot of exploitation in its history and you know there's been a lot of pain and blood bloodshed and you feel very shocked about that. And if you're white you might start feeling guilty about it. But then with the next breath you any any idea that there's like a new frontier for like changing that at a fundamental level is foreclosed and you are left having to deal with those epiphenomenon. If you want to feel like a good person because there's two ways you can learn about something like your class and what it means to be in a class relationship through experience and through instruction and middle class in america until recently. Now. The ones who are out of college are the first to not experience that since the post-war era those middle class people aren't experiencing it because while they are exploited it's masked. Their exploitation is masked by the fact that they're relatively well off and they put it off onto other things so that it's almost impossible for middle-class people to get a lived experience without the intervention of instruction on what it means to be in a class poor people. Have but the thing is is that well they have the lived experience of class exploitation. They don't in this world that we live in now have the ability to compare notes. The way that working class people used to be able to and so that whole gets filled with you know whatever is in the culture around them which ends up being stuff. Like you know alex jones a lot of the time or or other you know entertainment products that sort of fill in the void of that instruction. That is not there if you did not participate in college so the people in college get this first experience of class consciousness and they process it in two ways depending on not their income or their family's income or anything. Not if they came from the working class. Not if they're in the middle class. Not if they're coming down from the mountaintop of wealth and privilege to get an education for some reason which a lot of them do. Because what else are you going to do with your time they can all have different reactions.

It's not determined. The individual response is going to be determined by your individual life experience like I for example. I think the fact that my spinal column just exploded when I was in high school I i nearly died and I was in a wheelchair. It basically made it impossible for any reactionary social argument to hold sway with me because no argument that anyone has anything bad coming to them because of like where they were born like what skin they were born into or what social position they were born into will ever hold sway for me because I am more intimately aware than most people in my position of the fundamental and terrifying contingency of life on this planet. The fact that nothing is earned that everything is is is a random thunderbolt that we have to deal with and that our ability to thrive in life is largely our ability to just avoid through happenstance. The calamities that surround us other people have different experiences. Maybe you had really annoying hippie parents and you're and they're like really mean but also sanctimonious and it like turned you off on the entire thing or you had like evangelical psychos and you've decided that conservativism is inherently bad but you get to college and you learn all these cosmopolitan things hey in case you didn't know all the other people in the world. They're all equal. They all deserve life on this planet. But many of them are struggling and that's bad and we should do something about it. Now if you didn't go to college. There's two ways you process that if you have had likely and like I said didn't go to college doesn't necessarily mean poor but it disproportionately means poor and specifically it means your parents probably didn't go to college which means they probably make less money than the parents of the people who did go to college if your parents didn't go to college if your parents didn't go to college and you worked your way to college like you took out loans or whatever you very well could see all this stuff and be like. I made it you and if you get out of college and are successful and you're like driven and that's how you got there and that's how you made it. You might have contempt for the people you know in those conditions who didn't get out like jd vance for example or you know um like lit. You know a pull up your pants. Guy you know like. I made it. They didn't you know like poverty doesn't ennoble the character like poor people being poor sucks and it picks people have a hard time empathizing with others sometimes and it makes it harder for. It makes people mean sometimes not everybody but it makes them mean people and if you're poor and you're around mean poor people. Sometimes you decide this.

I'm a republican or you say yeah. I feel a kinship with the with the suffering of these other people. Once again. This comes down to the personal experiences you had that made you think that way. I'm broadly speaking a democrat. I might consider myself a left-winger but I'm a democrat and this is what I have to say that these are binary categories everybody. Who went to college or votes. Votes consistently along a a political access or doesn't vote. But because they're making a point about it is one of these or the other because they're very broad They reflect the broad binary dynamic of american politics. They're democrats and republicans. A lot of people say oh chapel you're democrats that's like. I don't like the democrats. I didn't fight for joe biden. I never told anybody to vote for joe biden but broadly speak. I'm a democrat. But here's the. You are also a democrat everyone listening to this everyone watching this. I would wager is a democrat even if you didn't go to college.

You have absorbed left ideology to the point where you're on that side of the cultural divide. You have the same sort of visceral responses to these cultural signifiers. Even if you know they are cultural signifiers now if you go to now wealthier people who go to college. If for one reason or another. They don't feel guilty about the fact that they're exploiting other people and that they're the that they just suck and a lot of people do. They harden their hearts one way or the other or for one reason or another They say no them. They should be that way and they're republicans. But people who are wealthy and don't who do have like a human connection. Haven't like forsworn that human connection haven't decided to justify themselves. They become democrats but of course they become liberal democrats because they're never going to want to get rid of class hierarchy because it benefits them they are much more likely to decide.

You know what class is always going to be there but racial discrimination and all these inequalities we could do something about those just so happens. They don't really do anything about me except me except what I might have to pay higher taxes at the end of the day. Rich people can always afford to pay more taxes and then you've got the middle class where they experience life and their parents experience life. Both exploiting and exploiting or not or their exploitation is not felt as class exploitation and they might come aware of the very idea that their class exploited in college and be like whoa how do they respond that boils down to whether they decide to feel a kinship with the working class even if they aren't technically part of it and even and or they are or they decide to disdain the working class and adhere their heart to capital for specific personal individual reasons. But the thing is you get these like these might be random.

These might be a happenstance within an individual but over large groups of people. They sort into broad categories and broad broad world views that people hold and so you you shift these working class. These these these college educated middle-class people into sort of in their hearts working-class people whether they are or aren't who believe they're part of a project with other working class people to to get rid of all the racism and the bad stuff or maybe if they're more radical. You know get rid of capitalism either through the democratic party or defeating it. But maybe voting for it strategically sometimes and then you've got the the ones who decide yeah no my bad my dad.

 you know he worked his ass off to become an insurance salesman and yeah. His boss rid him but you know he he wanted to get good work out of him and he got and then he took over the boss ship and I could be the boss someday and those become republicans and these things are pulling. These two groups to identify along two axis and a lot of it is about gender because gender is felt much more closely to one's lived experience than than classes and it's still in it and it's actually structured by our relationship to that college education. We got and like the language we learn in college is the education is the is the manners of the professional sector which is in like engagement terms in in social terms. It is a feminized space. It is a face that rewards politeness that rewards an ability to be socially observant cooperation over conflict and in fact that's one of the things you really learn in school is to act like that that is and so women are more likely to find that agreeable because they have been conditioned to be like that because of gender expectations men are going to be less comfortable with it so that helps split this atom. This is more this means that men are more like of all races are more likely to go through that process and come out as republicans. Women are more likely to come out as democrats and then you've got the men who identify as you know with that working class with those oppressed people. They're more likely.

They're going to be male feminists. They're going to be they're still being different and then women who are like feminism is stupid are going to follow the men to the republican side but the leading gender like split is in that direction so in all cases like it's going to have people of every group but I'm talking the the polls where the where the things demographically aggregate into parties that are going to then vote and determine the outcome of the political system. And so what this means is is that over time these working-class people who have not gone through that process of coming into like full awareness of the of the virtue of this specific cultural etiquette are going to be brought into politics. By the trauma of the moment offered a choice between you know vigorous resistance of of formalized nicety and a series of elaborate social demands kabuki abnegations that have no goal that have no benefit because that is the key point to all of this. This is the thing that's going to drive the democratic party into oblivion. Is that all of this stuff while self-evident the virtue of which is self-evident to people who went to college and adhered to the democratic worldview the people who said yes to all those things about inclusivity and yes all those things about privilege and yes to all those things about the need for diversity and voices being heard and all that it all makes sense to them and the way that it relates to human 

[54:52](https://youtu.be/2XB22E5Tdo8?t=54m52s)

Flourishing makes sense but if you have not encountered it at all let alone rejected it. You hadn't even had the chance or which is a lot. This is a lot of traces you would reject it through viewing it through the culture and the media and saying it's sanctimonious. Because you have not been absorbed into it when you see it all you see is a demand to be quiet. All you've seen is a demand to me nice all you. See is a demand on you to behave a certain way for no benefit to you the benefit of someone else and why you're supposed to care about them.

You could get there and you could even get to a point where hey helping them helps me if you go through like a whole political awakening but americans aren't doing that if they're being asked to this or they didn't. They saw the culture and said. This so the upshot of this to me is that any question about how to politically engage with this perpetual doomsday machine that we've created between the two parties this dance of death. This tumble off reichenbach falls between the two political parties be done through. The democratic party cannot be done through the through the device of the democratic party because the democratic party is in my opinion fully and completely the party of it is the party of manners and politeness to anyone outside of the the educational matrix responding just to its cultural expressions and its political expressions. It is just the party of keeping your voice down and that means that anyone within it trying to reach people outside of that bubble will be received the same way even if they're socialist even if they're they're saying medicare for all in full throat because they're not all that is going to be heard is that through the that the democratic party actually in a day-to-day basis represents to these people which is unpleasant interactions with unpleasant liberals both online in the real world and on television and in the movies if there will be a democratic expression of working class challenge to the coming neo liberal austerity hell. It will come in the form of a new party not a break away from the democratic party but a party that emerges from labor action. The actual coordination of people in their place of work where those people doing that work come to organization the same way they did in the 1870s when pinkertons were shooting them and in so doing that they will because they live in the united state lesson people even if you have not absorbed the values of going and voting because that's the important thing here is that is that you say like well what about what about all these dem to trump what about all these trump to damn white people aren't.

They republicans didn't. They say. It's like yes they did but the thing you're getting from. College isn't just the content of the cosmopolitan worldview. It's the container which is objective reality which is norms and institutions which is the constitution means something and the presidency has meaning and voting has a worth that's why you do it and that means that when trump shows up and does his clown show for four years even if you are not really that attached to the democratic party. Even if you are as a you know republican adhered towards a policy of keeping your taxes low at all costs you very well might decide okay. This is too far especially when the other option is joe biden. That's why people are mad at the but the the democrats were doing what they did and hitting them pitching themselves to suburban republicans. I'm sorry but it was their only play because the democratic party unless bernie had been the nominee and even then I wonder would have been able to break through that and so the only voters they could realistically get were them. Now. What they didn't anticipate is that a bunch of these working-class people would now come into the electoral process and say. That's what that's why they're owned. But their general strategy was the only one they could have pursued because this is not something that is chosen. This is something that is predicated by the algorithm of the party and by it's now. It's. It's. It's. It's demographics so those those trump to biden voters.

You know they they never bought into all the like that I mean that's why they voted down ticket republican. But they do think that trump is a bad president and an erratic president and therefore should probably get out of there and get a nice quiet guy who's not going to get everybody riled up all the time so anything in the democratic pile would pile. Anything coming out of the democratic branding is going to be buying for those people and they don't know it that's the thing the people who are even doing this like the people on the left of the democratic party who are imagining some aoc led insurgency. They are not even aware that their project is stillborn because they think no we'll reach out we'll reach out to these people. That's like yeah you will. But they're just going to see some charlie brown's mom. But then when you say intersectionality and and kids in cages they're going to roll their eyes. That's what's gonna happen. Because this is not being done in the democratic party. The people in the democratic party the people who vote in the democratic party they're not operating on be for They're not operating as an expression of working class interest. They're working on what they perceive to be behalf of working-class interests. They are. They are stooping to they are condescending inherently because even if they are you know they are struggling themselves. They're struggling in a context where they assume. They're part of a of a middle class by virtue of their education and they're not connected culturally to those people they just aren't and that means that nothing within the democratic party is I think realistically going to blow out and grow out and increase the share of those working-class voters.

It's going to get some of them but I think the the the it will not change the drift because this is all about big numbers and about drift over time. It's not going to change the trajectory. What might happen is that working people might realize that they can voting yeah that's the next step because they're not going to go to revolution. I'm sorry nobody's going to skip this. If you're like hey maybe. I can do politics and there's an option of voting and maybe doing things without having to get your head cracked open. Most people are going to take it so just yelling at them that it's not going to work and that you're being sheep dipped into electoralism isn't going to work because everyone's going to take the ballot over having to shoot somebody or get shot because they don't have any assumption it's going to work. They have not been conditioned as the people who believe in that those vanguard partyists they have not been conditioned to believe that they have not come around to the realization that electoralism is useless. They have to come to that realization so they're going to try sorry and that means they're going to build a party and it's going to have people who are like went to college in it but not coming down from above. As organizers maybe the media figures might inspire not me for christ's sake.

Not nearly famous enough but maybe somewhere down the line. Somebody like will run some sort of third-party insurgent campaign that galvanizes people and and like a party will emerge semi-spontaneously from the working class. It will not be a spontaneous like anarchist organization. It will be structured as a leninist party should be I think and it would come from the intersection between a working class and like an emergent party activist base organically now. I'm not saying that will happen and I would in fact still say it is highly unlikely that it even gets off. The ground let alone has any chance of successfully challenging for power. I do think though that if there is going to be something that emerges from those grassroots I talked about the other day. That's the form it will take. It will have to be a new party. An explicit working-class party that does not emerge from some split with the democrats and is not constituted at the top level by democratic operatives or democratic politicians. So is that still I guess is that black pill is that brown pill. I've at least expressed you know a possibility um but you know a lot of people who hear third party their assistance. Their sphincter wraps up and mine did too like that's one of the big reasons. I kind of rolled my eyes at people who got mad at bernie for not running third party. It's like this system is designed for two cis parties. It's it cannot be broken the constitution itself. It necessitates it and so I said forget about it.

[64:43](https://youtu.be/2XB22E5Tdo8?t=64m43s)

But there is a historical precedent that might give some hope that things might be a little different and that would be hilariously enough the republican party. Now the republican party emerged not from the breakup of the whigs and that's one thing that we're not going to have on our favor. I don't think the democrats are going to break up anytime soon but the whigs broke up because the whigs like the democrats for years were a party that was brought that was broadly national. Although there were far fewer wigs in the south than there were in the north but there were wigs in the south whereas the democrats were more numerous in both places because while they made up the the gentry and the labor and the white peasantry of the south they made up the urban working class of the north as well. Whereas like the smallholders were generally the small holding like craftsmen in were split between the parties and and and the wigs were largely the part product party of work. The emergent middle class the emergent classes in the cities.

The people who worked in the the new like proto-capitalism and you know staffing things. The the rude mechanics and or not mechanics were were actual laborers but mud sills I guess. I would call them like clerks the kind of people that the southern aristocrats despised that that was the whig party. The wings and democrats both had a policy for years of just ignoring the sexual question of slavery because they didn't want it to lead to a civil war and that was okay because it wasn't a salient issue to people and the democratic party in the north was largely bereft of anti-slavery sentiment for a long time because for northern workers um and northern farmers slavery was a material issue. It was they didn't really care one way or the other because it wasn't happening there or to them and since that was the case they really just wanted abolitionists to shut up about it so that it didn't lead to a war. They didn't want to fight um in the middle class. There was opposition to slavery which made the whigs like a less pro-slavery party than the democrats were because it had this middle-class base that was that objected to slavery on ideological grounds. Slavery was bad because it was the enslavement of people and that drove the conflict for a long time but then with first annexation of texas and then bleeding kansas and the question of slavery and its expansion became material to the workers of the north because everyone sort of understood at a basic level as lincoln said the highest divided against itself could not stand and that if the sectional tiebreak was ever broken in the favor of slavery it meant it would mean that slavery would become a car. It would be across the entire country. It would be brought into the north just as the south was certain that if the deadlock in the government broke the other way which it did in 1860 and caused the secession that that slavery would be done away with. They were both certain of this and so once the the balance got threatened by the question of kansas. The issue of slavery became material to the working class of the north and they said.

I don't want to compete with with unfree labor and so that led to pressure within the parties and the first to crack was the wigs because the wigs were because they were more middle. Class more ideologically opposed to slavery which means their ire on the question got hot hotter faster and meant that the ability of the whig leadership to hold together the sections became attenuated and so in the early 18 1850s it it broke up and the republicans emerged as a essentially the whig party's platform but explicitly anti-slavery and it was originally staffed mostly with former wigs and it competed in the 1856 election for the first time and because it was a new party it went for star power with its nominee. They nominated john c fremont the pathfinder who was a very famous explorer and free booter who had done like I think he explored. I think like colorado so he was essentially a celebrity and third parties love celebrities because they need to get their foot in the door with people and they actually ran in that race against james buchanan and against millard fillmore representing the no-nothings who represented a different breakaway from the from the whigs of people who were pissed off about slavery but even more than that were pissed off about the very existence of the democratic party and decided that instead of going against the the slave power that ran the democrats they would go against the northern expression of democratic power which was catholic immigrants and within four years though they were gone and the republican party was the party in the north because the issue of slavery had become completely salient to everybody both workers and middle-class people and eve and the democrats broke up in 1860 and a big chunk of democrats in the north still voted for the northern democratic choice stephen douglas. There was a good democrat switch. The democrats or I mean switch from republicans to democrats but lincoln mostly won with the ex-wig strongholds and then was able to take advantage of you know douglas's not being able to get any southern electoral votes. So that you know that could happen and what happened during the war is that you have this fusion of the whig. The republican like middle class opposition to slavery which was ideological and then the working class whose opposition to slavery had been.

This felt material threat the idea of having to compete with slave labor. The the very process of fighting the war and defeating slavery brought them to sort of a synthesis and by the end of the war there was a broad understanding. Even among you know the largely racist working class of the north that slavery was an evil. It wasn't just a threat to free labor. It was an inherent evil of itself and that it needed to be stamped out tragedy of reconstruction. The reason it failed is because rather than the because these republicans who at the leadership position were the democrats of their day in that they were middle-class people or wealthier who had absorbed middle-class values not through college necessarily. Although a lot of them had but just through the drawing room propriety of life in these you know well-heeled urban areas and their opposition to slavery was always that of the um of the aesthete and that means that they did not connect it to a deeper issue. The way that like a working-class person could connect to the deeper issue and connect slavery to the concept of wage slavery of connect like compelled labor to his his life of exploited labor and so when the war ended capitalism in the south did not end this the plan plantations went back. The cotton got extracted again the slate. The the former slaves were were rehired and and the poor southerners were forced to pick up the pieces while the planter class was re-established because these these former wigs didn't really have any interest in transforming the means of production and and heightening.

You know the the conflict with capitalism the way that like the german idealists like my boy agus village and joseph wedemeyer hoped it would and that possibility that that moment we had after the civil war of like a a a coalition of of this militant working class. These people who fought the war to end slavery the former slaves themselves and maybe even the dirt farmers of the south. Who'd had nothing their entire lives could have been brought together in a project of of of of liberation. I'm not saying that would have happened. It's still it's very unlikely but in any world where it could have happened abraham lincoln doesn't get assassinated. I'll say that but even if he doesn't get assassinated the overall issue of the fact that the whig party which drove the the caboose of the dem republican party that became hegemonic in the post-war world was not fundamentally working class and therefore did not have any interest in furthering the conflict with capitalism and in fact reinscribed capitalism and just instituted the whig program which was hamiltonian developmentalism but in the context of the massively accumulated capital that had emerged from from the civil war itself which created an industrial behemoth that destroyed that became this oppressive force on the the broad working class and and that is why you don't want to see the democrats doing any of this because if they're riding the thing it'll be another middle-class exercise in aesthetic morality 

But there are examples of things like that emerging and I'd say the populist party is probably the closest we've ever seen to something becoming becoming just sort of sweeping out through like mutual mutual cooperation in the face of exploitation and hardship. But eventually they were absorbed into the the platform of the democratic party which is kind of inevitable but honestly. I gotta say the democrats could collapse like a house of cards. I mean not it's not in like some of these suburbs but I think that that their failure is going to be pretty dramatic and a lot of people who are very keyed up right now are going to be very very mad and I don't know where it goes like. I said it probably doesn't go anywhere but it might go. It might go to somewhere and if it does it'll be an emergent party. I'd say because that's how people are going to express themselves in america because that's what that's what politics will mean to people who are being brought into it not by book learning but by lived experience and cooperation and if we could do that we might finally have a party that the post-war republican party could have been and that a lot of people like marx and certainly willach hoped it would be which is a party of labor that would have in my you know best case. Scenario for a more successful reconstruction have gotten rid of the us constitution and refund and created a new refounded american political structure that would abolish federalism entirely. I think that that any hope we had to not be on. This trajectory would have required that and I really do think that like. I said although there's no guarantee it would have worked it probably wouldn't have. I think that the assassination of lincoln is one of those rare contingent and consequential moments in american history. But if we ever got a party it would be a party that will take up the banner that the republicans should have held which was to take the war against slavery and continue it against wage slavery.

[77:46](https://youtu.be/2XB22E5Tdo8?t=77m46s)

The way that bukharin wanted to take the red army after the after world war one and turn it into a people's army against western imperial capitalism. The difference but it didn't happen and honestly. One of the big reasons was that after five years of war people were tired um what we need the way this is going to happen like. I said. I don't know what to look like in terms of real structure or specifics. But if it occurs it'll be because people have enough people will have found a way to motivate themselves towards a collective good through a not through reason not by logic not in order to performatively demonstrate virtue to other people and alleviate themselves of their own anxiety about their class position and the amount of exploitation that they that they benefit from in this world. But because they truly believe that their lot is tied with others to such an extent that that they can abnegate their own narrow interests and it's to that point. I would like to read something that one of my favorite people in american history eugene debs wrote in his. The socialist newspaper appeal to reason in 1907. About john brown and the need for the spirit of john brown to return. I want to say before that. I read this that when I say if we need like john brown as an example as I've talked about.

I do not mean any of the violence that carried out which is what people like let's be real. People like john brown because he cut the heads off of slavers and they think of john brown and they imagine themselves like beheading a proud boy and they feel like their via this violent fantasy that they have is virtuous. That's that's what it is and I'm not talking about that. Like I think anybody who's observed. America knows that like any kind of exemplary violence is not going to motivate any sort of titanic conflict it's only going to be absorbed as entertainment and his content. The way that everything else is so not talking about violence. I'm talking about a spirit of commitment. John brown's violence was in the context of a strategy of ending civil war of slavery which was broadly correct in that he saw that there was a standoff between sides in which no one on the north cared about slavery enough to commit enough to create a genuine point of conflict with the south. The south was pretty confident up until bleeding kansas that they would just eventually take over the government they they were on because there was an asymmetric asymmetry of interests in the south. You had an entire working moving working a an entire ruling class devoted to slavery at a fundamental level culture wealth. Everything was about slavery and a white society that was all built around slavery in the lowlands anyway. In the in surprisingly in the hills where there weren't plantations. There was a lot less slavery and weirdly a lot less support for the confederacy during the war. For some reason. I don't know where that is um but in the north like. I said it was largely. I just don't want slaves competing with me for labor. You had some abolitionists those wigs. I was talking about and people who were too hardcore for the wigs like the liberty party people and the free soilers who said no.

They were going to create a war that they didn't want to fight because they didn't care about slavery but as the sec as the question of expansion became more central and the the investment of the south in expanding slavery and therefore expanding their control over government became more powerful that changed the math in the north but not enough to make anyone cross the boundary because at the end of the day it was abstract to people. It was not abstract to john brown or the people who rode with him. It obviously wasn't abstract to black people either but they had very limited power to influence white people's decision-making john brown could go to kansas and do violence that that broke away from the stalemate that that that galvanized the free soil factions in kansas who at that point had basically been backing down to the ruffians at every point and made them fight and the fight made everyone realize that what they were willing to do and brought about the conflict there's nothing like that in the current moment. There's no violence you could commit that would have that result all violence would be absorbed. People to death from the top of a building and it was the fifth biggest story of the month. There's no amount of violence you can do that will have any effect not even it'll be negative effect. I'm not even gonna say don't do it. I mean yeah if you kill people that's bad probably. I mean they probably didn't have it coming especially if it's just because they have the wrong opinions about something. But my god which is what it would really be you're not going to go and fight real power you're going to find somebody who said something you don't like on twitter shoot them or something like that because that's what really matters to people.

That's what they really care about what I mean is that spirit of non-abstract commitment as a life and like. I have said I am not that person. I mean. I see. I would like to be and maybe someday. I will find a situation where I am like able to believe enough that the thing I could do in front of me would mean something meaning that would like that would justify any any sacrifice. But I think that that spirit is necessary and I think that it's to be. I mean. I don't think it's not going to happen. I don't think it doesn't occur. I don't think it's not out there everywhere in the hearts of millions of people. It's a question of whether it'll spark in the right places and among the right people where where the rolling ball of humanity can like gather and and like. I said when I talk about how atomized we are and how we are all consumers and how we can't even think politically like that was a huge huge huge problem like brown brown activated in an era where politicization of life was much more taken was much more material. It was it was the spectacle of politics was much much much less a component of people's understanding of their politics but if we're going to do anything that's going to be we're going to do anything except like volunteer to be a fifth column when the chinese army shows up. That's what we have to keep our eyes out for as I've said just keep away.

So we'll close here with this from the appeal to reason november 23rd 1907. The most picturesque character the bravest man and most self-sacrificing soul in american history was hanged at charleston. Virginia december 2nd 1859. On that day. Thoreau said some 1800 years ago. Christ was crucified. This morning per chance captain brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not old brown any longer. He is an angel of light. I foresee the time when the painter will paint that scene no longer going to roam for a subject. The poet will sing it the historian record it and with the landing of the pilgrims and the declaration of independence. It will be the ornament of some future national gallery when at least the present form of slavery shall be no more here we shall then be at liberty to weep for captain brown. Few people dared that on that fateful day to breathe a sympathetic word for the grizzled old agitator for years he had carried on his warfare against shadow slavery. He had only a handful of fanatical followers to support him but to his mind. His duty was clear and that was enough he would fight it out to the end and if need be alone old. John brown said an example of moral courage and of single-hearted devotion to an ideal for all men and for all ages with every drop of his honest blood. He hated slavery and in his early manhood he resolved to lay his life on freedom's altar in wiping out that insufferable affliction he never faltered so god like was his unconquerable soul that he dared to face the world alone how perfectly sublime he did not reckon that overwhelming numbers against him nor the paltry few that were on his side. This grosser aspect of the issue found no lodgement in his mind or heart. He was right and jehovah's was with him. His was not to reckon consequences but to strike the immortal blow and to step from the gallows to the throne of god not for earthly glory to john brown wages. Holy warfare. Not for any recognition or reward the people had it in their power to bestow. His great heart was set upon a higher goal animated by a lofty ambition. His grand soul was illuminated by a sublimer ideal.

A race of human beings lowly and despised were in chains and this festering crime was eating out. The heart of civilization. In the presence of this awful plague logic was silent reason dumb pity dead. The wrath of retributive justice long asleep awakened at last and hurled its lurid bolt. Old. John brown struck the blow and the storm broke the that hour channel slavery was dead. In the first frightful convulsion. The slave power seized the grand old liberator by the throat put him in irons and threw him into a dungeon to await execution alas. It was too late his work was done. All virginia could do was to furnish the crown for his martyrdom victor. Hugo explained in a burst of reverential passion. John brown is grander than george. Washington history may be searched in vain for an example of noble heroism and sublime self-sacrifice equal to that of old john brown from the beginning of his career to its close. He had but one ideal and one ideal and that was to destroy shadow slavery and in that cause he sealed his devotion with his noble blood realizing that his work was done. He passed serenely almost with joy from the scenes of man. His calmness upon the gallows was awe-inspiring his exhalation supreme. Old john brown is not dead. His soul still marches on and each passing year weaves new garlands for his brow and adds fresh luster to his deathless glory who shall be the john brown of wage slavery. I would just like to note also john. Brown was not He was not a middle-class wig. He was a broke stockman and farm farm farmer. He did not learn the wrongness of slavery in the parlors of good society. He learned it in his heart and that's where everything has to come from if it comes from a desire to be perceived as good as if it comes from a desire to justify one's social position and and and purge oneself of the guilt associated with the exploitation inherent in their position. It will it can go to no good all right guys bye-bye.
