Oh don't care anymore what you say cause. It's my life do go ahead with your own life. Leave. Me alone don't forget that you're a victim of circumstance. I never meant to be the victim of your romance. I so go on don't get me wrong but you can speak your mind but not on my time. I don't care anymore what you see cause. It's my life to go ahead with your own life. Leave me alone william joel sir william joel. I believe he's been knighted one of the best to ever do it and by it. I mean right incredibly cheesy and insanely hostile and narcissistic songs that weirdly over rely on cheesy's sound effects. William joel billy joel is about the only contemporary like songwriter of any note popular in popular culture to you know before hip-hop. I guess to consistently put little sound effects in his songs like little making literal the content of the song like moving out with the room at the end or there's one where their tv starts like dude come on man people. It's a song people know what's happening. It's so funny because you'd think it would make his work specifically and exclusively or.

I mean specifically suitable to the what do you call it. The god damn it to the jukebox musical. That's what I was thinking and there was a billy joel jukebox musical called moving out twyla tharp did the choreography and I believe it was a one season flop which is like. I said amazing because his songs are very though many of them are stories he loves people like them with that kind of you know theater theater style elements theatrical elements. I kind of wonder. I mean. I never saw it obviously but I kind of wonder if it flopped in part because any protagonist like imagine the main character in a play where he's gotta sing billy joel songs like every 10 minutes imagine what an absolute.

You. I'm cool you suck or trying to ex-cultivate yourself or demand. Something of someone else. Don't go changing to try to save me oh. If that's what you call moving on while I'm moving out hey good luck in the suburbs here. I am on the piano and they're asking me man what are you doing here. It's like god damn.

This guy is a smug hostile prick and I'm assuming the characters the main character in the show was as well. I don't know probably never gonna see it but whatever some of the songs are still pretty. Goddamn catchy okay have I talked to you guys about the white noise thing yet because I really think this is really interesting so if you guys know anything about the movie biz right now one of the hottest power couples in in creative end of hollywood is noah bombach felix's least favorite director and greta gerwig his younger female paramour. It's funny noah. Baumbach is is like the dark alexander payne for felix because felix loves alexander payne and he hates baumbach and I honestly think part of the reason comes down to the fact that bambach is actually jewish and alexander payne is a midwestern greek guy which means he's kind basically jewish in that his relationship to like mid-america. Milieu is like similarly alienated but it's not quite the same thing which means for you know someone who's immersed in jewishness. Their whole life less maybe annoying so anyway he hates bomb back but so babak has been making these netflix movies for a while. Now he's he's on the creative end of the lost leader ledger for netflix. We've got bombach the guy who made you know movies like like marco at the wedding and the squid in the whale middle blo middlebrow classics at the very tail end of independent theater as a concept and in those early days he was married to celebrated and talented actress. Jennifer jason lee but they had an affair.

I believe in part because he cheated on her with greta gerwig. If not he cheated on her with somebody for sure and then he ended up making a movie about it. Mary's story and hooking up with granite gerwig and together they've collaborated on a couple of movies and she's like his younger protege and also a wife I guess or girlfriend. I don't know but so they're both indie people. You know who came out of those those moderate budgeted movies that existed on the margins of the big big studios and were meant to you know gobble up make enough money for investors. But we're not supposed to be huge ledger items but of course that whole economy has been swamped by quantitative easing more than anything. I mean we talked about at the end of last week about how the the final time fix to the crisis of capitalism now is in quantitative easing from the federal reserve and what that means is now. There's so much money circulating that profits have to be massive to justify investments and because investments are massive because there's nowhere else to put it so. Let's get some laundering through the system. So these guys all get squashed out but so he got to enjoy sort of the apogee of that like I said squid in the whale margaret at the wedding.

These movies played in theaters. I went and saw them in theaters. They were talked about by cognizancy and literacy greg gerwig younger of course comes. In a little later. She gets a few of those before she ends up getting swallowed by the same economy he does and so I honestly I think because gender plays a role but also the generational thing baumbach had longer to establish his name as like a brand. They are now both at the two ends of the stick of like the creative in hollywood. Now the the the filmmaker at least film runner show writer whatever so if you're a filmmaker with any kind of clout in the industry. Your choices are you can make on netflix that will never get seen by or talked about taught seen by anyone or talked about by anyone. Some people will watch it while they're on their phones or fully laundry. They might tweet about it a little bit. It might get a little bit of mean rubbage but that conversational the thing you went into it for basically to be someone that people talk about you know one of the things that fuels the egos of filmmakers that's gone. But they'll give you creative freedom because they're just signing checks. There's just an algorithm that's making decisions you don't have studio executives and people thinking that they actually have a role and of course. Creatives hate those people but we know now from the netflix example that some pushback requires filmmakers to get more ingenious and to like look at their film and address it critically in a way that they wouldn't otherwise and makes in general for a better movie not always when you've got. Colonel kurtz having spent 140 million dollars on an adaptation of white noise which is a movie that takes place entirely in and around a college campus in the midwest. So that is where you end up you end up in the creative weeds trying to hack something out of just this big blob of money on a streaming service or if you're a little late to the game and maybe a woman you are. If you're greta gerwig you get to make a smart thoughtful you know subversive actually version of barbie you get to do ip for a studio. Those are your two options that's that's where you get to go. There's no other place like the best case. Scenario now is not that you get to make a movie and then you have people see it and have every step of that process. Part of a careful deliberative. Winnowing into you know the highest the highest amount of clarity of purpose and meaning. Instead.

It's people just drowning in a sea of money or it's you being creatively strangled by the ip shackles that are required to get anything else made for any significant outside of the streaming economy and of course the pombac deal is running out. He's probably going to be one of the last guys to get that deal the barn that they're closing they're pissed. They're calling them the they're applying some friction to the market. They're tapping the brakes a little bit and so the first thing so they're going to get stress tested are these things where there's not even any theoretical money where it's just a build technology. And capacity play where profit is out the window which is only possible because of cueing quantitative easing and applies to things like netflix and um netflix more than anything but also like lift and stuff. Those guys are in trouble tesla. They had to sell their bitcoin that lost to show a positive cash flow for the quarter which is a big eyebrow raiser but the most vulnerable of all is netflix because it doesn't really have anything all this. It's it's value at now hey we're going to create. This like streaming capacity has now been absorbed by people who have ip like disney or warner's tech like amazon or it just met basically a domination of the personal computing space in such a way that their profit flows elsewhere are such that they can throw money down that hole forever because I don't know how many people know this but for the last decade or so apple has just been sitting on a trillion of trillions of dollars that they can't settle anywhere because there's no way that it'll be worth it to put in an investment versus what they're going to cost in taxes and so they're just looking for places to write off money and apple plus is part of that and so they're going to be able to hang around forever but netflix has nothing. They frantically spent zillions of dollars to build a catalog but they're just so far behind the eight ball compared to the other. Ip holders that they were never going to do it. But part of the strategy was get quality names and give them all the money they want which is just like letting. Kids eat sugar for every meal their teeth rot out.

There's a couple of people who use the maximalist format and the indulgence well like there's a reason scorsese is one of the greatest obviously and it is that they can be like oh. These insane idiots will give me all the money. I want all right. I'm going to use it to to utilize special effects technology in such a way to intentionally alienate the myself from the audience of this picture to make them be pulled out of space and time to be intentionally alienated in a brechtian sense from what is being watched and that is astounding is that you have a 160 million dollar exercise in brexit and alienation. That's what the irishman was that's because scorsese is the king he's very very talented. He's a genius even in his late senate. He's almost 80 years old. Now a lot of people say scorsese. He's a middle brow choice for best picture or best director and that's what I say hey well first of all. He's in the conversation for me. But the reason he's in for the conversation for me is hey idiot film is a middle brow genre the more capital it takes to make a piece of art. The less art is in it you can put it on a chalkboard and the anomaly of netflix throwing money around where it doesn't have to relate to profits is what allows him to go in there and go yeah. I'm going to poke the audience in the eye for three hours and basically do an old man look back at his life's work only for like. It's frank sheehan looking back at his life's work of being in the mafia and it's scorsese look at him looking back at his life's work of chronicling the mafia and really what I think that movie is about is scorsese who grew up around gangsters in little italy but who was a nerd with asthma who had to stay home as he looks through the mirror darkly at at sheer and all of his protagonists. All of his criminal. Bad his criminal anti-heroes and he and he says like and he points out like their end is this this misery.

It is this end state of total alienation from everyone and I don't have to worry about that. I am not suffering that because I get to do art because I get to tell stories about them instead of do that stuff. I mean you know I'm benefiting from the same capitalist machinery that they're all part of. Because organized crime is a fun is like a load-bearing member of the capitalist political economy it cannot not exist. In fact it must exist and it must be directed towards capitalism's ends which is very easy because organized. Crime accumulates people who care about money and therefore they can be socially organized along a class interest that is basically orthogonal to you know the legal classes and they'll do what you need to do. They'll do the stuff that can't be done in a democracy and that's a big. Part of the irishman is is the relationship with the teamsters and the way that they warped the labor movement and maybe killed kennedy. We are live why are people saying we're not live. I'm talking why do you think all right. I will let me go to twitter.com and tweet. I'm gonna do it right now you're gonna hear. Here. I'm live dummies are you even if you're gaslighting me. I don't care all right so that's the kind of gold. You occasionally get from this model. But what you're mostly going to get is people who are at the end of their creative rope probably who aren't getting challenged anymore and now are just being indulged to their extremity and they're gonna be able to you know it'll be interesting. It'll be better than you know the gray man or whatever the.

But it will it'll not be a movie which is what they used to make you know the chat. The the the challenge won't be there so the effort won't rise to it and that's why streaming is just a new and lower form of art. The problem with talking that way is that people get defensive because they think they think that if you say that a form of art is like less meaningful than another one like you know in terms of conveying the human spirit. All that stuff you all the abstraction. All the abstract pleasures of art that are like the the apollonian elements of art that are that are rested right on top of our dionysian desire for just distraction and indulgence which make up you know. That's why we look at art also because it feels good but it doesn't just feel good. It also connects those feelings the good feelings to something that is eternally good and say that's what art is that doesn't mean that you're bad for consuming it. It's what's on offer and we all need something even if it's cruel. The problem comes when we decide that no the gruel is all there is and that actually all that other stuff is worse or inferior or at least the same thing and I don't need to engage with it.

At all. There was a tweet from like a a british newspaper or something that said you know people say that there's a less lyric culture but that doesn't acknowledge. All the words that people consume in the television and films. They watch like yes because that's not literacy that's not reading for christ's sake. So that's why you can be. That's why. I try to indulge the middle position as I do in everything where I am. I just sort of try to suspend myself eternally dialectically between the adorno critique of popular mass culture which I think is is a correct sketch of like social function and the fact that that's what I got you know. I'm not on a mountaintop. I'm in a house. I have time to spend what do. I want to spend it on. But I acknowledge it as that what. I don't do and what i. I try not to do anyway is try to infuse that consumption with political meaning that is the most important thing because I earnestly believe that the the cult the cultural turn is really just a response to the the death of politics. It's not the result of people making a choice to betray the revolution or sell out it is that the grounds that they lived on that fought on had shifted underneath them and they had to adjust themselves to this new reality in which the the the halls of power were closed. The real political action had been foreclosed. The cia had gotten up to its business assassinating everybody it needed to but that's really just a mop-up operation. The real war is fought in the late 40s and early 50s and but by the time you know we come up We've seen the ground laid by you know this machinery of death that just has clipped our democracy such that it existed into this form. But you know that's because the the the social engines that built class power from the ground up were sabotaged.

Bro. We're broken up. We're blown up tapped. Hartley dropped into the machine boom you believe lost your. I don't know anything about cars but it takes a while for the machine to you know it's still coasting on its own momentum and we were there for a while. But it was since the 70s we've known even if we can't see.

It say it that there's no more horizon for political action and so where else do the culture hoping that maybe we can push the culture collectively through willing it in a direction that might get people to act differently to reclaim their political destinies. That's of course what we're all going to want to think because what's the alternative what's the real alternative smashing yourself to a piece is against the state defining yourself against the order until. It destroys you but we saw the people who tried to do that and that ended up just being its own form of indulgence as much as people going corporate or whatever the or making the cultural turn and deciding to go to the academy and tell everybody about you know the semiotics of elf in order to get them to become marxists. My head is tic tac shaped. I think that's true it's pretty much a square they called. They called scandals. Square heads for anybody who's seen dead wood because they had this head shape minion maybe maybe a minion also but we're at this point now where people can no longer hope that that their consumption of politics can stand in for action because action is becoming imperative like people feel a sense that oh there's this thing coming towards me. There's this train coming towards me. What am I going to do or am I going to go and there's no guide because we've we burned the map and so there's a huge incentive built into our social rituals.

The ones that technology has bent us around to seek to escape the question of of action by creating pseudo action and then consuming art is part of that and again I'd say that basically a hundred percent of the of what passes for political conflict online like what those what people are talking about like at the very sharp end like not even democrats or republicans. But like you know the the left and the right as as groups is people shouting into a mirror and that they are both beholden to their paralysis. Both addicted to their participation in the orgone cycle of online politics. Both made sick by that because they feel the anxiety deepening and can't do anything about it. They feel the misery deepened. The alienation deep ending can't do anything about it and loads their own inaction but they cannot confront it so they have to recognize it in a mirror in a mirrored twisted image where their participation in it is laundered basically like you get to look if you're a a lib you get to look at your. If you're a socialist you get to look at the at the right. The gripers as these death obsessed psychopaths basically who who want to see the world burn well by their actions by our by your actions and their actions are basically the same your actual things you do in your life. The stuff you do the stuff.

They do. It's the same thing and if that's bringing about the end of the world well then you're doing it too. You just are thinking differently about it and it's the thinking differently about it that makes them bad and you good but that is superfluous. You have to pick a side for the thing to work. You have to get on one side or the other the seesaw for the thing to go or like you're the two hands on the on the on the pump car you know the old cartoons pump car going down the railroad track you need two hands for that. Some of them can use one but a lot of them have two because like that is that is the thing that all of this is meant to 

Overlook is we feel this anxiety which manifests as loathing of the self but also loathing of others loathing of who we feel is responsible for the moment who we feel is responsible for why we're here now remember. We feel some responsibility of ourselves and I would argue that for the most part that is a neuroses if you're not amongst the actual like architecture of power. If you don't have capital that you are actively managing I think you can't even be said to really be responsible in anything other in any way that is real your day-to-day actions are the same as in their intent and interaction with others as most other people in the in the dispossessed class are but we feel responsible because we're putting political subjects in a punitive democracy and it's our commitment to that belief of that belief in ourselves as that that makes us feel this degree of guilt and it's the guilt that has to be turned into hatred of others and punishment. Someone has to be responsible now if we could look at it as a system and eliminate the judgment the need to judge ourselves or others for their participation. Then we can notice oh the people responsible for this. I don't I've never seen one of them in my life. Probably you haven't the people I interact with on a day-to-day basis.

Regardless of their political opinions are in the same boat as me and then you can say okay well. What do we have to do to survive this coming this thing that's coming towards us this train on these tracks that we're locked to what do. We do and we have two choices. We can get on try to get on the pump pump train or we can find someone to put in front of us. Now here's the difference between those two actions the pump thing that's not a political choice in the way that we think of it. It's not voting for somebody. It is actually doing something on a daily basis cumulatively with other people towards a goal pumping it out there because that is all you can do to engage with a capitalism that has been fully abstracted to servers to algorithms that are inaccessible spatially and conceptually to the average person that you might think you represent.

Somebody says do I do any rituals. This is basically my ritual right here the biggest one. I do anyway but if the question is it what are we what am I going to do together to avoid this from happening. If instead. It's well. It's not gonna not happen. It has to happen because I'm addicted to the things that it gives me and I can't move because I'm scared to be in a situation. That's less pleasurable in the moment than the one.

I'm in now because I can only imagine things getting worse but there still is politics well then. I can vote for somebody to get put in front of me so that I can watch them get hit by the the cow culture in the face before we get it and I would say that those that that desire is what stitches together the entire corpus of the american political body. Now you could say on the left that's not fair what about people who want socialism yes socialism would be. Would be a way out of that but socialism cannot be built politically right. Now what can be built politically right now is machines of retribution at the national level. I'm saying at the local level local politics could be an expression of that pope action. I was talking about but the national level. It can only be a weapon of what is perceived as defense against the other and then and then retribution now the problem here and the reason that so many liberals are terrified even though they can't move just like the rest of us is that this is wildly asymmetrical. These are wildly asymmetrical political alliances like when we talk about people who are sick of the system who would go against it who would break its rituals who would willingly go into a defiant relationship to all that is there's plenty of people. Like that. Now there are a lot more people who have been beaten into acquiescence or terrified into it. But there are a bunch of people who are just sick of this. But they can only be meaningfully politically aligned by the right through the mechanisms of spectacular politics that we're all fixed within because on the right you have a vastly larger group of people who are willing to conceive of conflict why because they would not be going against the state.

They imagined that they would be claiming the mandate of the state police high-ranking military officers suburban. This system I would go down and I would throw down against it. Many of them have they vote for democrats out of the compulsion that they're better than them republicans but they are not organized. They do not have that kind of relationship to the security institutions of america and so they have no they conceive of a rupture as confronting state power and that's terrifying and that means and and it's exacerbated by the fact that the higher you are within this structure. As in you're not voting for democrats. You are a democrat or you demographically are among the group of democrats who actually determine who gets to run for democratic offices.

You have absolutely no desire to see a rupture because you're still sitting in your. Suburban home fat as a calf because your side won the culture were the 60s which was a necessary victory because capitalism has to be in a global capital global capitalism must be cosmopolitan and culture. It is necessary and that's why a bunch of think that defending national reactionary social formations is some path to conflict with capital but that is organized around this land-based capital that is essentially a residue of feudal social order and is grounded in a way that your participation as just a voter or rooter for the right isn't and which means that in a rupture it will reassert itself using the technology of capitalism. It will not advance away from It will not advance from capitalism to socialism. It will regress to the sort of of techno technologically infused feudal land-based regime of domination because that is what's getting the backup of organized resistance on the right to capitalism. It is not exploitation through class. It is alienation from culture because no matter what this actual class position of someone who is in a sense of personal identity consider themselves a rightist. It is a belief in the hierarchy. The vestigial hierarchy of pre-capitalist social formations and we are left with the task to infuse. The relatively few decisions we get to make in a day with meaning and and remove them from the realm of the automatic that sucks because you can't talk about it.

You can only really honestly. You can only be poetic about it and and this is not a poetic age. This is a place where if you want people to hear you. If you want people to hear your voice it has to be It has to speak in like a a very concrete prose because we've robbed. I mean it sounds kind. It sounds you know cheesy to say but it is true. We've robbed as we like as we've robbed the public square of spirituality. We rob it poetry because we rob it of that if the the recognition that there is something unspeakable unobservable undescribable about experience we labor under these cultural delusion that that is not the case and we're being driven insane in fact by that by by the inability to to communicate. Poetically. We can only communicate literally which that's for machines that's for robots which capitalism is trying to turn us into so. You gotta put poetry into your life that sounds super fruity. I know. I'm sorry but it is true.

That's all I got over here and the way that I feel better about that is like yeah that sucks that's not very good. But I'm one schmuck. I'm not. This is not my job. This is not my job. This is not any getting to aha is not any of our specific jobs.

Our specific job is to be there for it to be there for history as it occurs and stealing ourselves and and directing our minds towards that goal and then playing a part that will be determined by time and space and chance in a way that cannot be anticipated and would be foolish to try to because if you anticipate it. You are basically locking yourself into a doomed relationship with it because guess what however whatever you tell yourself it how it's gonna go. That's what your secret demonic little chipping voice wants it to be that is the motivated reasoning of someone who is locked in a libido relationship with spectacle. I know I am because if you can sketch out something that you believe is going to happen and then act towards it politically. I mean like as an architecture as like large events not lives in your events in your life talking the broad ones saying well well. I can't think about what's gonna happen in my life until I really get understand what's going to happen in the next five years. Globally nationally nope that that thing you're going to build out of that that's that ship in a bottle and it's a ship that is you're designed to go you're designed to go onto the other. The other opium addicts. I am at the end of the day.

Optimist because like what what is the what is the what is the moral political telio what is what is the animating morality of socialism. It is the creation of heaven on earth not heaven as as as communion with god which we cannot have but heaven as we imagine it in a folk sense as a place where people live through time through perception through sensation but without alienation and of course like it is a cornerstone of liberal understanding of the world the one that they've been trying to drill under our heads for 150 years is that that's impossible and that any politics that has that at its base cannot be successful. It's going to kill everybody if you think you're but the reality is is that anything that is not driven by that anything that is in fact driven by the end sage. Capitalist concept of man as essentially at war with itself can only be directing itself subconsciously towards annihilation. It's like congratulations by avoiding utopian thinking you have guaranteed a dystopian actual ending and what would that look like given our understanding of what humans are capable of look back at history and see what humans acting in concert can do in terms of extending their consciousness to each other beyond one another using technology. I mean we've seen enough examples just in the actual history we've lived.

We don't even have to imagine and extrapolate into the future. Like the sci-fi folks have been doing for the last couple of hundred years. You can just look at what we've done every element for a global sweden. Basically you know a place where maybe people do kill themselves because there's nothing because it's kind of boring. But there's like a basic dignity to life and therefore resultant relatively low level of social pathology just like that is absolutely achievable given what we developed technology technologically as a species over the last 100 years from the not just technology not just high-tech. Like the green revolution allowing for like un never before understood or conceived possible population densities in the world transportation energy we've been. We've solved this. This weapon of destruction that's going to kill everything because it was all built in the context of capitalist accumulation and of course the capitalists want to look at all. The advancements say that was capitalism. It's like no all the doom.

Now of course you might say global sweden that sounds boring and and shitty india and yeah if you're like socially reactionary or you're even just like anti-woke which you know fair enough. At this point. It's just if you're still caring about this stuff at some point you're going to pick a side and just out of boredom. So. I don't blame anybody who picks any side if they're you know. I don't care but of course global sweden would not look like sweden. Global sweden would not be capitalist because sweden is capitalist at the end of the day. It's just one part of a capitalist machine that is able to negotiate a spatially and geographically fixed relationship with capitalism that was only sustainable there. Those conditions globally is not some sad some igmar berman movie with a bunch of people looking longingly into the distance. It's people working towards goals all of them that are socially and individually aligned. That's not the machinery of orwell that he feared of and that's because he saw the soviet union in the context of scarcity. It would be people moving towards their best use of their own will in accordance with their position and I think if you don't have that as a political horizon then your politics are worthless because the only alternative to global sweden is geohell.

This point has been made for a very long time. Rosa. Luxemburg most famously put it in socialism or barbarism. It's it's banal and it's true so you have to ask yourself. What is what how do you get there. And I think that for a lot of people who even on the right who would say those are my politics. Global sweden white people everywhere having a good time again. It's about the process of building it. A society that makes global sweden through genocide will be internally warped because guess what it will not be in both. In creating socialism. It can't create socialism it will not dethrone capitalism within itself. It will try to maintain this surplus this. This volk surplus diverted to the center by starving the every periphery holy. What I'm saying social when I say global sweden. I mean global swedish standard of living not talking about anything other than that we're talking about given the conditions that we have in this world.

Given this technology we have now how could people live like as in access to things like health care and calories rewarding work safe clean streets that that's all. I mean oh there's fascism yeah sure. I'm saying. It is this spatially and geographically fixed relationship to capitalism. That of course is dissolving all those spatially fixed relationships that got built over the course of the truce between labor and capital and the post-war era. They're all unraveling and they're creating these baronial revolts by local reactionaries. Because there's no social. There's no working class to resist anymore. They've been defeated and I'm saying a world with global swedish standard of living does not have the social problems of sort of of of sweden. It doesn't have no problems. It has personal problems everybody's. It's.

It's who was it who said it's socialism is converting hysterical misery into everyday unhappiness because we can all. Live with everyday unhappiness we cannot live with hysterical misery. We drive ourselves to destruction to escape it and the peroneal revolt is a goddamn absolute dead end watching peter thiel say like oh we're gonna need to do We're gonna need to do techno theocracy here to save capitalism and save save freedom like guess. What that's exactly the goal that the globo homo agenda that you're trying to defeat is trying to do is empower. The algorithm formally it's been in power for a while now honestly the same year that transf that terminator 2 was released is the year that the algorithm became self-aware 1991 for the soviet union. But of course it's hidden behind these inefficient screens of democratic accountability that are undermining its ability to function because we have to all act like politics still exist even though they don't and so now we've got.

This gridlock where no crisis and crisis are just going to keep piling up on top of each other look at good lord corona is still running wild and now we got monkey pox showing up of course for the right. Seeing these crises pile up and then become unaddressable. This can only be explained by secret cabals and great resets. It has to be intentional because things like the united states and capitalism and the constitution are good and have good are a strong are a blueprint for stable and secure and upward advancing government. Not a unstable truce that is constantly being undermined by changing economic conditions and so they ah it's a great reset well look. They're. They're they're making they're gonna when global warming starts like swamping huge parts of the world they'll be like yes. They made this happen they're trying to get rid of oh they're cutting the power oh they're cutting our food supply. It's like no the system can no longer sustain itself because of its piling internal contradictions that political paralysis if rendered unaddressable and the only sense. But the only sense that the reactionary revolt against capitalism can make of that is as plans as cabals and any working-class energy that joins the right will be organized around those principles because they don't have the ballast. They don't have the the the cultural capital and real capital that would be based on to present an alternative theory so yeah like we're gonna just fall from the bottom into a pit which we can't speak of and that pit is not here's the cr.

Here's the most important thing that pit is not the end of the world that pit is not the real inferno. That pit is just beyond the pale of settlement beyond the legible world that we who are in this hall of mirrors have arranged to make sense of our world. It's just out of the picture it's out of contention. It's out of the political subjectivity that we are all related to one another within and then those who aren't falling are going to be moving to one of two spatially fixed capital accumulations that are going to have the same robot security guards and and psychotically armed police and and physically removed elite but different political rituals around that and different stigmatized groups to be ritually punished for the misery. Everyone feels but can only be directed in its blame outward because we've lost the voice. We've lost the voice of the human race which is supposed to be the the self-conscious working class speaking together. Now. It's just a cacophony of people who consider themselves first and foremost as consumers not their fault not their choice. This is why I have to reject at the end of the day spirit conspiracy fixation because it is a search even from the left for someone to blame and punish and that is surrendering our political horizon and saying we're not going to imagine anything better any time in the future. We're going to imagine We're going to imagine payback for what's going to happen anyway. And I think any of that energy that goes out in the world is going to get used by capital. It's not going to be because violence. I'm not talking violence violence on behalf of a nascent and growing connecting working-class movement. That's that's the purest sort of sacrifice. I mean my god you're talking john brown stuff there. But you know that the time for that is obviously not now because where where is the working class structures to direct it.

They don't exist. They will be made by the future we'll all have to be there for it but anything that wants to find someone to blame now is just going to be playing into the hands of a capital that will take that energy in any direction. It wants but anyway to get back to why. I'm an optimist so the thing I described right the utopian horizon where you have people working technologically together towards full consciousness. Full species consciousness well by I mean just logically the same way that christians say that you know god has to exist because we can imagine him that has to have happened somewhere because we can imagine because when we're talking about human history and not human as like a species but human as consciousness as conscious life which humanity is part of but only one strand of a much denser connection of of of states and manners of consciousness then that that that history is also unbound by time the number of chances. The number of conditions that emerge are basically limitless which means that the number of outcomes is essentially unbound and that's one of those outcomes and since that's going to happen somewhere. Someday. Then any act we make towards its goal will make us feel good. See this. I'm basically doing a humanist version of rocco's bacillus gear because those guys are of course the people who have extinguished any notion of the sacred any notion of the una. The un the unquantifiable truth and have re resurrected that in without even knowing it in the form of this.

This algorithm that they worship because they imagine that it is outside of them but really it's just a container for their their selfishness. They're like oh yeah that machine got built somewhere and if you're not helping it get built it's going to punish you well what look at there. The goal what's making you act fear of punishment you're just resurrecting the the the angry god of protestantism that drove capitalism to destroy the world in the first place and what a shock this is it at its end stage when you've got to the point where smart people really can't take religion seriously if they want to be in another room with a bunch of other smart people. People who understand computers and such because we're all we all know that sky fairy stuff is nonsense but future omnipotent time traveling ai well that's certainly something we can consider you've just made god again dude but you've made it in You've made it not as a repository of of connectedness and the love that that rep that is rep that that connectedness is represented by in our experience but rather our reptilian loathing of one another our fear so our. We can only act because the machine is compelling us to act not because we want to want in the deepest centered sense not of wanting to satisfy our neuroses and our pathological relationship to the things around us in a way that distracts us from our deepest feelings but one that makes a resonance throughout our entire breeding and we all know we can't once again. This is the thing where we know what this is but we cannot really describe it to each other because it is an individual experience but we all know that feeling the reason everyone is going. Crazy is because we live in a society where we are basically forbidden from doing things like that most of the time and I know I did say we live in a society but it's true we really do. The joker was onto something there and we live in one where to advance the self which we rationally understand is what we should be doing.

We have to absorb things that make us feel that way and so we have to build an angry punishing god to compel us to act one way allowing us to indulge ourselves on in other ways. So we have to just find things that make us feel that way and then build around them lives that can accommodate them and they can connect them to other people who can feel the same thing because people getting together who feel the same pull towards acting together are beyond compulsion. This is one of the big but that but the thing that gets us to that point it has to be a combination of our values our abstract values but also our necessity like what we have to do to survive. There has to be a moment when we can bring those together and one of the real problems of the contemporary left and what prevents it from being a left in a meaningful sense is that by definition it is largely volunteer and a voluntary left is one that will skew disproportionately towards the people who understand their experience of capitalism as one of guilt and accountability and a desire to to have that expunged and that means that their engagement with politics will tend towards in large enough samples to be indulgent. Not that there won't be a desire to do good things there and people who want to do good things there. But they will always be swimming against that current and this is why the labor movement is always an only and forever the last best hope of humanity because it is made up of people who are in it to win it personally for their families for the people that they love in the near term say like conditions around them and then meeting with others who can give voice to an understanding of the world that can make sense of their position and then act collectively. Now like the bolshevik party of course was made up the reason that the military party will forever be.

The model is because of one and it won in part because it was actually both. Of these things you had a bunch of fancy boy. Emma graves largely not not all of them. Some of them came from the working class like bucharan but or no I'm sorry picard was just like lennon. He was a school masters kid. There were a couple of working-class kids but they mostly stay.

They were people who came out of the labor movement. The trade union movement in russia. Then you have a bunch of immigrants who get to sit around in coffee shops and think about theory all the time and so when they come together in 1917. It is this machine that clicks into place people who are on the ground and did the organizing from the bottom up out of necessity because they weren't getting any food to eat and the people who were doing it to execute guilt and to enact like a a life of of a will to power that all modern subjects do have to some degree or another and they went to war together and they overthrew this art but in the process of winning the war that working-class half of it was essentially destroyed because they were the guys who fought the war. But they mostly got a lot of them got shot and and that politically active connected conscious working class was replaced in the cities by a new generation of displaced peasants whose relationship to the bolshevik party and the soviet state became more akin to their relationship between the up jumped and uprooted peasants who made up the post-victor british russian working class ruling yeah russian working class and the old xyres regime and all you have is this new bureaucracy on top which ended up carrying out not the agenda of like the russian people and not the agenda really of the working classes in like their best their felt interests but rather modernization of russia the creation of a competitive capital formation.

A technologically advanced state capable of going toe-to-toe with the other technologically advanced capitalist states but not using capitalism because their faith basically prevent them from making it capitalism and because of the at the at the tail end of the stick. Once you get out of europe out of western europe and the united states and you get to larger older social formations and you have advanced capitalism engaging with them. It's not they don't get to build so they don't get to build capitalism the way those countries did. They have it imposed on them the way it's imposed on colonial subjects that means stagnation at the bottom that means domination by foreign powers which nobody whether they're a punitive. Marxist who wants to you know save russia and build russia so that it can advance the cause of the global working class or just a great russian nationalist who doesn't really have a vocabulary of class consciousness. You can array a line on that goal and that is the goal that stalin lied around and he did the same thing that the up jumped. Active. Bourgeois did in every country and of course it's very fitting that stalin himself was. Sorry was neither a worker nor one of the bourgeois exiles. He was a lump and proletarian criminal. He was a guy whose dad was an alcoholic shoemaker who got his ass beat every day lived on the street. It was hung out at a at a monastery or a seminary to get some you know free free meals and then became a street criminal in his teens and also a poet meaning that he is not subject to the same specific intellectual and spiritual narcissisms as the other old bolsheviks.

He is able to see clearly in a way that they aren't what needs to be done. You got trotsky as the ur the smartest of all of them of course but also the one absent lenin's will to power. Lenin's brain blows up because he can't handle the contradictions basically but trotsky is left here in a position where he wants to build socialism in russia as a way of advancing global cap the war against global capitalism to to be the real prophet. You know to embody that prophetic role but he doesn't also. He also doesn't want to kill a million peasants to do it. He doesn't want to build a machinery of exploitation. The likes of the capitalists did. He understands that that's not what socialism is supposed to do. Communists are supposed to build out of the wreckage created by that process. They're not supposed at with the machinery and the capital that had been built up. They're not supposed to exercise it themselves but he still wants to do it. So he's left paralyzed and basically begs somebody to take power from him. Trotsky again and again is given an opportunity to advance himself in a way that would have allowed him to meaningfully confront stalin for power and at every point he steps back. He says no that would be wrong because he doesn't really want power because he does he shrinks away from the responsibility of doing what deep down he knows needs to be done.

Then you've got bucharan and the right who I think died had the best diagnosis of the situation. I think were the bukharanites and that they said oh social social revolution is not coming worldwide which means we're not getting rescued by the germans but also if we try to build a industrial state that can compete with the west. Meaningfully it will be at the cost of going to war with our own peasantry which that's not in the caps the socialism playbook and he was right about that. But what bucharan imagined instead was a system where essentially parrot that he essentially wanted to do perestroika seven years earlier he wanted to do He wanted to extend nep and and build build a market relationship with the peasantry to use capitalism to get them to advance their agricultural production the way that they did in the west and the problem there is that that might be theoretically possible but a cold clear look at the conditions. The soviet union faced in that period will tell you that the west would not have stood for that that the introduction of capitalism would have meant the breaking up and the severing of the soviet union. The overthrow of bullshitism and probably the end of russia now maybe you get you get enough drinks in phuket.

He might be okay with that because what's russia it's the working class like I understand this. Something we have to work with because it's a historical reality but it's not real in a way that I should emotionally connect myself to guys like stalin actually thought. Russia was the whole thing so there he so so. Stalin is able to embody this knowledge that none of the other factions can accept and then he neutralizes them all in time. He uses he he he allies with bukharin to neutralize november and then turns right around and neutralizes bagan and carries out. What what kaminev and zenobia have any trotsky for a while. We're all demanding but here's the thing none of them would have been able to go through with it. And if they can't go through with it. What happens to the soviet union and that's because stalin had a did not have a utopian horizon to his politics at the end of the day. There's a there are notes in stalin's archive where he's got like volumes of angles and like angles is talking about. You know the reality like how how socialism would extinguish. You know hierarchies and it would extinguish monetary economy and stuff like that and he would just write hahaha next to it. He believed that his wars man against man is wolf to man all right so that's this week.

I am going to do. I've decided. I'm going to do richard lachman. Rip's book first class passengers on a sinking ship for the next book but not maybe for a couple weeks because I said I might get. Sam granted on the show to talk about making of global capitalism. But might do another q a app maybe later this week before we get to there so stay tuned keep. It sleazy bye bye you.
