Alright here we go and we're back. I know it's been a long time since I wrapped it. You guys as Jim and Carrie used to say but has been going down as you know and honestly. The main reason they didn't haven't really been streaming is because I didn't want to say anything that everyone else was saying or that was misinformation or that was speculation. I didn't want to add noise because it seemed like there was a ton of noise because I mean. We've talked about how this quarantine was slowly being unraveling as people realized that no help was coming and that the nothing was undergirding anything anymore that we really are that we're really there on our own that there's nobody coming and how that situation was do that was sustained due to the fact that we were all apart. We were all segregated by employment and race and quarantine and didn't and no one knew what to do and no one knew what to rally around. And in that moment as I mean the reason that quarantine czar we're already talking about being wrapped up. Even before this I said Cuomo last a week ago was announcing that they were gonna start unraveling the quarantine in early June here in New York without you know any compensation from the loss of life or income or the failure of to the fit. The complete failure to do anything about this so people already wanted out and in and we're coming to the realization that they were going to be coming out and that all of that time indoors had been for nothing. All.

It was was the time for you to wait around and lose your and have nothing nothing does for anybody and for a hundred thousand people to die without anyone really even noticing or saying anything about it and so on that neck for eight minutes and staring into the camera I mean I understand why they thought they could get away with that. You know like a lot of people. Kyun on types of are obsessed with the idea that there was some sort of false flag that the guy is the Ben Bailey from Cash Cab or something because it seems so it is so outrageous even compared to your other police shooting videos because of the the the cold-bloodedness of it. The complete a complete lack of any humanity in it. The not even emotion just impassive almost Borg look on the guy's face and that's why people assume a lot of people assume. This had to be some sort of scam that said to be some sort of provocation. But I mean look at where we were look at what we've been putting up until that point hell me you know like I said the US Senator telling people who are out of a job which is what 40% of the population at this point almost that hey. Good luck and that impassive look that just willingness to be filmed murdering someone.

It comes from the same realization that's filtered throughout every level of control of the society that like we're broken. We're broken people and there's really nothing. We're gonna do about it and maybe two months into the Brett. Maybe two months into the quarantine that would have been true but we got to a point where people got to a point where it just. It wasn't. It wasn't gonna do it anymore. They weren't gonna be able to put up with it anymore because that sweet suspension that most Americans even poor ones are in in America where you have this massive police apparatus designed to keep people cowed. But you also have some thin layer of material and creature comforts and also the in hope that you could potentially improve your situation through striving right over the. All of that is gone all that's left that the the the the carrot coronavirus destroyed the carrot is all.

Those left is the stick and in this and right in your face and the thing about that is is that the stick loses a lot of its coercive power. If people don't think that there's anything to lose and that's where we are now and so people people did something and I think one of the big reasons that it's that the protests spread so quickly outside of Minneapolis. After that first night of love. Fighting was seeing that you could do a thing like burn a police station but you could actually do it something that had never really been dead before and so now people are doing it all over the country and the question a lot of people are and you've seen at least I've certainly seen this paralysis. This this everyone wasn't in stasis and now everything is moving. We talked about how that that's how it works you get you get into a fixed position something intercedes.

It breaks open. The consensus and those things are fluid again in a different way and like we were in a bubble. We were in this quarantine bubble that popped and it was gonna pop at some point and this is what was gonna pop it and this is what popped it. Now what's gonna. Happen. Next is a real question and no one knows and I feel like one of the big reasons that some trying to makes I'm trying to be clear. Here. It's very difficult because obviously this is a fluid and and dynamic and and incredibly dramatic historic situation.

[07:13](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=07m13s)

But I don't wanna get on my hobby horse about the internet but like looking at people trying to make sense of this thing. Online really reminds you that you can't make sense of anything online. It's not designed to do that and it can't do that because so you have the protests at a mill course along with those you have burning of buildings and cars and and looting and and immediately that becomes a moral question. That people have to adjudicate or feel that they must adjudicate because that's how we've been trained to understand politics as observing situations and then informing opinions about them and so the question becomes who's doing this looting is it is it anarchists is it anetha is it the cops is it ray. Jones provocateur is it regular. People who are frustrated is it good or bad because if it's good then we should help or there maybe we should be involved if it's bad.

Then we should shut it but that is an irrelevant question. I would say the answer to the question of who's doing it all those different options. Yes I mean we've already seen video of cops smashing windows themselves and smashed cups piling up bricks. Cops clearly think that allowing things to get burned allowing things to get smashed last night in Manhattan Soho in the Midtown got smashed up and all those awful stores got looted with cops blocks away in giant pie joint groups clearly that's because they wanted it to happen because they think that if these protests are are destructive enough that America's middle class propriety will overwhelm any sense of any sense of injustice. Any sense of anger at the failure of the status quo to provide for anybody and not even prevent them from joining because they probably weren't gonna join anyway. Most people aren't going to join rather. They're gonna look the other way or even oh be okay when the live ammo comes out or the the mass arrests start as in like filling stadiums and with people like that's clearly the the the hope of the police and what sustains that hope is the fact that so many people want more than anything to be right before they do anything because the internet gives us with a fantasy that we can know what the right thing to do is in any situation that we can have enough information about the dynamics of a fluid situation.

Like a nationwide spontaneous outburst of protests that we could determine oh these people are doing it for X it can only result in this. Therefore I should either involve myself or sit it out which is why you see a lot of people on the first night saying this is the revolution this is happening. We will take over obviously that's delusional but they need to tell themselves that this is it to motivate them to do it. Now the other hand you have the people saying oh what are you doing. Don't you know corporations actually love riots. They think it's cool who gives a what they think it's branding. It's PR. They're not involved unless you think target has like shooters out there doing their own looting. It's just ask covering because at this point it is just a series of protests that don't have any connected demands or organization as because we don't have a left of this country. We don't have a movement opposed to capitalism at any level.

All we have our discrete people who whose alienation they process in discrete ways and it's and so black people because they are a separate group within America and are treated as such and live as such have any more acute. Understanding of that alienation that will lead them to take step take a stand collectively in a way that is much harder for any other groups to pull off. But that's that doesn't mean that whatever this is can't become something more than it is and the thing that's gonna make that happen is. People have to just make the choice to except that they can't know that you can't know where anything is. Gonna lead you want to be able to say to yourself by doing enough post reading okay. This is all adventurism. There's no politics to this I'll stay home then okay congratulations enough people do that then you've ensured that that's what's gonna happen because and but especially for white people. There is this Court this. This crisis of what is my place in this. What is my place in this contest do.

I I don't want to crowd out black voices or whatever the hell and that's why you have this cockamamie blackout thing today. But one of the reasons that people that there is that divide and that that this this protests happened along racial lines before they happen along any more abstract class line is because of the segregation of American life and the only way to change that is through action the only way to build the connections. The word that gets thrown around around a lot here solidarity to create organs of deliberation decision-making and coordination that are going to be necessary to push back against whatever is coming. Next that's gonna be built in the streets. It's going to be built in the process of doing things it might not be. But if it but it can be and it's only will there so I think more than anything people need to give up any idea that they can outsmart this thing that they can figure it out. But they could have a take on it that is all-encompassing and so that only leaves your your need your morale and and just for your own so personal preservation.

Because what we're staring down right now is a is the complete collapse of any social order. Other than pure coercion. The the Terminator face be revealing itself completely and the only thing being left the the carrot completely going away for everybody so that is your thought as someone who is more removed and and and protected for the worst deprivation of this collapse than people in the streets that's not gonna last. The profits are still going away. They're still eating the seed corn they're still selling. The popper well copper wiring and stripping the pipes. It's only gonna get worse but the budgets for cops are only gonna get bigger because it's the only public service that they need until of course they could privatize that completely but for now that's not on the table and if we're going to defer going to stop them from doing this.

[14:55](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=14m55s)

Essentially the only way to do that is to build collaborative organizational power against it which does not exist and cannot be built by the internet cannot be built by posting cannot be built by hashtagging cannot be built by Instagram post. It can only be built by experience. It can only build by reacting to things as they happen because right now guys more than anything I'm. Roll tanks in the streets and people by and large will allow it to happen and the only way that's not gonna happen. The only way that's not gonna happen its if we don't let it happen and of course that doesn't mean anything now and it can't mean anything now because we're not in this situation. We're not responding but every day that people stay out there.

It's another day. The power can be built. I'm not. Gonna say I think there's gonna be enough. I really don't but that doesn't change the math at all because winning and being right or being right at some abstract analytical sense. Mean nothing acting means something because only through action can we find purpose and more importantly only through action. Can we find effective counter action effective attempts to stop them from doing what they want to do and you're already seeing that you're already seeing the possibilities that emerge in these situations and with the thing that they need is bodies. The thing they need is people because at some point if there's enough people you find out that maybe that negotiating position that seemed completely impassable. It's not quite as fixed as it seemed because at all because it depended on an assumed passivity among the population that is that can be disrupted and changed change the the the change the power dynamic change.

The degree of of leverage I mean obviously the next step the step that would genuinely help prevent the kind of crack down and reassertion of like a new order of pure coercive of urban essentially open-air surveillance and coercion would be some sort of labor disruption as in obviously strikes but also the disruption of the ability to continue functioning. This is before the economy to function now of course it's hard to get any more specific than that one because things are still happening at least. These formations are still in the process of being formed but but you can see the big formed. They took over a hotel in Minneapolis and they turn it into a homeless shelter and yes of course with the with with the owners allowing them to do it.

But that still speaks to a degree of coordination outside of official channels that looked impossible just a couple of weeks ago and that makes you wonder what could be possible a couple weeks from now. But it's hard to say anything more specifically one as I said because it's still fluid but two because there's going to be a hell of a comeback crackdown coming and the fact that so many people have their entire lives online and have their entire political views online and their entire political actions online is going to be helpful to them in that respect. So I don't advocate anything specific because every situation is different. Every protest is different the composition of every group of people who is are in a given situation is different. The response of the police officers is not always identical. The responsible bystander gerson and the unengaged is different. What I do know is that the only way to prevent this from just being another another milestone on the road towards of collapse not of the states or the state's ability to to control life but rather our ability to live in any way with any dignity with with it with any control of our own existence the only way to stop that that from happening is to prevent them from putting a cap on it the way that they want to and that means first foremost and only right now on at this point being out there if you can and supporting if you can in any ways and in the way that you can and the internet is good to the degree that it helps you coordinate actions and tell you where to go and what and what people need. But it sure is not going to tell you what's happening. It's not going to tell you who the good guys and the bad guys are it's not going to tell you the morality of anything. It's not going to tell you what what tactics are going to be the most effective or revolutionary and which ones are actually you know.

[22:32](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=22m32s)

Those are really neoliberal. No one knows so I would say to anyone. This includes me that as scary as it is. It's also very exciting and you know a new world is being born but just what kind is is what kind of world. It is is one that that nobody knows and I mean the trajectory has been pretty bad so it makes sense to assume. It's gonna just get worse. But if you don't want it to be you at least have to know to be able to tell yourself and to tell your loved ones that you tried and so someone on Twitter.

The other day said said how does this fit with the grill pill and it's it really does. It really does echo the idea that you've got to go out. I mean you got to do something near you and if you're anywhere near a protest that's a thing near you that's a thing near you now the problem is is that this is basically an urban movement as you would imagine and because of the way that that cities have been racially segregated and the way capital has been shifted throughout urban areas. So yeah you have these these city centers that are now surrounded by by reactionary suburbs which is a reversing of the dynamic that persisted in say France where which is France is essentially the country where the model of the the revolutionary spontaneous riot that becomes a that coalescence into an actual. The revolutionary movement was essentially born and then the reverse is true there. The middle of the city is where all the swells lived in the suburbs were over all. The workers lived the red belts around Paris and that's been reverse the United States but the thing that also has happened is that those same urban centers because of specifically because of gentrification. They're also the places where all the all of rich people's money is stuck in real estate so there is still vulnerability. There there still is there's a lot of money. In these cities.

There's a lot of of investment and that is a point of leverage that can be exploited once again. I don't know how I have no idea. I just know that that they're gonna that that the option of just the option that happened after 1968 which is essentially just a strategic retreat for of state resources and white populations from cities and then just malign neglect coupled with a massive. You know police investment that's harder now I mean my god how my god half in Manhattan in the 80s. Half of half of the buildings in like south of Houston were empty. They were really were squatting squatters warehouses. There's very little actual money on the table. In those places. Now I mean all those buildings that got smashed up and Soho those things are all filled with empty apartments that all have billions of dollars sunk in them from the global elites to park their money.

So that's the consist significant difference and that's means that it's gonna be much harder for for them to just do a strategic retreat which would require a retaking and re-establishment of law and order but so far that has not happened but like yeah like the cops. Just let all that hat looting happen yesterday because they want to terrify all the Upper West and North Side people who run the town the people who really have the money and the people who really call the shots not Bill DeBlasio the walther than the Wall Street people they want them to sign off even if they might have urban liberal sensibilities on an untrammeled response but that's only possible if if the people who are under that threat are a small enough group and if they're if they're alone enough if they don't have enough support but yeah I don't know what's gonna happen. I just know that everybody's got a responsibility to to to do what they can because this is what we got the same way that the Bernie campaign was was what was happening and was the shot and was was the process was that was the movement. This is that and it might not it might not be organized enough for some.

It might not have enough concrete goals and I do think those are things that are wildly necessary. But like I said they're not gonna be built by scolding like it's gonna be built by cooperation and by participation with enough people. I will say though that um that I am surprised. By how resistant people are to being cowed by the by the moralizing that usually accompanies any kind of property damage and that is provoked intentionally by the police for that reason because there's less to lose and because we've seen our institutions completely fail us at every level so what the hell a bank. An intact bank window speaks to a a sense that you have a you know you have a a functioning order right and that it's one that you can participate it. But if that order doesn't if that order ceases to hold any real imagined imaginative power of if it ceases to stand for anything good if it ceases to if it ceases like everything in the country. Right now ceases to provide then what do you give a. And I think that's what people are kind of realizing is that the horror they might have once had for. This stuff is dissolving in the fact in the face of the system's complete callousness and incompetence. The overwhelming callousness and incompetence that speaks that is a yute is now felt more and more keenly by more people than any time in in my life.

[30:55](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=30m55s)

That's for sure we're not and people see that it's the cops really more than anything because for every video of some smashed windows there's a video of a cop pointing a hard to talk about bad apples when every police force. Every metropolitan major police force in this country is simultaneously rioting but I don't have a lot of illusions that what's ever going to come out of this is going to be some sort of permanent change I think the best hope is that it builds like I said structures that can move forward from here like people love to compare to revolutions of the past and in fact you've got entire political tendencies that are essentially revolve around recreating of the 1917 October Revolution. But I would say that the thing right now that that this historically reminds me the most of is 1905 in Russia because the Russian Revolution of 1905 caught everyone by surprise including every reform movement every Socialist Party. Every radical none of them were involved in the leadership of them. None of them had anything to do with the planning because it basically was no planning but over time systems emerged. The concept of the Soviet was born in 1905 in st. Peters and that's what this feels like now that doesn't mean that a 1917 is inevitable. But it certainly means that these structures that emerge from 1905 could emerge here because you had a government in in Czarist Russia. That was that lost all legitimacy due to its incompetence lost its ability to project itself as a provider of security or safety. Bred. Anything got their asses kicked in in Japan and and I can't think of a time that more reflects this current moment just in terms of the the general dawning sense that this government in this system is at base function incapable of doing what it is supposed to do at least what we all are told. It's supposed to do and we all convinced ourselves as what is actually supposed to be done.

It's supposed to be doing so I don't have any kind of real health that this is going to be the revolution whatever that even would mean. But if there is going to be any coherent and effective counter mobilization against this slide towards bare face techno authoritarianism. It's going to come out of this because you know if you want to compare to 1905 and then assume 1917 whatever that moment happens is going to come a lot faster than then 15 years later that was also on the knife edge and very well could have led to a complete reactionary takeover and so that's still certainly in the cars but and I think this is important. There's nothing about the protests themselves in any sense that is going to make it inevitable. What's gonna make it. Inevitable is the declining rate of profit and the collapse of of civic institutions the sniffing by the way it's not because I'm on cocaine I have Haller geez thank you very much and it's a little damp today and that tends to make them worse ragweed.

Maybe that's what's is it maybe. This is a calorie allergic to and the scariest.

These cops are I mean. They also are just fat suburban.

I'ts at the end of the day I mean there's only so much work. They really want to do you know. I mean they don't have dreams of countenance panic Dominion. They have dreams of wealth. You know adding another level to their dot deck or something and that's the thing about Americans is that you know. We don't we're not really built.

We're not gritty. We're not our you as much as we fetishize that stuff the reason we do that is because we know we're all soft pudding boys and girls. We know that I mean we know we buy trucks to drive around with and we never take them even off of a hockey pads and and guns so that they can act and feel like they're tough but no but they aren't and then what that mean what toughness is essentially is the willingness to sacrifice yourself a lack of concern at the end of the day for your physical well-being their physical harm and and your your material surroundings and that does not exist anywhere that's and the thing that builds that sense is having less to lose but hopefully another thing that can make you believe that is having more to gain not for yourself though. And I think that's a thing that has hamstrung politics in this country as the world has become disaccharides and as we have become more and more consciously and unconsciously devoted to to a pleasure as an end to itself is that you're probably not going to live to see anything good in this world. None of us no one listening to this no one watching this no matter what happens is out there with this protest is likely to see anything like a significant revolutionary change in their lifetime but that doesn't mean you don't try because the people who come after you matter just as much as you do the people and and that is something that has to be rediscovered and so the feeling like you haven't have anything to lose might get you out in the street. But I think what's gonna get you keep you in the street is the dawning realization that there is something to gain but if you focus on it for in then here now and that's what it seems to me. So many people who like saying this is a good change anything look at this the corporations are saying they like it that is based on an assumption that whatever you choose to do you have to believe not only is it going to be successful in the short term. It is going to bring about some sort of significant revolutionary change for you and if that's the standard nothing will meet it.

[39:11](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=39m11s)

Nothing will meet that standard because that's not how it works. Sometimes it works sometimes you're there holy. But that steel falls but you can't assume that anything you do will lead to that. It's like those guys who spent an entire lifetime building a cathedral. But by the time they're dead all all that's up is like one flying buttress they still did it. It's it's the medieval cathedral and you got to think of it. That way. We all have to think of ourselves as coming together to build something.

That's not gonna be that we're not gonna be able to live in. So we're a build like. Moses wasn't able to go to the promised land. You're not gonna be able to live in the house that you're building and the thing that happens and the thing that will build that is detaching yourself from pleasure as an end to itself which was the greatest and most I guess. Inevitable. Byproduct of capital hyper accumulation is that it it disenchant the world and replaces enchantment with with stuff and if all you have a stuff then the only thing that matters is stuff. I'm not talking about you have to live in a you know in a shed and will lie on a bed of rusty nails like cherish em skis what is to be done protagonist saying that you cannot operate politically from the assumption that you will live to see the promised land and a lot of people. If they the weighing action and the sense of control over their lives versus the danger of doing that that's the deciding factor is oh well that's not going to.

It's probably not gonna work. Anyway. I know that's in the my past. I know that that's the thing that has kept me indoors. It's probably not gonna live work anyway but nothing is probably gonna work until all of a sudden oh. It is and it just the thing that makes the difference is people keeping pushing people not going home people people making a leap of faith like so as again as has been here before my advice is log on to the degree that it helps you know how to log off and what to do when you log off.

But I just I found myself this weekend just getting staring into the goddamn Palantir just and and feeling like the mercury poisoning entering my bloodstream. The paralysis said it the analysis paralysis of wait a minute what is going on who's a lot who's doing the looting. Let's go who's who wants this to happen. We're the provocateurs and if you get stuck at that level. Then we all know what's gonna happen. But the thing that's gonna prevent that is it's a lot easier to make that leap when there's less to comfort you when there's less material stuff to to indulge to imagine and the fact that everybody's been indoors for three months and so much of their their life that used to give them pleasure and just diversion is no longer there. That's a powerful thing but yeah the cops are loading up bricks. The cops are smashing things. The cops are allowing looting to happen because they want a blank check and of course no matter how much they have it ha every scumbag on TV is gonna give it to them when it Khan comes and this NBC will give it to him. CNN. I'll give it to him all these Democratic governors and mayor's who are aghast. Trump are gonna carry it out and the only thing is gonna. Stop them is us so as scary as it seems and I am genuinely scared of what's coming with the drones and and I mean I would not be surprised if there was. It's not a concerted effort to start rounding up. Ringleaders especially now with an tyfa being called a terrorist organization. But if we lay down for it then we're gonna lay down for everything that comes after it. I mean yes so there will be there's probably gonna be some sort of Marshall. Honestly the fact that today is a primary day is very funny to me and the fact the idea of any of this being resolved through elections is very funny so much so that I'm becoming more and more convinced that we might not even have elections in November and I do like the fact that you're already seeing.

[47:16](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=47m16s)

Demands come out of this which speaks to the the the effect. The heat the community-building effect of this kind of thing because you know last Thursday. It was it was smashy smashy but we're already seeing significant formation around the idea of reducing police police force size and budgets which is a hugely which would be huge because the reason they do that. Property values so high. It's. It's how you maintain order in these cities that have been slowly and steadily stripped of all non social networks and social functions and safety net so saying way fewer cops and hey how about this wait if you were guns on cops. That is a genuine challenge because to accommodate that you would have to put a ton more money into making cities function as social spaces that doesn't involve coercion and incarceration that doesn't put the problem in jail and provide revenue streams for private prisons and and that is not in the cards as that's not on the on the long-term plans for any of these people.

But it is hard to imagine this happening in any other context than a three month quarantine and I mean I talked down here on the other streams about the slow steady dawning realization that all of this quarantine wasn't for anything but a lot of people especially in cities especially good liberal people in cities who believe in science and have this sense of a public good that involves not getting old people sick with a potential virus. They stayed home even though nothing was being done to make that quarantine mean anything this gave people the excuse that they needed to go outside. This is this was a thing that superseded the virtue inherent in staying indoors. This was finally a way to get outside without feeling guilty about it and that you could look at that cynically or you can say now they're in the streets and now they could make a new choice. What's the what's the moral thing. Now. What is the community-minded thing now that the cops are out there cracking skulls and shooting people with beanbags and tear gas.

But yeah I mean if you want to keep on that 1917 405 I guess Biden would be like this stupid right. The the mod the moderate PM who comes in and oversees you know a bunch of executions and imprisonments but but also acknowledges you know the importance of transition to democratic institutions and all that stuff I will be up going out to a protest. As soon as this I was out last night. I'd been out. I'm not going to talk about what I'm doing for a number of reasons.

I'm in New York City for one of them and these cops are legitimately Psychopaths and I'm not going to be posting about it. I'm sorry I'm not going to be validating anyone else's opinion of me by by by trying to prove that I'm a good person. But I will be going to a protest after this but beyond that I'm not gonna be broadcasting anything so if you want to audit my my behavior for virtue. That's up to you I'm not going to provide you. I'm not gonna play along with that. I'm probably I will I will level with people that I'm probably not going to pick too many fights with cops because I am disabled as it were but we'll see what happens. I will say though that Joe Biden telling the cops to shoot people in the leg is perfect liberalism and more proof that we have reached the the end point of both political parties trumpet by and represent the terminal the terminal decrepitude of the two major parties and they're there in their own ways their own different ways that are determined by their different social bases. They are revealing their utter impotence in the face of processes that are completely beyond the control of any political faction or even the political class. At this point. I think police unions the day with police unions is I think you limit what they can like organize around you know like two big things that police unions love to organize around are preventing oversight and resisting residency requirements to things that make it much easier to have a police force of suburban maniacs who kill with impunity unions should be able to do something like that Oh. Someone points out there's actually one more perfectly emblematic liberal response to this even more perfect than Biden saying shoot people in the leg and that is a fact that former President Barack Obama wrote a medium post. The format of people apologizing for getting me to has now been used by Barack Obama to tell people to chill out amazing impetus reveling in impetus.

[55:09](https://youtu.be/VpcqUKLnRAs?t=55m09s)

I mean Trump Trump is infinite little bad. They had to shoot up there to fire a bunch of people. It's church and the S David Roth point out that leaked audio of him talking to the governors he sounded like a pissed-off guy calling in to Mike. Franceska show about the Giants offensive line. He's just a spectator like that's why fixating on Trump as always is the chimera and a fail is a failure of analysis because he is as much and in the sea. As the rest of these people Layton their response to Corona was determined by the nature of the American economy. He was not determined by any ideology and the response to this as you see unified police unified forces. Democratic governors. Republican governors democratic government mayors almost fell across determined by the niju reassert power the authority in these cities.

None of that is determined at the political level but if you're sitting up if you're sitting sidelines for this and you're waiting for something better I guess. I think that's what people are saying you know like a lot of the people who were poopoo the Sanders campaign and are now in the streets. They were waiting for something better and a lot of the people who like Bernie and now are skeptical of of the protests they're also waiting for something better and in both cases the answer is.

This is what we have this is what's happening. This is the movement this is where things are fluid. This is where opposition is an organization is being mounted and so if you want things to change if you want to assert any control over the world. Then you must do it through what you use in front of you if you wait for the perfect perfectly class-based political movement to appear. It's that's not that will never happen and all you will have to keep yourself comfortable as things get worse and worse and worse is your own sense that you're smarter than everybody else and that's cold. Comfort let me tell you but the thing that's really most striking is the absolute collapse in institutional legitimacy. We've talked about that and we talked about how Trump is a symbol of it. Now that but this is the most stunning example of it is the fact that the the playbook of everyone getting horrified at some looting and then deciding to condemn.

It didn't happen this time because more and more people have lost all investment in any of these institutions political or otherwise and that's the first and most necessary step for anything to get better because if if you are invested in these institutions they will at the end of the day determine your behavior. Now the scary thing is is that the only institution in American life that has not lost all of its legitimacy is the military yeah ooh and that is why the other person you got to look out for if we're talking early 20th century Russia comparisons of course. This is all facile and meaningless where this is a completely different situation but if you want to have fun with it if you're looking for who's Trotsky you're looking for who's Lenin emerging out of this 1905 moment and you know and moving into the future you got to wonder who's who's carnal love who are Denikin who's Kolchak because the military is the only institution with any kind of bipartisan legitimacy in this country because so many people's family members are part of it and because it has been able to maintain a non political stance relative to the political process and almost no other institution has been able to do that everything else has been politicized and of course. Obviously. The military is political but it is not perceived by enough very many people relative to other institutions as political and that is why if things get worse and if this becomes a prolonged struggle and that prolonged struggle is happening in the context of a prolonged economic crisis oh and by the way a continued pandemic that will continue to kill people at now probably much higher rates and the military might be the only thing that can unify people or at least enough people to reestablish even a baseline legitimacy for order and that's a scary thought every thought is scary right now but none of that obviates there to anyone's moral strategic imperative to grab with both hands the world in front of them and try to shape it for the better.

I hope everybody stay safe. I hope everybody find something that they could do that can make them feel like they're contributing and I hope that fear over tide will turn into something else. Maybe maybe hope we'll see all right guys. I'm gonna be going see how the flippity-flop I think I'll be doing more of these in the future. I think we might be going back to daily daily streams. But we'll see maybe not no promises.
