Again I can see that now sometimes. I think it's the same when. I think that I'm winning and I'm losing again sometimes. I'm gonna take care if I find you've been creeping down my backstairs. Hey folks so who's president. I'm not sure. I don't know probably trump. I'm assuming although we haven't heard from him since he got kicked off of twitter and there's been no hurt since not ominous at all of course and we've got a good indication that there's going to be further attempts to to act as some sort of web-based shock troop to push over the tottering coke machine of american political system. I don't think that's likely. I think we'll see in the next month and the inauguration day will definitely be the real. The real proving ground of this a basically a whiff of grape shot anybody knows what that is It was one of the things that helped cement. Napoleon's legend is when he was still just general and had not yet even I believe not had not even gone to egypt. Yet He put down a right-wing royalist revolt that was threatening to lay siege to the national assembly but with a well-positioned artillery crossfire that drove the mob away from the building and saved the directory as though and as a result. Napoleon continued his ascension to power and I gotta say the parallels don't just end there and this also very similar is the fact that the directory was a completely transactional hollow cynical shell that had no popular legitimacy. So that's certainly history rhyming again but whoever it looks.

I think that we're gonna see these. These ornery whites disciplined because one of the reasons that they're like this one of the reasons that they could just walk into the capitol and not think anything's gonna be bad and think that they can just go home and no one's gonna get arrested is because nothing bad has ever really happened to these people before in their lives. Now that doesn't mean they don't feel precarity and that doesn't mean they don't feel real anxiety about their station and worries about them their future and their children's future but in terms of like getting to do what they want outside of course for the market. If they're employees. I mean a lot of them as we have said are our. You know small small business owners which means they feel autonomous all the time. But even the ones who work have ideologically you know screamed that alienation and maintained their sense of self-assertion through their purchases and through their political activities which have never been curtailed and so now it's happening. If anyone saw the video of the person who was denied entry to a flight because they were on this new like. I guess flight attendant insisted upon no-fly list for people who are identified haven't gone to it and the guy wasn't yelling. The guy wasn't threatening to get his gun. He was crying he was whining at the top of his lungs. No what they're doing is completely different. What are you talking about caesar. Tulum was was like well years earlier are you. Talking. About this is the whiff of grapeshot after venomir jesus. Christ he's just crying because he doesn't. It's like wait consequences and the majority of these people.

Once they see oh you can go to jail for this. Oh there's actual consequences are going to back down now. They're not going to reconcile themselves to democracy into the biden administration and they're not going to be chastened and like vote for mitt romney for the nomination next time. But they're probably not going to be marching around so much with guns and but there won't that's not going to be all of them. Of course. Some of them are going to keep fighting and they will be at every level manipulated monitored and encouraged by the secret police so that we can keep this low running insurgency going and justify further civil liberties destruction and create more spectacle for people to engage with while everything burns. But I wanted to I was wrong about this at every stage. I mean I I'll admit. I never thought they were gonna. Breach the capital. It's pretty amazing. But I mean. I'm sorry if biden becomes president. I was right everything else boils down to anxiety like oh. I worried more than him before we got to this point and there and by the way if I'm wrong and there is a endless stalemate frankly. That's why I don't think it's gonna happen more than anything because it would actually break open this political structure here that has got us completely or or biden is nominated or biden is sworn in and there's no problem either way. If you spent more time worrying about it because you were more concerned than me and we're both in the same place. We're both in front of the same firing squad. We're both watching the same stupid at a stalin speech at the pollock bureau because nobody wants the first to stop clapping even though he's up there and drool is coming out of his mouth and he's been stuck on the same syllable for 45 seconds wherever we are if we're there together and you spent more time worrying than me guess what. I was right regardless of what I thought because none of these people who want to. So anyway there's going to be some sort of whiff of graveshop. And if not then let's stop life and you can't life oh my god. That'd be the worst thing in the world wouldn't it. I'm operating under the assumption that this machinery of coercion is that is so that is literally surrounded. The earth is going to be more resilient than some neutered sterile neurosis.

So I'm sorry if biden gets biden gets nominated if I can get sworn in and there's no coup then guess what. I won because. I wasn't spending this whole time. In a bucket over fear about this thing you won what did you win you get to feel smug congratulations. That's the entire currency we have here so. I don't like. I said forget forget forget what's going to happen. I just think broadly there's going to be a snap on the nose of these people and kind of for now get them back into the column although we'll talk about what that's going to mean long term and none of it is good because none of any of this is good which is why I never bad. But I wanted to start today talking about some about like reinforcing sort of the the narrative of how we got to this place and how we created this class that revolted at at the at last week and these people who now are fully rejecting democratic governance because they have a fully in fully separate media consumptive window where they didn't lose the election where all of your entreaties to democracy and rule of law bounce off because they think that there are those things are on their side like that is incommensurability at a level that cannot be resolved politically which is why people talk about civil war. But like my get is this is america. Most people are just gonna go home especially if they can go to a goddamn outback. In a couple of months. They're gonna go home not all of them but enough to avoid a con apocalyptic confrontation with the state so how do we get here with these. This republican base here and I don't want to talk about whether they're that left One of the most annoying conversations you can have about is trying to understand the class character of these people oh they're working class. No they got. They drove there and they took planes.

They're rich. It's not one or the other. It's it's a whole strata. It's the middle strata and also they're not working class no. They aren't nobody in america is we don't have class consciousness. So we don't have working-class people. We have people who work for wages but they do not especially these people if they are technically working class. They sure don't think of themselves as workers. They think of themselves if anything americans or consumers which mean basically the same thing. But what's more important than the class character which that's meaningless in this context is their demographic character specifically um the places that they live and the the jobs they do. There not necessarily workers like. I said a lot of small business people but anyway the reason that we have this now this. This class of people who are in revolt even though they are as people like to point out relatively comfortable compared to people in this country who are suffering much worse in these conditions but are hyper anxious and aware of their deprivation which is relative. But that's the only thing anybody feels is their relative deprivation and then they feel a a bone deep confidence in their ability to exercise political influence and change that they want to speak to the manager because their entire life the manager has shown up and given them what they wanted. But they're pissed how do you deal with this and then you've got the democrats as the opposition and their party made up of some of the people who are struggling the most in this country and some and most most now of the most educated and wellest off americans.

 um ronald reagan won 80 of the 100 counties with the highest degree of bachelor degree or higher attainment. Trump won 12 of them that's a real thing that's happening and and this democratic alternative which is just the same thing republicans are pushing for but more culturally inclusive. Is the only alternative to it how how can this be so let's start by just pointing out that there's two that two types of capital formations emerge in america. While it was being settled. You had finance capital concentrated on the coastal cities and then you had physical capital before the civil war primarily in the form of plantation slave agriculture and some manufacturing in the north and then over the course of the post-war era. The end of slavery and then the expansion westward we get the proliferation across the country of regional economies that all are fed and then feed back into the national economy which is still headquartered on those east coast cities and this sends the the fortunate sons and daughters of of the bounty of america's conquest um into spatial and cultural directions. So if you are in one of those eastern cities with finance capital as its raison debt you are growing up in a condition around people who are not necessarily only financiers not necessarily only capitalists but also the handmaidens of capital lawyers.

[14:18](https://youtu.be/wR_2edKW46o?t=14m18s)

University professors politicians people who will become the dreaded pmc. That's where it's found how to coordinate a national economy that requires expertise and that requires schooling and it requires manners. It requires civilized civilization in the european sense and that over the course of the 20th century meant that the both middle and working class striving people who were able to access our huge expansion of um access to higher education. After world war. Ii had a choice of how do they want to pursue the bounty of america they could go east and I say east. I really just mean to a city because the cities they those centers of finance and and you know capital. They pop up across the country you go to the cities you go to college. You get a degree and you go to cities to either make your fortune in in with the money itself or make your profession around the money. But that while that's happening while there's this flow of people to the cities. Like this there are regional physic physical capital production facilities and and networks of of commerce that are fixed that don't go anywhere and that don't and that only interact with finance capital and then global capital as debtors essentially as as people who the the ones who are there to give you liquidity so that you can expand and who you owe essentially the old banks that the jacksonians were terrified of those regional um capital finance capital economies around first and foremost extraction mining. Drilling fracking.

Things like that also retail to serve all the people who work in those industries and then all the attendant you know it creates its own parallel economy filled with small business people and hustlers like lawyers in both places but lawyers doing different things finance like financial planners in both places doing different things but in different cultures and after the working class was brought into the political arena with the new deal after working class got a seat at the table as it were the first explosion of of reactionary sentiment which is basically just a restating of the old jacksonian and jeffersonian concept of the totally unfettered citizen the the idea that american liberty is only real if it is if it is without any um any sovereign beyond the individual and that it is just the accumulated actions of these sovereign individuals that makes up the country when it exploded to as the antithesis to the sea. This this the thesis that it emerged from world war ii. Of you know the the fortist keynesian new deal state which was a a creation forged in the laboratories of those big cities by finance capital because oh we have this industrial economy but these workers are organized and if they don't work we can't get this stuff out we have a war to win.

We have a global war over like the resources of the planet to win what are we going to do. We have the money let's give it to them for the love of god. Let's recognize them. Let's get them on the board here. Let's get them in the center pissing out because we can afford to and they were making all these deals and the and the I'm not I swear to god. I'm not uncoke. I swear to christ. I understand you won't believe me but I'm not on cocaine so those deals are being made there within the upper ranks of both the democratic and republican parties but then at the grassroots. In these places where there's like a local candy manufacturer robert welch.

The founder of the john birch society was a candy manufacturer in western massachusetts in orange county amongst the like the knott's berry farm fortune or all the aerospace engineers who came to work for boeing um in the sun belts you know wherever it is it emerged and and then of course in the south in response to integration in every place. The revolt to the new deal consensus came from at the top regional ruling class people. Local national bourgeois types the koch brothers were really just a super super successful version of that they were like the alphas of them because their money is in oil. It's in the ground they're not for not they're not bankers and trump supporters among the billionaires. The lump and billionaires who support tend to be who support trump tend to be not on the finance side but on the physical capital side and um so you know oh um fast food franchise owners car dealership owners. Like the buddy garrity types we know the beautiful boaters local gentry. They are the ones who rebel because they're not in on these meetings they don't get.

They're not sold. They've not been consulted on the bretton woods system and marshall plan. They've not been consulted on integration either which is another thing that had to happen so that we could keep the money flowing and we could be beat the soviets. But you can't talk sense to them because they're not in the room. They're. They're out in the hinterlands and they have their own cultures and they don't interact really with those easter ones except as something to define oneself against so. There's no persuading them even though it's in their best interest because another part is it's not in all their best interests.

The more successful ones over time will be like brought into and by and be bought out maybe at the right time. But the tendency towards monopoly is real and these small gentry are going to be crushed over time and they are being crushed over time and like if they don't if they're not smart and a lot of them are not. Smart and lucky and very few of us are lucky like half of us are not lucky at any given moment. They're going to get crushed too and they're going to get proletarianized and they don't want it. They never wanted it so in addition to the fact that they're culturally separated enough just to never buy any argument for why we should be doing this globalizing economy. They also are very well. They very well might not might be in conflict with it just like all those factory owners. Workers who are told that nafta would be worth it because hey you're going to have much cheaper socks at walmart and if you lose your job.

[22:20](https://youtu.be/wR_2edKW46o?t=22m20s)

We'll give you we'll teach you how to code and that new right was in advance for the 50s and early 60s. Because things were good times were good. It was working for most people when it broke up. It broke out out of the cultural ferment of the the essentially overheating of the cultural economy. The cause that came from having too many young people with too much time on their hands because literally the economy was too good and that is where you get you know You get social ferment and activism and attempts to change things because you have people who are increasingly articulate and able to make demands on on the political system and are able to organize themselves and while the 60s counter culturals were doing that so was this local business roundtable lumpin bourgeois rebellion and it eventually took power in the form of reagan. Now. The thing is these people were resisting global capital but they're still capitalists and also they're morons most of them and at the level and at the political level when you're not even trying to talk to people who like have looked at the sheets. The the the economy or anything are just schmoes reading the newspaper and don't have any more you know understanding of the world than anybody else when you're getting it through capitalist. Media when reagan was elected it was with a promise that even though it looked like the american economy had stalled out permanently in the 70s we could get it going again not by seizing the means of production and redistributing profit which is the only thing that was going to do it that was off the table because the working class had lost its influence by that point and couldn't. Regain it there was an attempt. The 70s saw the biggest wave of wildcat strikes since the po. Since the late 40s it was like the the birth and death pangs of like business liberalism. And our business um unionism in america were with the post-war strike wave and then with the 70s strike weight but it failed and what it meant was you had neo-liberal democrats like jimmy carter who wanted to tell all the people white black whatever look yeah. We can't rely on indulgence. We can't rely on stuff we buy to make us happy anymore. Now.

That's all true what he said but he wasn't doing anything to change the structure of the economy that made people have to find pleasure in goods because their lives were totally alienated. Otherwise he was essentially just telling him to pull up their bootstraps. It's classic the poison chalice of liberal piety right there but who was listening who was listening every every white middle class and up person who had at some point either them or their parents had made the trek from the hinterland to the colleges and to the cities or the suburbs of the cities to work around the money either in the state or in its cultural departments and they had they were going to do good because part of this deal was we got here not because of the physical productivity of the land. We got here because we can use our brains to inter interface with this new data economy. This post this consumer data economy now of course they weren't smarter than anybody what they were was well positioned. Some way to exceed to the manners and social mores of college well probably because their parents went or because they were like uniquely suited for them for reasons that had nothing to do with their virtue could never do but one way or another. They were in a position to thrive regardless and so of course they said yes. There's a lot here hmm very interesting but reagan's answer was what's restraining. America's economy is all of the stuff that makes the economy possible. It's all the structures of regulation and taxation that literally allow the thing to function the stuff.

It took us 200 years to build because the thing kept breaking down. There were like six giant depressions and a civil war in the 19th century and then we had a depression that led to massive social misery and tumult and then only ended when we decided to become the world spanning. Hegemon and then we'd had this this thing that looked beautiful this keynesian synthesis but it was predicated on profits that over time fell as we had to build up our former enemies. We had the soviets there. We couldn't let japan and germany languish which meant eventually they were going to start making stuff and once they did our bloated carcass of a automobile industry which had made itself uncompetitive which it essentially castrated itself to avoid being overtaken by its workforce. Like one of the big reasons that the big three were unable to adapt to the smaller more energy efficient vehicles coming out of japan in the 70s is that the facilities that they'd had to like um to to make a work workflows and and part you know movement like getting a thing from a get getting you know windshield wipers from a plant to the finishing area or whatever had been intentionally dispersed right after they've made the deals with the uaw in the 30s and 40s in order to make it harder for um the unions to secure crucial choke points of production one of the reasons one of the things that that led to is that when it came time to figure out what to do with the new economic order they they were unable to but anyway the chickens were coming home to roost and america was either going to have to socialize production or if it was going to maintain a profit-based economy. He was going to have to dismember the very structure of new deal governance that has allowed it to thrive and if you're one of these small holders or people in their thrall people who live in the same cultural area.

Maybe work for them but have imbued the idea of america. America's good therefore my boss is good therefore. If anything's wrong it's something else. Reagan was able to say all that that's something else that is alienation and anxiety and precarity however it's felt across the class. Rectum is caused by the government holding us back like fry when he's trying to drink the slurm and he's trying to get his head through the grate and he goes. I could get there easily if it wasn't for these damn arms and then chewing them off and that no was more electorally appealing than carter saying put on a sweater. Now of course you might say hey maybe revolution would have been more appealing but there was nobody there by that point because labor had been demobilized bought off and a scattered by that point so for a while. Though the reagan scam worked it was a classic ponzi scheme in the american sense oh yeah we're going to cut taxes oh.

Our cities have destroyed themselves. Our cities are turned into complete bomb cells and we oh that's okay. That's because of the black people they like drugs too much. We'll throw them all in jail but your your places are still great because you've got mortgage mortgage deductions and we've essentially silently reconfigured the welfare state to give you silent subsidies that you don't even know are there and that make you think that you're a world destroying business genius and not a costed little baby being kept in a swaddled blanket because the white middle class is the center of american politics and always has been it is not driving. The caboose of course capital is doing that but it has a crucial like load-bearing structure and it its movement can shift positions like it was the working class were able to get a good chunk of smallholders to go. Along with the new deal. They will follow a strong hand and that can be the left but in america it's been mostly the rights and so well the the end of prosperity 70s like. I said last stream what that meant for African americans was just base. Repression like you'd never actually gotten to the point of political equality and now we can keep you as essentially contained like we give you enough power and influence to maintain patronage maintain a middle class a middle class but anybody who's like falls out of that structure and there's gonna be a lot because we never built up any actual. You know capacity social capacity. There we're gonna just story in general and what are you gonna. Do we're gonna complain. What are you gonna do you just had a big complaint. You just got a bunch of laws passed. All the white people are sick of hearing in it and what are you gonna do one. The republican party is designed to be against you you can't go there. So what are you gonna do you're captured by the democrats and it's tough. The repub the white people is a much different problem. Now the democrats their new base of white people that was set.

They're signed up yeah yeah. Sure knowledge economy. Great go. I'll go to college learn to code. We'll do it and they went to college and they got the jobs now. Some of them now are finding out oh no yeah. That's all now and that's the thing now the check is coming due.

[32:41](https://youtu.be/wR_2edKW46o?t=32m41s)

Even those costed regional lords and their vassals are not feeling. The pinch like trump did very well very very well in counties with high fentanyl overdoses. Now of course he didn't do well against the people who suffered those fentanyl overdoses or their families. They don't vote but they did very well among the wealthiest people who live there because they're seeing it. It's their community and they're unhappy about it and so they have because. But because this is like a a petty national reactionary capitalist movement. This is essentially a barons revolt from a bunch of of pig-headed like feudal lords who have not got it in their head that there's one team here called capitalism. But because they're embedded in their social structures and they're in their fake class affect of I drive a truck and I listen to country music. So I'm basically the same guy as the one who is the dude who mows my lawn.

And he thinks that so that too because I'm dressed like him and we're all living this lie together and who's going to tell us what we're wrong the. The the the gay jews on the television they're not going to tell me anything. There's nothing they can do to break my bubble. We're in here together and we're suffering together and so what is to be done and they are taking the reaganite conclusion to jeffersonian jacksonian logic which is end the state and if you like ask these people like okay. What should trump do what is trump going to do to fix things. Now you might say some people like in the base. They make free male health care whatever that's that's not that's never going to be the the um. The place where policy is formed because remember at the top rank of these people we're talking about these beautiful boater classes. This petty bourgeois these barons. These these are also people who end up going to congress and be and like running for senate and becoming senators as their kids are so they are also the political class of the republican party. Like these are this the party and this class is almost fused it's the same people and that means that they're going to dictate what the response to this horror is. This is neoliberal capitalism rolling over everybody how do we stop it and their answer will be allow us all the unrestrained power of barons because the buried assumption within all of the few the fantasy of the jeffersonian model is well if everybody can do it and of course no it will concentrate where it always does. The money and power will stay where they are but the people under it in the thrall of it within the cultural bubble of it will accept it because they could one day break out themselves.

If they work hard enough. I mean it is a theology and they fully embrace it and it is connected and grafted onto christianity at the route. So what is the trumpian and post-trumpian political project. If there is one and of course there really isn't. It is just spectacle but say they can't. They actually are able to assert and at the state level they very well might be like regardless of whether biden gets in. I don't think you see him ruling for four years without some sort of nullification. Crisis somebody like desantis or greg abbott rallying sabers about refusing to accept federal laws so you could see there like just being in the near future. Some sort of attempt to assert like a trumpian social vision. It's not going to be heron volks democracy. It will be get rid of all taxes get rid of all restrictions on pollution on drilling anything and get rid of all restraint on any sort of inner like consumer-based protection for any financial or or physical product like let lead-filled baby food whatever let the market decide um and because the pitch there is with all restrictions lifted if we assume capitalism and everything is assumed of capitalism. So the alternative to this that doesn't I mean and you can't blame them too much for not believing that this could exist because no one is talking about it. Especially the democrats if capitalism is it do we submit to being turned into soy creatures. Do we submit to this regime and says look we're going to strip mine the earth. But we're going to do it politely in an orderly fashion and we all keep voting and we all pretend to respect each other's religious and ethnic diversity and by the way you now don't own your business. Anymore. You work for amazon. You don't have any health insurance.

That's just the way it is. You could code. If you you want to learn how to code. Grandpa you want to sit in class all day junior to learn how to code. Even though like that isn't for everybody people. There are people who are not for college and not for the kind of jobs that you're supposed to want to get and of course. Even if everyone was there aren't enough of them there aren't enough of them so that's what we're.

That's what the democratic party and now after the trump ban the entirety of culture. The amano culture from tech industry and the tech monopolies to the democratic party to everything you see on television that is one party and it is for turning us all into into little uber eats minions. There is no socialist alternative to this in the discourse. What there is is this this incoherent jabbering that nationalist white like racial nationalist version of it not purely like white nationalists because it will it will it will by definition and for its own survival except others outside of whiteness. But it will just do that by enhancing the side what whiteness means but it's still part of it. Like that's grafted in there right there with the nationalism and the christianity they're all wedged together and they all reinforce each other. What is the policy what is the proposal instead of doing that let's not let the cucks of the u.n. Tell us how much oil we can drill. Everybody gets a pump every surface of this earth because hey it could be you that finds the next. The next mother lode multi-level marketing schemes. No res no um regulations of those anybody with enough hustle can get friends to get friends to get friends to to understand this incredible marketing opportunity. It's okay though yes you're still a minion most of you the ones who aren't in the iron I aren't in compounds.

Most of you are still a rabbit-like peasant but at least you could be a lord as opposed to the the gerbil in the soy plantation who has accepted his lot in life and what despairs makes me feel with despair about more than anything is is that now that we have this like now that after they banned donald it's all out. There there is one agenda. There is one party. There is an establishment. There is an elite everything that you ever said about that is true. It's just. It's everybody except what is the undigestable thing. What's the thing the system cannot absorb what has to be rejected what has to be denounced. Everything else seems to be acceptable including black lives matter including all manners of of socialism what cannot be absorbed trump and so what does that say to the people absorbing the spectacle that the only alternative to the misery of the moment is trump. No matter how incoherent it is and stupid and cruel. It is. I mean look at what is what is trump's real legacy. In these last months he hasn't really been planning a coup. He's just been like hoping somebody else would do it what he has been doing is making sure that they. It's feudalism like the choice is really is. It's it's two brands of barbaric barbarism. It is old-fashioned feudalism in the american sense like you know the plantation master and his thralls and then the pathetic overseer in the middle trying to negotiate the two. And then we have techno feudalism where there is no ostentatious displays of public violence and sadism and domination.

[41:41](https://youtu.be/wR_2edKW46o?t=41m41s)

They're all done behind the scenes they're all covered by ones and zeroes. They're all hidden. We are all too polite to mention them but it's feudalism. In both cases. It's barbarism in both cases and then the alternative to that is this just yeah. The alternative is just this savagery and I am not becoming post-leftified because I am saying that sucks and it is the goal the only meaningful alternative to this and the only thing I will say about that is it will not be by posting and it will not be by monitoring people's anxiety levels and it will about be curating ideologies in the hot house of online and building your. Nothing I'm seeing on the internet which thank god it shouldn't be. It should be people working together. It's going to and it's going to have to happen and I hope it will or else all of the coming misery that's going to break our fantasy of endless indulgence. The the myth that greg grandin talks about will be finally dispelled any hope that that alienation and and pain goes to the mid goes to fill the ranks of opposition to capitalism that goes away if the only alternative to the system is trump. They'll find a way to absorb almost all of it all of it that doesn't go into self-destructive despair or just pure. Apolitical violence and the one thing that like can shine through. This is that this is all spectacular politics and it's spectacular.

It's spectacular nature is what allows it such purchase in people's minds because because it's so easily manipulatable like half those people at the followers or had a t-shirt on that that you could buy at their etsy store. Everyone was selling each other stuff. It was some it's a giant tupperware party. It's self-interested delusion the only thing that can defeat that is a self-interest that is fused to the self-interest of others at the point of work and suffering not at the point of arguing and meta-suffering and discussing suffering and finding a cultural costume for your suffering. So those are the vulgar boatmen. That's the class that we created we created a regional bourgeois that was never forced into full political acceptance of the the system. Because there was never any need they were there making their money themselves. It didn't matter if they sponsored the john birch society or whatever hey. When they took office.

It helped apply pressure from the right to break up a lot of the new deal stuff that capital needed to get rid of. They were very helpful. They were very very helpful and they still are but only within the bounds they have to be corralled. That's why I'm saying. I think there's gonna be some sort of crackdown a whiff of grapeshot because they're only useful as long as everything is together but man seeing like the national coming out and saying trump got to go that's not good like if you are rooting for this because you think it's going to lead to some sort of working-class trumpist alternative to the status quo. I'm sorry if that's how it worked if you could get the like base of a party to dictate to its to. Capital that at its top without like fully organizing around a conflict with capital you're not going to in you're not going to beat them you will be subord. This party will be directed towards a incoherent gibberish sort of national sort of almost like right wing pole pot. Like destroy the city shoot everybody with glasses and then instead of having everybody farm collectively for rice like have everybody open their own like lululemon distributorship ugh but like what the button that's gonna what biden. I think is gonna do.

I'm not gonna predict you much but if he's able to hold power and like the gop doesn't just assert a veto at like every point which they might do like this whole impeachment thing is very interesting because like as I said this trump energy is useful as long as it is you know maintaining stability because these high-level republicans have interests that are that transcend trump but if they think that there's a chance that the democrats could actually change the rules because remember. The only reason that the republicans are able to be the party they are and have the appeal that they do is because they have a gerrymandered and structurally and structurally mandated handicap essentially that allows them to do that if the and that's all not and that a lot of that is based on rules that could be rescinded by a party in power and that could actually threaten them and especially if people are talking about like sending folks to jail and that changes the op-ed writers whose job it is to make the democrats look like a responsive. Meaningful resistance to authoritarian hell instead of its simpering handmaidens. The republican party is psy tolliver and the democratic party is e.b. Farnam. I do wonder if somebody would ever will just slap trump like what if one of the joint ships of staff just hit him in the face.

What would he do because you gotta assume he's never been struck. But they wouldn't do that either because they're a bunch of dorks and they have no real interest in seeing. This like ended. This should all be drawn out as long as possible that's to the benefit of everybody draw it out right to the end. Then trump leaves office biden gets in there's some shots fired There's some bombs that go off there's some shenanigans.

There's a few big raids and then everybody is just too. Spent and anxious at the same time to do anything other than just be baby birds as as it's dictated to us and as I was saying. I was distracted but I think we might honestly see some sort of trial ubi here to stand in for everything else that needs to change because it is the easy quick fix that's why yang proposed it and there is a basis now with the payment. The substitute for effective vaccine distribution or any kind of health care counter measures and that would be the path of least resistance because it doesn't really chafe anybody. All it does is is undermine your argument for deficit austerity which you need to have in order to beat back progressive demands. But it's at this point that's got to be like the one inessential item in your loadout that you can jettison but we'll see. I don't think we're getting anything else that's for sure and we're sure not gonna get any kind of hurt immunity for at least a year oh that at least a year two.

But the big thing about this is that the entire democratic cultural response and this goes for everybody talking about how anxious they have to be and everybody talking about how they need to impeach to send the message that this is unacceptable all that is premised on convincing people right you're convincing the population to for example support democrats against republicans as a stand-in to do what they always want people to do and put country first and make whether or not you support trump a defining issue of whether or not you vote for a republican like. If somebody. I will not vote for a republican who says trump should stay in office or didn't do anything wrong and the thing is is that they can't win that they can't make that happen. They can't make that work because they're not speaking to those people they're speaking to here's the people they're speaking to. They're speaking to the democratic faithful outside of the whole thing who are going to be yes siring to everything who take everything that's yes medicare for all is a good idea but it is impractical. Yes we do need to be realistic about what we can accomplish given republican opposition. They're just there to go -h . Then there's the people who you could theoretically engage to change the numbers the women's who don't vote or don't identify as partisan. But then it's mostly gamma rays because they don't think this matters because they've never seen it mean anything in their lives. They have no emotional connection to the symbology that the liberals do because it is not. The deal has not worked out for them the way it has for the liberals and then you have the people in the cut republican cocoon for whom everything they get outside of it.

All the norms all the norm assertions every statement by every big company. None of that like makes them go oh these things. I like don't like this maybe. I'm wrong they say oh this is a conspiracy. This is literally the elite telling you that democracy isn't real because remember they all think trump won on an emotional level even if they couldn't explain why they are motivated emotionally by a belief. That trump is the legitimate president maybe. It isn't maybe it's being deeper than than believing that he won the election like they might be think a lot of them that the people we have vote mostly shouldn't be allowed to and that means that they don't whatever the justification is the end result is that none of these entreaties to norms. None of these entreaties to higher ideals will penetrate that bubble which means there can be no threat. There could be no democratic like assertion of authority in the halls of congress no no ability to to cow the republicans into doing things because between now and then who knows how many people have stopped caring and the people who will who we know will care are going to be the same people who are always there and now we know a lot of these working class. People who weren't paying attention are now kind of siding with trump. I mean imagine imagine. This imagine trump was your first. Big stuff's happening kind of crazy what's going on. I don't know no one seems to know the dem like there's no clear story.

Mass are good. Mass are bad but now they're good and something about the chinese. I don't know but I do know that I lost my job or family member died of covet or can't go to my favorite bar anymore or you know I lost my health insurance or something. Well what the hell is going on. You've got this political establishment that is unified in its message like remember biden and trump didn't argue about any actual difference in policy about covet or anything else they agreed on the basic hybrid thing of lockdowns when you need and then open things when you can and mostly make it people's personal responsibility to wear a mask and then give people money some money to You know make up the shortfalls instead of shutting. Everything down and letting people stay home and paying them trying to economy at all costs that was the bipartisan answer so that's not the major difference but you do have one guy there who all of the people other people in charge all the media. All the big institutions say is bad and is fact uniquely bad and is beyond bad and is terrible and oh my god. Now what he's saying is mostly gibberish. But what biden's saying is mostly gibberish but trump's gibberish is apparently dangerous. Then there's an election biden wins looks like you won but I don't know who are you supposed to know. This is the media who knows what's who's who's behind any of this stuff but they're kicking them out. They're they're they're kicking him off twitter and off facebook wha what what is he a threat to because remember these people outside of the dem. Enthrallment do not credit the democrats or the constitutional order or or the media or anything for any good thing in life.

Nor should they and it's insanely frustrating that you've got all these people who've decided that you know you might actually need to have public ownership of public goods instead of having like monopoly capitalists being able to to veto your access to crucial infrastructure yeah maybe think about that beyond the thing you used to post beyond thinking we need to nationalize the internet so that my grandkids are forced to like my facebook memes that is how this is why I'm saying there could be no constructive politics with these people because it is all the most selfish brain dead entitled dog. On earth I want to bring back cap. I want to bring back executions in the streets and no income tax healthcare is by lottery but you know it's it's legal for me to sell um moonshine that I cut with antifreeze this. Like the culture they're defending the national culture they're defending against the encroaching globalists which is how a lot of people like to phrase it. They like to say this is a national you know cultural. This is an embedded cultural unit that is rebelling against encroaching capitalism. You know the way like think of all those think about the plains indians and you know um and peasant europe and think of the enclosures. No these people were already totally consumerized pringles.

They were already processed dog well there's snow out there and the idea of oh I'm gonna direct him in the right way. I'm gonna like convince them that my visceral imagery of the american flag or the confederate flag for that matter and like the pageantry and uncertainty and religious fervor of this your is gonna cut through that especially since all of the money will be right against you all the money that is within those you know remaining sectors dumbass like it's hilarious watching people who make fun of aoc and people who take aoc seriously and say oh you're a rube. I can't believe you idiots and then make fun of all of the high-pay media hacks who pretend to criticize the democrats but actually she dipped them back into voting for democrats. How many of them are are convincing themselves right now well maybe not right. Now we'll see that like josh hawley is. It's like the the guy who's going to You know awaken the sand worm and and bring class politics to this like gibbering reactionary petty bourgeois tantrum that's a fantasy as rich and you have to be either well paid or hoping you'll get well paid by by flattering an audience that wants to be reinforced in their worldview already or you're just deluded. There is no hope in either of these parties my friends. The the things they represent are two flavors of the ship taco or. I don't even remember the stupid south park. But you know the truth or falseness of that is never. In doubt they always were by definition they are but whether or not that matters to determine is determined by the context of their of the contest. Like I'd say like a 64 election like that's a real 32. That's a real distinction.

[60:46](https://youtu.be/wR_2edKW46o?t=60m46s)

Even if you're both talking you're talking about real You know a bipartisan capitalist super structure undergirding it but right. Now everything is accelerating towards. Every all conflict is in the benefit of both parties exacerbating conflict is in everyone's best interests at least to the point that they think that they can overtake it like the democrats they're aware. There's a point where they might bluff beyond their capacity and then we could see them get slapped out and they don't want to risk that and that's why I doubt they'll impeach trump because they don't want to be shown to be holding a weak hand because what they want their fantasy and the fantasy of all liberals is at this moment those guys in the guy with the horns. At the at the rostrum.

That image is the 911 that gives them the whip hand during during a moment of national catastrophe. The same way that 9 11 did for the republicans that is the dream of the democrats and the signal and the evidence of that is going to boil down to how many republicans break ranks how many republicans denounce trump how many republicans say yeah. No. This is too far and signal that they're willing to you know cut towards the democrats which has been what they've been trying to do break the regular republicans away from the base. That's been the goal since clinton and got the nomination and trump was running against trump and this is another chance for them to do that. But if they do a vote and the republicans are essentially unified. All of that all they have demonstrated is that the democrats have no actual ability to govern and that biden will in fact be being having his policies dictated by mitch mcconnell. I just don't think the democrats want to find out I think they're too afraid so that's why I doubt they'll do it. They might not going to say they won't it's just right. Now my guess is they don't want to see. They don't want to show how weak their hand is.

They want to leave it in the air so that scared republicans could like start really freaking out oh get. Some of those polls out there showing how many people were opposed to the to the attack on the thing thing is though all those and think it's awesome and will vote for any used car dealer who runs against you saying he voted to kick the president out or he voted to certify the whatever and they don't want to show that they don't want to have that out. There they want to have it out there as a possibility yeah. It's like the republicans after the civil war waved the bloody shirt and it worked great because most people like who lived in the northern states which had the enough electoral votes to determine the president if they stayed unified had been shot by southerners or had shot a southerner who was likely a democrat so that bloody shirt was real. This is all just a spectacle.

This is all just kind of funny. This is all just pretty. Permabanned was like this is really serious yeah but I'm sorry. I treat that the same way that I treat the people who say you have to take the coup. Seriously. We let the tech companies take over everything that already happened. This is just the validation of that having that having it come in the form of president donald trump being congress and stealing aoc shoes isn't funny. I'm sorry that's very funny. It's so funny because I remember from the bush years. It has been a long-standing project by the intellectual left liberals. The op-ed columnist types and and the the nation writer types that that the republican party is an existential threat to democratic governance in america and that therefore it has to be destroyed. In its current form. You see this a lot. Many people have made this argument.

Over the years. It's only gotten more intense than the last few but the way but that is impossible given the current lay given the current layout of like american political power. The big empty places in this country were all of those the smart all of the smart ecology like sensitive types departed all the ones who went on to become the the debate. The the white middle-class base of the an upper-class base of the democratic party that when they went out there the ones who stayed they stayed in places that are disproportionately electorally powerful the democratic party with its play towards the same base of middle class like understood forgetting their actual jobs. Self conceived of as middle class white americans mostly white americans with like black people as this permanent adjunct to the democratic coalition and like latinos and asians sort of being in in the in the middle strata.

You can't and then a bigger bigger chunk of people deciding the politics doesn't matter and checking out you cannot have you cannot destroy the republican party. In those conditions. Any more than the whig party or any more than the democratic party could destroy the wig party. The whig party had to be destroyed from outside. It had to be destroyed by people withdrawing their support for it in concentrated organized ways and then taking that power or taking that support and concentrating it. Somewhere else. What am I talking about the only place is the midwest where am I wrong about this is the rural parts of this country are filled more and more with reactionary white people of all job descriptions. Whether working class middle class or local barons college educated and most these people disproportionately not college educated by the way and then disproportionately college-educated urban whites and then black people as a hegemonic part of the democratic coalition and then that's and then those places where those votes predominate. Those white middle-class votes. Predominate are places with a lot of electoral power. It's a 50-50. It's a 50-50 split you're never going to be able to overthrow the democrat republican party. Within this. Array of courses something has to come outside of it and break through both parties support bases. That's the only thing that's going to do it and in this current moment which activate a vast chunk of people who do not vote and the key. The reason that I think that means that we cannot be thinking anything that exists currently online is going to work is that I really do feel like this is all a poisoned well.

This is all this is all a mad language. We've taught each other in this self-imposed sanitarium and then once we try to go outside into the sunlight. We're going to sound like jabbering mental patients. That's my real belief you gotta get the normals to start talking about it and you and if you can be normal with them then by god go and do it. I know that's ableist but guess what I get to say ableist stuff because I'm actually disabled unlike a large chunk of the people who consider themselves disabled activists who a lot of whom have self-diagnosed conditions. I have like four distinct disabilities. So I get to say that all right guys please.
