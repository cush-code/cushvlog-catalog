Ah hello perhaps you recognize me. It's your favorite president ah so what's going on everyone. Things are so funny right now shit's really funny. It's times like this that I don't feel that bad about picking politics as my is one of my zones of of entertainment. One of my spectacle preferences. I mean yeah. Obviously it was much. It was it was. It was great when he was in the hospital but honestly. I love. This now too this thing where he like he's in the oval office and they're saying oh he's enough office. He's he's signing documents and then they come out. He they just just right before. I came on. They dropped a video of him in front of the white house just caked up on the makeup because he looked like he looked like death last time and he sounded absolutely gaked they've clearly got him on the roids or at least he's still not flying high on him and you know what he might be fine. He might not even he is he shouldn't be alive anyway so maybe he will never face any physical consequences. But it's still very funny to me because not even for what's happening because he's mostly been hiding and now he comes out with his like proof of life video But because of just the absurdity of this the pure absurdity of the president having this deadly disease and being hidden away in the castle and everyone trying to decide what it means and all of his minions and all of his supporters going He's dabbing all over corona actually you're owned and other people being like no he's on death's door without any of them having any actual information just a pure projection onto this void which I think is evocative of certain phenomenon and just like this death watch this death walk life watch god. It's something. It's something I mean he is going to be stronger in the short term because the steroids are going to whack him up. I mean he's going to be real powerful like they said he was eating like crazy which I love how like don't people know what steroids do. That's what they do they make you hungry. It would be funny though people started giving themselves corona like in solidarity with the president that would be really good yeah.

If anyone's seen the new video he seems very keyed up more so than usual certainly more so than when he's speaking extemporaneously not in front of a crowd and everyone's just like waiting. It's funny because like I said the other day the fact that at no point was pence even in the ballpark of being sworn in as president even though he was like in hospital care for a while and on mind-altering drugs. It really tells you. I think less even that pence is this empty shirt which obviously but more that he isn't really in charge of anything like they. I don't think if he ordered a nuclear strike they would do anything if he they wouldn't. They would ignore him like they ignored him when he said he wanted to assassinate assad which means that like this death watch is is in a way. It's beside the point you know. It's just. It's. It's.

It's it's the further intensification of just the pure spectacle and that's the one thing that the politics expect of a presidential spectacle has lacked until recently has been like the actual corporeal body of our figure of of fixation. You know like trump has seemed like a permanent fixture in our lives and now there's this schrodinger's fat thing where it's like is he gonna live is he gonna die could he die could we handle him dying at this moment because the big thing that gets me is like him leaving office and then going to onon or something. I get that you know it's just. It's just. It's another crimp in the narrative but if he's just gone after what he has ended up becoming in this culture after how all-consuming he has been as a personality oh just what is this where does that go where does that energy have to go and and the reason. I find that question so fascinating is because. I have no idea. That's one where I just feel that's why his death feels impossible and why at the end of the day I just can't buy that he's going to die anytime soon just because I cannot imagine what it looks like with him gone. What are these people putting their energy into both for and against we don't know where we would be without him. We need him right now he is the focal point of all of our energy. Now. I do think that this election is the process of us like weaning ourselves off of him. You know like fighting will be our our suboxone or what is the name of the methadone. The stuff they give you when you're addicted to heroin if they'll wean you off that's fine. But him dying is just cold turkey overnight like just not doing it anymore after being heavily smacked out the deep. The the the withdrawal is going to be gnarly if it happens.

It is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of trump correct bad bite mck that is very good but trump is going to go away one way or the other. I mean entropy demands it and it is the thing that that gets me is how do we how do we either maintain like that psychic investment in politics or where do we put it if we decide to redirect it. It's all very murky like. I always when trump got in there. I recognized it as like a tectonic change in american politics and and I said I remember in like 2016-17. I said like we don't know what everything has led to trump but nothing has pointed past him because trump is the end point like of all of our most prescient art right and culture that that sees the direction the arc of our political trajectory. All of it says the end point is donald trump. The end point is this absurdity where politics has been rendered a pure spectacle and the guy presiding over. It is like a giant court gesturing chief like that's where it ends and then that's like supposed to be sort of you know the the dystopia and now we're in it. What comes next and I still don't know.

I mean electing especially if he does win in a landslide although who knows. I'm honestly getting to the point where I'm wondering. Maybe trump's gonna win hilariously maybe that would even be funnier because I was talking. I was singing like funniest outcome. Trump loses then dies like two weeks later to bite but now I'm thinking. Trump almost dies and then wins that'd be pretty funny too. But I still think it's more likely that biden wins and us electing a absolutely out to lunch advancedly. Senile man is certainly a topper on top of the trump thing but then what's going to happen you know he's probably not going to serve that long and then we get kamala harris which is like the triumph of you know of woke neoliberalism. But what we know for a fact about woken liberalism is that it provokes a wild wild cultural backlash and what does that look like in the absence of trump who kind of came in to fill a spot and I think that's the thing that's why it's hard to talk about because whatever emerges will emerge organically like. I don't think anybody thought trump was going to run for president in like 2014 seriously run. Sure didn't get to think he was going to win the presidency and we're in a similar situation like what the things that are going to come are going to be as inconceivable. As that was then he did no he didn't run. In 2000.

He made a half-assed bid for the for the reform party nomination against pap. Buchanan happy cannon got it remember because famously a bunch of south beach jews voted for noted anti-semite pat buchanan thanks to the wonderfully designed butterfly ballots. This is before most of your time that ended up costing gore florida and giving us bush and sending us hurtling into this timeline that we're in now but I feel bad for the country as darren rafael said but this is tremendous content. Well. Somebody asked is it was it the brooks brothers riot or was the chad well. I mean bad ballot design and other things are what made it so that gork didn't have a clear election night win which if he had would have obviated any kind of riot or recount or anything so florida ran a shitty election first and foremost and of course. Part of that was by design like jeb did illegally purge a bunch of people from the roles who happened to be minorities and that contributed. But I don't think that there was like an outright effort. We're gonna steal the 2000 election. It was when it became a jump ball.

They went and grabbed it which is. I think the only likely outcome like everyone worrying about trump. Stealing it it'll just be that again a jump ball that gets stolen and right now if you believe the polls and who the can say. At this point there's not going to be enough jump balls for them to grab or there's going to be too. Many jump balls for them to grab there's going to be too many places where biden wins handily but who knows. I mean. The polls were off last time that's undeniable but why and what what I don't think anyone knows to this day why and as a result it's almost impossible to handicap polls. Now so you just have to kind of go in blind which I think is useful and honestly. I think it might be awesome if they banned. Polling completely got rid of polling no polls. What's the point of knowing who's gonna win beforehand.

How does that contribute to your decision of who to vote for in a meeting like in a policy sense. Because remember. This is supposed to be us collectively as a country determining our policy trajectory. What our country is going to do shouldn't that mean that the only thing that needs to matter is who the candidates are and what they say they're going to do what they're gonna who's ahead how does that help anyone.

It's literally an entertainment product and if we wanted to make politics not entertainment and make voting less of a weird like sacred ritual divorced. But it's like it has all of the powerful emotional resonance of sacred rituals with none of the effect of creating like a sense of well-being or connectedness to a community. Only the opposite it only pushes us against each other more and more how can we like put shrink voting down to size which is really when I talk about voting on here. People seem to get the wrong impressions sometimes. I'm not saying it doesn't matter who you vote for and I'm not saying it doesn't matter if you vote or not I am saying is that the act of voting is of little to no individual moral consequence for a person which means that it cannot be the sum total of your political activity and the only way to bring it down to size is by psychically reducing the hold. It has on you morally and in terms of building an identity making elections. Less entertaining would be a big part of that because one of the reasons we we do put so much energy into voting as a cro as a totem is because that means all we got to do is watch. The show hashtag like they say in the queue and on which is a show we want to watch.

We wouldn't tune in if we didn't want to watch it and half the country doesn't like the show when they turn the show off and they're not paying attention even though they're the ones most materially harmed by our political reality. The the falseness of the front of our democratic process means that for half the population this show is too boring that's because they cannot give voting the sensual emotional. Sacred place in their in their minds that people who are still watching do that's the unnecessary. That's the suspension of disbelief you need to watch a tv show and get into the characters or the situations. This vote means something from that all the other pageantry of politics comes to vivid life which is why voting is not going to be the answer for anyone. It can't be the answer for anything because half of the people have decided that it's a boring show. They don't want to watch because they cannot they have not made the investment which means nothing you do at that level is going to reach them which is what we learned with.

Bernie is that even though they were making intentional a big effort to reach out in person to people like in iowa. I know they hired a bunch of service industry workers as organizers to organize their workplace like instead of just calling people and it had in specific places where you had like real like working class like structures like the union dense city of las vegas where you know people were able to do shoe leather organizing and and bring like you know cleaning staff and and taxi drivers off the strip to vote But that was never going to be enough. The hope was is that the people watching this pageant were going to hear what bernie said and be moved by it. Problem was the only people watching that pageant were people who were already locked in on the right side to the republicans and that was not their concern to the left side to the democratic party.

Because of course they're voting of course. They think the democratic party means something of course. They think the democratic party represents their aspirations. If they didn't. They could not find the show the pageant of politics interesting and they would turn it off and that means they wouldn't be paying attention to it which means they couldn't be intersecting with it in a way that was going to bring them into the process and so for the people who do vote which is basically everyone who watches my you know watches my streams or listens to the podcast or anything or goes on the internet to discuss politics like they'll vote or if they don't vote. They're not voting is not turning off the tv because it's boring it is a reaction to voting you know the way that all atheists are still christians you know like the way that atheism is basically just like a really refined form of protestantism you're still in the system even as you reject it because you are making a conscious choice to reject voting out of a political stance as opposed to out of disinterest is that voting has to be brought down to size in your mind because then you'll have to fill the rest of the time figuring out what does work and what does connect people and what does provide any chance that we can influence events because what I see people talking about like oh we go you know biden.

What's what's he gonna is he gonna you know biden needs to give outreach to the left or something like he has no interest the party he represents has no interest in doing anything for the left. They defeated the left. They risked a lot to defeat the left. They risked a lot of their credibility. They killed their own voters in some states by insisting on having primaries in the beginnings of the coronavirus. All these people who now are telling you how trump is horrible for ignoring science and getting people killed with his reckless rallies went out there and said yeah no go vote don't worry about it knowing they were going to kill people. They they are saddled with this fossil. This demented fossil who could die at any moment or just start blurting out a logarithm or have his teeth fall out or just start saying slurs maybe and who in his person rejects the entire carefully crafted identity. Politics appeal that they were building for like minorities in this country to make up for their lack of their any kind of material politics. Like oh we're gonna give you representation and representation is its own form of power nope old white guy old white guy who got into congress running against bussing which his own vp. Nominee pointed out in the debate with them.

This is not what they wanted. They brought themselves to this level to defeat the left so they're not going to give anything to the left. Why would they they're they're the victors. Only thing is going to happen is they're going to the only way that they're going to change. Anything is under pressure and that pressure can't come through voting for him for biden because if biden wins then the left then the left was disciplined if biden wins that means the left enough of the left voted for him to get him across the finish line which means you can take them for granted. If biden loses. It's because not enough of the left voted for him either way. The left is still out of the tent. I mean is that wrong tell me if that is wrong right because since when has a democrat winning made anybody think thank you left because as I've said a million times voting is not a collective action. There is no like coherent left to express a collective desire to either support or not support bernie or biden's candidacy. Like you know the afl-cio deciding not to endorse mcgovern in 72 because they were pissed about the nomination process.

 there's just a bunch of individuals who can be ignored because they're on the team or it could be blamed if you lose. But anyway all this means let's ban poland band polling ban pharmaceutical advertisements. I don't see how this is This should be controversial. Somebody asked well does that mean like they're saying well who should you vote for then and that's just it. There's a weird more like part of the moral confusion that goes with voting is like if I vote for someone that I am responsible for anything they do if they win basically and I am absolved from responsibility for anything that happens if they lose like that's the moral wager there and a version of that an expression of that is that like if I tell someone to vote for if I if somebody says you need to tell your followers your listeners to vote for biden. The assumption there is that me saying that will make all of them vote for biden or even a majority of them vote for buy and the fact is they might vote for biden and they probably will more than not. But that decision will not be because I told them to do a thing. There is no way that my decision for more than a fraction of a fraction is going to be the sole determining factor in their decision to vote for somebody. Because nothing is like that there are no sole determiners of actions at that level. There's a million reasons you're going to vote for biden if you're going to vote for biden. What I say is not going to be the tipping point. Any more than me voting for biden is going to be the tipping point between him winning and losing 

I I have to say though that I will be voting in person due to the nude celebrities because they horn me up. I'm horned up now. I'm all horned up. I did not know chris rock was so deceptively built for a skinny guy. I will be rich lou to braces louis louis viii absolutely. We will up the catholic league.

Somebody wants me to talk about meditation. I'm not really. I don't think I'm the person to talk to because I'm still learning you know. I have a sporadic practice I try to do about a half an hour a day. I do it more often than not but I do. I don't do. I'm not um but and I try to do the insight yoga which is like concentrating on breathing but you know mostly. I'm in my head thinking of things. But I am trying. I try to mostly use it as just a time to make myself sit with thoughts and then let them go because. I've realized that one of the keys to thinking clearly is to not stay into one thought train of thought for too long. You need to allow like you start thinking about something because you've had some sort of connection between your your brain and the world and it gets you thinking about something and over time you know the conditions that brought about that thinking. They go away and now you're somewhere else and you're still thinking about that thing and now that you like you're you're in your head more you're less in the world and to stay in the world as you think it's probably. I think it's good. I'm finding.

It's not something. I used to even think about doing but now I feel. I try to do it. Consciously is just let thoughts just kind of go off and then just instead of trying to pursue them let them go and then just like look once again. Around you and then something else is going to come up like. The brain is not going to be quiet as much as we might want it to be sometimes but where it goes will at the end of the day always end up being directed from and sensory experience if you're actually paying attention to your sensory input and I mostly like. I say that to feel better about the fact that I have a hard such a hard time like clearing my head. I don't know if I've ever really done it but I try lord knows I try yeah. I have never done transcendental meditation that seems pretty intense. I guess the thing I worry about is like doing anything that's too I don't want to get discouraged. I guess is the thing because I worry about my. I worry about my I always worry about my discipline levels. You know like the reason. I have been a louse. My whole life is because I i had insufficient motivation because I didn't really believe anything you know and the problem is like belief is that like furnace it goes up and down you know and sometimes it's stoked up and sometimes it's down and meditation helps with that. But it also it provides sort of a a concrete expression that can for me anyway be something. I I get overly worried about but I'm trying to keep doing it.

I'm keeping on so tm is mantras instead of breathing like you say things over and over again. I would like to meet david lynch in the spirit realm. I would apologize for not really liking his work because I know I'm supposed to yeah. We could hang out at the black lodge that would be cool that place seems kind of scary. Nothing's wrong with david lynch I respect him immensely. He's he's one of the few pure artists in cinemas certainly in like his television program from what I understand is like almost suey generous in terms of being a mainstream product in the first seasons on network television with that kind of singular artistic vision um. But it's just it's in the past anyway. It's just not it's a wavelength thing. It's a vibe thing and it's just not a vibe that I was ever able to really connect with maybe that'll be different now.

But I haven't watched any in a while. I haven't seen somebody reminding me of that the one recent steve eastwood movie that I haven't seen yet. I keep forgetting to see. It is the one about the guys on the train that uses the real actors or as actors uses the real troops who stopped at a terrorist attack on a train in france 1517 to paris which I i know had baffling reviews and I'm. Intrigued I keep forgetting to watch it but thank you for reminding me. I'm going to see it soon.

I am people are asking my height. I'm 6'3. I'm probably 6'2 at this point from slouching but yeah yep. I'm a confirmed chad sorry guys sorry confirm chad I mean if it makes up for it. I have a limp so I don't know if that ameliorates the the chadness or maybe exacerbates it. I don't know how chad this works. I do know being tall is part of. It apologies to the to the mantlets out there. But it is it's brutal bone law and of course. This is all being said tongue-in-cheek. None of this stuff is real in real life. These things do not exist. I've seen enough experience. I have enough experience in my life to know that there is no like look determiner for outcomes in life specifically romantically in this country. It's all it's this real like all that stuff is internet. Mania turned into delusional ideology as it is in politics did I ever watch what would you do.

I remember that theme song. I hadn't thought about that show. I haven't thought about that show. In 25 years. I gotta see if I can find the theme song is it oh man that was a show. It was like a kind of a quasi. It was a money-based prank show with with mark summers where he would like pay people to humiliate themselves. Wow that's insane why would someone ask that and how would that be in my head. I literally that was wow. I there is zero chance that I have consciously thought of that show or that song since. I watched it as a child and as soon as I saw because you see what would you do on abc. Just I instantly heard the whole. Thing that's brains are crazy because the thing is we like we have perfect memories like your brain imprints everything it experiences it's just accessing it for the front that's so hard because you're trying to juggle all these balls by absorbing all the in front of you like you're absorbing all of this stimuli while trying to pull things out that happened longer ago. But that was just sitting there waiting to pop up when I think of the things that I can't remember and have forgotten important stuff and necessary stuff and the fact that that was just waiting there.

No no no what what you do. This is an interesting question. Someone says what would you see us twitch chatters as real people. That's an interesting question that's an interesting question This is a very interesting ontological question. Are you people real to me like when you interact with me like do. I imagine you the way I would if. I was in a room filled with 100 1400 people and they were like had microphones or something. I mean. I'd say abstractly yeah like i. I believe that our consciousnesses behind these comments that this isn't machine generated for the most part you're not thoughts and that you're you're I'm engaging with you but beyond that it's very hard especially. If I'm trying to like formulate thoughts and stuff to keep like a concrete notion of an audience intact. They kind of kind of guys kind of melt away and it does sort of become like. I look at myself. I don't when I'm really in the groove look at myself not at the chat you know and so if there's like a weird like element where I'm basically. I am doing some sort of like conversational exhibitionism where I'm talking to myself in front of a lot of people you know instead of talking to a lot of people um. Another question. I saw before I started talking.

There is living what's better living color or mad tv about a while ago now like 10 years ago. Maybe I did a little. I rewatched a couple episodes of a living color and even then it didn't hold up so I guarantee you. If I tried to watch it. Now it would be painful. Meanwhile mad tv is has got some good stuff in it. I mean and as you know kum towns talked a lot about how if you have any sort of um fondness for the pre-woke cultural comedic style mad tv was your show. I mean the wildly racist sometimes very edgy as they said they had a character who was a white lady pretending to be an asian woman. I mean the kind of stuff was just like oh my god but the thing is like those things can't hurt you. Now so you can watch them from a move and find them pleasurable. I think in living color. I remember just being very very cringe when I rewatched it wonder shows and on the other hand.

Now that's a program. Apparently. It's not streaming anywhere. I haven't watched it in all the way through since. I saw it on dvd. And I would really like to rewatch it but apparently it's not streaming. Anywhere is it on youtube. A lot of time things are on youtube if they're not anywhere else if anybody can hook me up with wonder shows and because I was I talked about fright night 2. The other day somebody recommended it to me and I couldn't find it on the internet and somebody said oh yeah. It's on youtube and they showed me the link it was perfect yeah. Wonder shows it is An exposure to that show at the right time is like just. It's saturating your brain in an alien um premise like just an alien sense of compared to the rest of the culture you consume it is at a complete angle to everything else. You're gonna. You you you are absorbing and I think that's true of all that vernon chapman stuff and everyone's watched his new claymation show on adult swim shivering truth very good. Xavier renegade angel a great show. He also did a 

He has done two really fascinating side projects that he apparently paid for with his own money. One was he took two weird. Niche companies that existed one was a custom porn site that would if you paid them enough shoot a porno for you like according to your casting specifications your dialogue you know the the scenario and then he gave them a like a movie script without any sex in it and had them carry it out. I haven't seen that I would like to the other one he turned into a book. He there's apparently companies that will and I cannot imagine who has ever gotten their money's worth for this if you need help writing a help writing a paper for some sort of school assignment. They will basically farm out to people in. I think asia. Most of whom's first language is not english and they will write one for you and he sent them a bunch of different essay topics and they wrote them for him. Heart.

She-holler also very good. Final. Flesh is the name of the movie. I haven't seen that I'm gonna find the name of the book mind sploitation. That's it. I have seen wizard people dear raider oh my god. We're talking about comedy legends here. Another guy that I i absolutely revere brad nealy to this day. Wizard people dear reader is the only encounter I have had with harry potter as such. I've not seen any of the movies independently of that or read the books. I just saw wizard people dear reader and yeah china illinois. All the shorts they did before china illinois harg malin slippio pipio.

I thought was slept on somebody. We're doing we're people are shouting out. Adult swim shows now and someone says moral oral and they talked about that and they said like it's it's. They compared it to bojack horseman and I had not thought of that before but moral oral is sort of how is like the the gallant to bojack horseman's goofus. In terms of it is the It is the good way to do that kind of thing. It's the good way to try to inject pathos into a cartoon yeah yeah. This is this stuff is some demographic pandering right there. It's like hey are you. A are you a late millennial white male come on to the cush stream and let's remember some stuff yeah. I gotta say like I really do realize over the course of these that that I am definitely you know projecting a very a relatively rigored you know um. I'm I am expressing on these streams a very specific point of view and anybody who isn't like shares a lot of my reference and sort of experiential premises. I'm always amazed that they tune in but I actually don't worry about that because like I remember when chapo started a lot of people like asked us like you know do you think like it needs to be don't. You think it should be more inclusive and stuff and and I i think that that assumption comes from the expectation that everything should be for everybody you know. And I don't think that that's the case like what you get when you do that is the kind of you know a mediocrity thing like where like like the new fargo or something where it's. It's just enforced like the real diversity should come from giving ev from maximizing the opportunity for creators of all types to express themselves rather than having every like node with any kind of you know market share enforced upon oh wait.

A minute somebody says that there's somebody who worked on the dark tower tv show in the chat or the movie. I'd be very interested to hear about this yeah. It's when the wind is crying mary right now so. I know the show didn't get picked up right. I would be. I would like to see it. The movie was terrible. I mean the movie was the worst kind of of garbage and not in that case for diversity. Like idris. Elba was actually pretty good choice for roland but just the number one failing is absolutely no respect for the audience's intelligence. That's the main thing. That's what's made it impossible to have any quality to it is its expectation of like audience buy-in to the world they were building was so low there was so little confidence in in you know presenting something and having the audience sort of come along with them and and accept it and fill it in as it goes as opposed to having it spoon fed to them especially. Since it was only 90 minutes. It's like my god. It's almost like they they realized how like soulless and juan it was and just decided you know.

This was gonna be like a two and a half hour long bloated piece of. Like every other big movie. Let's just cut. All this stuff and just call it a day and everyone just went yeah. That's for the best it just like it felt like nobody's heart was in it except maybe mcconaughey who'd seem to be really chewing the scenery but not in a fun way which is why it was kind of. Like. Even after that terrible movie. I was kind of a little hopeful for the show just because the very fact of it being a continuing narrative would give them more time and more rope to sort of build their own narrative scaffolding and maybe a little more confidence and then they were like nah no show either well. The books are still there.

Car is a wheel. That's true car is a wheel did. I never have a grateful dead phrase. What what do you think what do you think what's the likelihood of that. I'm just wondering how what the percentage likelihood you'd think that. I had ever at any point was a deadhead. I was not now. I didn't like music enough. I think I've said this before but I used. I didn't buy albums because I was like even if I liked one or two songs and a band did what if. I don't like the rest now. I paid for this album that I'm not gonna get that much use out of so. I would buy movie soundtracks I did not have a cake or a ween phase never got into ween and I'm sorry. But I still like cake so that's not a face. I mean. I don't listen to it as much as I used to but that's because. I don't listen to music as much as I used to and I do not like camp town races that's slander. I'm going to sue felix for that the best cake song that's an interesting question. There's a lot of great ones. If I just try to blank my mind and think of the first thing that comes to mind it might be italian leather. Sofa. I like mexico a lot too. Satan is my motor is great as well. The distance is a great song. It is a great single. It's just. I kind of take it for granted because it's the one big hit you part. The waters is a great shot. Great song sheep go to heaven is a great song friendlies.

A four letter word is really good. Short skirt lot of jackets really good. I'll go I'll go italian leather sofa number one. They did a great cup. Their covers are some of the best. They did a great cover of. I will survive and honestly their cover of sad songs and waltzes is. I know. This is heresy. I like it better than the willie nelson version. Because of the trumpet. The trumpet adds this like plaintive emotional note to it that is in my opinion even more evocative than willie's voice which of course as I said heresy. I understand bomb korea is good too. The cover of war pigs is very good oh. I really love rock and roll lifestyle too and mr mastodon farm. The wind is mad at my cake takes the wind does not like cake oh yes comfort eagle also great obviously someone's asking about the revolutions podcast.

I they asked the best season. I don't know if it's the best and probably by definition. It isn't but the most impressive season for me just as a podcaster and as someone who's like has the long-term goal to try to do historical like entertainment like historically based you know podcasting and has in the past done that what he did with the 1848 revolution still blows my mind like the fact that he did 1848 at all. I kind of couldn't believe I thought for sure he'd skip it and then the fact that he was like no. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do a thing that took two years happened in almost every european top country simultaneously and then bring it together. I mean it's not as like you know narratively satisfying as the haitian revolution which is a great great one and maybe. It's probably the best like pure expression of the show. But I'm just very very impressed by 1848. Especially since 1848 is a very important historical moment for like the birth of modern revolutionary politics and it's very under known by people and like a lot of people ask me like what's a good book on the 1848 revolution. So it's like that's a tough one because of how unwieldy an event it is and how much more likely you're gonna find like more like thin-slice narratives and he really did a service by giving just like just an event structure so that you could do something like read the brumaire and like have it have a context which is hard which makes it hard to read if you don't but like I would say like. Marx's writing on 1848 is all great but he's assuming a level of knowledge that most people nowadays do not have.

I saw the movie bakaroo and I liked it. I liked that it had a very rigorous sort of It had the rigorous it. It very much had the tone and look and feel of a world cinema art movie. You know what I mean like those those three hour movies about you know a village in turkey where someone's trying to sell a mule and that's the whole plot so it has that aesthetic. But then it has a absolutely bonkers b-movie. Plop up pulp plot and I thought that that was a very interesting choice that I thought worked very well and of course. It's very politically relevant. You know these rich anglos hunting poor poor brazilian peasants and everything.

I never got into dan carl and I never listened to the dan. Carlin podcast too long too long and also apparently conversational. I know it's hypocritical for me to say this but I mostly prefer the scripted history podcast. Someone's asked me if there's anybody in somebody who's been evil who has gone good who got anyone in history like a historical figure who started off evil and became good I'm gonna troll epicly and say ben benedict arnold. I would like we're gonna do another among us stream soon that was fun. I got the hang of it as. I went on. I have to say and I have and I did enjoy being a. I do enjoy being the infiltrator that's a lot of fun yes. I was I was pogging by the end of it 

Somebody asked me why don't you call more nazis nazis and I will say. I don't know what you're trying to get with that get with that. But the real reason. I don't use that word too. Much is because. I think it's incumbent on people to make the political system. This political situation more clear to people if they're going to talk about it for a living instead of less clear and that kind of language. No matter how it conforms to some sort of you know checklist on the internet does a disservice to that goal. It makes things less clear. It fills the moment with a thunder and emotion and an urgency that is not matched by the actual political engagement of our population and leads people. I think to make to to choose wrong priorities based on an emotional response to a symbolic collection of trigger words and ideas that and I mean. I think when people yell at me. For this. It really does feel like they want me to affirm their mania. They want me to say no you're not being hysterical and the thing is. I think a lot of people are so. I don't want to tell them that I mean if you think we're on the verge of a coup or a fascist pushed. Then you need to do something other than post and if you can't find it in your if you can't find something to do that isn't posting to make that happen then. Maybe. It's not as imminent as you think it is. Someone says be more specific.

I don't know what you mean by that oh god. It's a little lens all greasy again why is atheism protestantism. I don't mean in the sense that like there is a way to not believe in god. That is inherent that that like not that by not believing in the judeo-christian god requires like oh that's just provincism. I'm saying that people we think of as atheists. New atheism is just another. It's just a further um abstraction to the individual and away from the notion of a social religion that catholicism represented catholicism says is that so that that religion is a social practice and protestantism says no religion is a personal practice and then the furthest. The further removed to that is is the post-rational atheist who says no there's just the individual and it's just.

It's it's further severing those social ties because at the end of history where we are you know religious devotion if it is divorced from a social context. Like it is in america is a It is a connection to something else like something older something beyond oneself even if it's only in the mind and atheism says no no sever even that connection to anything outside of yourself. You have the tools of racial sensation within your mind to make sense of the world with the help of others but you do not have to pay homage to any old system of beliefs that predates that and that's just the further. It's it's. It's eternal velocity away from socially embedded meaning because anyone who makes a project out of like atheism. It's baffling to me because whether or not god exists is beyond the point so beyond the point so meaningless because none of us will ever know ever. What matters is what we do here and that atheism does not get you there. Like I understand people think that they're like breaking the spell or something. But they're not really like when you look at the trajectory of new atheism on how it went from people opposing the bush administration in the early aughts because it was filled with all these christ bothers to now a bunch of people who are measuring skulls like maniacs to try to determine who should live and die in the coming lifeboat. Economy.

 you know following climate collapse like I don't think god exists in the sense of a any being outside of the natural world. Like. I don't think that there is but what we call god is a real thing. Every everything that is in the concept of god is real and has to be acknowledged as such as opposed to you know evangelical american atheism which is just another schizophrenic insistence upon the primacy and and in fact paramount and solitary and untrans transcendable barrier of the individual human consciousness. I sound like a baby well. I am well. I'm a baby. I'm definitely a baby all right.

Maybe one question and I'm gonna wrap it up. I played disco elysium a little bit but it was very complicated and it kind of hurt anything where I have to click bothers me I've heard. It's very good game though our theater is going to die we'll end on this. I mean eventually yes and I think that this all might have really facilitated the end of that. I think we might be at the end of the if there is an end to the corona. If this isn't the new normal and if it is then yes obviously theaters if nothing changes about our ability to be indoors together in like five years which you know. Some hysterics freak out about like oh what if we get more and more mutations and you know we never reach immunity and therefore we can never go back normal well that's true then but by theaters. But even if like two or three years we get back. Everyone can do it. I think that the shift to digital will have been complete by then and theaters are going to be mostly maybe they'll be rep. Maybe we'll still have repertoire houses like the way they are now people showing old movies and honestly that's not the worst thing in the world. You know because going to the movies is obviously not just the experience of seeing the movie. It is a social engagement for the most part you know there are people who see movies alone. I see a lot of I used to see a lot of movies alone but even then there is a social element to it. You're out of the house and that gives your viewing of the movie a formality and an experiential richness that you don't get at home and the thing is though that could be anything you know if it's old movies. I mean people see old movies. Now people used to see old movies. Now even when there was new ones to be seen but it will definitely change the number of theaters. There are the size. I mean we might be. We might see the end of multiplexes. We might get back to like one one screeners that'd be nice. I don't know what they're gonna do with all those all those old big theaters though paintball range putt-putt. But I think most the theatrical release is going to go away sadly but not maybe the theatrical experience which I'll take. I'll take it alright guys bye.
