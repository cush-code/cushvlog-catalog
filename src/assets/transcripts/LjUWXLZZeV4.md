There I am sorry to take you away from those lovely little fluffy guys down there. Apparently uh those look like critter chat was was having a good time but I felt like I should stream today might not be able to do it this weekend so I want to try to do it today and tomorrow if anyone's watching which I assume they are. Although I'm not getting any comments yet I'll just start talking uh. I wanted to start today by remembering michael brooks who was uh who's everything everyone is saying about him is true so I don't feel like there's any need to uh be redundant just know that the outpouring uh of affection for him was totally warranted and losing someone like that in that way. Is is really scary in its own way and and reminds you just how uh how lonely everything is. But uh we're still here and uh for now and the best way to honor him is to do what he wanted people to do which was to god damn it be kind to each other god. Damn it be kind. I really appreciated that about him is that he understood that that the the uh reward the reward mindset and the value system inculcated by by online even among people who who really truly want what's best for everyone. Just reduces everyone to the cruelest version of themselves and the least generous and that there's no way to build a movement around that kind of uh mindset so so yeah rest in power as they say michael ah. I've only was on a his show a few times but it was always really really fun and he clearly uh. He did a lot more work for it than. I ever have ha and he was more prepared.

He certainly knew more about uh developments in other countries than I ever did yeah oh. And when someone like that's gone you can always then look back and wish. You'd you know been closer. But we only know what we know henry. Kissinger's still alive though that's kind of funny and uh bolsonaro has had has had coveted four times and been attacked by two or three large birds. Guy will never die because god i.e the demiurge i.e. The the enforced social order and material realm loves. Human evil rewards it basically which is why this is a world that's not fit for real human beings because it's not made for human beings. It's made for lizards folks. It's made for people who are able to make the choice to strip themselves of everything that makes them human uh. It makes me think of how the neoclassical economic or the neoclassical economic resurgence and then uh takeover basically of the economic field after the 70s coincidentally around the same time that you know the uh post-war labor consensus broke and private money just started fl flushing into every propaganda valve known to man just so happens.

At that point. Everyone realizes actually penguins aren't social animals. Humans are self-interested economic agents uh that was that was the very idea of that really like to to to put that forward as not the horrifying uh spiritual deformations caused by having to live under capitalism because that's the thing that the the economic the the the neo classical description of the individual uh that is what is incentivized by the market and people do better the better. They treat themselves as one of those but that is not humanity flourishing that's not humanity finding its its meaning and purpose that is to even suggest that is blasphemous at like a deep level like like just evil and uh uh demiurgical just like a a enchantment from the brimstone pit to suggest that the human that humanity is somehow uh more fully felt the more that it's isolated the more that it's delusionally fixated on satisfying its own ego terrifying and the recipe a world where people are like that is the world. Like the one we have now and economists like to look around and smugly look at that and say see. This is what people are like and it's like no. This is the system that you were disgusting intellectual handmaiden.

For this is what it turns people into like how the hell you've you're an individual self-motivated agent. If that was the true why are anybody a lot. Why is anyone alive why do people raise children why do people impart why why does anything exist. Why is there any social fabric to be pulled apart by capitalism for in the first place. How was it fixed. How was it built into being cultural marxists in the babylonian times fall out of here but even if you could be what they want you to be and of course. There's a there's a zillion examples of why no one is rational and that no one can know their own self-interest well enough to operate from it successfully beyond any of that even if you could what the  is your self-interest what is your self-interest accumulating more than other people around you in a world where you're connected and tethered to every other every other human being on earth by deep ties of of I mean sharing a mutual ecology and a world together. Each of you contributing in your smallest possible way to the full flower of like human civilization and culture. That's all humans rubbing against each other. That's all humans collaborating at every moment and to say. I'm going to make my life and everyone should make my their life about accumulating as much material distinction from everyone else as possible. What I mean that's a recipe for planetary annihilation that's a recipe for human beings ending uh ending life on this planet self-interest. The self unbound by its social context is not a thing the thing that's you the thing that isn't culture the thing that isn't other people is a whisper. It's a fragment.

It might not even really exist and trying to and teaching people that it's not that the opposite is true that that is in fact the entirety of your sense your ego the entirety of your self to have an interest psychotic psychotic genuinely. I mean in that you you you are eventually forced to a point where the world as you understand it and the world is. Exists becomes so disparate that your brain breaks and we're clearly there. Now. People's brains have been snapped like kindling by trying to live in a world like the q people. For example they thought they lived in the united states. They really really have an idea in their head of what the united states is and and and and their place in it as self-actualized individual consumers and now they find themselves living in whatever the  this is uh how the hell are. They supposed to make sense of that go and create a fantasy narrative that connects the two things. That's what everybody is doing to some extent or another creating a fantasy.

That's what ideology is fixing the two things together with like a bungee cord when you're trying to move a bike in the back of a car or something connecting your perception of the universe uh what what your what your baseline understanding of it is with the world that you actually live in because for one reason or another you refuse to examine those basic baseline principles. I mean there is a self-interest that is social like that's. What that's the whole idea of class coming into itself is in marx is it's not a person acting in their own under their own interests because that's absurd. It's a class of people operating under their own interests because they understand their mutual their mutual uh shared condition of oppression and that's the real thing. It is a condition of oppression being being defeated by coordinated action. It's not it it. It manifests itself sometimes as material deprivation but that's not the core of it. The core of it is species being alienation caused by the  wage system.


I wanted I was thinking about the masks and it seems like even the teacup people. Even the conservatives are now starting to wear the mask because trump is now wearing the mask. Although apparently people were very unhappy with that tweet which by the way was clearly not him. It was one of those ones where you can tell it was scovino which meant that they probably asked him to do a pro mask tweet because it's clearly one of the few things that we have right now that could potentially stop the uh just insanely uh terrifying upward trajectory of covet infections uh and the the best they could. Do is just have him ghostwrite something and have him press press tweet under it uh so. But I bet he still won't mostly be seen in public wearing one but the it's gonna be interesting seeing people come to terms with it because I i saw a lot of I've seen a lot of people baffled by the people who get psychotically angry about the mask and refusing not and refusing to wear it in public and like having spitting fits and freaking out. I mean of course half of that.

At least you can just chalk up to people trying to go viral and be epic. I think people need to really really they are underestimating every time one of any kind of viral video comes over the transom. The insane incentive structure of people going viral in one way or another. It's not like there's any difference between good and bad publicity anymore. So either side of any of these conflicts could literally just be someone being epic and getting uh and wanting to get some of that precious clout which as as I've said cloud chasing is just it's another form of being living in the gig economy. It's just one more element of the gig economy. Uh is is trying to get the clout online to supplement income replace income have people be there for you when you need a medical bill paid so. I understand that but the incentive structure is so overwhelming in one direction that half this  is probably people being epic and being viral but forget that when people and but there really are clearly true examples all across the country people just going and turning into frothing dogs with the prospect of having to wear a mask and a lot of people say they don't understand it and they want to say it's just because people are stupid but I think it's something much more understandable in a weird way. It's that so obviously we all know that there's of the politicized americans which is once again less than like half of the american population even has like political instincts thinks politically draws political inferences from things that mean something. I mean have invested themselves in politics as it's understood in america i.e. The electoral system. I'm not talking about people being alienated everybody's alienated but they have a vocabulary for it and they have a worldview that that uh that explains it and I'm saying that if you want to broadly draw 50 of the population people who vote as those who are most likely to frame their anger their disappointments in life their goals around political ideas.

They don't live in the same world right. We live in different epistemic realities with different value systems and it's totally zero. Sum. Something is either either triggers the libs or triggers the cons and if it does the one thing uh if it triggers the ones you don't like then you. It's good it. Just it's just a pure negative dialectic of of agitation uh and you could wonder like how do people live in a country with people that they are that violently opposed to without it. Getting more violent than it does and part of the big reason is it sublimate. The hostility is sublimated by the the spec observing the spectacle of politics getting in getting excited when our guy owns. The other guy getting excited when there's a successful troll done uh or someone wins an election of course. That's the big game so they get that level of sublimation uh. But part of the big reason is that they're able to carve out a world where they are not directly being. They are not directly defeated because that's what everyone is terrified everywhere. Everybody hates the idea of being of losing to these people in some sort of meaningful like significant way like elections are just proxies. Elections are just entertainment and then you invest emotions and then when there's a good result you're happy if there's a bad result you're sad. That's the main emotional level. That's the main uh emotional uh trigger of elections. That's what they're there for. It's there to be the big game to get excited about and then to get really sad or really happy either way. It's draining your political orgone into the into the spectacle which is what is that's the what it's there for. But it's all. It's all spectacle because life in america is largely the same no matter who's in charge.

I mean the economy gets worse and bad depending on how close we are to the popping of whatever bubble we're in uh and there's wars all the time and there's occasional school shootings and things and individual people can get like horribly traumatized uh if they're not lucky but for the most part they're sort of a steady state. American experience and the declines are gradual enough that they are not. They are not processed as emergencies and so people sort of feel. Like those damn liberals or those damn conservatives. They are doing things that are bad and I hate them and they're making the country bad and they're why the country is bad. But they have not the day of defeat has not come you know. Like the on the right the gun people. The guys are obsessed with the second american revolution and defending themselves. Obama was there for eight years. They complained the whole time but at no point did any of them get there get to where they say. This is it you know or very few of them. Anyway. They were the whole eight years. They were just like come and get it and it never really happened so they never. They never rose up uh and same thing happens uh and I think if biden got in there you'd have similar thing but the masks are different because the masks making someone wear a mask in public through social librarian and the legal code that is compelling behavior that is compelling actual behavior. It's not choosing to throw your keurig out the window because they were mean to sean hannity or buying a trunk load of goya beans to give yourself diarrhea for a month. This is actual your life and because the masks are part of that epistemic tree of the enemies that propaganda fake news universe where liberals live you know. The mainstream media is part of that the democratic party. Some republicans and and of course anything like the medical establishment just like the scientists who say global warming is real if they make you mayor a mask if you have to put a mask on your face in public that is a public.

It's a might as well say cuck you've lost. It's some fundamental way. Some real conflict happened the one you've been waiting for the one you've been girding your loins for and and especially one that you thought you were winning until five minutes ago. You guys were winning up until  trump up until february. It looked like trump was gonna get a second term. It was gonna be more epic dabbing on the liberals until the end of time until your heart explodes and now like that the chinese and the media and the democrats can make up some. Virus make up a whole bunch of uh of stuff to make you to get you scared to make you vote for a democrat to destroy the economy so it hurts trump and then the worst of all to normalize this surrender. This physical manifestation of your defeat at the hands of liberalism. It no wonder people lose their. It's like imagine if trump made you wear a mask for like an american flag mask for like america day that he declared everyone has to wear a mask or they go to jail how many people would get insanely pissed how many people would get up viral getting like tased or fighting someone over not wearing the mask and of course you say. But there's a difference that would just be arbitrary uh flexing of his power. Whereas this is a response to a real uh uh viral phenomenon and and public health hazard to which I say not to them. They don't see the difference. It's all political. It's all just a battle of domination. There is no objective cri realm and if you have to wear if you wear a mask that means you sir have been cut. So. I see why they get so  pissed. I really think they're pissed.

I think for that reason and that's why there's no real possibility that we're ever going to tackle any emerging threat any crisis by coming together the fantasy you know like. That's the biden campaign is. He's saying hey we're all going to come together. That's why republicans listen to them. They love me too and you know what given the situation economic collapse and a viral pandemic that a lot of people blame him for because he was the president and that's generally how it works. The president gets the blame for  uh it. It's the lightning rod for everything. They get blamed and credited for things that they don't really have anything to do with now of course. In his case he does have a lot to do with it because he did have a manifestly incompetent reaction but he wasn't the only one and plenty of democrat. Uh democrats in high office like andrew cuomo and gavin newsom stepped on their dick plenty enough for everyone. But it's looking uh. It's looking bad for the trumpy. It's not looking good for him and you know if you're a conservative. It's just because they press the  media press the buttons uh. I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret. Uh people are gonna. Be asking me about the the last chapel episode uh I guess I just wanna get this out of the way so. I don't have to deal with it um.


I mean I know some people are joking but uh with the cognitive test thing. I was doing a bit where I was pretending to not be able to get the answers right because I thought it'd be funnier than everyone getting them easily correct because it was obviously a very easy test so just putting it out there. I am not cognitively declining any more than anyone of my age which is significantly because after you hit 25 your neuroelasticity basically goes to. So it's not like I'm not cognitively declining. It's just that it's more it's slower and it's earlier in the process. I could definitely draw a clock.

I don't have any paper here but I could definitely draw a clock but biden is trying to do the thing that is impossible which is bring everyone together. Because duh there is no everyone and there is no together there is no unified value system with undergirding social foundations or even shared reality. So. I think that even though as I was saying trump looks like he's  and people think it's so. His people think it's because of uh democratic shenanigans. But it's just the absolute happenstance of of the the coronavirus thing more than anything uh which you know. I don't think any president would have done a great job with including hillary would have done better than him probably but people wouldn't have known how bad he would do so. They would blame them. They would be mad as mad at whoever the president was as they are at trump because they wouldn't know that trump would have been worse or. They couldn't know that you know what I mean they don't live in that reality. They live in the reality where their person  things up but so he's going to get blamed for something that at that is relatively random uh and that's going to lead to.

He may be losing an actual like landslide although. I don't think that that's inevitable at all. And I think the democrats going crazy for it are just getting too hepped up. They're getting too riled. Uh oh. He's going to win georgia and he's going to win arizona. He's going to texas slow down he'll be lucky to win florida but there's a chance that he wins significantly and handily and with republican support uh and that'll give people this. This little notion I guarantee you if you win significantly you will see across the land. The the media saying this is it. We have broken the trump fever and we have unified the country. Now they won't be able to delude themselves into saying that the republican party is somehow purged of of its uh uh irrationality. Uh they will just say the republican party is now a rump uh composed of just like the most backward members of society and that now we will move forward in a spirit of true bipartisan unity to defeat corona and global warming and everything everyone else.

I'm just going to do the spoiler alert right. Now that will not happen. There is no there's no common response to the crises of the moment. There is only the struggle for power over the uh the institutions and the uh and of course those means of production. What does this phrase socialism or barbarism mean it's uh. It's the inevitable crisis point provoked by uh by the capitalist consumption of the natural world where there is a crisis of production and surplus and uh and output and all that stuff just gets all those gears and then there's two choices. There's we socialize. The means of production create an efficient distribution according to need rather than desires cooked up by capitalism itself which reduces the horrifying toll on the environment and allows for more of a homeostatic relationship with the natural world and that means value for all human life and all life to some extent much more so than now uh. But if the other the other road in that crisis moment and we're looks like we're in. I mean we're always in a crisis but this is getting. This is getting extra crisisy. Uh although I must stipulate that you know late capitalism as we call it could could limp on for decades. Maybe 100 years depending on how technology shakes out uh and of course. Not in you know there will be countries falling apart over that time and there will be massive violence.

But it will be assimilated and normalized into a system that might have to drop off parts you know that are no longer governed uh but will hold even tighter to those areas where it has control and that that's a realm where the the the selfish pursuit of resources. By all these damn rational actors leads to the biome being uh inevitably fatally uh unbalanced and leading every human being to only be able to violently compete with each other for what's left through through war exploitation slavery whatever whatever whatever tool is necessary to grasp the last the last bits grasp the last remaining arable land and mineral rare earth minerals and profit. However it could be expressed so that's your socialism and your barbarism and there is no third way because capitalism drive is towards oblivion and towards uh towards critical over consumption which means any hybrid system that's still engine driven by capitalism especially in a fractured uh uh nation-state riddled world. Like the one we have will lead towards fatal competition and destruction. So you got to have you have to have you got to pull that engine out of the machine you have to pull the profit motive out of the the machinery of of human uh economics. It's the only way to prevent that that that decline into barbarism and of course it won't even get called barbarism uh. If if technology is able to be maintained. It will be called humanity. It will be called liberalism. It will be called uh enlightenment. You know mass mass euthanasia and eugenics and engineered viruses. You have to like pay a monthly subscription not to die from who would be able to look at that and say oh. This is the savagery of uh of tamerlane. No this is this is humanity. This is us.

This is us dealing forthrightly and adultly with the crises and problems that the world faces us faces gives us. I ran out of bloody skews in me skills wallet or I'll go talk to my member of parliament. Me skills wall. It's bloody empty mate. I'm skint. I don't got any skills mate olaf. I spent my last skill at the tesco awful terrible. I should never do that. I didn't watch the 30 rock special now. I'm worried. I won't be able to. I don't know if it's going to be available. It wasn't on hulu. I mean. I know. It's depressing and terrible and a  ad for awful shows on a streaming set network a streaming series for a network which is now all of them. They all have that what the heck who are the ad wizards who came up with this one am. I right.


I've got a skills wallet. I've got a skills wallet down. I lib dem's proposed new skills wallet scheme. No I mean the the skills wallet is a terrible phrase and it's obviously perfect neoliberal. Uh you know uh social engineering oh. Yes. We'll give people money but only if they spend it on education and only between the years of 30 and 39 just oh my god come on guys. Get. It give it a give it up you weirdos. You're sick you're sickos you love that. But it's also premised on the false idea that labor market shortfalls are caused by some sort of skills mismatch which was pretty definitively disproven by the recovery uh from the uh uh from 2008. I love I mean my favorite thing ever was the learn to code thing and kasich if people talk about. Kasich was one of those guys who got absolutely fixated on the coding thing like he'd drive through the appalachian parts of uh eastern ohio or youngstown and just think if all these guys could code and now one of these people thinks well if everyone could code then how much would you get for being able to code how much can you get for knowing how to read there's no there's no income premium. If it's universal. They just can't conceive of that because otherwise there's no answer because these guys there's a reason that liberals fixate on education whatever that means because it's the only way out of the out of the maze that they've built for themselves the intellectual maze of like defending a patently indefensible institution that reinforces the grossest kind of social inequality and racial inequality and gender segregation and exploitation. How the hell do you stand that legend and the answer is well. If we could just get people smarter.

They all just went to college there. There's no rest of that sentence when it comes to uh to the economy right because there can't be like. I said it's it's incoherent but uh but it's the other end of it. It's the social end that they really think that they really think there's something. There. They think if everyone went to college they'd be. They would all be enlightened and that would make the world better like not if they I mean we're seeing it now how much is how much is college helping anybody be better people when it gets them no job and six-figure debt. Overproduction of elites yeah you're actually making the people you can't get into the uh. The high status jobs more miserable than they would have been by raising their  expectations. You raised a generation of people's expectations of what they were going to get out of life and what they could be settle and what most importantly what they would settle for and now they're really pissed that reminds me of uh of how it come. It came up in the context of uh of after uh michael brooks's passing.

There was some awful person who I'm not even going to name who decided to use it as an opportunity to like try to yell at felix for some reason and it just and he kept calling him a grifter and that just struck me because that is the word of words to describe people on the left. It's like every everyone is on the lookout for for a grifter if you're if you're not if you're not explicitly ideologically evil like a nazi or something you. Then you're then the second bad faith assumption is grifter and it's pretty clear at this point that the word has lost any kind of meaning because ostensibly it's supposed to be about somebody who who gets money from people under false pretenses. Right and kind of by definition.

Something like a podcast where you pay for episodes or something cannot be a grift unless those episodes don't exist unless you download the episodes and then they aren't there if they're if you if you're paying for something. Somebody is offering you and that you get what they what their what they advertised then by no definition can a grift have occurred and yet. It's all these people all of whom have podcasts accusing each other of being grifters when the term doesn't even obtain and I think it's because they're trying to get at a deeper accusation which is that you're not serious. It's either that you're not serious about what you what you claim to believe and you're just doing it for clout and therefore money and therefore that's a gift or you're a fraud and you don't know what you're talking about and that they're there there and uh and that is what makes it a scam because even though you are giving people what they asked for and what they're paying for you're doing it under false pretenses of who you are and of course it should be pretty clear why that's an obscene absurd and incoherent way to try to argue and like make sense of the world around you because it requires you to know uh someone's like internal motivation for why they say things rather than what they're actually saying and I mean it's you just dug a hole for yourself. If your interest is actually you know moving forward with knowledge which of course isn't the point.

It's just to exercise people and build lot barriers. There's just one more one more brick in the wall but I think the real underlying part of it. All is what I said a few episodes. A few streams ago about how the lack of faith in the project is like the undergirding uh uh flaw in the left if it exists is that most people aren't really operating under any belief that anything they do will do any good and I think that that grifter accusation is an attempt to sniff out the people for whom that's true be like. This person is just mouthing these things and that they're really just here for the scene and the verso loft and all that and I think once again the the tragedy. There is that the reason that's so resonant and so frequently uh used as an epithet is because it applies to some degree about all to all of us and it's yeah. It's like. It's. It's.

It's the fixation on that is just a neurotic inability of people to deal with it in themselves and so they have to uh condem it strenuously in others and make sure everyone knows that they don't suffer from it. That's because they're not secure in their own uh beliefs and they have not grounded them. They haven't fixed them. They haven't accepted that you know what it probably won't get better probably not going to see anything good come of any of my actions. But it's still worth doing regardless. It's still in fact morally required of me to do these things because it springs from my like my spiritual understanding of my place in the world rather than as a as a way to distract ourselves from from our powerlessness.


I would like to do lamb skewers. Someone is suggesting lamb skewers on the grill. I will do that. I think maybe I'll do that next time you got maybe make them homemade. Tziki sauce put some pitas on there yeah. I'm thinking that sounds pretty good. I think I might do that uh someone's asking about the federal troops. I don't think he's gonna do it uh. I think he's stoke he's he has found something that he thinks is gonna win for him because obviously trump only has one button to push. It's the same one he pushed in 2016 and of course. That's insane because he's been president now for four years. So it's not nearly as effective but the one button he has is that cultural uh polarization button and we actually already have a a decent suggestion that it might not work if he's in power.

Because people. I mean obviously it feels like a million years ago but in 2018 during the midterm remember he put all those troops at the mexican border and whipped up a terror about the caravans. Those troops are still there by the way uh waiting for a caravan that never shows up and he's still lost pretty badly so nationalizing the election around those like galvanizing social issues didn't work at least once. I mean the context of 2016 is really so much more about hillary clinton uh than about him and about what she represented and crucially what he represented which was an alternative. He's not an alternative anymore and I think a lot of people kind of underestimate that he's no longer nobody could vote to him being like hey what's the worst could happen. They now know what they get when they get him and a lot of them don't like it and there's nobody who's gonna do like the hey throw the dice thing because they know what they get with him. That's why undecideds and less engaged people tend to in elections with an incumbent. At the last they tend to uh break against them. At least that's not always true.

But it tends to be true for that reason. So this time I think he thinks oh great the statue  is my thing. Now. This is the one thing that he can pull out of the muck that could be a polarizing issue because he tried it with the with the masks and with the go outside order which is now being totally underwhelmed overwhelmed by the inevitable you know spread of the disease beyond containment or hope of containment and uh he's already backtracked like he's wearing masks. Now he can't really. He can't really press that button uh and then like he can't really do the uh. The the black lives matter thing that he was doing earlier like you know where he was saying black lives. Matter was hate slogan and stuff like that that's not polling well because you know broadly speaking. The goals of the of the protests have been met with approval in uh in polling. Now what that means I have no idea. I don't think it necessarily means anything but uh it certainly doesn't give him a sense that this is a fertile row to hoe uh but the idea of like untrammeled violence in this in the cities and him being the only one who can stop it because the local democrats are too feckless. Uh. That's some  which is his wheelhouse. So he's going to keep trying to uh escalate this. Like this is all intentionally uh uh. Uh this is all intentionally provocative.

I mean it seemed as though the protests were sort of not petering out but losing their front page urgency because they had become less and less con violent. Because the cops for the most part in most places had stood down a little bit and therefore the marches went by largely unmolested. They didn't escalate and so they became assimilated into the day-to-day reality and we're no longer news and then the  plane club or the uh unmarked cars start plucking people off the streets of portland which is of course you know. One of the most fervent cities for uh protests and uh and one of the most like organized and uh uh confrontational left's left uh protest scene in the country uh and what do you know it that sparks off a whole new round of conflict. I mean people talk about how this is you know. This is a dress rehearsal for fascism and I mean yeah as if the crisis persists and gets worse and we don't do any redistribution yeah. Pulling people off the street and unmarked cars is going to get much more common but in the more near-term and I think more on what trump is thinking. It heightens the conflict that he thinks he can win on but the problem is.

I don't think he can because because he's the incumbent and because he is so intentionally inflammatory in his speech and in his actions he I think will get blamed more than certainly biden by people who are disturbed or people who aren't already committed and who are disturbed by you know protest violence because you know in 68. Nixon ran as a as a peacemaker a guy who's going to stop all the violence and all the mania in the streets. But that's because you know he wasn't in office. Trump is in office. How do you say vote for me and all this will stop when it's happening under you. I mean you aren't stopping it now. Why would. I think you're going to stop it a year from now biden. On the other hand he says he might so. I think this is all part of his his one campaign strategy and I think that that's going to be the next four months is going to be him uh especially ver especially uh verbally and in tweets raising the stakes against the mob antifa and all that  because it's gonna look more and more like he's he's threatening he's like. Gonna promise an actual civil war in america's streets. But I think that he doesn't have the sand for the actual confrontation uh look what happened with the lafayette square uh clearing he went out there waved the bible around and then the next that day threatened to send the army to american cities at which point joint chiefs started leaking like a sieve that they wouldn't take those orders and the whole thing was shelved. Now right now now he's doing it through dhs because that's a compliant toady and those guys are his guys in a way that the army still isn't.

But they're dhs give me. A  they're the losers they're. They're. They're the they're the runoffs they're. They're um. They're not those guys the bureau of prisons. I think is is not the same department but uh the guys that we talked about a few weeks ago who just destroyed all of their uh co-workers with paintballs and uh and flashbangs. They brought from home during a simulated exercise so yeah.


I think there's gonna be more stuff in portland. I think he might send some guys in to try to provoke in the big cities but I think whenever the the real moment of like confrontation comes. I think he'll back down oh man jacob wall. The man is simply a king there's no denying it. He is one of the most brilliant post post post modern media figures of the moment. He's one of the very few who I admire because he's free. None of us are free. None of these none of the people. In this like whatever the hell you want to call it uh. Uh this morass of uh of internet political personalities. People who essentially monetize their identities as like vectors of political agitation uh all of us are bound by to some invisible audience. Some imagined viewer or reader who we want to respect us we imagine who they are they're basically us because we imagine like somebody if I was out there would I like me that kind of thing.

Jacob wall has obliterated that he doesn't care what anyone thinks of it uh which is astounding and and what better example of that than him making up a fake llc to pay himself. Uh that is one letter off from the one that jason. Maxwell has and then claiming that he she paid him to do dirty tricks bragging about it essentially bragging about a fake dirty tricks campaign that he was going that he carried out on behalf of a globe-trotting sex criminal a a groomer par excellence a a a a genuinely evil person and he's out there clout chasing it. I mean it beggars imagination like in a world where we've all decided to like plug into a global panopticon where at every moment our psyches are totally vulnerable to being devastated by the just acquisitory unblinking eye of our perceived audience that even exists when we're not on line or posting.

This guy is gliding he's walking between the raindrops he's vibing at a frequency that not even dogs could hear yeah like he is the guy who more than anyone especially anybody who claims that's the case he has embraced the idea that there is no such thing as bad publicity. Like a lot of those alt-right guys will kind of uh point to the fact that they do open racism which makes means that they can't monetize the way that uh left-wing or non-explicitly racist political people can as proof that they're authentic and genuine right and that is one of the big reasons that I think a lot of young white men go to the alt-right is because you know the simulated alienating hell of online makes us crave authenticity which of course is itself a fantasy and a chimera. But it's still something that is a load star for many of us and when you see everything being sold to you and people selling themselves all throughout the internet if somebody could point to something and say like. I mean this. I'm not full of. If they can actually point to something some part of their belief system that that validates that argument. It's very to some people. It's very uh engaging and I think for a lot of those all right guys uh.

They they say. I'm the real  yeah. That's authentic that's authentic uh and of course. It doesn't really mean anything you know it's. It's just really a question of etiquette like where where what capitalist etiquette is and how it impacts uh. Its you know market structures essentially just the rules of the market of behavior of the market have changed uh and and now you're just you're as much like. Those guys are as much a threat to capitalism as somebody jacking off in a bank lobby. You know it's like it's gross and at some point the cops are going to show up and and get him out of there. But he's not going to  bring that bank to its knees by jacking off in the lobby and that's what those guys are they're jacking off in the lobby of like the the the marketized realm that we all live in the internet and they're calling the fact that they're asked to leave uh proof that they're dangerous and really subversive but it is a mark of authenticity. It's a mark at the very least that they're not after what they think those other people are after they're not after money.

They're not after fame they're not after getting their butt smooshed by hollywood pedophiles and that is persuasive. But the thing is those guys still are just as terrified of their perceived audience. I mean remember the thing with pinovich and his jewish wife where he like left his jewish wife because his mouth dreaming  podcast that is a man who has been brutally cucked by his own audience. Jacob wall doesn't care. Jacob well does not care at all nice. I could write a poem with that title uh and he expresses that by humiliating himself in a way that no one would do uh that no one could do unintentionally that's what's so brilliant about it. Like the specific there are obviously a lot of clowns and pathetic losers out there who like you know uh uh guys who like pick their nose and eat it on a stream. You know it's it's not hard to find a lot of self-administered l's out there. But they're usually they speak to that person's incompetence or or just personal loathsomeness or um lack of social skills. Walls.

Humiliations could only be intentionally self-inflicted and the thing is is that they also inflict damage at a very like low level but they inflict damage on his supposed world view too none you know not not only do none of his uh smears on democrats land. The very fact that he's doing them and the fact that he's associated in some way with conservatism undermines conservatism to a little to a little extent but he doesn't give a  because he doesn't really care about politics in my opinion. I think he grew up in emilio of politics because of his insane father but I feel like he is totally detached probably because he saw the sausage getting made from a young age from any conceptions of political uh value system. He had just assimilated the the self-dealing that's behind it all the the gimmick the the the the the fraud at the heart of modern politics and certainly modern consumer cons. Uh conservativism you know going back to richard vigory in the direct mail uh. Uh the direct mail uh lists that started the conservative movement in the 50s and 60s.


It's all been a  giant scam. It's all mid-level marketing. It's all handed in each other's pockets all to advance personally within the system. Effects of mutual exploitation cannibals all and wall got that at some point I think and just took it to the next level like okay. This is this is this the name of the game is personal personal advancement through political spectacle well. Any way. I do that. I'm going to be trapped in the maw of this machinery. How could I possibly indulge this while still being in any way a free human being and he figured it out by just detaching completely from human conceptions. Now of course the question then becomes who's paying for it and that is why we have to always get back to the material basis for all analysis because obviously the fact that wall is so obviou manifestly incompetent limits the number of people who are reasonably likely to give him money you know.

I can't imagine that he he has a lot of real clients. I mean he does have a history of doing literal. Uh stock fraud allegedly which he's that's why he's banned from like trading stocks on uh. And I think he's he's still awaiting trial on on securities fraud in california and that was when he was a teenager. So he he is now so could this whole thing be a money laundering operation for someone else which describes most of the economy. At this point uh. I mean the uh the liquidity in the global market is provided by the laundering of illegal black market money. There's some persuasive evidence that the 2008 collapse was prevented from being a absolute uh dismantling of the global economy by the presence of a huge amount of liquid capital in the form of laundered uh drug money that basically helped fill the gap before the government was able to loosen the floodgates. But it's all just it's all  real estate market that's all money laundering investment. I'm sorry investment quantitative easing um so maybe he's part of that. I don't know but when he got an only fans that was amazing mind blowing he decided to go on.

He's like 24 years old and he got on steroids to get all weird and ropey and like broad as  and like. I don't know he is a riddle. He has a riddle wrapped in enigma and it's I would and I and if I knew where the money was coming from that would help solve the equation. I think if he's got family money. Then he's basically just a hobbyist a very talented hobbyist but a hobbyist if he's somehow making money off of this. Then he is one of the greatest geniuses of all time if he is actually making money at what he says he's doing. Then he is the greatest genius of all time and honestly even if he has money laundering for somebody that's still pretty impressive unemployment expansion.

Mcconnell came out today and said they're gonna do it. It's probably gonna be less than the last check but I never I honestly say I never really thought for a second uh that they weren't gonna do that because we are just so far away from not from allowing from not allowing a second or not requiring rather a second check dispersal that at a certain point politic ideology has to give way to political reality as much as these guys were apparently enamored of the idea that oh no we can't give people money. Then they won't go to work and then the unemployment rate will go up as if that matters compared to the like a third of the people in the country being evicted from their homes uh so yeah. I figured they were gonna blink. It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be more you know more money up of course always more money for the top so that when they can swoop in and just buy up all the old real estate of all the small businesses and further monopolize the economy. But uh I think they're going to do another check and I think they're going to do unemployment extension too also maybe a cap maybe a capital gains tax cut which would be hilarious and also a  what a payroll tax cut amazing they can't help it. It really is built into the system like to do anything else like we could say well. Why wouldn't you just do x y or z to do those things they would have to be different people in like a fundamental way you know if they just did a payroll tax cut that would be amazing. But I don't think they'd do it.

At a certain point. There has to be a recognition of real self-interest. I mean that's the thing you have to remember though is that you know when you're trying to figure out. What capital is going to do you do it from the assumption of they're operating out of what they consider the best interest of capital broadly defined is you know if you're talking about government as sort of the as a stand-in for uh for a like a round table of large capitalists. Uh there can only operate from their best perception of their best sub. Their best interest and every government and despot that's ever been overthrown in a revolution. At every point they thought what they were doing was in their best interest and at a certain point they were no longer correct because ideology starts gumming the works you reproduce the most mediocre minded  to fill every meaningful position. You get completely detached from the actual micro reality that uh that hayek claims is supposed to like uh signal what's really happening at the grassroots to to the top levels of government all right guys.


I'm gonna get off in a minute here a few more questions and I'm gonna say goodbye how much longer will twitter be a website that's a good question. It certainly lasted longer than. I would have thought it would when it started. It's weird how after early innovations it really just and things popping up and going down and friendstered in smack spaces. It really just settled into facebook and twitter. There's never been like a third heat unless you got instagram which is different. I think maybe tick tock is going to replace all of it. I mean if you if if the tweens are you know hegemonic and they keep marching through like the income brackets. Assuming there still are any associated with more you know spending income and more influence on the on markets and advertising maybe. Maybe it all becomes tick-tock if they if they got rid of tic-tac wouldn't there be an american version of tick-tock immediately to pop up why the hell did. I don't understand the internet. I should stop talking about it. It's just a bunch of clicks and whistles to me.

I kind of assume. All of it will be the same but different until you don't notice yeah. I was just thinking about vine what the hell happened to vine was it because it was seven seconds and tick tocks are longer or was it. The because I remember when the tick tock started. It was all because they had music. It was just people lip syncing and then it turned into a bunch of other craziness. At first it was people. Lip syncing was it that they had access to music.

I don't understand it. I don't understand it yeah. Let's go to web 1.0 guys. I was there ate my balls. I kiss you uh mr t through hell of afar seanbaby.com mr cranky uh the dancing hamster that was a hell of an internet just clicking along on a dial-up modem. The forum era people could always ask me if I was ever on something awful and I never was. I didn't even know what it was until many years later. I didn't meet. I met all those guys who were legends on something awful through twitter. I never went on something awful. I was on mr cranky. It was a movie review website that was my  uh sadly. I don't think any of those uh uh those those rooms survive which frankly good they would suck and I'm I would never want to read them but yeah uh that's how I'll end things with let's we need to we need to like recognize limits while still recognizing people's curiosity and need to explore new forms. So my compromise is. We don't ban the internet that's crazy. We just go to web 1.0 and then you have to be happy with that and it builds character. It builds character if that's all you get. All you get are angel fire sites with little clickers on the bottom saying how uh which visitor you are bye-bye.
