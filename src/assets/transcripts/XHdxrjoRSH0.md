 hydrations I was in them. I was looking into the mirror. See a little bit clearer the rottenness and evil in me fingertips and memories. I can't believe the girls of your body when I feel a bit naughty. I run it up the black pool and see who salutes but no one ever does. I'm not sick. But I'm not well and I'm so high cause. I'm in hell put me in the hospital. I swear to god got to commit me. I said. I was crazy put me in the hospitals well. I hate you guys my my hi folks. So is there a weird noise. Folks in the background of these or is that just on youtube because people are complaining or is that just on youtube echo that does that help is that better or am. I now deaf. What do you got all right. I turned off a thing is that better or worse that did it okay all right good echo as. I thought it was gone. It's gone okay ah all right so. I we haven't done on these streams for a while.

We haven't done a book and I figure since I'm going to do try to stick to one a week. It'd be good to focus it around a book that people can read along with if they'd like to and we can talk about and it hit me that I have this book. I bought it a while ago but I haven't started it yet and in the chat while I was talking last week about. You know ideas about social structures and how they're generated. Somebody pointed out that the new david graber r.i.p. And a david wengro book. The dawn of humanity is sort of like the antithesis of what. I'm talking about because you know they're anarchists and they don't think that structures necessarily determine the way that societies are organized so. I figured hey let's have a little conversation. Let's have a conversation with graeber and wengrow who for the sake of brevity. I'm going to call grape grow instead of having to say both names which is annoying so for next week. I'm going to read the first two chapters of the dawn of everything and we'll talk about. I already read the first chapter It's basically them being like yeah. You know all that other.

They're dumb We're going to start we're going to blow your mind. We're going to give you an alternative story as to how civilization began and in that first chapter. They make some very cogent points mainly that most of our stories about where social structures come from are just that they're totally unmoored to any kind of evidentiary or empirical model. It's and that's honestly that's not a problem with me. But it is interesting that it so many of the people who have now embraced empiricism and rationality and evidence-based scientific enlightenment as basically the only lens to see the world through are really content to allow the foundation for their understanding of the society.

They live in to rest on a bunch of fairy tales a bunch of just so stories and so grave grow here look like they're going to be trying to propose an alternative story which might have a little more evidence in it. Since you know these guys are actually anthropologists and archaeologists as opposed to the sort of freelance intellectuals who otherwise people the the social science the popular social sciences But it's still at the end of the day gonna be them telling a tale and we'll see we'll see what seems right. We'll see what where the what points are being made and which ones are good. So we'll see first two chapters for next week. I'm interested in going through this stuff because I gotta figure there's gonna be a lot of like very interesting useful stuff here.

But at the same time I am I come in with a lot of skepticism to any argument that says that the structures of the economic order do not determine most of our social values. They make a very good point though on the first chapter about how we're very quick when trying to imagine press prehistorical civilization to imagine that they lacked elements of life that we have basically because you couldn't price it like the things like the values that we have now the things that make us happy we live in civilization. Are valued because we literally have a price for them. That's how we know they have worth and so the assumption is in a civilization civilizations that existed before that the emergence of that market and that and that rigid price structure on on things that that the va that the experiences that those things represented didn't exist and I think that pointing that out is very useful and undermines. I think a lot of the triumphal and stephen pinker. Ideas about civilization in general but we'll get to that next week and I'll say like you know. The marxist tradition doesn't really have any kind of empirical grounding either because at the end of the day it's kind of hard to have a lot of empirical insights because the farther back you go the less meat is left to sift through the more fragments. The more fragmentary things are so anyway next week we'll be talking about that yes sift through your meat.

Somebody says do we need a secular anabaptism well. I mean I think one of the points I was trying to make last week is that is that the socialist movement is secular anabaptism. I mean because I really don't think that you can understand modern western society civilization. The secular west that we have with its enlightenment principles as anything other than a evolution of the protestant world and the protestant worldview that was emer that emerged in the modern era and just as protestantism overthrew catholicism and organized itself along different levels of critique basically and different challenges to social structure from magisterial lutheranism to reformed calvinism to the quietest sects like the mennonites to radical power challenging sex. Like the anabaptists. It's all a continuum of a challenge to the catholic social order and then the modernity as we know.

It is a similar challenge to the religious social order that protestantism was trying to perfect and it was protestantism's success in breaking up the social basis for religious belief that led inevitably to the enlightenment because there was nowhere else to turn to understand the world other than to oneself and the accumulation of technol technologies the tim. The accumulation of social orders premised on technology increased our capacity to understand at a mechanical level how the world around us worked which did a lot to cut the ties that had bound previous generations to religious faith. Like the the the early protestants their minds were of flame with critique and and with challenge to the conventional order around them. But they were deeply constrained by their understanding of the world which was relatively unschematic certainly nothing in it to truly undermine the socially generated idea that god created the universe god created earth and so and that like the bible is the source of understanding of the world we live in and so they set about studying the bible with ferocious intensity But eventually there became more books that you could study like origin of the species for example and applying that searching alienated urbanized guilt and resist resentment filled mind that that modern subjectivity to a wider array of of scientific reports on the nature of reality allows for the creation finally of an alternative. A really stable alternative to the religious worldview that's not to say that there weren't unbelievers all through human history and that medieval and early modern europe didn't have plenty of people who didn't really believe in god of course they did. But it's a question of reproducing those beliefs socially at the social scale and there just wasn't a constituency or a vocabulary to perpetuate that just as there wasn't a capacity or or constituency or vocabulary to challenge catholicism effectively until the invention of the printing press in the 12th century. England had 12th century already. England had the lollards very funny name for a religious dissenting group.

They used to get together at lollard palooza and they were critiquing catholicism along many of the same axis that the protestants ended up doing but absent mass literacy absent mass communication capacity. They became a small set off community that eventually was persecuted into oblivion or dissipated secretly into an underground. Jan huss got where he got which is killed but with his followers in Bohemia waging a 20-year war against the holy roman empire and eventually to gain a religious settlement that allowed them to set up their own separate church with their own communion rituals. The ultra quest church and he was able to do so in the absence of a printing press. But what he had there was a linguistic and ethnic conflict that the religious challenge was able to map on top of because in bohemia. At that time. The religious ecclesiastical authorities were largely german speakers and the laity by and large were czech speakers and that had caused as you could imagine ex social tensions and and resentment and huss. This is challenge to catholicism was able to map on top of it and that gave it the energy to become a sustained movement that was able to fight the holy roman empire to something. Like a draw. They fought all that they fought for 20 years for the right to get bread and water or bread and wine at the communion. That was basically it. They were sick of only getting You we want both and after 20 years and burning john hosts alive. They said fine so anyway this is all to say that you need the social structures and technology to really challenge.

 conventional structures which means of course that it's happening from within you know it happens from within a hegemony. You get this counter germany built and eventually it can take over and protestantism took over for catholicism. Largely because the economic engine strapped to protestantism was more dynamic than catholicism's political economy and then we get the perfected protestant polity here in the united states where all of the inherent contradictions that come from trying to abolish civic religious faith and ritualize reaffirmation of faith replace it with. This totally individualized religious commitment and then expect people to still live together as christian brothers are able to be resolved through domination subjugation and the creation of otherized laborers and the expert ex-corporation of others. Land and then catholics ended up having to come too from their undynamic rapidly devolving peasant economies in in southern and central europe and they were a undigested challenge to american protestantism for 100 years. But they were eventually scattered throughout the suburbs and suborned into a broader american protestantism that by that point of course had been atteliated into a even more secularized world where everybody is at the same time protestant and atheist so like the people who followed the puritans in peopling the intellectual spears of our cities. In the merchant classes they lost religious faith the protestantism in a formal sense. They embraced an atheistic understanding of the universe but the moral system of protestantism remained and similarly the the protestants who held on to the religious faith and spread across the continent. Did so while embracing capitalism and the logic of markets and the logic of secular society completely and then catholicism is just washed back into it which is why sometimes people say when they hear me talk about this stuff that they think that I am standing for catholicism against protestantism and I'm saying it's better or that we should all convert to it.

That's silly you can't go back. You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Catholicism is in my mind. What defined it and what protestantism challenged was a social ritual of a religious affirmation that is incompatible in the long term with capitalism and so one of them had to go and it was ritual reaffirmation of religious belief not everywhere not evenly but broadly and certainly in the united states and so you by saying you don't get anywhere by saying I'm catholic you're still totally socially isolated and atomized okay. I'm gonna go do the benediction okay good luck in your cult compound how do those turn out. The social order has to be challenged from from the from the point of its economic engine. If you're gonna have the building of any future religious faith that can offer the the sucker that people imagine medieval catholicism did yes like catholicism was the was.

The religious social logic of feudalism and feudalism is is gone. Now we talk about techno feudalism but the whole point the whole point of techno and the feudalism is that it has replaced all of the social bonds and points of social coercion and consent with technological ones. They know there no longer needs to be any concerns that people believe in the value of anything that any system benefits them. They only have to know that they will be punished. If they disobey and feudalism could not offer that level of coercion. There was not enough power and control. There was not enough surveillance. There wasn't enough of a disparity in weaponry between commoners and the aristocracy people cooperated within feudalism because at a fundamental point for the most part most of the time they believed they consented to the system. They were in and all of our social orders have been defined by that relationship and that exists at every level even at the hyper-exploited point the worst miseries of of a system like feudalism or a slave economy. The people who are most exploited are still are still participating instead of revolting but with them at the lowest point is exactly where in a slave economy. For example surveillance and technology and disparity of power is greatest where coercion is most in imposed. But it's a scale. Everybody is coerced and can sense to some degree depending on where they are the social hierarchy and that consent part that's free that is generated by the experience of social life.

It does not have to be formally maintained by power structures if you lose that absent a change in technology. You lose the ability to govern you lose legitimacy and you are overthrown your order collapses. If if no no coherent opposition to it can assert power what is happening in our system here at the endpoint of capitalism's terminal crisis once again terminal could go on for a very long time. It doesn't mean there's any collapse happening anytime soon. I just mean that we've finally achieved a global market that's the end point of capitalism's logic of expansion. It doesn't have anywhere else to go. There's fantasies of going to the moon and mars and stuff but that is just that is the ideology speaking.

That's the stuff that keeps us cons consenting that's why tesla is so important as a as a note of prop of of state. Control because and why it can't go under right now because tesla represents a technological capitalist salvation. An intervention that will prevent the worst that we all suspect is coming now absent intervention or a collapse that undermines the system's ability to maintain itself. The trajectory we are on is one in which all that belief that social consent that used to exist has been drained from us and replaced with an awareness of our precarity and vulnerability to a regime of surveillance and control and this will create like a new subjectivity that we can't even really understand or project outward because we're not living under it right now.

Though we're living sort of at the at the final frontier of an exhausted protestant. Secularism which took over protestantism first and and then secular western values as it got drained of its supernatural connotations. Became the cultural logic of capitalism and have been ever since capitalism. Fully dominated in the mid-1920s to 19th century and that is one in which the society so you don't look to your social order you don't look to rituals within your social life. For reaffirmation of your beliefs. They are internal they are held within oneself. The social order is seen as a desacralized market where if god's will is to be divine. It is not but through people walking in religious procession on a feast day or getting communion or having a carnival or or watching passion plays in the city courtyard.

It's who prospers and who suffers in this marketplace and I gotta say nobody is seeking. This like protestantism did not seek this de-sacralized social space. Protestants were trying to adapt to a new social reality as capitalism came into existence they were coping. I don't think there's a greater example of cope in human history than the puritans trying coming to new england to try to finally create a community of real believers who would all be trusting each other's faith and be able to live together as christians by excorporating the the godless natives. But they were hooked into a burgeoning world system that was going to pull them into competing classes based on ownership of capital and all those social bonds were going to break no matter what anybody's belief was and then they're the ones who stayed home the puritans who stayed home. They helped overthrow and cut the king's hop king's head off and in another attempt to recreate the social order which failed because it had to fail because it was always cope. Everyone is moving towards what they think is their best interest in the best interest of their faith and and if even the human race they can imagine that or if they imagine themselves as parts of ambassadors of a of a gospel that will eventually overtake the world but the tools they have to try to do that are the tools that the political economy leaves for them and that means that they can only destroy their the basis of their own beliefs with every action. Just as the the dynasties of europe destroyed their own powers their own.

 real power like their own actual control over people and and and geographic entities by endorsing and facilitating capitalism. But they had no choice because they were in a competition with other dynasties and they'd convince themselves that their best interest is the best interest of their people europe world whatever everybody within every social hierarchy is moving towards their own self-interest which they have identified with the best interest of humanity but in a context of capitalism can only end up alienating from themselves and from the people who come after them all that they had held sacred and profaning everything that they were seeking to protect and building this other thing this this alienated monstrosity because the human race is always in the process of becoming right of becoming self-aware of of of recognizing It's it's unity and destiny. But it's doing that through social structures that are generated inherently by contradiction written economic systems of exploitation that pull us away that that make the material world without our will would make basically the material we make the material world into the opposite of what we want. The actual material world becomes the opposite of our intended efforts and that is why we are in the process of of building a self-aware algorithm of profit exploitation that has no need for human inputs. No need for human will at any point only human subjugation.

Not the not a human desire for anything other than continued existence. All other goals desires aspirations squeezed out by the the process by which profit destroys literally the biosphere and ecosystem that that it's preying on basically and that creates conditions of decline and in those conditions. Humans are going to try to change something to stop it from happening but anything that they could do to actually change. It goes against the the deeper prime directives that are no longer accessible by human action at least within the system and so people despair fall away or submit themselves to the machine and eventually the only human involvement necessary is to fill a gap in a trend in a circuit and if if you refuse you prove yourself to be a a dead spark plug you get thumped out and they bring in another one because there'll always be another one.

Now that sounds of course super doom pill black pill and it's reflect is basically what. I was saying the other week about how that that encircling power that choked off the anabaptists of munster that choked off a couple of buddhist utopian projects in medieval japan and that choked off the soviet union is now all-consuming and all-encompassing and that the real has been sort of removed That's not that's not true when I when I talk about this. I'm talking from within the assumption being at every point that the people I'm describing the people in the position that we are now in in a inside the system in the future are are. Still there are still on one side of the border as these archipelagos of power shrink. There are still people on the other side of the line.

There are still real humans living in the abandoned parts of the world and amongst the the abandoned detritus of the technological civilization and they will all have a will and they all have a desire to continue on and they will have every incentive in the world to band together how effective they can be who knows but and i. I don't necessarily think that they would ever overthrow the techno feudal cantons but they wouldn't really need to they could very well be able to build alternative structures in the wreckage would. I think in the long term sustained themselves much more than the death driving techno suicide booth on the other side of the line within the wire because the human as human agency just is bled out of existence and technology completely over us there's no desire. There's no human will to continue and eventually yeah you would just have machines that were still plugged in doing their own thing.

Maybe a few like complete psycho field people who've decided that they can actually become god which if you're close enough to money in capitalism is the alternative to the despair of secular nihilism which consumes everybody else within it if you really can sit close to enough money. Even though it's not possible any more than us becoming space colonists. In the near future is you can believe it and that's all that matters there will be a cadre of of scientists who know more than you who will have a self-interest in bullshitting you about how you can live forever so that'll be it everybody ever you'll either. Everybody will either have killed themselves in despair or just not reproduced and then there will be a few tanks with guys floating in it. Hoping that they can eventually become robot living gods until like a.

A roomba kicks out one of the plugs and they just flatline but on the other side of the wire you've got the people who were left behind by civilization and who have I'm gonna tell you a lot. They're going to have a lot of the detritus of civilization to sift through to to build out of and they're going to have the experience of civilization chewing them up and spitting them out to start from and if there's going to be a challenge to capitalism. I think that's where it truly emerges and I don't think it overthrows capitalism. I don't think the center is overthrown and I think a lot of people are so wedded. To being inside the tent of civilization are so scared of the moral and physical implications of being outside of the the veal crate of western technological society that they assume any future that involves picking through the by definition lawless. Wastelands of capitalism is by definition.

The worst case scenario is the annihilation of humanity I think it could very well be the genesis of the next real stage of human social evolution and that what we're right in the middle of now is going to be remembered like any other failed empire from deep history. We're going to be like the assyrians. I think they're going to look back and they're going to chart all the all the all of the empires that rose and fall through the eras of of human alienation where the social order was predicated on competition between humans not something that was inherent to humans not something that was never that was always doomed to repeat itself but something that over time predominated during a given period given this period giving the given these climactic and geographic and contingent conditions. This is what we got from slave societies to feudalism to capitalism. Is we got these rising and falling empires attempting to stabilize a polity and having to always expand to compensate for the internal contradictions of a class society and then collapsing when usually when climate conditions changed and with that. The internal coherence and ability of the of the empire to expand was also compromised that's the history. That's that's that's the tale of all of our pre-capitalist empires and I think you'll see they'll say here's the roman empire.

 here is this here is the um the era of um of interregnum and and challenge in europe and then post 1945. You had this new global empire that progressed at every along every axis that it could and then finally collapse within its own contradictions and then the humans outside of it outside of its barbed wire and outside of its market zones outside of its logic but with the memory of all those things built something else. Yes somebody says the little ice age age ended.

Medieval. Christendom ended the catholic hegemony. I think broadly that is correct that and the printing press did it because you had a a worldwide but certainly continent-wide. Paroxim of of agricultural instability and feudalism is based on agriculture coupled with a new ability to express broad discontent across temporally fixed places and in those new climactic and social conditions. The old ritualized christian world was no longer sustainable and a new one had to be built and in order to prevent everyone in europe from killing each other a secular space. A secular social space had to be created and something had to fill in for a religion religiosity in public action and that was market compulsion what if it keeps on going though it's going to I'm just saying in its peripheries and in its abandoned zones.

Other things are going to be happening and there's going to be challenges from within as well that are going to push it in different directions and we don't. I don't really know i. I've given up predicting anything because we're in the middle of an inflection point right now. I feel like I gave the wrong impression when I talk about all the inflection points and hinge points in history and how we've missed a lot of them and that we kind of missed the chance to grab hold of industrials and civilization and socialize its machinery. That capitalism has moved beyond its historically progressive role and is now just a carcinogen on our body politic. But we're still in a fluid moment. All moments are fluid and no end point for any of this is fixed and wow and what that means is that whatever challenge will emerge to capitalism within and without 

Its zones of control is going to push us towards one world and away from another and that in the retrospect this moment will be a hinge and there will be contingencies that we can't see right now so we have to act like every moment is contingent. That is to me how you resolve the question of free will and determinism. The question of historical structures versus happenstance of chance and human decisions is to say one is the objective schematic of existence and the other is the subjective experience of existence and we can only subjectively experience existence as individuals and so we are obligated to act like every moment is a hinge point every moment is contingent and only in retrospect will be able to be able to determine which ones were but the way to think about this. I think that's most illuminating is is that it really is as james cameron and others have bluntly put it a war against the machines it is against technology ted. Kaczynski was right about that. I think it's kind of tedious to like be an edge lord kaczynski because none of you are serious nobody's getting a editor.

I guess you could say that if he lasted long enough he would have like posted blogs but I don't know. I think he would have considered that a lesser form of communication and wouldn't have bothered with it. But capitalism is a technology to hand manage human existence and it was built by the upper strata of european post-feudal society in an effort to maintain their power in the face of rapidly destabilizing conditions destabilize climactic conditions coupled with a new mass populace who could articulate ideas and communicate across time and space in an unprecedented fashion. Someone says it happened in agriculture. See that's what this is about. This is one of the big things that grab grow challenges. They say that agriculture did not necessitate the creation of rigid class structures and that's a bold statement as vincent veger said and I'm willing to. I'm willing to be convinced But we'll be.

But I will be reading it so next week first two chapters we're going to start talking about it. He's saying that no that he's got there's going to be a number of evidences of societies that established complicated agriculture without attendant social structures and I'm very very interested to find out what those might be. We'll see because to me. It's very difficult to imagine because as I've said there is an inherent preference if you are within a group of people who enjoy the surplus of others to continue to live that way. Instead of having to do stuff that is sucks now. I understand that farm labor. The the misery of farm labor is not fixed that it can be alleviated and reduced if it is unalienated and certainly if there is cooperation in its production how you scale that though is the real question how do you scale agriculture to allow for significant social formation and population growth in a way that does not increase exploitation of agricultural labor does not require the intensification of agricultural labor.

We'll see we'll see what they have to say. I'm like. I said I'm willing to be convinced and then we'll see how that affects the the rest of the tattering edifice of my welchong. Sure why do. I why do our elites have to be so boring is the question and a lot of people have pointed this out that our elites have nothing really grandiose about themselves like a lot of people made fun of that picture of jeff bezos looking like pitbull and thinking my god. That's such a bummer like this. Guy's got a more money than god and he's using it to have pretend. He's at the clevelander which you know anybody could do if they have like a iron shirt and they're like that's what you're doing with the money.

That's the whole point of capitalism is that it is totalizing all of the pageantry and majesty that separated elites of the past and all of the ritualized. Architecture like physical architecture that was built to sustain that sense of difference and distinction and power has been technologized. Has been synthesized into our social existence and now one of the big reasons we all participate in capitalism is because of the fantasy that we can be elite that we can be amongst them and so their dreams have to be our dreams as we've totally abolished a metaphysical separation between our elites and us like we no longer think they're gods or god's emissaries.

We think they're just like us. Their behavioral and cultural presentation is also made banal but of course in the real material world. The amount of power that they hold and the physical distance between them and us is of course greater than ever like at the end of the day they might have had a. The the the pharaohs might have built pyramids but they slept what up a few stairs from their subjects but but behind some curtains with some guys guarding it guys with sticks which you also have physically you're right there even though you are metaphysically a god to them and that does this that does the job of putting up of putting a razor wire and having land mines and and private islands and helicopter. Helicopter docking across the world to keep you from the hoi polloi that is that that power is metaphysical. So they don't have to worry about you coming in with a stick and so they can stay they can exert that kind of power within that kind of vulnerable position. Now our wealthy our power our elites.

They're just some guys. We all think that so the more prosperity gospel pilled of us might think that they are elect by god that they're that they're going to heaven because they live there now. But at the end of the day they're sinners like the rest of us. Everybody recognizes them as as basically the same metaphysical stuff as us. But they are completely inaccessible. They cannot be engaged with physically you can tweet at them. You can't get to them and that is the process of civilization is technology being used over time by elites to maintain the distance in space turn the distance in the mind in time into physical fixed power so like there's no reason for bezos and those guys to do anything like super operatically ritualized and and challenging to our conventional notions because they have nothing to prove. They don't need to reaffirm their separation from us and the fact that they've all just lived under the same system either we do means that their imaginations and mental horizons have been impoverished as all of ours have more so because of their commitment to power and and and asserting it which leaves them less mental space for anything else.

That's why the early 1900s are so interesting because at that time you had all these kings and queens of europe walking around in the same relationship to their subjects that their ancestors did who had around them the cloak. The divine cloak of a rite of kings that was genuinely something people believed even if they hated the king it was within a context of understanding kingly prerogatives and kingly power. But by the early 1900s the late 1800s as capitalism is doing its most traumatic work in europe and the united states to the polity with it. The people within it did its. It was it did most of its worst work. You know during the colonial periods but that's somebody else's problem at that point.

Though it was finally coming for the interior areas where the capitalist world system is finally revving into full industrial gear and in those conditions given the acceleration of scientific understanding that leads to mass disillusionment with religion and the experience of living in a world where things just get worse and you get smaller people in europe and the united states got smaller. Over the course of the late 1900s. They started growing a lot when they had more access to beef in the early 19th century or in the early yeah 19th century and then boom they started shrinking as soon as they started getting en mass dumped into the dark satanic mills so life was murdering them. Now english political economy told them that well. That was the market aka god telling them what their fate was that english liberalism is just the next step of puritanism. It's the further refinement of the contradiction between metaphysical existence and the alienating life under capitalism and that oh but that only really mo that only really sold to people who were benefiting from it from people who weren't they went along out of the fact that they didn't have a choice.

But they certainly got disillusioned with things like the king's. Prerogative and so you have this amazing period when a bunch of kings and queens and prime ministers who are used to just like going to the movies going to an opera riding around in an open carriage just started getting absolutely murked of course here in the u.s. It was william mckinley getting shot in the stomach at a receiving line at the buffalo exposition by a guy leon cholgosh who literally was hiding the gun in a handkerchief that was all he was doing no amazing but in the king of italy was murdered. I believe the hungarian austro-hungarian empress was stabbed to death prime ministers in presidents in spain and france. You had a bunch of pissed off people disenchanted with existing structures of power secular and religious and in close proximity to their elites and they started they started killing them. Now. We're reaching a new stage of core crisis and exploitation. After the stabilization of the post world war ii era and a new mass disillusionment but our elites are nowhere to be found. They're behind bulletproof glass 15 layers of security guards and yes the czar.

The tsar liberator alexander ii got it blown up that's one thing that we definitely lost though is the tradition of throwing round bombs. Perfectly round bombs with wicks fuses we should bring back those bombs not to throw at anyone parody video game but like shot putting towards a pumpkin or something. They're just fun but that that literally like that's how they would kill people. They would throw a little round. Bocce balls at it was like. Mario brothers being being a gilded age. Monarch was like playing a level of mario trying to just avoid the little bombs but of course what did any of it accomplish. What did all of this propaganda of the deed actually accomplish pretty much nothing because what moves the wheels of history is collective action collective action by elites and collection action collective action up by the the people that the elites exploit now because of technology and asymmetrical access to technology the elites you need a lot fewer of them to act together to exert power. You need a lot more of their exploited to do so to make up for the gap in technology and so you need to get people together now blowing up kings and queens and shooting presidents. It's you could say funny and certainly not anything that you could argue. They don't have coming in a moral sense.

But the idea that it's what inspires people to act against capitalism is a romantic fantasy because it imagines that your aesthetic appreciation of the death of a monarch is going to break some spell over you and change the way you act. I would say no you're gonna keep acting the way for the same reasons that most people act most of the time which is a dimly sensed notion of their own self-interest which is first and foremost not only but first and foremost a material self-interest and so while you might cheer on the death of a monarch or be inspired to to act against power in the moment that it happens you can only be repeatedly pushed in the direction of challenge pushed in the direction of mobilization and activism and the to the work of building counter hegemony by the deeper prod of material investment and that is your subjective experience as a exploited person someone in the exploited class and then the thing that keeps you on the same road as your compatriots is your shared self-interest which is then melded into a self-conscious class interest now when you think what's good for me me encompasses more people than it used to now. The capitalists don't do that they can always always. They're only looking out for their their their self-interest because they're not exploited.

They have no reason to resist the flow of the social order. They use their access to technology and control and influence to advance their self-interest. But all of those exploiters self-interest pointed in the same direction is of course the maintenance of the social order of domination. But because it is never fused into a single class consciousness. It has contradictions within it that undermine it like the contradictions currently existing between fixed national regional capital and international capital which is playing out all over the world in the form of the the center against right-wing populism. Someone says the self is the demiurge that's a bingo if you want to know where yaldallah bath or whatever the his name is is look in the mirror and so therefore the strength of the working class opposed cap to capital is that they by creating a class consciousness are able to negate. All those contradictions within this themselves and act in concert instead of undermining themselves from within this capitalism does but what happened in our version of reality is that even with all that propaganda of the deed and the emergence of working-class movements across the industrial heartland of north america and europe the apocalyptic violence of capitalism in crisis that marked the first 30 years 40 years of the I'm sorry the first 50 years of the 20th century saw the working-class movement neutralized and its cultural economic engine sequestered in a post-feudal backwater in russia where it was not able to compete and it was surrounded and starved just as anabaptist munster had been so well you shouldn't fret like if I was if. I was somebody in I mean. I can't obviously imagine it but looking back on it. There's no real reason for anybody to spend time fretting about the assassination wave but there's also no reason to participate in it. It wasn't going to move the needle. It was an adornment. It was an epic phenomenon to the greater process of capitalist class formation okay.

So that's that I hope that made sense let's go brandon just want to end today by saying that I honestly feel like joe biden is the best president of my lifetime for the simple fact that he is the first one to really drop the mask you can say people say trump but trump just traded one fantasy of us living in a deliberative democracy for another. Us living in a place where you can still win by owning your ideological opponents. You can still win through expression of your resentment if you piss somebody else off you've won. That's the dream of trump biden doesn't even have that biden is here to tell you every day and he does it with actions and more importantly to me as an aesthetic appreciator of politics in words that it's over. Biden came out here today after trying to do some more about the voting rights bill and he goes. I don't know if I can get this done. I don't know if it's going to happen folks. Shush tried everything. I tried nothing and we're out of ideas. People are freaking out about it but would you rather he. You would you rather him give you the obama con job and I can say personally that I've had enough of that and if I'm just if I'm just evaluating this stuff on aesthetic grounds because remember there's no point in getting mad.

At these people they are filling spots that need to be filled. They're all hollow they're just instruments of a algorithm. They might have convinced themselves that they're doing it because they want to and for some greater good whatever that is but that's just cope if that's the case give me somebody who recognizes the exhaustion of it which is of course what makes his contrast with harris so interesting because yeah. He is. The he is the corpse of the democratic party machinery and of course the democratic party as a machine is dead. He is the last machine democrat. The party is now no longer a machine with a mechanism that had some sort of internal identity. Formation mechanisms that made people fuse their best self-interest with their idea of the party's self-interest. I would say that's what a machine is. It's when you imagine yourself as a democrat because your goals not just your meanest material goals and your delusions of grandeur but also your ethical considerations because these people do all live in some sort of ethical world. Very few of them are pure sociopaths.

They have convinced themselves they stand for something that used to be connected to the party itself and biden represented the end of that and the reason that he won. The nomination is because the choice was either bernie and athema to most people who vote democrat or someone who stood for the democratic party and then a bunch of people who only stood for themselves the person of themselves and only appealed to people who narcissistically fused their egos to that person pete kamala. All these people were there at least the ones who made it in warren. At least the ones who like made it toward into any kind of discussions of relevance were there to only represent themselves and in a primary electorate. There's not that many people left with that choice people went with the person who represented the democratic party because that's something that they could relate to if nothing else than vestigially or if they were sick of trump as a negation of trump even if they didn't like the party itself but he was it. I mean there's a reason that the person who had that spot is a senile 80 year old.

That's the that is the democratic party in senescence. So kamala is the post party the purely individualized and atomized democratic party so while joe can tell you. This is all over turn out the lights. Kamala cannot do that so she says stuff about how we need to listen in order to hear and the amazing line about how every day is now and now is the time to do. Everything we can and that's funny in its own right. But it doesn't have the virtue of honesty which biden does because well. The one thing I cannot cannot. At this point fathom are the people who repeatedly and and ritualistically just hold up all these pieces of evidence of the democratic party's failure to exert any kind of governing ability any kind of able to coordinate action and actually do politics and have no alternative other than yell at them and then what vote for them but vote for different people and on the ballot line and hopefully.

Eventually it just loses its ability to self delude but of course what's going to make it do that is is deteriorating material conditions. So we'll see we'll certainly see end of mass politics you got that right. I mean that's politics. It's been gone for a while. But it's fully deserted the the the ballroom. There's no more mass in our electoral politics. World is a indeed but as I said amongst the broken strewn detritus and rubble and in the cracked pavements. There's There are green shoots rising. We are all called to be there to water them all right talk next week about first two chapters of the dawn of everything by david grab grow david grab grow.
