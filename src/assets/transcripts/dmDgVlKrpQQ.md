Good evening mr. And mrs. America and all y'all ships at sea let's go to press today instead of coming from the bunker I come from the beautiful gorgeous spring day here in Brooklyn New York. Apparently it's the only nice day we're gonna have tomorrow. It's gonna be rainy again so want to get out here well. The Sun was still out enjoy. Some of this beautiful nature look at all this stuff happening around trees and billowing bushes and such there's dainty toe in the white house. There's a good idea sheet over the White House. There's a worldwide pandemic economic collapse in a way that like the post like the post-keynesian economy world economy has never had to deal with kim de jong hoon might be dad and there's a goddamn cheeto in the white house how the hell are you supposed to make sense of it hi. Hi makes sense of a dead top Dan beyond everyday it's got a mound everything that Tom isn't the one thing. It's a dismal tide. Not the one thing not the one thing the evening redness of the West how you guys doing someone says me for streaming right now why would I want to stream any other time look. At this. The Sun is literally in my face for dads. Sake. I don't know how much longer that's gonna last.

I hate edibles because you can never guarantee what you're gonna get or like how long it's gonna. Last. I hate all that animals are for like when you go to a movie or something and unique and you you have to you know you're gonna be out of the house. Like edibles. I don't understand the point of edibles in quarantine. I guess like to get surprised by yourself like oh I'm way higher than I thought it was I guess. I don't know I've only been smoking. But I'm Austin also have other things other than that other than acid or I'm sorry other than others leave that might be contributing I'm trying to like trying to crossfade. I guess you thought I gotta say like drinking a lot less I used to like alcohol. So you know if someone's got a gift. I'd rather it be booze.

My I don't know if my chrono sings the word how you guys doing man how you guys living in this year of the cheeto add new MMO cheeto nay would that be it had no cheat on a AC the year of the cheeto. The year of the frito-lay cheeto product like we're in a goddamn David Foster Wallace book and the thing is that you make fun of Wallace. All you want but he got it. He knew it was coming more than anyone he knew was coming. You saw it here the subsidized time I mean there's no figure in like creat like especially right around the turn of the millennium. There's no figure in science fiction or literary fiction that heralded Trump more than Johnny gentle famous crooner. The the nonpartisan president of the onin Confederation that would rule near future America in a chest. The thing about like people hating David Foster Wallace basically happened because like guys a guy's involved. There's there's mom I hate the sound to read bill here.

But this is just the back is that like you know there are certain strategies were attracting women that certain men adopt and ones who aren't physically capable of doing so use usually else. We use use their wiring their wits of ahem you there. Basically I'm saying is that you you you you goof on the the jocks with like the art girls but eventually the jobs aren't there anymore. It's just you and the art girls in Brooklyn. So now what are you doing like you know none of you know how to play football. None of you none of you could change a tire so who's the who's the jock who's the scary masculine guy that you can convince the more anxious of your female friends that you're not like well. Hugh Pete's David Foster Wallace skiff gets pretty sad like then really that's like like when they're going out there making it being bro like to read a book that fifteen hundred page book.

Then those terms have been destroyed of meaning those those terms don't mean anything if reading a fifteen hundred page. Book makes you a a bro. Then there isn't the bro doesn't mean anything. It's a totally relative term that's just used as a way to distinguish yourself. Anyway infant jest he got what was coming. He got what the speak out like the psychological interior aura t that late capitalism produced better than anybody in my opinion and you might say well that's cuz you're a white male and so yeah probably because he wants to and that's part of the reality of it like the part of the end part of that like maddening generalizable but then also so like neurotically and mmm and specifically individuated so that like I can think it's Martin totally my own and also feel exhale Universal because that's the way that that's that's relate that reflects the same facets of capitalism. It's instant in math malleability and customizability so that state of mind. I think he gets that better than anyone but of course it's filtered through the mind of a white male dude bro so white.

Male Duke bros read it and they get that I think more readily because they have fewer they don't have to translate it. It's it's straight. It's like reading something in its original language as opposed to a translation or having to do the translation to yourself from the second line. Like that's the difference I think that is it oh yeah so DFW stamps are dudes. He had no idea what he's like but because it's mathematics and like that's the kind of thing that because that's the thing that made him a genius too because like the thing about people like me is the end of the day. I think this is almost universally true gun to the head people like me who like maybe know a little bit about history. Maybe have a little bit of a those ability to like synthesize concepts. Maybe they can recall ideas maybe they can you know be maybe. They can bring a bit of insight into a text that maybe you couldn't if you were reading it. We all think and if there's anybody who is who thinks that they're like me and this disagrees you can take it up with me because I won't I mean I don't know if I'll ever believe you. I think you're lying who doesn't think that like hard science intelligence people with that are like smarter than they are and so the fact that he was. This you know consonant indoor theater kid but also kind of a jock a little bit and then also a scientist a real smart person come on that's literally like creating himself as like the the the ideal version of the like late American male that synthesizes everything that came before like the dialectical embodiment of the late American white male. Like that's what he was and that math Matt. But the thing is what I'm saying. But the joke of that is that he wasn't actually very good at mathematics. According to actual mathematicians and I have no way of judging what they say the people who are smart in math say no his math math was terrible and then like all of his books on hard math are riddled with errors of like that are very basic and I just like that's another thing like the panic shooting. I don't know if that's true and I never will because I don't know how to count I can't count on my think you need my fingers to count not kidding like I literally got officer. No I won't say that but I'm basically can't do math like beyond. What's asked of my fingers. So I have no idea if you know what he was talking about the people who know what they're talking about say he does didn't know what he was like but anyway that's why he was like he was. The he was the full spectrum. He was the embodied man you know. He was the man in full hilariously like it's kind of funny that that Tom Wolfe wrote a book in that exact same time period that spouts the same phenomenon that he called a man in full. But because of course he was writing it from the perspective of the boomers. It didn't capture it because you know he couldn't translate the moment but you could have called him that like a biography of him could have been combat incentive whatever the hell. The name of that biography of him in it have become like a ghost story is a love story or wherever the people were talking smack about me and the Tom Pynchon subreddit what what because I read it because I read against the day.

[11:35](https://youtu.be/dmDgVlKrpQQ?t=11m35s)

I only said good things about pension. I don't understand why they do that' me and I have not claimed a knowledge about pension that does above my station which is I'm sure what they really get mad about does anybody reference. A pension doesn't understand that the level they do which of course you know that's up for them to decide. I would never make that claim. But I don't know so. I never said anything bad about pension and I was and I read a part of against the day which is like an under read pension. Book. I kind of think that I think is really good and like just a good piece of writing well. What well. That's what did I how did I offend the pension people or if someone would ask me. I'm just curious. They don't really care they're sucking the same you know it's basically like why is that why are the MLS mantenere where the them suck my dick. That's my answer you can read. You can read pension and you can watch.

This is reading gravity's rainbow right now instead of watching me. The answer is zero and that's true even though there's a goddamn cheeto in the white house. They don't like how I get twisted well. I mean some people can't handle the twist of us I think John Collins. My friend John Collins is a person I trust most to tell me what picture me and see seems like he lives it and incorporate on Twitter. Of course into those are my and Flores and yeah those guys are my constantly areas on kitchen. Oh no not the not the fash not the pipeline guys yeah why haven't you talked enough about the the chapo to the chapo to Pynchon pipeline because that's got to be a thing right. At least one person has felt like they were required I know I know I literally being on the show. The only reason I've ever read June I know dune is not as good as they think by pinching by a million years. But it's almost as hard to read as pinching is because of how like just clunky and poorly put together. It is his prose but I've read the up about like do can't rabies in the sleeper being awakened. I'm like alright. This is what the book don't like the first one I'm not gonna read the rest I'll just go to Wikipedia summaries from that one throws so sloggy. But what I'm saying is literally just being on. The show made me read that awful book so I got I believe at least one person is read pension because they've listened to the show which means that there is a if someone would say that if I could get one person to say yeah I I wanted to get a reference or something or some mid recommendation. So I rent a pension book.

If someone says that and they could like even if you just have like a screenshot of a pension book that would be more of a real real pipeline than the chapo to fash pipeline which these people imagine exists and have never existed shown example. I don't want. I don't know dig this back up again because I mean obviously this was not a close contest. This is a destruction that no need to be ungentlemanly about it. But it is funny that if I had to I would it would have an eat I would have an easier time making a empirical argument for the existence of a chap. There's certainly a chapel to Doon pipeline. But that's sort of obvious and easy because like I said you can just read the Wikipedia pages how you guys doing all right. This is an interesting one go back in time and kill any one person who would they be. I mean you can't just say who obviously because you have to say. When I mean we just talked about assassin 33 for that very reason killing Hitler or killing baby Jesus is way different than killing Jesus on the cross. It's way different than killing Jesus in the garden so the question is when and who it's hard to imagine any one person affecting anything enough to be landfill.

So it has to matter to you like not in the lingerie right because the fact is it's like if you go by the lingerie. Nobody is individual preference for anyone out come over and others should be privileged to test how could it stack up in the weight of time. It has to be privileged by its present situation by the acuteness of it as a sensation right. Like that's it you know that's an that's a that's a utilitarian observation that can't be denied I mean I understand that you could have like a religious disinclination to believe that you know if you believe them ancestor worship or whatever. But the reality is is that present feelings emotions are more real to us than both abstracted away from us in person and in time so I don't know I can't talk about so it would have to be well. Basically this is my way of saying would have to be somebody in my very near timeline because I'm the launch could you really ask in the long stretch if you really pull to act pullback and exactly this moment in history.

The way that we most of us who aren't like very specific historians of specific moments the way we regard history but the same sweep the way that we view like say something the way what we freight with lists. The words the Ottoman Empire where the Roman Empire for that matter how much time that word that that that phrase in our head what that means the amount of time in space. The amount of human lives that that encompasses and then in that mental nugget imagine. We're in that same nugget for someone else thinking about like you know who stopped Hitler from taking power or didn't stop Hitler or Battle of Tours or only Hitler has been killed wherever the like any of it would matter in the long scheme. No because those things are determined by forces beyond any of our individual reckoning. The longer a periods are in our mind you create pyramids out of chaos. Longer a is the only reality or the only thing close.

It's the white whale. It's it's its recognition of the other. That's it. That's the only reality. That's the only real thing that's the thing that haunts all of our moments on earth and that's what's represented by Pacific Ocean by Moby Dick by Judge Holden. It's the recognition of the other. It's the only real thing everything else is just intellectualizing around that this building sediment around it oh boy how you guys doing see what's going on. I don't know if I'm being very helpful today oh man. These questions are so interesting because they go from such a like you know questions of essential nature and like like questions that ask you deeply to the record with who you are and then. Oh boy. There's a goddamn cheeto in the White House. How are you supposed to deal with that why there were so many serial killers why would their serial killers from the 1980 or the 1890s. Why are there serial code is a victorian-era hinge points where the that's where the the hinges start moving things start rubbing against each other. It's things to pop it off like it's accumulated calcium rust.

See people assuming trump's gonna win hilarious to me he could absolutely loose. In fact this Mike I would put money on they're losing. I mean I wouldn't put a lot of money on it and I probably wouldn't get very good ads. But I put money on they're losing. I don't know maybe I get good on spending on how convinced people are that because of how obviously terrible Biden is the Trump must get reelected. It's like I mean if this hadn't happened and we were still cruising and like you know the Fed was still weekend Bernie using the American economy across the finish line which you would want to do you know it's. It's like having Trump as president. It doesn't really see any why change horses in midstream for the point of view of capital that means that all the like the right level ders have been held and like you don't have to worry that they're gonna pull the rug out from every year. The way that the Fed did against poor Richard Nixon in 1960 well the I mean you could say like the proximate reason Nixon lost in 60 is because the Fed refused to do short term interest rate to stop the 1958 of 50 58 59 recession and he always like that was one of the other one of the Eastern establishments that conspired against him. It was with their boy with a pretty boy JFK and that's why he was so free when he was in office to do whatever it took to gold standard for once at all and and the Bretton Woods system and float the currency but anyway what I'm saying is that those same Fed forces that that that has been keeping things going may be fine with Trump being president and so you know the Joe Biden we have sex predator a senile monster mama living mummy corrupt Dracula.

He would lose but this is an unprecedented situation and if people blame this bleach into their bodies. It's like you can say whatever you want about what he actually said you can say whatever you want about the media and how they are out to get him which is true. But I'm sorry you watch the video of that and that is what's his indictment. And I think that's one of the reasons and this actually punched. I don't agree with Paul Krugman that this is the moment people turn our shop. He's an idiot but what I think because what his followers think of him is I think beyond the can of anybody in New York and like presuming to say anything is fraudulent. But what they could say I think because they're there they're easy they can understand Trump like a lot of these East Coast people. I think the reason that they up and talking about Trump and understanding Trump is because they second-guess themselves because they get Trump because they he's one of them but then the fact that he has all these regular Americans who they don't understand and are scared of. But on his side it makes them second-guess themselves and then they start like both. I don't know I don't know is. He really what do you think no he is.

It's just because of this. Velveeta you know it's if that's it you don't have to like try to send guess yourself but anyway what that means is. That is that you could see in his face when he goes out there and says yeah put inject. The chlorine put the bleach under your skin and then has to come out and say no I was kidding. Now. He's now they're saying he's gonna not do. The he was loving those things every day getting the bebop and scat that's his whole milieu that's the only thing he likes about being president if the cameras on him and riffing everything else sucks. He hates being meetings and signing hates but having the cameras on and him talking in front of especially the crowd groups lick lapping it all up. He loves that and in the room he can't do that anymore he can't get like he can't get the crowds to give him back his mana. So it's just this roomful of East Coast. You know rootless Cosmopolitan's just giving him the old giving him the same Shaun decide they would have given him a you know across the table across the world across the floor at Sardis or whatever the Hells Angel showed up but anyway this is all a way to say people might start blaming him for this. If it's only response is drink bleach then people are gonna be like even the mum raw man. Even the go on TV for four hours a day and say maybe drink bleach.

So that's why I say anybody says Trump's gonna win. I think they're they've kind of allowed him to signa ties them a little bit. But I mean it doesn't mean they're gonna lose either the people who out obviously that we assume I'm saying going. The other way is also incorrect. How can you say this election is gonna happen if it's gonna happen. It's beyond my confidence. I'm not gonna give money on whether the election happens let alone either way who would win I will ready or reiterate somebody asking about Jesse Ventura. I'm gonna reiterate a little bit on the Misti Ventura and then I'll talk about the Kinze Jesse Ventura. Presidential election doesn't matter he is methadone. I said this on the AC eighty the assassin 33 episode. But I think we cut it. So I want to say it here then and maybe I'll say it on the next episode of mine because I really want to get this across. It's like yeah. I was saying sure you know vote for Jesse Ventura. People freaked out.

They're like well. He's not a socialist and if you're gonna go through party well how Hallie Hawkins is a real trade. Unionist. Florio relieved as part of a party you know so socialism liberation connected to you know real Marxist lenders. It's like stop it that is the boot. That's the nonsense talk of and crank idiocy. That's the that's the organ grinders we monkey wheel of electoral politics. It gets all of the that's all the most earnest minded cranks to get along with it. If you've got ignore that sound like you have to be willing to not dance when the tune is played then clout on people. That's hard because you want to move your hips so you want to get down.

There. The Bernie was a possibility. Everyone was in the pit they were going nuts because there's we're gonna do about this. Because these elections aren't gonna have anything to do with it. It's all gonna be us so maybe don't give a about this at all. This is literally the stretch so if you are going to have to like take some of that manna you were putting into the presidential election. You can't just turn it off. That's that's blue balls.

[28:10](https://youtu.be/dmDgVlKrpQQ?t=28m10s)

They have to be able to manage that declension you have to be able to manage the osmosis trance to just the trance to pure energy level transfer of that and if you want to do that a vessel to hold your excess or go and energy. There could be Jesse Ventura because he's cool he's a pimp. He was actually a kind of effective governor of the state of Minnesota. He got a light rail through the Twin Cities which is way more than a gym. Doyle could say in Wisconsin that guy was the get what light rail through. In two terms. He and what I think matters. Most is that like one of the reasons Bernie was a vehicle was because it was. He was here with some media identity and you need to get people through their understanding of themselves in the world and I'm sorry. It's the media. We don't. Want that to be the case but it is the case we have to acknowledge the reality of media and so that means we have this phenomenon that we can deal with. It's like that's why off third party. Like well glory reliever Howard Hawkins. Like no these pick this is just for you. This is not this is for you.

This is not for them. It has to be for them and Bernie was for them and Jesse Ventura hypothetically not in this world. But in another world tastes a little different Jesse Ventura could be absolutely justly power Schwarzenegger could have been if the stupid Constitution had been written differently don't you think Donald Trump beat Schwarzenegger. He maybe beats him in a primary but seriously Schwarzenegger could have run as a Democrat in 2016 and I'm elated Trump you would have won nomination and he would have destroyed does anyone want to doubt any of that anyone. I mean I know counterfactuals are stupid but come on. If Schwartz Schwarzenegger changes legislation changes to Democrat runs against Hillary runs in the general destroys it and what I'm saying it's like that didn't happen and there's a lot of reasons that it not just the Constitution that that didn't happen and but things a little differently back adapt things a little differently Jessica tree could happen acting like any of this. It's outside of reality is silly at this point but like I said this is just a fun brain thing to do to give yourself something to do that used to be concentrating on the presidential election. It's not like you were trying to to make a baby there like a little loool. I don't know whatever you wanted to call it.

We haven't found the name for yet maybe a little social so social democracy baby but other people are like actually no foolish sock tab in the inside. This social democracy baby you think you're incubating is actually a workers were a working class baby who's going to from the inners of insufficient social democracy well first forth this new class mobilization baby and that will create communist whatever you thought you weren't gonna create something out of that. This is sterile this is nothing into a sock and that's fine sometimes you gotta nun to a sock but that's it you're jacking off and that's what we should recognize all electoral posts. Bernie politics paths and specifically whether or not you want to say for mean purposes and there's a blow off of steam that Jesse Ventura's epic and root for him because one those things are not in not non significant factors politics. I think you can't acknowledge.

Not you could not deny now that those things have real power. Whatever material reality is generating them and determines them they have at like the the point at the at the point of like determining narrow outcomes. They absolutely evangelist so like as a weight and and as a way to think about power as a way to think about the media and its relationship to politics the way it relates to yeah like the difference between a performer and a politician like understanding that difference and like utilizing different facets of celebrity for different political ends. All of those things can be interrogated through the veg. Steven sure for president concept which is why as a place for your excess enthusiasm as I guess they used to say in the 19th century have a little fun with Jesse I will be I have to do more than most because this is literally my job as absurd and ridiculous and short-lived as that might be before anyone thinks that means oh you're saying the chapo is going way.

It's like I mean who knows what's not going away. It's not about the show. It's about how like it only exists in a certain economic context that might not exist in the near future but either way that could be good like what if it is more war communism. You know what if we do get like a yep I mean I literally I'm disabled that's funny like I never pulled the card and it's not on my bio and I hate that politics of it. But I literally I'm disabled if anyone has met me. They know that I'm not physically able so. I'm not gonna be able to you know hose many. Has many acres of potatoes as maybe somebody else. But whatever you need me to do. I would do and I'd be happy to do it. If anyone had me it wanted to do anything that a so tonight physical ability I would do it. I do not demand to be anime appraiser. I swear to God and not the man be anime appraiser. I will do some actual physical labor Lutie pushing duty pencils.

[34:02](https://youtu.be/dmDgVlKrpQQ?t=34m02s)

That's an article Hagen. But I think I absolutely answered this question about my favorite Ottoman Ottoman Sultan before but I'll do it again Celine the Grimm I feel like he gets widely underrated. Considering he doubled the size of this. He doubled the size the Ottoman Empire in an eight-year period. That's I mean come on that's amazing and it was consolidated - it's not like with Trajan. Like yeah. Trajan took the Roman Empire to its final ascent but they started trimming that immediately I mean Hadrian's Wall was put up after Trajan conquered Caledonia to be like all right yeah but we know realistically where our rip. Though same thing with the Middle East that didn't happen he held it. He held North Africa until the mama loose rebelled. Like centuries. Later he held he helped the Caucasus for a while so yeah I gotta give it to Selene the Grimm even though not a lot of fun parties didn't last very long got owned by his kids. Very politically this is an interesting question.

Somebody says was Charles Bronson the last the best actor to get pigeonholed in reactionary action of one. It's a good question because I'm trying to think of other people who fit that description who else is like a reactionary movie star Charles Bronson definitely John Wayne yeah who else are there any other like Clint Eastwood I think yeah not like more thoughtfully obviously like he is like like Eastwood is clearly like a more progressive configure than Johnny Johnny. Johnny. John Wayne was well in every sense like I mean John Wayne was a it was a very hypocritical decency monger and Eastwood was much more of a like California guy like a swinging sixties dude ask Sondra Locke. She'll tell you where she couldn't before she died but anyway. But he was the same is the same values we just modified given like the dissolution of the social mores that had held under Wayne like recognizing the difference in culture but who else who else and then Bronson is sort of like the like. The caveman version family Bronson is the unreconstructed chunk like if Eastwood is the alright.

This is interesting because they emerged on the same time as like stars seventies eighties death. Wish and Dirty Harry and Dirty Harry is the civilized Eastwood. It's er I mean Wayne. It's John Wayne's Americans civilized and a sin that that John Wayne's America Americans synthesizing modernity like that's what that's what that's what Eastwood was. That's what Dirty Harry was. Bronson. Kersey was the was that slug was the reactionary slug the XS that had to get jettisoned to create Eastwood so that's what the Deathwish movies were and and then and and and of course. I mean then that follows too because Dirty Harry is a natural police officer and he never actually does anything in the movies. It's illegal. He's tough and of course like liberals and like tourney's and the elite types might say what he's doing is wrong. But he doesn't break the law unless he very actually has to it always in the service of greater good. Bronson is explicitly a vigilante who is not a cop does not abide by laws murders people with impunity like a guy who would a guy who was the villain in a Dirty Harry movie. The bad guys in I believe it's Magnum force are cops Tim Matheson a young Tim Matheson buzz' ringleader who are killing bad guys. Secretly. They murdered evil pimp and a pornographers and some oh and Dirty Harry kills them all. He's like he's putting it back in the container you know.

It's like these are. These are the restraints that we need for a for a stable masculinity that can still persist at the top of the economic like that's totally accepted because we're not challenging that this is all about a cultural reconfiguration power will still be distributed as it always has money will still be distributed as always have excess surplus but in the most blunt terms surplus will be distributed as it always has so that's all taken care of the question is where do we fit on the on the stagecoach like where are we on the stagecoach and you know John Wayne. He's got to be. He's got to be in shotgun. You that's the only spot for him women women and like drunk Indians in the cap in in the actual stagecoach I'm up here with Chaka. East looks like maybe on the back. Maybe give the girl a gun that's funny. She's in bloomers and she's got a double-barrel.

[39:49](https://youtu.be/dmDgVlKrpQQ?t=39m49s)

Lie got made well corncob pipe so it's not about like where you can like feel comfortable on the cart as it continues you know exploiting and export rating it and hyper exploiting and creating surpluses that are turned into these cultural curios and artifacts that you can value more or less based on your individual tastes which are of course all determined by the culture that produces them blah blah and so the synthesis that's like the the police state. Harbinger. Bye-bye Dirty Harry comes into being the the kharsa real-estate means we know as now the tough-on-crime war on war on drugs. American police state and cars real estate to go along with it because you're arresting these people. What could I be doing to you like that's the real thing. It's like yes we're still keeping the lines of property and we're still enforcing them arbitrarily to the benefit of accumulated just heredity basically dressed up with different words but heredity total just something that is clearly wrong that cries out for for redress in the heart of any like a human being so it has to be command which is what culture is there to help do so yeah so that creates Harry Callahan and we civilize masculine dominance but that leaves the excess and that's Bernie Goetz and that's John Kersey and that's Charles Bronson.

He is the castoffs lug unreconstructed neanderthal white male masculinity that must be discarded if one is to create a synthesis. Now the problem is there's so much other. Mcdeere's that that deal didn't work out as smoothly as anybody on any part of it thought it would and that means that all of the debt Judas does throw off the run off the stuff that's you know endemic to any kind of mechanism. I mean it's you know grafting. Builds up in the the pipes of a car engine saying what carbon and things build up same thing as that so yeah Bronson. He is really the he's the last like right-wing action star because I feel like for the most part like mainstream culture. It agree that you're gonna get the benefit of a budget. That's gonna get you talked about as in our understanding high of what like constitutes like a mass culture like at the level of a Seagal or something. I think politics has been suppressed. I think like we're seeing like Trump kind of represents this excess just like cultural caught.

The these tensions owns that are unresolved that are supposed to be resolved by by the market. Honestly. They're supposed to get paid off for it's must have bribed them into being. Those brides aren't happening anymore because there's not enough money to make the payoffs because the system isn't producing them. This all started in the 70s with the state flashin crisis the energy crisis. The the the profitability crisis of capitalism has been in since that's the only way to understand the last 40 years of politics of 8-1 crisis that has been in persistence since then and in America and the short-term domestic politics sense the way that's been resolved. The crisis of centers officer short-term bubbling inflation's defense industry in the 80s tech in the 90s but when that gets disrupted there's no more you know the money's got to come from somewhere and it came from working. It came from the money that had to come from somewhere because the money in this case meaning profit. It's like either reducing profit or we're getting it else from somewhere else. Me first obvious answer was from labor and so that's what they started doing and from labor in the cultural terms means the people who are supposed to be signing off on all these cultural arrangements and the thing that makes those those trade offs acceptable is that they are comedy. They come with material races and circumstances that make those kind of cultural things matter less because you're comfortable.

Like that matters more than agree to which and you know you're in general pain. Your life is generally constrained and and defined by lack and by fear and like all negative emotions like if you didn't read what your life is like determined by those is a very which like things like that matter because it's literally all you get. It's like everything is in front of you and it's the only thing that matters you can feel more magnanimously the less the degree to which things more comfortable and so as those as that lubricant as the material lubricants went away. It's like that process of them happening like all these like oh look at every single person who like doesn't mean where they shall look at how cool guys. Back then were. They were on masculine and alpha. She went back then older bad we're saying look at. It's dialectical just if it was if you understand it is that it get Rob's a whole lot of it. Gets robbed a lot of the emotional stuff that makes it so hard honestly like that to sound I don't want to be like hey man get over it but like get dialectical and a lot of this stuff doesn't really. I don't need I just how do you even care of course.

Like yes. This is all based on the back of hyper exploitation elsewhere. It's just it was distributed among the top level more accurately and there's nothing virtuous about those things and this is the thing that needs to get understood and that people because the thing is. This is all this all this all we're talking about all this language and our understanding of third world exploitation. All those things are only consumed and metabolize by liberal subjects like people at the top of this. But then that's because you're comfortable but why I'm saying anyway. This is all about how what I mean by that is that I give the people who are on the bottom if they were on the top. They wouldn't be good by virtue of the fact that they used to be on the bottom. It would still suck they'd be a baby's bad because they'd be exploiting the fact that they were suffering would not make them exploiting good and that is a fundamental misunderstanding that undergirds like 90% of of like a surface level understanding of things like identity politics and privilege theory. It's all based on the idea that it would be better if someone who's was oppressed does an oppression. I think that's wrong and I don't agree with that and I feel like if you don't accept that as the beginning principle it can undermine your entire approach to politics. But anyway all this is just a mean is that the reason that these these things are thrown off. Your. Elliot Rogers is and your peppe's and your your little little creepy. An anti donek little toad lit a class. It's because you can't buy him off anymore because it's not you can't give like it's not because we change culturally. It's because it's no longer invite.

You literally can't have a one family household. You're gonna have two parents three kids. I mean forget that forget all that you even forget like the mid-century you know consumer aspect of it. Even if you said no I know I don't even need a lawn. I don't need all that that was really all Madison Madison Avenue's brainwashing. It was not actually part of any traditional life if you throw that away it's a I just want to be able to raise a family on an income. You can do it. It's impossible so it creates new things about that and one of them is is that actually women. It's good. It's not only is it good to work or and I mean not only know you don't have to work actually. It's great that you should work and it's empowering and it's the act not only is it empowering only place to get. Genuine work congratulations for the song because there was no more because they had to got it from labor because they couldn't get it from from the market anymore because things like the energy change the initially anyway. So it was a defense of the night that Reagan and then there was the first bomb possible. It happened before 9/11 which then coincidentally very happily for some people created a new sort of Keynesian military budget justification to do like an 80s defense build-up again on top of which you did a another speculative housing bubble and a speculative tech bubble. Both of course of course embedded in the spending created and then the network of companies and budgets and the created by the war on terror and that yeah. There you go whoo Wow I mean thing is. None of this is really brained mind blowing or anything. This is all pretty self-explanatory but it's also hard to put together man because they really don't want you to think of it all. Together. They want you to think about all those discreet little questions and then you can do have discrete good guys and bad guys and then you can have discreet personal investments and emotional attachments that can accrue to one or the other and then over time you can confuse your sympathy in a situation with some objective world stance or more. Importantly an objective like material insistence.

Not same thing Bronson was a good actor I mean come on. This is the last he was the last but anyway yeah so like a guy like Bronson now couldn't be a movie star. The guy like Bronson now would have to be you would have to be like YouTube guy or more realistic I mean realistically he wouldn't be as actor at all. He'd be a you know who's end-stage alcoholic that would be the reality of the mr. Majestic Charles Bronson if he would like the version of him. Now there was a cultural version of it. Now it would be just like as an echo of him as like a crude puppet created by his met like his slightly better off suburban failed nephews and stuff like holding up these like literally like dead like day of the dead. Giant puppets like that's the that's their that's that's the real you know like they're all there's their grandparents shirts filling up with what at the end of the day is just pure fantasy if something regurgitate that they are only building out of like. It's it's a thing they're literally making a effort. They're making an effigy of like their father's out of like the bonemeal spit out by the machine. But they are whatever that would be whatever disgusting bonemeal and spit mummy would come out of that process. It would be a YouTube guy or it would be a school shooter. Or I don't know it would be. It would it would not be. It would not have in for sure.

That's what that's what basically it would have to be unspoken. I would have to be the subaltern and then would have to be destroyed. But the thing is is that it's gonna. Keep conflict is never gonna end because source of the conflict is the increased friction. You're not gonna unless you put unless you're gonna grease up you gotta grease it up and there's no grease Spit on your hand. There's nothing and so it's just gonna keep spraying unless you under you get you literally change. The fundamental like Network problem is the way you get to do that is by organizing people who were all cast off shumphlett smade by this machine in the first place it's tough hmmm-hmmm.

It's all stuff that makes you go honestly. I love that Felix is doing and these I if you'd sold me when this all started all right. What is quarantine Felix. Gonna get into because I I know he would do relatively well you know like you could like you can tell who you know who's doing better or worse and quarantine is largely the degree to which they were doing better or worse beforehand and the worst they were doing the better. They're probably doing a quarantine and vice-versa and since you know Felix was always sort of in a crisis stage just like kind of an ionic and the needing like short-term fixations to sort of stimulate enough interest in him to keep like thinking life is like going through.

He's talked about this on the show yeah the dance between meaning and novelty and so it's always that's gonna spin on something you know I was like barstool sports or or twelve-year-old YouTube kids or whatever landing on NBC primetime shows didn't see that one coming but daddy's glad. He hasn't know that he's having a good time like for me doing these to spend my thing and it's been very helpful because I was a couple weeks in I was starting to feel the flywheels coming off it. This is like help because like I don't think I've done I literally lost track when I think of like how long I've been doing any one thing. It just feels like I've been in a tunnel. This entire time. It just feels like I'm it in a gigantic tunnel just like standing here. This entire time is I am like tiny places but I don't think I've stopped. I missed one of these in I mean I might not have put them on YouTube. But I don't think I'm just doing one for at least like half an hour at least half an hour for weeks and I hoping to do it for the rest of the quarantine time and maybe turn into something. After that.

I don't know but short term. What I want to do is put it on Twitch which I need a little bit more help with the computer ship to do but once we've got to figure it out this will be coming to twitch which will be great more interaction and stuff and it look like be easier to put on the youtubes because apparently it's kind of annoying that for Chris to get these off of here and put on YouTube I know I could be doing that but you yell at me. I'm an old man I don't understand such things you get my ear. You talk about the button and I can't download things. I don't know people like I was taught complaining about how your computer hears you say you want to see a movie or it sees you type. Hey look hey you seen that in a while and then it goes in to your streaming services and it removes them from from the queue so you'd have to purchase them or rent them. 100 percent believe that's true and I've had enough people like say some things like that happen to them MacAlister yeah. No they're doing it. You're doing that to us. The thing is there's no waste. There's no escape that's like oh no don't go on Twitch like yeah.
