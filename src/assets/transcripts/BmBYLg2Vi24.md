Slowburn is a production there. I am rock me like a hurricane. Ah the song that ended the cold war rocked me like a hurricane hello. I'm speaking from the back area. I've got a halo right now looking quite orthodox looking like a like a vision from heaven to send it onto earth to judge the wicked and the righteous. But no it's just golden time here in the backyard. It's off the bat just want to clarify something for some people after the last stream. I did with chris where we were back here batman it back and I've talked about how we want to do that on in the office with maybe some games thrown in. I won't be doing that and not doing solo streams. I will maybe I will do a few. I won't do necessarily as many but I will still try to do at least one or two a week even if we do stuff with the office and the video game rig. So don't worry if you still like me staring puzzledly into the chat with and not saying anything and kind of just staring and hearing.

Some birds. Chirp and somebody hooting and hollering and a siren and then I say something about the noid don't worry. That'll still be available. I mean. I'm obviously imagining it being wet ass party you know and the reference being the the popular song of the moment and the grand old party so just two adjectives. Someone asked if there's a dialectical resolution of the cgi practical effects problem and sadly. I don't not in the way that you're imagining not in the way that. I would that we would want I think the way it get it gets solved is people just don't that's all they expect and the context becomes one where everything is like that and so good and bad are contained within the concept of digital. So it'll be beside to the point so that's the way it's going to resolve like the way of keeping them both vital impossible because of the money like even having real guns. Somebody told me after.

I was talking about squibs that it's almost impossible to have actual firearms on movie sets anymore like the reason that they just have them pretend to have recoil and then put in the flashes and the sounds later is that those aren't real guns the rubber guns because the insurance and the price of having a guy on set who can secure the firearm are are prohibitive prohibited from the point of view of making the movie profitable which is of course the only consideration and with that being the case it'll never make economic sense to have real guns on the set. There's no aesthetic argument. You can make that can over turn the basic math. So I'm afraid it shan't be happening as much as we'd like to imagine it. I mean what do you mean you mean like oh you know. After a while. They just started cging the guns entirely and now. I really want those movies where they have the rubber gun. Oh. Those are the really good ones yeah when they're having the rubber gun and pretending to to to have recoil that's so much better than the cgi guns that fake recoil themselves. You can tell and that becomes the the remnant of the practical effects culture.

Apparently there was a shooting at the white house. I'm honestly stunned. That's the first time this has happened just because of how high the temperature is politically in the last four years. People took a shot at bill clinton. Like every two weeks there was a guy. I remember a video of it. There was this guy who showed up with a or maybe. I'm imagining the trench coat. But it was definitely a semi-auto and he just raked the side of the white house while running back and forth before he got tackled and that was only one of like two or three and then there was a guy who landed an airplane on the white house lawn during that during his presidency it's weird.

Now that everything is so much more intense and political politics is so much more polarized and and you know has an edge of conflict to it and so much more dominant in people's day-to-day lives and self-conceptions than it was. In the 90s. Very few people have tried to take a shot at trump maybe. It's because extreme like paranoid mindsets that get activated by politics would not almost by definition be activated against trump. But I can't believe that's true there's got to be some people who have who have oriented their psyche to an unhealthy degree against donald trump and yet nobody until whoever this is and we don't even know what the deal is who knows what country has the best shape. I always thought chili was sort of adorable. It's like how the hell is that a country what are you doing somebody asked how how do you understand 

How do you explain the idea that I've said a while ago and I don't even know if I would necessarily even agree with this now that I've like refined my thinking on things that consciousness your conscience is the degree that you perceive time and I would say just as a quick example of what I mean by that. I can't really elaborate because like. I said I'm not sure. I'm still working on all this stuff. But so they're like the the the matrix of reality. The universe whatever you want of it is composed of energy right. It's it's just energy. It's one substance moving at different speeds i.e it's matter and time those are the two things. It's a matter of time. It's energy transferring through states and there are objects in space. There are inanimate objects in space they do not. They experience no time. Lower orders of animals experience the present and a bit of the past and humans because of their ability to take a bunch of information. In turn it into memories and associations and patterns eventually can perceive or at least imagine. The future which allows them to move in what they imagine to be free will because they are moving towards a future that they have pictured in their head so they can perceive future as a axis of time in a way that less evolved animals can't and it is a continuum of course from human down. It's not and or so. It's degree two. That's what I mean but of course they're all the same thing. It's just objects perceive them in different ways or fail or don't perceive them.

I just watched the hidden a month or so ago. It was awesome I still don't think carl. Mclaughlin is a good actor but that movie rules and is just a smorgasbord of of practical effects and real car chases in a movie that couldn't have been more than a a couple million dollar budget. In the 80s. I did see cube and I gotta say that movie's reputation rests. It seems to me almost entirely on the scene where the guy gets chopped up by the wires because the rest of the movie has barely any cube ownage at all. It's just a bunch of people with canadian accents yelling at each other and then narrowly avoiding. Getting chopped into cubes did not enjoy under underrate over over delivered by the people who had previously praised it. So it's know the blob which I just rewatched last night because people were reminding me of the blob. I will watch the new dune movie. I'll watch the new dune movie on like a on an apple watch or whatever that intended. It's gonna be great.

 kamala just unfollowed biden. I saw that girl I need a tea someone spill it. I gotta say if they don't pick her. I will be surprised because that seems like the smart move and they're really just playing prevent defense here which is kind of surprising so I kind of still think it will be them. It will be heard just because it's the it's the what they would perceive as the lowest per like the highest percentage play in that it has the lowest per chance of having a spectacular or unintended negative consequence whereas kamala harris doesn't change anything or make anything interesting but that's in their mind enough yeah. I don't think it's going to be mayor pete. It would be hilarious because all the people who have been saying you know biden's intersectional. Biden is listening to women and he has to listen to women and all that or or he has to recognize blm and get and they have a black or a female or both vp. They will. I don't even know if they'll even be able to have one second of expressed public anger because the immediate question will be. What are you going to do about it and the answer is nothing. I'm going to do a. They've already said that I do hope. It's somebody from left field because kamala is such a boring pick.

I'm already snoozing thinking about it give me something interesting yeah. I think pete. I mean I'm assuming that pete got offered a relatively high cabinet pot spot for his What do you call it endorsement and dropping out when he was in second when he was in second place. I mean there is logic to it. It wasn't just a strong army because I think anybody with eyes could see that even though mayor pete was doing well in some sort of in in just the sense of his performance to that point that he pretty clearly had no path forward. He just did not have any support outside of upper like middle and upper class white people and that never changed. The hope was maybe a surprise. I would win could like win people over but it didn't happen. People were still stuck in with biden. So it was a you could argue that it was a rational response but he certainly wouldn't have done it for anything less than a significant offer. Maybe defense. I mean he'd have to want he'd want something in the cabinet because he knows he can't get in. He will not win another office.

In indiana. He cannot win a statewide race in indiana and at his at this point congress is sort of a congress is sort of a step down. He's not just the descendant of a grammar scholar gramsci. Scholar was his dad apparently not a very good gramsci scholar. But I have no first-hand knowledge just passing along a tea that I heard and then slit and then spilled. I slipped it then. I spilled it what would it take for a glue indiana indiana is gone folks. It's ahead.

It's gone in ohio is going to turn in indiana. It's a demographic thing like young people move out of the state leaving only a a shrinking core of older and older empty nest. White rural and suburban people and over time they're gonna get more and more republican so yeah ohio's gonna turn into indiana. I I mean even if they if we're able to pull off an election with any kind of any kind of legitimacy to it in november. And I think that is a significant if and I have no idea what that would mean and and biden wins big wins back. Florida hell wins arizona. He could win arizona I think and even georgia maybe and lose ohio. I mean there is a real thing. There is a real consequence to all the young college-educated white people who make up that like young cadre who is supposed to save the save us from our older reactionary citizens that they all move to the same cluster of blue state. Big cities is that states like ohio slowly get drained of everybody but the most recruited remainder the ones who don't move to arizona anyway. Indiana was always a republican state but I think I'm just saying ohio is in the in the direction of turning towards there because ohio used to have ohio had that rust belt upper area cleveland and such with its with its ethnic.

It's white ethnic democrats glasses versus contacts that's not a hard one. I will never wear. I've never worn contacts a day. I never got them. I never. I never got a subscription a prescription for contacts never worn contacts never had any desire to stick my finger in my eyeball.

You've got to imagine if biden does wins that people are going to take shots at him. All the time there's going to be a cue guy with a like a bunch of fire extinguishers strapped to his chest jumping on him at every public event. I do think if trump does pull something of the election around around mail-ins or something you could see an actual recessionist movement start. I don't think it would be anything like what you'd see if biden wins in terms of military brinksmanship. But I think you would see like an attempt by big state blue governors to sort of create a state within a state to establish as they call it real dual power and become co-equal to the government to the federal government if not exceeding it in authority which would then raise a specter of conflict be interesting. I would never do lasik my god laser ball laser lasering my eyeballs. No thank you party party of zero for that spicy ketchup. You're talking about. You're talking about barbecue sauce. Ketchup is ketchup. I do think it would be funny though and this is a real possibility trump.

Just steals the thing the way everyone sees him setting out to do and people just go no and like the entire media freaks out right because it's mostly anti-trump and pro norms. The entire media goes nuts half the country freaks out and then everyone is waiting for someone else to do something and he just does it and nothing and it's like well. I mean no one actually everyone said it was awful but nobody made any kind of coherent movement to stop it and so it just happened wow that's crazy someone's asking about the taiping rebellion. A fascinating event something like 30 million people die in the 1860s in china basically because a guy failed the sats and freaked out a guy who wanted to who was going to be who wanted to be a a mandarin to be to be a bureaucrat in the in the manchu state which was basically the only way that you could get out of the peasant class. One of the very few anyway was to take this series of rigorous exams which basically involved memorizing confucian texts and then repeating them he failed it. He failed it a bunch of times and then he failed it.

One more one too many times and he had a complete breakdown and he was in a bed for months of the fever and hallucinations and at the end of it he announced that he was jesus christ's younger chinese brother and that it was his duty to unify china under his rule to create a heavenly kingdom on earth and he set about organizing the landless hakka peasantry of southern china which are people who had historically lived in the northern part of china but been driven south over the years. By mostly the conflict with the step tribes over the successive centuries and become a sort of a permanent a rural a rural proletariat. The closest thing you could call one anyway in southern china and he was able to organize him around his weird syncretic christianity but also along the axis of expelling of of redistributing land to the peasants and expelling the the the manchu king rulers because the king dynasty was not ethnically han. The king dynasty had been one of those step tribes in manchuria that had actually been invited into china to help keep the I think the ming empire from falling and then over the course of their intervention.

They just took over because they were the stronger party and they were the ones who instilled the the long the cue the hair is mandatory for men and you know and and discriminated against especially in government against against tan to some degree and those those motivations worked and they ended up creating this gigantic peasant army that established a multi-year imperium in central china and this is the around the same time that the the chinese that the empire was getting torn apart. It's it's it's was being opened up at the barrel of a cannon to foreign trade by the opium wars and they were also simultaneous outbreaks and revolts among western muslims. The yellow yeah. No that's definitely red turbine not not yellow. That was earlier and it went on for years and they conquered huge swaths of central central china and they put to flight hundreds of thousands. Man armies established to defeat them and but eventually they were able to this was something that probably in in chinese history had traditionally been a the the pattern. The traditional chinese history horrible patterns you have a empire established itself over some part of china and and have a relatively stable social relationship for hundreds of years then through a lot of times.

It's just good old-fashioned weather change climate shifts but war with or war with the step people or whatever legitimacy is or the mandate of heaven is lost and there is a popular uprising that installs a new imperial line. And this was very much in line with that and and the king was about as discredited as any regime to be but I recently read a book that makes the argument that the in the thing that allowed the king to un to persist beyond its prey natural life cycle was western intervention because there was a period where the west was watching the rebellion where they were kind of sympathetic to the taiping because like hey the guy's a christian hey and they they and the typing government had support in in halls of government by people who like saw it as a way to open up china to foreign trade and he was very and then the hong. The The heavenly king was very solicitous of western hell because he was he thought of himself as a christian but it turns out he was a little bit too loopy of a christian and what the western powers really wanted. More than anything was continuity and and stability and they figured the easiest way to get that was by backing the manchu and that helped beat back a rebellion which probably honestly by normal circumstances should have been successful in overthrowing the regime or would have in the past anyway but now china was part of a global system that allowed this exogenous force to come in and helps determine things. But of course they didn't last too much longer because first they were overthrown by sun yet zen and then the whole thing got overturned by mao and if you want to get too facile about it. You could say that that the chinese communist revolution is sort of a replaying of the taiping in that it was an attempt to organize the landless southern peasantry because the hakka peasants also formed the backbone of mao's red army that did the long march and eventually won the war organizing them along along economic along axis of land disputes and land resentment of of the fame of the landlords who who dictated the life terms of this rural proletariat but organized along a a synthetic ideology that incorporates a a western ideological intervention innovation christianity with the taiping communism marxism rather with the the chinese communist party. Was china right to wall off the internet.

I would say that that restrictions on the internet should not be considered some sort of horrifying imposition they they should be considered a necessary element of just public policy to maintain public well-being. Although I don't necessarily think that content should be the axis of of repression it should be time accessing. I would say that needs to be choked significantly that is that's that that presents a social danger that needs to be confronted and needs to be understood to be part and parcel to the maintenance and functioning of a society and it would be f and it's felt definitely like think about that like the chinese style thing where there's a ton of stuff you can't access that feels like a actual repression that feels like I'm being denied something but if you do not wall off content. But you do limit time you have functionally limited the amount of stuff you can access the amount of the internet. You can access because you're going to have less time to do so. But it doesn't feel like a as much in my opinion or it shouldn't feel as much like a a repressive in infliction on you imposition on you because there's still hypothetically all that out there to be accessed but again.

I don't know that's just off the top of my head wouldn't that allow rich people to purchase time from people and live there forever okay fine. I mean sure I mean presumably once again. None of these are proposed to be in lieu of actual socialism. So presumably we would not have like the same class of billionaire draculas that we have now. But even if you still had income inequality if somebody wants to pay to spend more time on the internet you are still creating a you're still creating a rationing system. For most people. They're not going to want to spend the time but the ones who do are going to be limited by how much money they have to do so yeah. People don't ask to see my feet anymore. I remember that used to be a big thing and I will say again that you are all lucky that. I resisted your importations because it would have been very nasty for everyone.

Wow will there be another election live stream that's a. Good question it will probably have to be in a bunker or something but yeah we'll probably do something. I will not be drinking rum that much. I know I'll be. I'll be white claws only. I have found in practice that it's essentially impossible for me to really get to turnt off white claws. If I'm drinking them at a normal pace. They metabolize almost instantly and I just get kind of a little bit of a just a little bit of a frission and nothing much beyond that. So it's like it's self-regulating. So I'll be I'll be I'll be balls deep in claws on election night to prevent a recap of the last unpleasantness. Yes people are spamming that photograph or the the meme of me looking looking quite despondent in my plastic boater. My thoughts on belarus good luck and good game. I hope I hope everyone has fun. I'm gonna do the face. I'm gonna do the sad face thoughts on leftist getting their shits together. Fitness skills mental fitness yes of course. That's all stuff you can pursue if you're not on the internet. But that's why I never tell anybody to log off completely because it's impossible. It's all about reclaiming time reclaiming percentage of your day and then having to answer the question of what to do now there's usually something just too much time. It's too easy to just not have to ask the question we should do.

We have no plans to do an avatar episode but you know what I think the next time we want to do a movie. I will suggest it because I think it would be really good because I think. I'm kind of halfway. I'm halfway to felix because I really do think jim. Cameron is a once in a a lifetime movie genius just because he is singular. There is no other director of his stature who produces the who is as involved in the production is as much of an auteur. I guess that's the thing about cameron is that when it comes to big budget directors he is the single most comprehensive author among them and of course. The card auteur theory is very problematic and even in his case it's not true. But there is still something interesting and creatively in my opinion. Creatively admirable about somebody who takes on that many tasks and performs them with that level of kind of stunning facility.

You know you can make fun of his movies. All you want but there's a basic craftsmanship and skill to even his most eye rolling endeavors that is lacking in directors who have far fewer responsibilities because like the guys you would name to go along with cameron nolan. Spielberg lucas maybe maybe maybe guillermo del toro or no not del toro peter jackson for sure not del toro maybe if he had done that maybe if he'd actually done the hobbit movie instead of running away from the project. Because there wasn't any room for tentacle monsters to jack anyone off. You must you must allow me to have the delicious tentacle creature. Jackoff wrote frodo baggins and also no it's not frodo. It's It's bilbo whatever all of the hobbits and all of the orcs and all of the beautiful dwarves must be jacked off by the tentacle creature. Michael bay is actually michael. Bay is in the list.

None of those guys write the raw material. None of those guys write their own stuff. Maybe they contribute ideas and like some dialogue. I'm sure that they're all hands on to some degree. But it's not to the degree that they get writing credits and these guys are voracious credit seekers so clearly they would not have. They didn't do that much. He writes his own movies almost by himself. He creates cameras in order to get shots that he wants It's a sing. No one else does it and so therefore you can't even compare him to anybody else. He's beyond good or evil in terms of filmmaking because he has transcended the categories by embodying like an entire mode of creativity that almost no one else could be said to equal man. That kubrick movie would have been something especially because apparently it is not as it shouldn't be wasn't a biopic. It was like. I think the it was either. I think I think it was set during. I haven't read it but I've heard it. I think it was if someone could correct me if I'm wrong it's set during the retreat from moscow. I think which perfect that's the time that's the time to get the guy in a moment that reflects an entire life and with nicholson is napoleon come on that's crazy. It's good to know that he wasn't thinking of making ryan o'neal napoleon because while ryan o'neil can get away with being a vapid playboy with no substance because that's what he was he could not have pulled off napoleon what it is his whole life. Well never mind then that's a bad idea. I'm trying to think of what if. I was going to make a napoleon movie. What.

I would want to make it about because like retreat from. Moscow makes sense but I don't think it's what I would want it to be. If. I was making it. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do retrieve from moscow. I think I would want him in ascent. I would want him in a scent or at like a moment of of of greatest power to like prefigure the the decline rather than reflect on on it. Egypt would be interesting. I think. I want something after the coup or maybe the coup itself. The coup is actually a really interesting story. You could do it as like a as like a as like a ticking clock thriller. Um. There's a movie about napoleon at saint helena. I think it's called mr n or something with ian holm. If I'm not mistaken. So there's already a exiled napoleon movie. The whiff of grave shot would be really interesting the way he negotiated his spot you could do that as like a mini tableau of his whole. His like ambition.

 ability a strategic acumen charisma ability to spot the main chance the ability to like triangulate but him like negotiating the best deal out of out of like leading the the repulsion of the of the of the re of the of the riot or whatever you want to call it the royalist rebellion ending with him just smoking the out of a bunch of them. I think that would be good too yeah. Maybe you start with him in egypt like where he's yeah okay. This is I think this is what I would want to do you start in egypt with him selling this failure of the siege of acre as a giant triumph as he like marches back into cairo in defeat. But like yeah. No this was awesome we're doing great and then he negotiates his way out at like hey guys we're coming back. It's going to be great and so you've got like the knowledge that he's not going to come back and the absurdity of it. But then also just how no one doubts it because of his magnetic charisma and then he gets back and then the ghost in the middle.

Middle of the movie could be him negotiating with like abba says and bara bara would be an amazing character in a film and then yeah ends with. Like the third act is is the coup with his like the part with his brother saving his ass. The whole thing. I think that'd be good that'd be interesting but I think if I was going to do a movie about if I was going to do a movie about amer about like 16 1700s like early modern period. I would do it about bacon's rebellion 1676 and one of the most interest one of the top reasons. I would like that somebody reminded me of a field in england and this would kind of be like a the idea would be like a I think maybe a more politically pointed american field in england because the soldiers who went to suppress bacon's rebellion which was a early cross-racial like proto-proletarian revolt among indentured servants and and like the early the early social flotsam that would turn into the american proletariat rebelling against colonial authority. Before the racial caste system had really been established where you saw like you know actual cross-racial cooperation the british soldiers who went to suppress it.

They literally got whacked out on a hallucigen. A hallucinogenic poisonous weed called gym some weed or devil's weed and I wanted to read this quote about one of the commanders about the troops. He says it was a very pleasant comedy for they turned natural fools upon it. For several days. One would blow up a feather in the air. Another would dart straws at it with much fury and another stark naked would sit up in a corner like a monkey grinning in making moes of them. I think that would be interesting but of course. The other part of it is that bacon's rebellion was also motivated by a desire to be more in conflict with the native tribes. So class is funny in america so you'd have that you'd have that part of it too of course. I think you can make a very good comedy about prince rupert of the rhine because he was a classic kind of a opera buffet just rich fauntleroy he fought he was brave but it was a classic thing where these guys the chivalry had. The concept of chivalry had so lobotomized them that they couldn't distinguish behaviors by anything other than their personal whiff of grandeur. He blew at least one battle in the english civil war because he just wouldn't stop his guys he just kept charging off the field. I have to why someone's asking about von trier I on general like I'm on balance. I like van I haven't really loved any of his movies though. I don't think. I respect the man certainly.

I haven't seen the serial killer movie yet though it's on hulu now. I think I will soon best movie streaming platform. They're all dog. It's tremendously awful perfect perfect proof that we live in as consumer for oriented society where all of the indignities we're supposed to endure are justified by the fact that they provide us with this limitless choice of dog. Man. I haven't seen repo man since I was in high school. I don't think it. I didn't it wasn't one of those movies that stuck with me. I should rewatch it though because I remember watching it out of do. I went through the phase like I'm gonna get culture. I read the books. The people said were very good and I went and saw the good movies that I could get a hold of and that was one of the like oh. This is a cult classic and I was like okay that's fine but it never really hit me. I gotta re-watch it. I I mean. I've watched walker more recently speaking of alex cox than I've seen repo man. I will admit now another deficiency someone's asking about the trailer park boys. I watched one episode and I was like okay. I didn't really watch any more of it.

I get that you gotta stick with him for a while but I just didn't feel the need. I didn't have an aching hole. I i. I've seen all the memes and in no point have I felt. I need this in my life. Just preference man just the way things are you know in the 

In the 20s. During prohibition. People who were in favor of prohibition were called dries. People were opposed to what were called wets so you could say that after after 19 after 32 the democrats were officially a wet ass party for a while. They were a dry-ass party. They became a wet ass party eventually in fact that was one of the the battle over being a wet ass party or a dry. Ass party was one of the things that led to one of the most contentious us presidential party conventions in history in new york in 1924. It was a battle between the forces of irish catholic new york governor al smith who led the wet ass party and william mcadoo who was former treasury secretary under wilson from california who led the dry ass party and the wet ass party was made up of the urban ethnic whites who made up the northern base of the democrats and the dryas party represented the rural protestant native whites who were the other half of their coalition and they went to pick a candidate in 24 and they were essentially evenly matched and it led to 109 ballots. I believe which is the most in in history and there were multiple kind of small scale riots and fist fights. Over the course of I think it was over a week. I think it was like 12 days It was a big disaster. It was like and meanwhile the republicans had a very orderly first ballot nomination of good old calvin coolidge in cleveland and just won in one of the biggest ass kickings of the modern era. But then four years later smith got the nomination because over time the the dry ass party lost its its organization and its commitment and people realized. Nobody actually is liking this prohibition anyway and they became a wet ass party again.

No I would say scandinavians scandinavians and germans for the most part. I would not call ethnic whites. Ethnic white usually refers to the last white people to show up and so you could have called germans ethnic whites. In the early 1900s benjamin franklin famously complained a ton about germans and how there were too many swarthy germans running around and where that was this even america where the hell is this place But by the time the irish and then the italians and the like central europeans and stuff showed up. They became the ethnic whites in the midwest though like german catholics kind of voted like ethnic whites and they were all vehemently opposed to prohibition thanks to the beer hall culture. But yeah al smith was a contentious choice to say the least when he was the first catholic nominated by a major party. There was famously a row of burning crosses that he that were set up for his campaign train to pass and that was in long island yeah.

The whistle stop tour was fun. They don't do that anymore you'd think it would be good for biden. He loves trains and it would be a way that they could keep them away from crowds. Safe distance just have him come into a town have the train. Just stop goes to the caboose gives a little speech in front of assembled group of reporters who are all socially distanced and then takes off again. It'd be fun more fun than this goddamn zoom. But no he's I mean thanks to covet and the fact that he's a million years old. He's he's taking the he is taking the william mckinley approach where you just stay at your house. Mckinley famously did not leave his front porch to run for president in 1886. Instead he had his minion mark hannah running around the guy who was his fixer bribing everybody from here to timbuktu in order to make sure that the bi-medalist populist freak william jennings brian didn't win. In the 19th century it was considered bad form to want to run for president and you can chalk that up to victoria silly victorian manners but I think there was something to it. I think there was even then a real recognition that if someone would want that job a job of that much pressure and that much scrutiny and more important most importantly that much power relative to the average citizen there's got to be something wrong with them. They should only want that job because they're the only one who can do it and that was that was all through the 19th century.

That was the case the people if there was a contested convention or even if there wasn't. The candidates did not appear at their conventions that was considered gauche. They sent emissaries to work the floor on their behalf and they gave the speech for they if they got if they won. They accepted the speech remotely and now we have a thing where the presidency is more high. Pressure more powerful in terms of its power over life and death. More under more scrutiny than it's ever been and now. We've decided that wanting to be president is not a disqualifying trait in a human being even though to me it would seem like the most disqualifying trait. You could imagine a person to have. I mean that was like bernie one of the one of the semiotic like like the loaded things about bernie that maybe was not really true but his life story suggested it was true is that he never wanted to be president. I remember what's his name eric alterman.

He wrote an article about bernie in 2016 when they were first running the stupid sandinista thing about how oh my god he He was at a rally where they were saying death to america just because america was illegally mining their harbor and conducting economic warfare and having drug addicted rapists attack their territory on a daily basis. They're saying death to america and alterman was not yet at the point where he can say they that he was wrong to be there you know official Liberal doctrine is still that the the the contra war was bad mostly because it was carried out by a republican so they can't say he was wrong to do it what he said was. He should it shows bad. It showed bad instincts on bernie's part that he allowed that to happen but then you think well he was the mayor of. He was the mayor of burlington vermont you know he spent the first 40 years of his life as like a partially employed bad carpenter slash political activist and then he was the mayor of burlington. Do you think he was imagining being president that kind of thing proves he wasn't and anyone who is the other way anyone whose life choices are entirely conditioned upon what will lead them up.

The ladder has a life that is a horrifying thing that we should all unjustly be revolted by and yet we act like the desire to be president is not absolutely disqualifying to the position amazing. It's because I guess you're supposed to take their their word for it that they really believe that they're the only one who can do it and I mean with bernie. You've got an argument because he's you know the only me the only like uncorrupted social democrat to try to run for the presidency in 40 years. But if it's if you're like a standard issue democrat. What the hell personal thing could you possibly have that no one else does that would make you uniquely suited for this monstrosity. This moral crime of a job stick-to-itiveness you understand that the strength of america is is the strength of americans or whatever. Horseshit foe out of here kindly foe out of here please poor donald trump like donald trump is one of those people who wanted to be president and matt proves him as evil. But of course he only wanted to be elected president. He just wanted to be elected and then he had to do it and it proved not fun like everything else.

He's ever done oops well. The thing about napoleon is he actually was as talented as he thought he was or near to it. Obviously he was not quite as talented as he thought he was or he would not have done what he did there. At the end and along the way too. He had a number of fuck-ups but he was much closer in his estimation of himself than anybody. Any of these people could possibly be now and partially is because what did napoleon do at every step. He assumed his own ability to do something and then it did it. He assumed yeah. I can lead an army into italy and just route. The did it yeah. I could take over. I could go. I mean egypt was not a success but he was not personally defeated at any point beyond being able to stop the to to successfully seize acre. He's still got a hell of a lot closer than anybody else and you know. Eventually. He reached the level of his incompetence when he got started to get owned and it was to his detriment that he didn't recognize that in time but the average career path of a politician with a napoleonic fixation on their own ambition. What you got elected a dog catcher on a platform of fiscal responsibility and then what you you took some money from your father-in-law to run for house in a district that's shaped like it was made by somebody having a stroke and then what you got appointed to a senate seat by the governor or something because you saved him from choking on a chicken bone and a party fundraiser and you're going to act like you're. Napoleon marching across the alps kindly foe kindly foe because none of these guys have anything. None of these guys have ever done anything but worm their way through the political bureaucracy exactly if the level of if the peter principle gets you to be lord paramount of all of europe. You.

 you you're up there so yeah. I would not in mind. I would not have my mind the ambitions of someone who had their ambitions tested because if you fail well we don't have to hear from you ever again yeah. Everyone thinks they're napoleon and at best they're napoleon iii and that and still most of them could not pass that bar by a significant margin all right guys. I'm peace out. I'll talk soon bye.
