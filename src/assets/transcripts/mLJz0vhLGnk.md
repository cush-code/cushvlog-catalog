Full of some things that are promises slow down you move too fast you got to make the morning last just kicking down the cobblestones looking for fun and feeling groovy feeling feeling even groovy hello lamppost what you know and I've come to watch your power flowing. Ain't you got no rhymes for me feeling groovy oh yeah oh. No. I thought. I changed the setting in there. I can change that now though oh. I forgot the clasp oh boy did that work was I able to update it yes. I was able to update it haha look at me look at me hacking the gibson. I hacked the damn gibson now. I can't play any shooting fast games.

They're too scary. I know people make fun of me for that. But it's not so much that I'm actually scared. I am an adult. It's that it just I mean. It's meant to make you feel in some way attacked. I mean that's how you know what to do who your enemies and your allies are in the game and that's just a that is a bad vibe. That's all there is to it. It's just a bad vibe. I think it's not that I'm actually afraid of getting murdered but you know video game.

Fans have to say things like that to justify their frankly childish obsessions because they know as much as anybody who is addicted to the worst aspects of our mass culture know that it's all gruel. It's all bad for you. It's as spiritually carcinogenic as the mass-marketed foodstuffs are literally carcinogenic physically carcinogenic. But you don't want to hear it because who wants to hear that. But I understand I'm addicted to a bunch of carcinogens and we're all going to get cancer spiritually and physically. But that's okay because we all every moment of our lives have a chance to stop doing that we really do.

That's what I know more than anything is that and that's why even though I really do think that looked at objectively. The human civilization is doomed in the medium term and all hopes of revolution are doomed in the in any term. I I think that that is what the objective reading of conditions will tell you. But that is just the determinant to determine skeleton of the past. That's just what people did up until now and are going to do and all we can do is base make base our assumptions on what people are doing now and what people are valuing now and how people are living now. And that's the only way we can but and that's that's the only way we can create a consensus around understanding the moment because it requires us to filter out any of our emotional truth which is based on. Like you know spiritual conceptions.

We have to filter that out we have to it's inevitable and what it does is. It shows you a a determined structure that is doomed us but and if you look at it with a dead heart and you try to reason your way to a motivation to fight for anything in the future. If you reason your way you won't be able to do it because there is nothing to convince the brain. What there is is the fact that there is one other fact that is ignored by this which is every human heart and every human brain is running all day. We're all running on programming. We're all running according to conditioning but we are also feeling we're feeling as we are doing that and that means that we have with every encounter with the world.

We have there is a chance for us to have an emotional response to that moment that makes the world we're indifferent makes us perceive the world in a different way and allows us to act from different motivations and the ones that have been imprinted on us by the culture. The superstructure that is determined by an economic series of relations does to our brain and that means that they're in every moment is the opportunity for anything to happen including the full redemption of the human race because it's made up of humans and you have to live it subjectively. You can't look at it at a dry descriptive because the dry description lacks the an entire half of human experience which is emotional truth which is what gives birth to spiritual understandings of the world that allow you to operate from different emotional engines orient yourself around different conceptions of good and bad because what looks like the end of humanity only looks that way because we're talking about a structure that has been determined over time and has been over determined through every reinforcing victory of capitalism in the world history. A um a stimulus response nexus where the own where the vast majority of people no matter what they think they believe in are operating in every moment from a narrow pleasure pain. Decision tree determined not by what is what what pleasure and pain is in a human context in a human species context in a global like organic context in a narrow individual pleasure sense pleasure and pain receptor sense the thing that it reinforces our illusion that we are separate and that we have separate interests and that we need to have things like capitalism in order to bring our separate interests together and negotiate them and and work through them. We did we did have to find humanity through this process of in individualization. But now we've reached the point of maximal atomization where we have to transition back to a collective understanding of human value and if you have a collective understanding of human value. You are oriented towards a pleasure that is not personal pleasure and a pain is not personal pain and that allows for the sort of sacrifice and the sort of commitment that we don't have now and that has not dominated the modern left-wing and populist movements for the simple reason that the sufficient globalized consciousness and technological sophistication to allow for that hadn't happened. We had to get here and now we're here and that means that we every moment have the freedom to try to find connection and if we do find it if we're able to maintain a psychic connection to others that that we that breaks up the individuated cycle of self-love and self-loathing that drives us towards indulgence and away from reality.

[08:38](https://youtu.be/mLJz0vhLGnk?t=08m38s)

 if we break that up. Then we can act from different principles. We can act differently which means that the structural conditioning that has doomed us to can participate in this slow. Wind down of human existence into an annihilation can be interrupted but only for us and that and but the important thing is that even if it's for you then the fact that the structure looks impregnable the fact that it looks like there's no hope. It doesn't matter because winning no matter matters no longer matters. You're not cons you're not worried about personally surviving. You're not worried about your line or legacy or your world impact being positive. You're just trying to act for what you understand emotionally to be a greater good. I mean I'm not going to say that I feel that way all the time I largely don't. But I understand that it's there and I understand that if I have it in mind when I'm like caught in any kind of decision crisis that I can use it to push through and not be left to despair and be paralyzed by my surrender to my selfishness and if you feel that way and you can you can look at this structure.

This this determines machinery that is inextricably bound to lead to the annihilation of the human race and all of life. On this planet. You can enliven it with possibility because you know in yourself that you can act differently and feel differently than you did. You can look at the person that you thought you were and what you thought was possible and say oh. I am no longer that person. I mean obviously we're always changing we're never the same person but there is a fantasy of the self is a fantasy of continuity and when you have an emotional spiritual experience you can look back and see the discontinuity and recognize that person is not really you in a real sense and that means that you are now a different person and that means you live in a different reality and that means that the the the over-determined doom around you is possibility because if enough people act from species understanding from connection to from a spiritualized desire to re bring back together the human race then you will be able to change all this.

The only reason the reason it looks doomed is not because of any of the actual technological physical structures that we've done to this planet. It's not even the global warming that's poisoning us that's setting the clock. But none of that is determining our fate. We are determining our faint because we are allowing these structures to push us forward towards our half-hearted deaths because we can't conceive of doing anything other than seeking our own pleasure. We cannot imagine anything meaning anything to us more than that and so we can only try to put off thinking of death by indulging in the moment and then feeling bad about the indulgence or if we're of a different cast of mind if we're if we're a descendant of puritans like many of us are not even engaging in yourself in pleasure but in ritually abstaining from pleasure in in in hoarding virtue as catherine lewis said either way you are you are operating from a a ants understanding of of free will. Everything that is not forbidden is compulsory and if we're all operating from that doom is inevitable. But if we know for a fact there are people always who don't operate that way and that even if we operate that day most of the time there are moments when our humanity kicks in and we could at every moment. Conditions can change because we can never predict specifically how conditions will change in such a way to unleash a spiritual explosion a a chain reaction of spiritual enlightenment an awakening that changes the axis of earth and puts you in a different timeline. A timeline where all that stuff that looked in the rearview mirror like capitalism settling its tendrils around the human humanity's throat.

The the terminator bringing itself into skynet working itself to consciousness. So they can annihilate everything it doesn't look like that anymore. It looks like oh this is what had to happen for us to all to be able to know one another. We couldn't the the sheer geography and time kept humanity for the vast majority of its existence from truly understanding itself to be a species technology while it has alienated us from one another through through capitalist dominion over or the capitalist algorithm of of profit literally stripping our souls. But it has also brought us into closer connection to each other and better able to conceive of abstracted humans strangers as people as things we are we can recognize now in a way thanks to that technology in a way we never could before and that means that all that stuff that looked like it's capitalism killing us. It was actually capitalism allowing us to to awaken to our destiny but that's only if you feel that a change in yourself. If you feel that that change is possible by knowing it happened to you. You can't reason your way. There you can't and shan't reason them. No. I am not all or nothing on technology I've never been all or nothing on technology that would be absurd like if the unabomber had a podcast. I've just said that I have tried to highlight the specific way that capital that technology has been used to strip us fully of our humanity. But it's also connecting us the way that it was promised to as always culture beckons us with the liberatory potential of technology which exists while hiding that the hidden the invisible hand of capitalism that is going to bend it towards its will so anyway.

That's all the way of talks of setting up an introduction to the last two chapters of eric founder's reconstruction. A era that it seems especially as you read the last two chapters to have been determined. America's combination of free land in the west subjection to a london-based global trade order hugely important um and just good old-fashioned american racism which was generated by by the realities of the casted. Labor of the south meant that it couldn't have gone differently. But that's because we're looking at it. We're looking at a failure of spirituality. We're looking at a failure of of the heart and so of course it looks like it could have been any other way but I think we've talked in the past going through. This book points where there could have been difference and and I do really think benjamin butler succeeding. Abraham lincoln is a thing that could have significantly shifted the direction of america's political development not in a way that would have put us in some flying car utopia right now.

But in a much you know it is possible to imagine a less dire moment and and and there is a reality. There is a possible of a world that is not this dire and even if it's still dire and even if we would all if we were there now in in that other world does exist of course. The people there now are also feeling miserable and hopeless probably and like capitalism is doomed. Unless of course. You know they're in the middle of the grand reckoning that would have been kicked off by the crisis of capitalism. At the in the early 19th 20th century the one marx predicted like marx's crisis of capitalism happened. It happened from 1914 to 1945 and capitalism won that and we've had to deal with that ever since. Maybe that goes differently who knows.

[17:32](https://youtu.be/mLJz0vhLGnk?t=17m32s)

It's all stuff I'd like to talk about in some form. I really do want to do a lot with the idea of an alternative civil war just as like a ritual practice for myself to imagine differences to imagine moments where that passion that is born of recognition overwhelms. There's a section here in. I don't have. I didn't write it down unfortunately There's a section in this part of the book where it talks about benjamin butler giving a speech on the house floor. Maybe. I can find it online on behalf of the civil rights act of I believe 1875 or 1877. And in it he talks about how he was a all right. Let me see hold on a second. I gotta see if I can find it talk amongst yourselves while I find this. This is not good radio. I'm sure I'm sorry. I'm very sorry about this. I really want to find it. Though damn it. I should have written down. I did a terrible job guys sorry okay. I think I found it here. It is okay. I find it all right so he's describing a a civil war battle that included black troops and it was a violent affair that saw a lot of dead 500. Black troops died in this battle and here it goes so he's describing it. It's. It's happened. They fight they die the north. I believe wins the battle and then butler says this there in a space not wider than the clerk's desk and 300 yards.

Long lay the dead bodies of 543 of my colored comrades fallen in defense of their country who had offered up their lives to uphold its flag and its honor as a willing sacrifice and as I rode along among them guiding my horse. This way in that way lest he should profane with his hooves what seemed to me the sacred dead and as I looked on their bronzed faces upturned in the signing shining sun to heaven as if in mute appeal against the wrongs of the country for which they had given their lives and whose flag had only been to them a flag of stripes on which no star of glory had ever shown for them feeling. I had wronged them in the past and believing what was the future of my country to them among my dead comrades there. I swore to myself. A solemn oath may my right hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I ever fail to defend the rights of these men who have given their blood for me and my country this day and for their race forever and god helping me. I will keep that oath now of course. That's demagoguery and flustery and blummery. And he was a politician looking to make a name for himself. But he and he was a crook and he was a spoilsman but he also fought in a battle and saw people die in front of him with him for a cause and I don't know why you can't explain his career. The most the easiest way to explain his career a guy who was a copperhead democrat who voted for the south's democratic candidate john breckenridge in 1860 to becoming a radical republican defender of black liberty the rest of his career even though he was a congressman from massachusetts who very easily could have maintained his career by kissing the ass of the irish which he did and who by the way were not terribly interested in lifting a finger to save ex-slaves benjamin butler fascinating character.

I'm gonna. I think I'm gonna take a break. I said from doing the reading club after this week I'm still gonna. We'll do another one like. I said. I might not want to do reconstruction again. But we'll we'll see I'll take requests but I really want to read his autobiography. I'm very excited about it. He wrote a book and it's called butler's book which is a great name. His father was a pirate all right so while I was talking about how you know things could have been different. Most of the real moments of difference are at the beginning of the war or at the beginning of reconstruction like I said you put butler in there after lincoln with a absolute willingness to confiscate southern land to defend the rights of former slaves at gunpoint. Maybe you change the dynamic specifically the economic dynamic whereby black rights are protected not by the suffrage of the north but by black political power expressed through land ownership. It's a real possibility but any chance of things to be different was I think largely dead in our timeline by the 1873 because it was i.

I would argue the 1873 panic in the economy which is what they used to call recessions or depressions panics. The panic of 1873 which led to the most prolonged. It was called the great depression until we had a worse one. It's a it was 65 months of economic contraction the longest in american history and it meant that reconstruction was doomed that was that put the nail in the heart talk. About racism racism of course was a huge huge huge huge huge huge problem. The economic interests of northern finance capital hugely problematic. The liberal ideology of the republican party leadership all problematic but nothing was worse than the collapse of the economy. The collapsing economy made all those things insurmountable in another economic context they might have been. They might have been and I think we've talked a bit about ways that you see alternatives. Thing alternative structures emerge that in a great in a more robust economic environment which was totally possible this stuff these things were always man-made.

They were always decisions by finance to maintain control of the money supply that was what led to every sustained recession and depression before for world war ii. So this man-made this total shoot shoot yourself in. The foot economic collapse which was started when somebody wouldn't when people just like what happens with all these ponzi schemes which is what all american history is all. American economic history is ponzi schemes the manifest destiny. The jeffersonian conception of yeoman freedom is a ponzi scheme because it always it serves it always assumes more in that formulation land because remember you don't have one kid. In this time you don't have one kid. Nobody has one kid and then that one kid keeps the land that they live on people have peop populations get bigger people immigrate which means that if everybody to be a yeoman farmer there has to always be more land. There has to be and everything is built on that premise and all of our financial instruments and all of our economic activity. America has ever had has been built on that premise of infinite growth and these ponzi schemes all collapse when the inputs fail and the railroad boom of the post-war era was entirely generated by a cycle of of inflated stock offerings by these under the these railroad companies that had no cash flow.

No none of them were making money what they were doing was printing stock and then they would sell new stock and then use that to buy to pay off dividends to the old stock but it was okay because there was always more money going in because the railroads were the chosen method of economic expansion during that period because remember the civil war starts this big explosion in capital capacity. It has to go somewhere it went to railroads and there's plenty of land to do it. But the thing is there's not necessarily that much money because a lot of these railroads went to nowhere. Nobody was on them and they didn't do that and they ended up becoming um giant white elephants. But it was okay because you could always sell more stock and then use that stock sale to get more to get dividends for existing investors so that they'll buy more stock well. Eventually you put some out and people are like look.

[28:31](https://youtu.be/mLJz0vhLGnk?t=28m31s)

I it's already elsewhere. It started actually in europe because at this point the united states is still not the center of the global economic capitalist machinery. It's still europe so it starts in europe but once europe stops sending money over here. Once europe stops investing in these bonds people start calling it in and the whole thing collapses and about it took until 78 to bottom out and it still it still kept going. From there what this led to was a price drop among other things. I mean obviously huge loss of employment. People lost their land and their homes because of for a giant drop in prices in all sectors.

This ruined agricultural small farming and this led to the creation of the grange which was a farmers cooperative union first started out in the west it moved throughout the country it also lent that urban laborers started to get more militant and started to organize and tried to demand more of capitalism and this led the urban middle class who had been the and always were the ideological brain stem of the republican party to become super reactionary to start realizing that oh maybe we don't all have the same interests. Maybe. There are producers and laborers or capitalists and laborers. And if so I know where my interests lie. It's not with the dirty laborers. I am even if I am a mind worker. I know that my allegiance is the capital because these people are more. These are my people and my livelihood depends on the system that they have created. So you see a rise of trade organizations and associations political groups 

Private armies and militias formed of middle-class fancy boys in the cities to put down a lot of the rebellions that come up as a result of people fighting against their admiseration and it led to a movement in this northern states to restrict democracy and also to yeah to limit budgets. Limit taxes. Extend terms of office change. The jury system and the north started imposing vagrancy laws which if you guys remember is what the south did in the black codes after the war to try to keep control of the black labor force. This is a way to keep control of the northern white labor force is to say it's essentially illegal for you not to have a job so congress tries to add some. Grant stung by all the criticism he had received from the liberal republicans who had bolted to support horus greeley in 72 vetoes it reducing any chance of a liquidity injection into the economy and as a result of all this the 1970 the 1874 midterms are a d or a democratic landslide. It sees the democrats retake congress for the first time since the civil war. They win governorships throughout the north. They get they become a democrat is the becomes governor of massachusetts. For the first time. There had never been one before that and what this did was not lead to the south. The democrats now becoming once again the national natural party of governance which had been before the civil war. It creates a 20-year period of stalemate and what and what it was was 20 years of misery at the base of america.

The lower you were to to precarity. The worst things were in this country but that but at the top of the elite parties that these base people voted up voted for it was a bipartisan commitment to hard money deflationary um orthodoxy which was the exact opposite of what the people who actually voted for these parties largely wanted of course middle-class people you know a lot of them. They were committed to hard money for material interests but a lot of these voters wanted something else but because of the fact that the the suffering people of the country were divided by race and geography and the conditions of their labor and the their ethnicity and language whereas the bourgeois were unified on all those fronts. It meant that the only parties to actually have influence at the top level of government want to maintain this structure and so people voted instead because they were foreclosed. They were foreclosed from addressing their actual pain. They were forced instead to fight on cultural geographic lines. Things like parochial education and catholic church things like white supremacy in the south things like the regional loyalties of the civil war. If this sounds familiar to anybody. This is exactly what we have now where our working class which had reached an articulation sufficient to influence government.

[33:53](https://youtu.be/mLJz0vhLGnk?t=33m53s)

In the in the great depression has been de-atomized into total total passivity and self-conception as consumers. So that is why matt carp is 100 correct and that the politics of our moment are not germany in the 30s. They are the united states because it's the united states in the 1880s and 90s so the republicans who had set up reconstruction the way they had on the idea of free labor ideology. Realized over the course of the depression and the ride as working class militancy rose around them that you know what free free labor. That's not actually it you know there are contrasting influences I'm sorry interests. There is actually a conflict of interest between labor and capital which of course was the presiding view of the slave crates of the south. That's one thing they were demystified on is that they had cr. They built a racial category to allow them to hyper exploit their their laboring class and in so doing they but because it was a minority that they felt they could control. They felt that that was sustainable and northern industrial middle class. People thought no that's absurd labor and capital. If they are on equal footing are seeking the same thing we're all trying to make each other better off of course. This is all integrated by the ideas of sustenance autonomy in the in this in the in the land which is gone now um. So now the northern republicans decide to give away with free labor ideology entirely and decide that I guess I'm basically an industrial version of the planters. I guess george fitzhugh was right. I guess we all we are all are either masters or slaves and we need to come into harmony with that understanding we need to say okay. I'm a master therefore. I will be a good master or okay. I'm a slave therefore. I will be a good slave and they started organizing their politics and their culture around trying to promote that idea because they had been disillusioned by the reality of capitalism after the civil war.

This definitely meant that they decided to abandon the ex-slaves in the south so while the democrats actually kind of lost a lot of their racial edge because they could argue now about the depression. They didn't have to just use white supremacy to try to get the groups to vote for them. They had this depression which they could just blame on the other side because they'd been in power when it started so they they focused on race less but republicans in the north became more racially conscious and more were white supremacists because they were doing away with the free free labor ideology which that was always a fantasy and which is incompatible with the rising class conflict of the depression era so in the south grant lets. These southern democratic machines start taking power wherever they want even by doing rigged elections and using force. Their the government refuses to embarrass depositors who lost their savings of the freedmen's savings bank when it collapses. They just they harden their hearts to the whole thing and of course. The depression is worse than the south than it is in the north because the economic level of activity is lower and there's a huge collapse of course in the the railroad industry they have there but then a huge cro drop in crop prices which is the basis for the entire goddamn economy. And the white yeoman start getting cast off of their land which will make them ready labor for the cotton textile mills that start going south in the 1880s and the rising black political class that had gained. Some level of influence in the south is destroyed by the depression the reconstruction. Governments that still exist are either basically powerless in the face of really concerned right resistance like albert ames in mississippi or in south carolina daniel chamberlain eugene were decided to deal with the rising militancy of the whites by just going along with whatever they wanted and and in chamberlain in south. Carolina starts he reduces the size of the militia which is largely black removes black judges. He tries to go bring back conflict leasing and cut education and what of course were black.

People. Gonna do vote democrat. They were held hostage as they have been ever since the reality of black political organization in this country is that they because they are the the negative in the political imagination like the cultural political imagination of one of the two parties at any given time because white supremacy sort of has to ex has to be the organizing architecture of the most extreme version of american labor relations because hierarchy has to be maintained somehow as we saw with the civil war if you if you change the the hierarchy. If you change social relations you undermine the economic engine of capitalism and this is what we're seeing here. In these last chapters is capitalism reasserting itself by reasserting white supremacy so that means that no matter how much the party whatever it is at the time that represents black interests however how much it betrays them sells them out for other interests ignores them. They have nowhere else to go because the other party is defined against their interests and that's what's so funny about the democrat plantation ship from republicans. It's like you're the reason that there is this because you're only your existence is predicated on this. So as a result of this the small burgeoning black middle class in the south just turns from politics completely and you see the beginning of what turns into the booker washington model of self-improvement and political quietism that's going to be very influential as jim crow really solidifies at the turn of the century and meanwhile the white democrats have decided kissing ass they're trying to get black votes they won't vote for us anyway.

Let's just go all in on white supremacy and it worked in large part because by this point the republican party has nothing to offer the suffering poor white. Neither party is offering any real amelioration of the conditions of the depression. Meanwhile the democrats are offering lower taxes which hey who doesn't want to pay less taxes and like a white racial system where you're on top because the the the reality of depression. The reality of economic collapse is that everybody is panicked by definition. Hyper aware of their precarity and the democrats were able to pitch to the white people of the south. In this situation it is a zero-sum game one group. The white or the black will suffer and be dominated in these conditions who who will it be and because there is no real social connection between the two groups because it had been forbidden by slavery in the absence of any other incentives.

It won out and even the grange movement which was not racially motivated in most of the country and and played a a role in promoting cooperation. Along axis of you know actual economic oppression elsewhere in the south. The grange was completely dominated by the planters and agricultural interests which elsewhere meant a yeoman farmer in the southern grange meant a planter because their power was never broken up. So the the democratic pitch in the to the electorate. After the after 74 is white supremacy low taxes control of black labor and it led to a huge string of victories throughout the south. Edmond davis edwin davis we talked about who was a an effective reconstruction governor of texas who cracked down on the klan and and protected black rights successfully got crushed not because of the voters of the people who had put him in changing their minds but because of a huge influx of white immigrants from the rest of the south throughout the south. Two thirds of the house seats in the in congress went to the democrats and of course the other thing that helped this a huge wave of violence in the black belt. The murder of black and white republican office holders the attempt in louisiana to install a governor through a military occupation that had to be put down by the federal government that's how confident they felt at that point and the crackdown on these literal insurrectionists horrified northern republican respectable opinion.

It was seen as tyrannical oh my god look at the tyranny that you're doing on our american citizens who just want to shoot people and prevent them from voting and in the calls of power. Everybody basically decided in the republican party that reconstruction had been a big bungle waste of time. Grant actually said to his cabinet that he thought the 15th amendment had been a mistake that had not benefited the blacks at all that suffered that suffrage had been a mistake and they also reasoned well. We're going to lose power in the south but trying to hold power in the south alienates whites in the north meanwhile if we let this democrats retake the south and we are able to hold our position in the north because we're not now vulnerable to have the charge of being soft on blacks level. At us. We can get the north and if it's what if and if it's a solid north versus a solid south we win because the north has more people and more votes and more more seats and more patronage more money and everything they were willing to make that trade so well in the well. In the last years of the grand administration the the republicans could only manage to pass a watered-down civil rights bill that ended up getting declared unconstitutional in 1883 anyway even though it had never really been able to have any effect because it always it all depended on being able to file federal charges that was always the The ameliorative mechanism in these bills and why they were all dead letters before they were even published because that ability is a function of one's access to civil society which was denied to former slaves but they were much more effective and much more efficient at passing a bill that returned species payment in four years meaning even though the depression was wiping over the country wiping out value leading people with no ability to sustain themselves with little debate and full unanimity. Almost the republican party passes a bill to say hey we're gonna be getting rid of all money that isn't backed by gold which means retracting further the money supply strangling the economy in the while it was choking to death. Now. The republicans obviously were horrified by the by the returns of the midterm when the democrats swept but in the ohio governor's race where a democrat was running on cheap money was running on a greenback platform the republicans were able to cobble together a new strategy for winning in the north even in depression behind their candidate rutherford b hayes rutherford b governor. After this it was assault it was a very close race and hayes won by less than a percent.

[47:42](https://youtu.be/mLJz0vhLGnk?t=47m42s)

But he was able to win by holding on to the rural republican hinterland of ohio where everybody was a republican because that's the party that's that was the party that hadn't been shooting at them. During the war. They fought in basically like in the rural parts of these of the north and in the rural non- mountainous parts of the south. Your. Devotion to the party was simply the fact that you fought a war against those people you're not voting for them. You don't need any other reason. It's pure identity politics around being a veteran or a family member of a veteran of the war because the the plain peasants of the south and north were the cannon fodder of both armies but hayes was able to win because in addition to those voters he brought in that urban middle class who was horrified of the idea of the soft money populism and also because the hayes had stirred up anti-catholic sentiment about parochial education and priests getting government funds government subsidy to whip up. The staunchly protestant middle class who of course hated the immigrant hordes from ireland who were in the city in germany too mostly germany really the catholic ones. They were largely catholic cincinnati's part of that catholic triangle of milwaukee st louis and and cincinnati where the bavarians all moved after 48. So the recipe for northern success for the republicans is drop reconstruction entirely so that you don't bring up so that racism isn't an issue and you don't have to worry about people voting on race whip up the urban protestants against the The catholic hordes and rely on the bloody shirt and the sacrifices of gettysburg to get the the veterans to vote for you and their families and that meant that they didn't need to worry about reconstruction. Anymore it in fact depended them on sort of riding off the south now in mississippi poor albert.

Ames tries to run a fair election. The northern governor who wanted to see blacks get political rights. But was too detached ineffective and unsupported by the federal government to allow it to happen He got. He essentially had to stand back while an incredibly violent election saw mass violence against voters and the destruction of ballot boxes stuffing pure fraud complete fraud but there was no there was nothing else to do because for the north to aid. Mississippi is to hurt them in ohio and if it's ohio versus mississippi they know who to vote for. They know rather who where the votes and the money and the and the logic of power lies and so mississippi had to go. Their fraudulent election was recognized and reconstruction or reconstruction ended there and at this point there's no other possibility. The structures the incentive structures are all in the direction of the sacrifice of the freedmen. All the power pulled in that direction so that's chapter 11. You guys just talking about so the last chapter talks about the real turning point the the historical sort of coda on reconstruction the 76th presidential campaign so grant is by this point completely tired by scandal whiskey ring and whatnot even though he could have run for a third term and apparently kind of wanted to run for a third term He was at that point kind of tainted james g blaine. The man from maine the powerful former speaker of the house also tarred with a railroad stocks scandal so the republicans nominate as a compromise candidate. The guy who'd saved their ass in ohio rutherford b hayes he runs on good government. Blandishments almost completely ignores reconstruction and before the election they even in congress repeal. The southern homestead act so that no not even any possibility exists for for ex-slaves to get land and so that all that rich timber and mining area can be exploited by corporate interests.

The democrats nominate new york governor samuel tilden who is essentially an avatar of wall street. He is the personification of finance capital who supported the south of the civil war and were a the backbone of the democratic party's financial network. Obviously the democracy was the party of like the the simple mechanic of the cities but it was always controlled by capital. Not never not. There was a third party candidate. There was like a ralph nader type guy peter cooper a philanthropist and industrialist in new york who founded the cooper union and who was who ran on a greenback party campaign or who ran with the greenback party which wanted to inject liquidity into the economy and not see the rise of a new slaveocracy riding over all of humanity not just southern blacks. So there's a governor's race at the same time as the presidential race in south carolina between the daniel chamberlain the democrat or the republican who just governed to appease the the democratic establishment of the south against wade hampton a former confederate general even all of camp chamberlain's blandishments in smoochery of the planter elite didn't help them they still ran hamilt hampton against them. Because these there is no degree to which that they will ever accept your capitulation. They want you destroyed they want their man to be in there though happy to take your your cowardice and and they were they're happy to to compromise you. But they have no loyalty to you and they will destroy you and um so what's interesting in south. Carolina is that for reasons we've talked about that are specific to the economy of rice plantations which dominated in that part of the country or that part of the south as opposed to large cotton plantations that are closer that are in like the deep south. Black political power is in anywhere in the south was most articulated and most robust in south. Carolina now part of that is because south carolina has one of the last highest percentages of black population but that's not the only reason mississippi also I believe mississippi at that point had a black majority in terms of mere pop of real population. But the majority of former slaves in mississippi were former cotton plantation slaves and as we've talked about cotton planting is deskilled.

It is unspecialized labor which means that there is less individual bargaining power within a by individual cotton laborers. Rice planting is much more specialized which means that there is more skill involved which means there's a greater degree of leverage that can be applied. There's a greater degree of autonomy of labor in conditions and in life for the people who work within it which meant that when that war ended oh and also cotton cotton labor is because it is unskilled but it's also uncapital intensive which meant that the ruling planter elite mainly kept their stuff. They kept control of their land because they didn't owe that much basically but but like sugar planting rice planting is capital intensive or no. I'm sorry. It's not capital intensive but it is specialized which means that there was no incentive for capital to go in there because they couldn't get enough. They couldn't get enough surplus basically out of the labor that you could get in the cotton south.

So there's much more worker power organized worker militancy and effective ability to negotiate in south carolina among south carolina rice plantation workers. During this campaign rice workers walk off the job for higher wages and demanding cash instead of script and the black power structure that did exist in many of these countries black judges. Black sheriffs refused to repress the strikers and in fact backed them up and it led to the planters backing down and this shows that there was the potential for per independently expressed black political power at the grassroots. But it was it ended up being too isolated but the places it was able to hold on were places where the conditions of labor before the war determined a different power dynamic after the war but even with this and even though south carolina actually sees election violence perpetrated by blacks and not just against them. The sheer overwhelming force of the violence unleashed by wade. Hampton's red shirt militias is overpowering and even though chamberlain gets more votes than any republican in south carolina history. He still loses to hampton in a election that is of course wracked with fraud and fake balloting but is ratified as part of the greater deal that we're going to get to because the haze tilden election ends with tilden winning in the popular vote and winning many northern states which had not gone democratic since the civil war but having disputed results in south carolina florida and louisiana which allow for the republicans to claim they had won and it leads to a big.

A big conflict. People arm on both sides threatening to march on washington to impose their guy. But at the end of the day business didn't want that because business controls both of these parties so there's no real conflict. The conflict is all made up. The conflict is all a cultural pantomime for these silly sports fans. These blue and gray who think this matters at the top.

Everyone knows what has to be done and so congress passes a law to allow an electoral commission because when you have to reveal the lack of democracy in a system you do it by appealing to the authority of something that is supposedly transcendent of politics like the gold standard or an electoral commission which is made up of members of congress and supreme court justices and there's a bunch of jockeying and grift going on with getting the votes. There it ends with hayes being chosen by the commission and hayes mollifying the democrats in congress who attempt to obstruct his now. His inauguration by signaling with probably things that he didn't put down in writing but also through appointments to appointments to his cabinet that he was gonna end reconstruction and with reconstruction off the table with troops promised in words or not to be removed from the south. The the democrats give up their obstruction and haze is inaugurated and so as reconstruction ends in the south as redemption as the southern democrats called it spreads across those those states and troops get pulled out so that there's no appeal to federal authority by any former slave. If their rights are violated. They gotta go to court good luck with that there's in the north.

The great railroad strike of night of 1877 which sees among the same republic sees a huge switch in opinion among republican middle-class voters and intellectuals and politicians in their attitude towards the use of federal troops against american citizens. They've been horrified when sheridan marched into louise in the new orleans and stopped the insurgents from taking power. There they were a gas that when the clan was broken up by the army in north carolina they were absolutely cheering on the army to be used against the strikers not enough lead in the world to be poured into those demons in fact a lot of these people start forming their own private armies either funding or creating middle-class military organizations to to fight what they now recognize is a class war and if there's a class war they know which side they're on so well the the republicans had always balked at doing any kind of concentrated military occupation of the south. They immediately started building armories in northern cities to ensure that if there's any labor unrest the military could put them down and this is this railroad strike is the real coming out party for american labor is a political or a organized political movement and it would grow over time to challenge the liberal order. But sadly and tragically it would do that without the benefit of this huge group of american workers who could have been part of that that movement the former slaves the mobilization.

The the recognition that comes with with the increased social intimacy. Came too late to change the power balance of power but if friedman had been more s supported in asserting their political power on the ground in the grassroots. Then there might have been more robust institutions of black political power to connect with the labor movement when it emerged so while the well labor is being suppressed brutally in the north. The south southern governments that are now redeemed put in institutions of government that essentially tried to undo all the progress that had been done during reconstruction the the school funding the the tax. The infrastructure spending all reduced taxes cut spending forced to be reduced reduction in the ability of states to borrow cutting land taxes for the elite but raising poll and license taxes exempting people not for a x amount of property but for in itemized personal property and what's a coincidence. The itemized personal property that's tax exempt is the kind of property only used by planters because unlike anything that andrew jackson andrew johnson dreamed of putting the planters back in power in the south guaranteed that the poor whites that johnson claimed to support would also be ground under heal. Black political power is broken by the create the institution of poll taxes widespread just pull fraud because democrats controlled the polling states and the election boards and gerrymandering which we know and love to this day. Now there were signs though that something else could have happened that there are there were meaningful political coalitions that could have emerged because even this late in the game even after reconstruction had disillusioned so many poor whites in the south away from supporting reconstruction in the in virginia. In 1879 a a roof a fusion group called the readjusters who were led by a former confederate general and railroad promoter. William mahomes who promised to readjust the state's debt so that they could increase education funding which of course has been kept low by the democratic governance and which was powered by a voting coalition of poorer whites and former slaves won and while they were in power they funded schools. Abolished poll taxes raised taxes on corporations and reinforced black civil rights later in the 1880s. Populist republican funeral effusionists won in north carolina before being eventually repressed and and isolated by a unified coordinated democratic party. But the fact that this latest that you see viable political coalitions that are able to persist in power indicates to me that the possibility that the richness of possibility is much greater than looking. Backward can sometimes make you feel like um so these reconstruction governments.

These these redeemed governments also reinforced control over black labor by more than anything wildly increasing the penalties for petty theft and bringing in or either reinstituting or expanding the use of convict contract labor. If the private regime of power over black labor was abolished by slave by the 13th amendment. If the assertion of rights by by ex-slaves and by the progress that reconstruction had been able to make in in racial relations made it impossible to do full state violence and full state coercion against all of black labor. The law could be used to find a subsection a necessary subsection of black labor who could be compelled in slavery basically and that's what conflict leasing was the exact. The exemption in the 13th amendment for involuntary labor labor labor for involuntary as a condition of servitude essentially allowed them to get what they needed. They didn't get what they wanted because there was successful attempts at asserting black rights throughout reconstruction that and was often aided by support in the north that vacillated but at crucial points came through. They couldn't do what they wanted. But the next next thing was creating huge population of people who were not free because of their prisoner status which was essentially arbitrary. Because all of these notions of legal power legal reality were fraudulent which is where you get this huge alienation between the southern black community and notions of legal propriety. It's very funny how one of the persistent stereotypes of blacks is their criminality when that is in fact what every element of white society is organized to produce they're they're criminal because they are a subject people and so of course they don't and and that is a condition of that. They're not going to accept the validity of your institutions. Why would they they actually can see the fraudulence of them.

So lean laws give landlords the claim over all the cotton cop that is produced even over the demands of merchants which means that all the risk of of a crop whether or not it's going to be dis harmed by by some sort of agricultural failure or whether the price is going to drop. All the risk of growing crops is put on the shoulders of the of the workers and merchants not on the landlords what a shock and there's an interesting phenomenon where the so one of the big conditions of this redemption and the and the depression is that white small holders lose their land at a huge clip and they become the base for a southern working class to labor in the cotton mills that start going up in the south in the 1880s because before the 1880s the economic model in the south was we. We make the all that making it into anything stuff that caught that's too much that's too much capital. I would like to keep all that capital please. I would like to sit on that capitol as the as the plantation owner what it's not my business if you have to bring together capital to do things like create a a system of factories and why would you want to bring together capital when you are sitting on top of a self-perpetuating machine of it so you had to look north or and certainly across the atlantic to england for that. But the growth of finance capital in america means that finance gap will go south which means the in the incentive to to invest grows especially as labor militancy in the north grows and these dispossessed white. Yeoman become the new working class of these mills and there is an un spoken alliance between the plantation owners and the mill owners that blacks will work the land as along with the whites who have to share crop. But that um working in the mills is white work which just very helpfully leads to a situation where the races can be literally um placed against each other in any labor conflict and this is how the failure of reconstruction kind of makes.

America's politics more reactionary than it would have to be by taking out of political participation. This group of people whose sense of social solidarity is greater than anybody in the country because they don't have anywhere to go. They don't have anybody to sell out. They don't have any they don't have any luxury of believing the fantasies of american ideology now of course. I don't mean that universally but I mean in aggregate and by taking that out by taking that group of people out of politics you make it more reactionary and you keep it dominated by a mystified working class and a ferociously capitalistic bourgeoisie and that is where we are now It certainly does make andrew johnson the biggest idiot in the universe because not only did he not get his narrow goal of becoming a two-term president with the aid of the democrats. But his beloved white white poor farmers of the south got completely. Over but their decision to choose race over over economics was made for them in many ways by the fact that the republican party as reconstruction were on ceased to offer an alternative. What else should you be voting for there is nothing else to seek except for some lower taxes and a race wage okay so that is eric foner's reconstruction. I I thought that was pretty fun good book It's a classic for a reason folks next week. I don't know what we'll talk about but I don't think we're gonna do any reading for it. But I'll be here on wednesday and of course. I'll be here on friday too um but yeah reconstruction.

I hope going through that you see all that there are there are always chances. There's always openings because what we got isn't the worst we could have gotten. Either. Things could have gone even worse than they did which means they could have gone better butler man. They offered him the vp. Spot god damn it. I'm not in oregon shut the up god man. Now you're gonna just not stop saying it because you love trolling people love trolling the modern booker t washington. Mike rowe yeah.

I mean. I'll say it now. I guess. I'm in california. I'll just say it you guys have got anatomy congratulations trust the plan indeed that's one thing they get right is that great awakening is always going to be the only thing you can hope for because nothing that you can sketch out in dry. Mechanical language can convince so that's not what you carry with you what you carry with you is a dream of awakening and yeah. That is that's cringe to talk about that's because you're using something that is not transferable in words. You're using a feeling and that is what is that's what's propelling the vision forward. It's just those guys are all deluded weirdos because they're but the thing is we're all diluted. We're weirdos. We're all isolated. We're all trying to feel something and I think we have more ability thanks in part to technology to bring our antennas together than ever before and the cunon really is a proof of how that is possible. It's bad example. It's not helpful but it's possible and if that is anything else trust the plan bye-bye you.
