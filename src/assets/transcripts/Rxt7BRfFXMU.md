Along Came Jones still walking Jones slow talking Jones Along Came lonely lanky Jones any track and then he tied her up and then he lit the fuse to the dynamite and then and then and then Along Came Jones slow walking Jones slow talking Jones Along Came lonely lanky Jones foreign and then he tied her up and then the train started coming and then and then and then Along Came Jones dude talking Jones slow walking drones slow talking jump Along Came. Lonely lanky Jones I see you as the navi say haven't seen Avatar yet going to uh don't really have a backup plan if I'm not transported to Pandora psychically if I come back out of that theater and I'm still. Here I don't know what I'm gonna do because uh man. It's really. It's really getting tough and why because our brains attack themselves because what we're seeing socially wide can best be understood as the brains of a bunch of people who are by any objective standard safe and comfortable and uh not in any real danger of that changing in the near future I'm talking about myself too but who can imagine a future in which things are worse for them. Right things are going to be worse even if it's hard to imagine them being more materially poorly uh well.

Off. They definitely can imagine themselves being older which is itself the non-stop grinding Terror at the base of everything in a society that has no sense of the Sacred and has no true religious belief beyond the self which is what we have universalized. Not everybody feels it to the same amount it is. It is hegemonic though because it is reinforced through our institutions and our mode of production because we have been instrumentalized by a algorithm profit extraction which had been historically part of a suite of values that made up sort of the mental toolkit of the ruling class. Uh the ones who create the cultural superstructure that we are all enmeshed within through their actions.

The machine does the work always the machine of class Society is not something that people uh do consciously. It is something that they uh are wedded to through psychological structures that are far beyond uh uh conscious thought. So they don't really enter into how people uh act or narrate their own actions. Rather. They determine our actions without us thinking about it. That's always what uh are modes of production are are social reproduct our social reproduction does and that is why it's the base as Mark calls it because it is done by the subconscious. It is done below the level of our felt sense of control of Our Lives.

It's the stuff we do because we feel we have to do it and anything that you feel like you have to do you treat differently in your mind to something that you feel like you are choosing to do all class societies. The stuff that actually makes them go. The human inputs that connect to the technological and machine inputs that make economic action that's all stuff people at every level of society feel like they have to do superstructure culture uh the instant the way people interact within institutions that we build on top of our economic uh structures. Those are all people acting out of a conscious will that's and that the action of the conscious will uh obviously affects our our actual economic system. Obviously it does but it cannot generate its own uh uh a will. It cannot generate its own uh independent uh action because it is always being shaped by a relationship to an economic system that we feel enmeshed.

Within and inextricable from now of course not always and everybody not everybody everywhere within an economic structure feels that way there are people there's alienation away from uh our our duties everywhere. But it's arranged asymmetrically the places where it is. The most acute is that I'm not going to do the stuff that I have to do. You that goes that pools at the bottom where the benefits of adhering to what we have to do are the least to be felt but that those people are geographically temporally spatially the farthest away from the actual machinery that is running us so when we Act politically culturally we think we're acting uh as independent beings trying to change an economic system. But what we're actually acting as are people who are to one degree or another enslaved to an economic system and trying to better the condition of their slavery. One way or the other. Now that action at the lower end of the social economic spectrum tends to be towards militant uh economic based challenges to the political order because they're getting a  buttons and and gigas and the whistles of cultural production and institutional reproduction.


There is no there's no desire to really change things to really challenge things but we have all these institutions that we can basically take our sense of uh anxiety in relation to a system that's leading us towards uh uh death. Now former systems have to their benefit for the ruling class. The fact that there was a sacred there was a line because as I said Prophet was part of a suite of mental faculties of a ruling class. Now it is the only one and it is not a human one. It is the thing you tell the machine to do well guess what congratulations. The machine is now telling you what to do completely because it was that Suite of things within a ruling class mindset that made them Act to change without knowing what they were doing to change the system and bat at it and undermine it as as as time passes contradictions within any class system. Accumulate people start freaking out at every level that freaking out takes different uh uh forms based on your class position and they have the effect of battering at the institutions not reforming them from within which is what everybody thinks they're doing but destroying it. That is what they're actually doing. We're all doing that every day because we're divided against ourselves because what we need to do is posited as antithetical to our identities and our identities are formed around denying that which we need to do well that is schizophrenia and it's always present in a class Society. It gets worse when crisis accumulates and now we're in a situation where because the ruling Suite of interests has been reduced to one even the highest levels of power and influence within this global system. This chain of uh uh this supply chain fueled by Technologies of compulsion internal and external guess what it cannot be challenged from anywhere within the superstructure in a way that previous generations could in a way that people could when there was a counter hegemony in the form of a working class left wing project.

You're talking about everything from yes the Soviet Union but not just that every  uh uh a Communist party and also just regular old uh left liberal politics like in America yes you know the the Keynesian uh consensus killed and and the Fortis compromise killed the American left in the long term. But it was around for a while and it built institutions and they were people by individuals whose Matrix of what I need to do and what I am choosing to do are more aligned. That's the strength of working class. Uh politics is that because it aligns people's actions of the will with their their deep reptile sense of self-preservation which is what keeps the rest of us lashed to the Mast of capitalism my God. They're motivated to act absent the incentive structure of capitalism foreign a world built by those institutions. So we think they still are alive but they're not. They have been filled top to bottom with people who have had everything but profit and individuality sifted out of them I'm talking about myself too.

We are all fully individuals spiritually because we have severed that connection and the thing is that a subconscious stuff that's where God lives God's there. But he's here and we have to have an open Channel between our bodies sensation of existence and its decisions to act based on uh that combination of like recognition and repulsion of the other and like that that sonar of like building a fictional but necessary sense of identity to navigate a world like part of that's half self-preservation. But it's half recognition of continuity. It's ha. It's how it's half recognizing that yeah you're part of something and you feel it whenever your need and want are aligned. It is a  tuning fork that cuts through your entire body. We all know it. There's a bunch of words for it. Love is the cheesiest one the most denudative meaning because we've lived in a Loveless World our entire lives. We have now that doesn't mean. We don't love we do but our love is individualized. Our love is dampened because it cannot resonate. Our ability to resonate. Love has been bro destroyed and so we live in these institutions and we think that they can do a thing they can't do that thing because when push comes to shove everyone will save their own asses because this is getting back to the original point if we're gonna die and we're gonna die alone which is what culture tells us which is our society tells every one of us we can intellectualize our way around it. We can think our way around it individually and we can find groups to try to get together but it's basically like a self-help or support or therapy. It is an amelioration of a chronic reinforced social condition that is going to capture us to one degree or another. Our soul sickness is our recognition of that but how we deal with it.

It's a crap shoot some of us get lucky. We find names for it some of us though never do and that means that we're left with this ache and what how do we fill it if that's the case. If y'all get die alone you can believe in you know God. But God is just a substitute for you and and uh that Eternal uh Eternal separation is inherent because you cannot imagine uh Heaven as as uh the original religious traditions did which is a reunion with God because that is an annihilation of the self. Heidegger was right about that Heidegger was right about a lot I got to say yes problematic opinions but uh so he had he has some good. He has some good stuff in there uh so that's why Christians Christians believe of Heaven as uh basically a giant gated community. But the thing is they don't really believe in that they don't really believe in it. How do we know that because their lives are entirely dependent on creating a global communicated community in the Here and Now they're insisting no every day of my life must be spent in Suburban Splendor. Every moment of my life must be comfortable why if you're going to heaven you have to live it here to believe in it. You have to live every moment of your life in heaven to believe in it because as soon as you move a second forward in time it collapses into nothingness. It collapses into absurdity.

It collapses into fantasy so you have to live in a moment that's why any any annoyance is misery and has to and any uh interloper must be annihilated and of course. There's a narrative that these people tell themselves where they're being forced to be this way because of these outside forces. But they are picking an enemy to stand in for their own horror and panic at the thought of dying that they have never been able to reconcile. That's drove the lips to obviously it's true of everyone. If this is true we're gonna die that's it well then we have to spend as much time as we have personally enriched in one way or the other. Now what that means varies by your demographic that varies by your value system that varies by where you have grown up and but where you're brought up and by whom what their opinions were to so certain Enlightenment principles. Uh were they an Armenian are they a  uh gomerist basically uh uh to get Dutch with it. That's the psychic split of the Bourgeois. It has been for the beginning of class Rule now turned into instead of what had been before capitalism a interplay in a relationship between a ruling class that is wedded to a social structure because they had a god of the world. They could break that thing open they could actually crack it now again. They couldn't build a new thing but they could act to break it up in a way that felt to them meaningful and therefore had a meaningful effect. That's how they end up absent-mindedly creating the new social structure that emerges from the collapse of the old one that they accelerate with their actions.

Now though we're at the end of this technology has totally taking control. Everyone. People thought they're peddling the boat everything everybody you know you're on one of those uh the drinking. The the group drinking pontoon things where you're all supposed to uh pedal and drink and go around town very obnoxious well. You know you'll be doing that and like maybe you realize oh like my my uh. My my wheels aren't engaged but you assume somebody else's are nope the thing is got a battery. None of those  things are engaged to a flywheel you're just spinning your wheels and spinning your wheels is going to drive.


You crazy no matter what but in the conditions that exist now where everyone is able to Intuit with their senses in some respect or another a deeper catastrophe one that cannot be spoken of or acted upon for the reasons I enumerated by our institutions by our ourselves. We can't work on them collectively because we cannot speak to them. We can only speak around the whole of them. The absence at the heart that's the only  thing we can do is talk around a giant hole death basically that cannot be talked around now of course that's because we have been psychically broken and disconnected from our deeper well. Our our our deeper interests our bodies interests which are not individual which is not about self-preservation of the self at all costs because it is at that level that we understand yes our separation from one another but also our connection whereas in our minds. At this point we are only reinforcing our separateness so our bodies are our brain our body. Our bra our upper brains are moving our bodies in the direction of panicked annihilation in the pursuit of pleasure in the here and now because if it goes down what else is there to orient your self. Around now you can again value it how you want and uh and act towards it. In a way you want like liberals and leftists do this thinking that yes. But what I want for the the greater good is some fantasy of political power where I make everything better that's not going to happen either now. This does the thing is so we we can't. We can't recognize that truth our bodies feel it. We feel ourselves aging. We feel ourselves becoming more vulnerable every day. We also feel the world around us turning and the reason we feel it so and the reason that the feeling of it is so overwhelming is that for so many of us. It's the only thing we feel because our ability to love our ability to connect to other people has been so brutally severed so what do we do with that feeling. We take it out into the marketplace. We try to find an answer and the only answer we're gonna.

Get are those black holes that are of con of discourse and artistic expression that collect around money. It's money. That's it if we're talking about it. It cannot change things no matter how important it feels uh viscerally and a lot and no matter how an issue relates to real. Human beings on uh who really matter if it could touch the real substance of our crisis. It would not be discussable. It would not be it could not. It could be discussable if we do discuss it. But it could not become a axis of action action which has to happen because we spent so much time in a discourse bubble. We've convinced ourselves that we can talk our way into these institutions. Moving like we can enough hot air will blow these things in one way or another but no that's just energy. It's Just Energy that powers fully automized systems of control that have obviously have never before understood levels of technological technology behind them but also have reached into our hearts. Like the way there's a  uh kroger bag at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. There is a a little plastic uh dagger in all of our hearts. Foreign now that does not mean humanity is dead though because this machine that reproduces this is also reproducing its own decline it's just not being helped. Along by us the way previous generations of humans have helped along the end of their political institutions but those were closed systems or I'm sorry but those were segments of a larger open system like every Empire. Every uh regime of power that has ever risen and Fallen has risen and fallen in isolation. This is the first globalized uh a human Network or economic Network and that means that it is bringing about its own destruction. Much faster than those previous bases did meaning that even though we're frantically spinning wheels at the top and really not uh uh uh contributing the way that we imagine we are to its uh uh constructive decline. Its declined is still real and that means that its ability to assert power at the heart goes away.

It is reduced not everywhere all at once not even in one person all at once but in different degrees among different people who then in their new condition in their changing condition. I should say move towards one another with like uh light towards a new black hole. A new center of gravity and I really do believe that because and this is why I have always been a a a hypochondriac and I've always been a a terminally neurotic isolated person who really did not who who had not no feel for anything outside of himself for the vast majority of my life. Like that is a hundred percent that was me and as a result I was never ever. I was. I was miserable in a way that was manageable because there was some imagined other state that I thought if I could Attain temporarily or permanently it would alleviate it and it's that belief that keeps us wired into this thing. At the level we are and that has changed for me for no virtue of myself purely through luck like just because I got hit by the right uh uh gamma ray blast and got knocked onto the right trajectory in this by the solar wind foreign. Other. Dimension of life and feeling and the self that I never knew but all that other stuff the selfishness and the the uh the hypochondria and the fear of individual death that's still there and it didn't go away. It's it's my structure.

It's my carapace how could it go anywhere and not Matt Christman without that because we are our traumas to be I mean it's annoying the way that traumas talked about in media now in the least useful way in the in the most uh uh demeaning and and and virtue signaling and uh superficial way because it is deeply important concept because we are built around the dents that we take like those are our shape are the dents that we take in our lives the thing that comes from outside that we don't know why or when and then we have to make sense of it but the thing is we don't know we're coming at it. After it happened. We're piecing things. Together. We can get close but we can't get there to knowing what the hell happened. The stories we tell ourselves are the stories of our lives but they are stories. Some of them have basis in reality but we fill in a bunch with fear because that's all we have absent a sense that we are not gonna die. The death isn't real that the fear is irrational but that is the irrationality that our psyches are premised on that guy's still there and he hears all this stuff that I'm saying and his response in the aftermath of me saying it and feeling like it makes. Sense is you know when it's quiet and it's just me.

The voice says well what if this is you uh basically euthanizing yourself like you at a deeper level than conscious know that oh the thing you've always been afraid of the sudden death that betrayal by the body. It's gonna happen. Very soon gonna have a brain aneurysm some sort of uh cancer that's been growing and it's gonna just rip you to shreds very quickly. You're gonna get. Owned you're gonna die and this is you this entire coming awake this entire. Uh uh uh uh midlife crisis fueled uh Revelation. This is literally you uh using drugs to say basically cheat your senses into apprehending a truth that your conscious mind is too terrified to reach at and is pulling you towards uh you being euthanized. That is like the worst thing that that's the thing that makes all my bodily senses turn into the fear like the sensation of actual physical threat. The thing is when the word terms on that if that's true it doesn't contradict anything else I said and in fact it reinforces it because if this if God in the spirit existed it exists in the temporal space between mere physicality and uh conscious perception of the world that it's in a space. A I hate to be cheesy about it. But a Quantum space where time is reversed basically and that's why I realized like oh my fear of dying has always been a death wish and this is still a Death Wish because what I'm really afraid of is having to live now that used to be having to live with uh. You know um personal discomfort. But now it is because I feel like I have fulfilled much more of my life like I feel like I have a sense of community and and reinforcing acts of love that kind of keep me grounded uh in a way I I had not previously because I couldn't I couldn't perceive at that frequency.

Uh I don't have that you know but I do have a sense that things are bad and are getting bad getting to get worse globally and that that and then I will not be exempt from that in any way that I am as implicated and enmeshed in that decline as anyone else and the question is what do I do about it. That's the question we all have to face and what political identity allows us to do is avoid that question not address it but avoid it. Uh things are getting worse and worse for me and for everyone in a way that I can't disentangle no matter how much I try to rationalize it. I'm gonna make things better by saying opinions and then voting for people and doing political activism in response to issues and uh um. Concepts and and events more than anything that are dictated by money money is the thing does it matter if it went to college or not. It doesn't matter if it's red pilled or uh has the woke mind virus. That is all a mask that is all a interface for you to engage with because you are making a consumer choice and you are being offered as with everything else in the world a suite of options that are meant to appeal to your demographic trench. Because this is a tomography. It is not politics. People with X demographic traits tend to have why aesthetic uh uh uh alliances the same mistake for political ones because they have no political subjectivity. You're gonna go out there and you're going to fight and you're going to make the world a better place. No you're not you're going to have a good time.


You're going to have a nice time with your friends on the computer and then if that's not good enough because you're really miserable. You're going to go and do Insane. Water thank you very much raspberry lime because we all feel we're going on the train and we all feel like our lives are going to be worse like I I want to die now because I would rather die uh relatively happy. I feel like I could do that I could let go feeling like I uh you know I have regrets. I have significant powerful regrets that are going to be with me my entire life. But I feel like I can answer for them to myself.

You know as I as I personally consciously go down this. The towards the black hole of nothing where of course everything stretches and time ceases to have a value and all of our fear of of Extinction and of our fear of of the the Tony Soprano death are shown to be the the uh medieval idiocy of people who can't see all of the dimensions around them that are  orb a basketball and then all of the flatness is imposed by class Society. There's no religious tradition that exists now that was not born when class Society became a permanent feature on the on the Earth's landscape which is the early Iron Age. The axial age Confucius Buddha so I feel like I could reckon but I would like to not reckon with a bunch of uh. You know physical pain as I am you know uh economically imperiled uh or if I'm not if I'm lucky enough to not be economically imperiled uh if I have to confront the state at some point to Res to avoid being uh having my Humanity eroded out of me to the point that I have made it. But I am trapped in the same gilded hell as guys like Elon Musk. So no because I don't know if I'm capable of it. That's the question I can talk a big game but when it comes push comes to shove if I'm going to really be willing and able to sacrifice myself because right now loving the world is very easy for me. It's going to get harder even if I don't suffer some sort of uh some sort of uh economic catastrophe or I'm victim to one uh.

I'm going to see around me a a intensity of a miseration that is going to make continued life uh in Alliance and in reproduction of this system intolerable and again that's neuroses too how fast that's coming that's neuroses because thinking about that the the other side of it. The only part of my brain that can really game out. The catastrophe of things is the neurotic selfish side because I'm not there yet the heart lives in the present. It's nowhere else. Our memories are devoid of it and our projections of the future cannot uh can I conjure it so our worst case. Scenarios are always driven by our neurotic fear of death that doesn't mean they're not based on real objective things that really exist but we reproduce them and and heighten their frequency because they are not counterpoised to a um grounded sense of I hate to say it love.

But it's true foreign because the goal the Dream of capitalism is everyone is Barren. Everyone is a king. It is the Romans uh Roman conception of identity turned into God which is why Christianity getting absorbed in the Roman uh uh absorbed by the Roman Empire was the end of Christianity because it it because every society has an idea of God right and the Roman idea of God. Even though you know they were pagans or whatever their idea of what a God was was. As as it is with every everywhere it kind of has to be a manifestation of our most valued traits and what were the most valued traits of Rome mastery individual Mastery of others. Now that's a problem now that's why you have the crisis uh of the Enlightenment. Like people the  dark Enlightenment pseudo uh intellectual morons who want to blame the enlightenment for everything when what what happens is that you get a certain amount number of people that that uh the malthusian Trap is solved if the lock is picked by technology and you have to have a guiding ethos. Every Man a king over slaves can work in the demographic context of uh second century or you know second century. Uh Rome. But it's not viable once you're in the by the 19th century. So then how do you synthesize that you can't in Europe. That's why it's a cycle of annihilation until World War One you can in America. Now. It's the fantasy in a chimera and it dies almost immediately.

Uh you the great the Second Great Awakening the big uh uh uh Mass psychotic break that happens in the in the early 19th century. Uh specifically in Upstate New York is an Evidence of this like the the before the the um the real exploration of the continent had begun those early uh settlement areas get all taken all spoken for basically uh by um by the 1820s and the people who came in late the people. The people who showed up from largely New England because oh sure turns out that land where the Yeoman dream was. Born is actually really shitty for farming and uh filled with Limestone and not very fecund at all so he uses X Mass Exodus from New England Due West starting with upstate New York. Uh Joseph Smith's family is a perfect example of this they're from Vermont uh John John Brown's family is from uh from Connecticut and you know there are people who are able to get some land there. Uh there was there were a number of there was uh land that was given away the World War uh Revolutionary War veterans and so there was a sort of a little mini land rush there.

But what always ended up happening in those situations when when soldiers are given. Land is that a lot of those soldiers end up selling their right to the land to a Speculator or an existing landowner because uh it's a lot of upfront labor for a relatively it for a risky proposition. At that point. You know this is before Farm subsidies one bad  investment is gone. Some money in the hand might be better but a number of them tried to uh you know make it go and yeah we're annihilated and it's that socially declining group who can't grasp the Yeoman dream where you can reconcile godliness and submission to an authority in a way that the Puritans here as hell couldn't that's why they had to chop off the king's head. It's going away but there's nowhere else to go because the frontier is not open. It's not viable yet like you've already thrown your dice. You're not going to be able to pick up and go to uh. What try to settle uh the Western Reserve. Not yet anyway you need more uh time for that to develop for because you can't move there until the infrastructure has been built for you. Like that's the fantasy of American uh uh westward migration. It says it's a bunch of  independent wagon trains going west. No it is the Army going first setting up bases trading posts and uh fortifications and then building roads that happens first. Then people start moving it. That's always the way it always is and of course that's we reverse it for our fantasy for our uh a narrative we tell ourselves as a nation because we sure as hell can't Forefront the the role of social uh institutions in providing this possibility for the individual to try up because it undermines our uh our sense of self our identity that self-sufficiency is key to the settler Colonial mindset. The fantasy like the  boars have it in uh in South Africa too Oh. They'll they only oh they get to do even better because they actually were like uh them. Like. They are the most aggrieved of all uh Petty Bourgeois in the world because they did actually have the British army come. After him I mean we fought a relatively uh civilized war with the Brits. They  put them in concentration camps. They invented concentration camps to put those crackers out.


So what do you do you got to open a door somewhere and that is why God comes back into the world. But it's only Joseph Smith among those early innovators who realizes in the long term. God's not going to be enough. God has to be wedded to a new social reality that can be reproduced separate from the institutions that are alienating everyone around us. That's why he tries to create this Utopian community uh Kirkland Ohio and then the Vu are intended to be commune communist Utopia so the way that Gerard winstanley created when he went to St George's Hill uh after the suppression of the levelers and they have been relatively successful which is why Mormon identity persists is something other than a demographic because it's tied to a different understanding of the self that's tied to a different relationship to capitalism and that's what like the seeds are trying to build to protect. That's what the Amish are trying to protect all the different degrees of success. All the different degrees of internal repression necessary to keep that and that is what the uh the populist right the intellectuals of the populace right want to universalize. They want to take that uh that communal sense of self that Alloys capitalism and universalize it but oops can't do it why no Frontier it's only allied with a frontier.

It destroyed itself in Europe over and over again until America synthesized it and died and imposed a new order where it says hey Brit hey hey Europeans. We're going to subsidize you people to pretend you're doing capitalism. You guys can all like trade for trade with each other and have your little labor unions. It'll be adorable. We're gonna put the ex-nazis in charge. So you don't get too crazy with this  and forget who who you work for but you're gonna get to have your little fake democracies and your little fake capitalist systems. Oh you guys uh you love your farming. Don't you your. Yeoman peasants out there adorable. Here. You go here's all the subsidies on Earth in America we  and turned into minions of Monsanto oh because there were other Frontiers for us. But Europe that little that little hot house the little fake continent that little  snow globe. They get to keep like the the farmers. The the farmers of Western Europe are are restive and and they're always fighting for their uh for their Liberty and it's like yeah. They have been effective political uh uh subjects but only in a context where they are being uh. They have been anyway coddled and allowed to and indulged by us which is changing and that's why Europe is going to go back to. Fighting already has it's going to get worse because the populist fantasy is of universalizing it cannot happen now anywhere which means you fight gotta fight. Gotta fight the internal enemy yes but never just the internal enemy because there have to be spoils to distribute to the winners and and absent that you have no uh synthesis of your Social Dynamic which these right populists think that they're gonna. Create and the proof of this is that the teleology of all right populism is war with China. Now of course. The Grim joke is the teleology of left liberalism. International capitalism as it exists also war with China because we're we're going down the drain the same drain where we perceive ourselves at opposite sides of the drain right.

The cultural left there is no left that has to be emphasized. The left does not exist. I don't think I say that enough honestly because I see too many  people talking about the left like it's a thing. The left is not a thing. It is an attitude. It is a it is a identity segment perceives the right as driving us towards Oblivion. The right perceives left is doing so. Meanwhile they're just going through motions and spinning wheels in a machine that is being driven by the one actual operative order generating any political uh any economic action anywhere on the globe profit extraction profit extraction is the only thing turning the gears nobody's ideological prior's matter at all that is all post-hoc uh self uh uh justification and see. This is where I get to the neurotic part of me because I'm like well. That's true of me too right. I am also rationalizing my interaction by sitting here and talking so that means that I am dying and when it happens I will realize all the things I should have done all my failures I made but that is tied to what narcissism again because it doesn't  matter. I'm nobody. I'm nothing and that's that's the freedom that is the that's the thing that religion used to point to realizing you're nothing is the actual Transcendence that religion used to offer and now in the west. Anyway does not foreign. I personally have to do this to stand against that why you so important you're so special oh look at you adorable I have to die affirming. My individuality guess what when it's time to actually die all that is going to be brutally uh. Uh Stripped Away and of course you know that deep down. That's why the cult of action. That's why fascism which is dead as a active political agent but is Alive. Now fully as a concept conceptual skin for one half of the diet. The gyroscope the dot the the one one set of hands of the two on the Wheel of of culture and politics that are now. It's their action. That drives it not the specifics of their intent. Oh it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity. So all the pills are the same pill your black your doom pill your black pill your red pill. All those pills are the same thing that is a self-flattering validation of the individual oh I'm telling it like it is. Everything's doomed. No you're telling it like you're. Uh  your ego requires you to uh to hear and yes Grill pill too. The whole Grill pill was came out of me realizing oh I can't affect change. Therefore this load-bearing sense of myself is a worthy being on.

Earth has been knocked out. What do I replace it with and there was nothing there because the work is individual. But it could only be reproduced socially. That is the Paradox at the heart of of everything and what Bridges the gap faith. There's a common. There's a common sentiment on both sides of the cultural divide that says that they would kill us if they could and the thing is asymmetrically that is true of a few people and that's because and it is yes asymmetrically on the right but that is because there are for someone who is demographically attuned to right psychological structures. There's less place to vent it. What can you do to vent your Ox to your Horror oh. I'm just one person who will never be able to actualize in any meaningful way and then die which is what coming into uh uh. Consciousness in this time in this place does to you how are you supposed to deal with that. Uh if you are culturally to the left there's a lot of options. There's a lot of things you can do to liberate yourself just feel a sense of liberation. There are none on the right now that's boohoo obviously uh. But like the ones that are there are things like joining the military but even the military what do they do they go when they lose Wars. They go you get to be go to go to fight in other countries and reaffirm. What a  time-serving loser you are foreign. Battlefield where you can fight and feel like your sacrifice means anything is here I can die meaningfully here but only in confrontation with a uh cultural superstructure that I'm alienated from and so yeah on the right. It's a lot more violent but that's because of a liberal cultural hegemony. The other place of course is though is you can enter the police you can go be cop so that's why you see the police. The way they are so yeah more of them would if they got you in a room kill you but even then actual numbers acting again individually because there is no capability of collective action not a way that's going to be an existential threat to any social class. Not not the genocidal fear people have most of those people yeah they would like to see you die they'd love to see you die. They would laugh their asses off if they were watching it on television. If somebody else was doing it for them and yeah a lot of liberals especially uh. Uh the wealthier ones the ones who are more screamingly miserable in their heart and more guilty about it. They do hate right-wingers and they would love to see them die again on television. We're all gonna get that treatment one way or another. From this machine.

We're gonna fall out of favor with the gods and be reduced not all at once but through demographic economic trenches. Lower faster higher from the top as people sort of individually spin out through bad luck and bad wiring but at the bottom universally prison camps. If you're if you lose you're like mass incarceration of of people for the crime of poverty is a going to happen in the United States but it's and that is going to happen regardless of who's in power just as the children in cages at the border happen regardless of who is in power depending on who's in charge it. When they in one side or the other there will be spectacular acts of State violence to affirm one or another side and they will have real outcomes and that will mean real misery for real people. But it is largely not even going to be a question of the state making choices so much as the media making choices on which part of this misery to highlight the misery is going to be increasing our vote and our cultural uh. Uh war or culture comp is going to be deciding which channel to turn on which lens to view the horror through that is why I feel my if I have any justification for persisting in the life that I am living now given the conditions around me. It is to try to cut through that to break up that that uh that psychic uh tractor beam between these two poles of what is effectively homeowning Bourgeois there's people trailing them. We're all in the comp. Most of us are in the common end of that but it is homeowning Bourgeois one sword or another. In this country. People who see threats everywhere but by definition threats far away from their person because this is all a game to them. It is a  game to them and of course. It's not a game to the people who get caught up in the violence and and in the uh the the spectacle of politics. Like that's a real. Those are real actions with real consequences but they're not felt by the people who dish them out.

So they won't change anything and the thing is all. I'm doing is the same turn to the self that every that the left that actually existed did uh after the defeats of this of the late 60s only even more pathetic because it was such a relatively uh meaningless Outburst but of course that's because the material conditions have changed. This is a last the left as we understand. It is the end of something it is not the beginning of anything uh the the cultural. The cultural formation we're dealing with now is something that will be extinguished. It will be replaced by a more expansive and spiritual conception of the left that will be in many ways unrecognizable to people who now call themselves that and therefore a horror to be avoided because no my idea of the left is the good. One of course it is dear of course it is what a coincidence. It's the one that you personally believe in oh really the your personal beliefs are the objectively good ones. I can't believe it what what are the odds. It's just like how uh just coincidentally uh. Imperial uh Prussia was uh the ideal social formation that uh Heigl find himself live on living under like it was amazing as soon as like this new uh cultural ferment of the left emerged in 2017. The first thing on most people's agendas was okay uh.


This counts is left and this isn't if you believe this you're in it if you if you aren't you're out of it and of course everyone who had that uh in mind they had a very reasonable under argument for why their thing they cared. About the most is the thing that mattered the most but how could you ever know because where did you get. This  did it come from struggle did it come from uh participation in the class project for the most part for the loudest part. No for the part that collated around money no in a time when the left was was was was trying to be resuscitated from nothing Your. Instinct of if your instinct is we've got to Define this as narrowly as possible that means that you have totally misunderstood the terrain that you're dealing with why because you're in a you're in a little play. Bubble and every every media uh thing that emerges to meet your consumer needs is going to reinforce what you want to hear because that's what it's for that's what this is all for what do you want. We will tell you it everybody who tries to go online to find. The truth is just going to look to themselves in the mirror what that mirror is gonna be. But what they're looking for is individual. But what is going to be reinforced is every individual's selfishness. It's going to be stripped of everything else that brought them into engagement and it's going to become the only thing that reproduces. But of course you know.

It doesn't really matter because it was this last bubbling like oh this mode of production is ending. This mode of relationship is ending we should do something about that what do we have to deal with it. These Notions. These categories of left and right these political parties these institutions. These actions this Suite of responses that we've inherited from previous generations. Who weigh of course like a nightmare on our brains and we get up in those costumes not realizing that those categories are empty like in previous iterations when Marx talks about the way that revolutionaries will take up the mantle the costuming of of the previous generation of revolutionaries he's describing because he's describing capitalism at its beginning. It's real manifestation as a as a continent-wide and worldwide operating cultural operating system and therefore the working class is a self-conscious uh element of it that will be that will reach independent power and it did he was correct about that just it's the extent of that individual power was independent. Power was limited proscribed and then annihilated like Mark thought he would win. We would win the war. I think if you if you want to get where he got wrong. I think he got everything right except that he thought he would win the war and of course he did. Everyone thinks they're going to win the war because they cannot imagine Humanity outside of their cone of uh of identity formation like what the values that they have uh been a culture to because what other ones are they going to have but but when Mark sees the saw like the Paris communards using the the revolution as a model. The French Revolution that had been carried out by you know the lawyers in the Bourgeois. This was being carried out by the workers of Paris so those old forms are getting new content.

At the end of that process. Those old forms are being taken up by uh is being filled with nothing. It's being filled with our our narcissistic uh uh desires which are the desires of the market. The desire the market has imprinted upon us no matter what we think we're doing politically. That's how we can act politically through those institutions and class is an old form because someone says what if class is an old form. It is I mean we can talk about class existing as an objective thing right now. But we cannot talk about class and certainly in America as a uh as a live function of human identity. People might think of themselves as a working class person or middle class person or whatever. But that is it does not have the uh grounding to institutional reproduction that it used to which means it's nothing more than another element of the demographic pie that we all make up and what does the New Media economy the new reality we move through do.

It sees our demographic groups and then at a speed beyond our ability to perceive. It's happening offer up to us. What it no what it expects us to be attracted to and then our eyes will move towards it without us even knowing that we're why they are doing that and then as soon as we have done that everything else we encounter will be something that we think we think we're getting uh. We're searching through a some sort of reality but we're having reality built for us. It's a simulation I hate to use it. But it is and I think a lot of people noticed after 2020. Oh a lot of the things that make up the the legacy of the left in this country. Uh are just ornaments of uh individualism oh my God. They're pursuing them actually puts you in conflict with solidarity uh and that is correct but then many of them made the uh the self-deceptive move. To then uh say okay. Those are the only ornaments of identity to have that effect other ornaments of identity uh that I associate with some more authentic previous demographic of worker. Those are untainted. Those are Simon pure. Those can be harnessed to confront capitalism nope sorry same thing and those people who made that decision they thought they were operating off the best evidence of their senses and rationality. But what were they doing they were being told what they wanted to hear and what they wanted to hear was.

What could I do to avoid this question that I cannot answer without putting my sense of self Indulgence at risk and that is the question that all of this exists to prevent you from genuinely confronting including this show as I've said a million times so how can I keep doing it because I know you're going to do it no matter what because I know because the lack cannot be sensed it cannot be pointed out anyway. It has to be to be experienced. There has to be a resonant experience in your life that makes that be felt at a lower register in the meantime I might as well try to tell the truth. What feels like the truth again totally self uh self-exclamatory because yes I would rather for my own personal pleasure. I would rather sit here and talk on the computer and make a podcast and hang out with my loved ones and do like fulfilling and rewarding uh. Uh work then come into existential conflict with the state which is the only alternative so again always coming back. But what class society's religious institutions tell us is that that circle is all. There is that circle is one dimension of a multi-dimensional process. The flattening is is done by the mechanisms of class society that rip us away from our felt experience yeah. It's like everyone's lying except me like okay wow great sales pitch what a shock what a surprise. I'm the one who's saying what's true but how do I resolve that same way I resolve anything faith and in this case my faith is rewarded by the fact that uh when I say it it feels good like in a deep sense in a way that nothing else does like. This is one of the key. Parts of this is that pursuing that selfish drive for pleasure. Everyone knows this is never fulfilling in the moment. You are always anxious about losing something or getting around something finding some experience that was not fulfilled. We all know that and it sits with us and it still does like plenty of times. During the day. I feel that I feel like what should I be doing. I shouldn't be doing this and then if I try to do something that is just going to make me feel good in the moment. It doesn't really go away when I do this it does go away just sitting here and saying this stuff every outcome of what happens after I finish the moment.

I'm in now is okay with me because the words I'm saying they like I said they resonate okay. I hope some of that made sense this is always talking in circles. A lot of this is yeah me doing therapy and talking through my own. Oh God trauma but with me therapy. I'm just like I'm sorry. You know part of me is always going to be.


I'm paying you you know so once again as a child of the market I let the market decide for me. If I say this stuff and people respond yeah that made sense then. The market is spoken if anybody has any questions they'll stick around for a little bit. Here yeah. The Chinese lockdown ending is uh. It shows that capacity is limited everywhere yeah and that you know hoping that any current institution of any kind anywhere within the capitalist World System has not been fundamentally hollowed out is who knows to what degree that's wishful thinking. But there certainly is some everywhere because again how do we know what are we projecting versus what we can have any confidence really stating. I would say the percentage uh is way more towards wish casting criticize about everything ending tomorrow that is also its own wish fulfillment right. Like it all is. It is all attempts to to to make the future okay to live in even as we fear. It won't be it not being there. That's that cuts through the gordian knot. That's why that uh the end of uh Dr Strangelove is a  split the goddamn atom in the first place foreign because in this individual system uh if if we cannot let go if we cannot submit and only above faith in some sort of benevolent greater. A benevolence greater than us can allow us to do that we cannot believe it that at the highest levels of power and that we have selected Now by for generations for people who cannot conceive of that. Then we must choose our own Annihilation.

We must that's that's the death drive at the heart of capitalism and fascism's effective Death Drive is just a capitalist system manifesting terminal crisis. In this case the uh the German economic unit among the pre uh among the uh competitive State apparatus the westphalian state apparatus that had been created uh in Europe by the mid 20th century. Those uh those units were an existential conflict with one another one. There was going to be ultimate Victory and ultimate defeat and the Germans really going to change or die. They didn't change so that means they were going to die and fascism was there preferred method of going out and that is why there is so relatively little difference now in different uh strands of American politics because as I said war with China is how both of them are oriented as opposed to World War II where you had this Atlantic American anglo-american capitalism with its Frontiers that had like a real capacity to globalize capitalism in a way that was advantageous to it. Germany couldn't do that Japan couldn't do that they showed up late to the party. All the stuff that the anglos and Americans had done to get their position was now outlawed. It's like Air Bud comes in and uh and he scores the winning basket because there's no rules in the book that says a dog can't play basketball. Then next week. Somebody shows up with a German Shepherd and they're like nope dogs can't play basketball. We just won the cup and changed the rules oh uh doing uh Mass expropriation of land uh and and just uh. Distributing it to your own uh Petty Bourgeois uh flag on the play.

That's not you can't do that Amber said that once uh my wife amaralo that was very succinct talking about the Axis. Powers in World War II so locked out. It's like Japan and Germany Gonna Change or you're gonna hit the  accelerator and because the change uh faction was defeated. Annihilation is the only uh end state. Now you can say China is an alternative but we're still here and we have something that the nut the Chinese or the not the Nazis and the Japanese didn't have nuclear weapons do you think for a second if uh if they developed a nuke at the end of World War II even after uh like like they were working at it like well. The bunkers were falling you don't think somebody would have pressed that  button you don't think Hitler would have pressed that button. That's why there is a I mean because Russia like Putin is like that end state of a capitalist uh facing like real emisuration because the United States has decided that Russia cannot be allowed to be its own country like to be its own independent power base to to to re to resist its own decline and without an option why would you not hit the nukes. The the proof of the superiority of the Soviet system is that they didn't launch the nukes at the end of the of the 80s because they had a fundamentally different relationship to nuclear weapons than the United States did sure there were uh there were uh. There were Hawks and everything but you did not have a defense establishment that was fixated around nukes as an inevitability well. You have  MacArthur champing at the bit to use nukes and uh uh Korea and Nixon offering suggesting Eisenhower they offer a nuke to the French to relieve the dienbian foo for Christ's sake.

Uh it still amazes me we made it through the 60s when we had those Nut Cases Johnson's and Nixon back to back without nuke going off. Although apparently Nixon did actually order a nuclear attack on North Korea uh during Watergate when he was shit-faced and they just ignored him whether or not the Russians launched a nuke. During this uh Ukraine war comes down to whether the U.S gives them a chance to save face and whether there's a faction in the Kremlin who uh is not as set on Putin as Putin is uh on an existential conflict because they can imagine themselves getting them or some group around them getting some sort of a deal. The same way that the yelts and criminals got their deal when uh Russia was carved up but of course. Now you know everything's been carved up. What do you do next uh and I think that's why you see. The NATO heads talking about dismembering Russia because I think what they're hoping happens is that uh is that there's some sort of coup uh against Putin or he dies and then the leadership of of the state that he's created. Here you know the the remaining oligarchs and political operators and Military guys will take the same deal that the regional uh kingpins of the peripheral. Uh Soviet Union did in uh 1991-92 when uh they got to be the heads of their own little countries so that is the long-term goal because they know if Russia sticks around there's going to be a nuclear war.

Because the psychology is overwhelming when it's one person or one small group of people. They actually can use this thing to bring it all down but where wig history and Marxism is wrong is the idea that it the actions they take can be towards a constructive reform because even Marx's Revolution is a constructive reform. In its architecture. Like the state is taken over replaced from within By A Working Class. There is not annihilation that then something comes you know up from afterwards and that is what nuclear weapons Ensure and that is really why the last hope of socialism for this stub of human development. Uh is might have been ended at the Trinity test site because once you got the Cold War uh a final confrontation between the Soviets and and the burgeoning uh communist World block and Western capitalism became impossible uh the Russians. The the Soviets would always back down. Mao got that Mal you could call him a crazy person and he certainly was in many respects. But he understood that uh that if if the the Communist side was not willing to use nukes uh then their eventual defeat was inevitable uh but of course that dream the idea he had that like the the Chinese who emerged after a nuclear war would somehow be you know like a a communist subjects that is incorrect I do wonder if they just dropped one nuke on Kiev what would happen because it's hard because you know. It's like that's that's that better not be like a nuclear like an instant launch scenario right. But like we also could not do nothing so what is between uh nuclear retaliation and nothing that can be done. If they nuke Kiev you say like okay. We're gonna nuke uh uh Archangel or something that we say look one city. You don't don't do another one. We're just doing one retaliation and it's not. It's not a big one. It's not one of the main ones. The Moscow can't do Moscow yeah full blockade but how do you respond to that. If you're Russia.

Then that's why I really don't think there will be one nuke because I don't think there's any gaming it out where it ends there so why start there but again all of our all of any of our thoughts. On these subjects are neurotic thoughts the preservation of ourselves and as I said the preservation of this stub of human uh life which is only one of infinites in the orb of life. Not the circle of life the orb of life one one track one vein in the in the cosmic membrane. Since we can't do anything about that thinking a lot about it becomes a way of thinking not about other things like what can you do in your life today to feel like it meant something the problem we have is for a lot of us. It's very hard to imagine anything that was true of me for many many years. It's still tough because it's not like I overcome the isolation and enemy of American Life still wedged in it. I'm still totally a messed in it. My relationship to it is a little different thankfully but I'm in the same boat as everybody else. The main thing that would stop that from happening is that the system does have that profit extraction incentive and everything is arranged along that axis which is aligned among humans along an axis of self-interest and it is really in nobody's interest. Uh you know except for a few people at the very very top who have sort of talked themselves uh into uh an existential Panic which is true of most of our very very top ruling type people. I could name some names like they have convinced themselves that they are uh in imminent attack. But you know those Pinnacles can't be amputated From Below by people so it's just a little lower but able to active act in sort of collective self-interest and they kind of snip them off uh. But yeah. Everyone has some sort of self-imposed uh uh uh manifest a projected manifestation of their own Ox their own inability to reconcile them themselves in their body and then that gets projected into something else. Uh that's why everyone in the suburbs thinks they're going to get traffic or that or the Isis is going to kill them or they're going to murder if they go into an American city or uh somebody's gonna try to groom their child. This is all a a self-projected uh uh fantasy pleasurable fantasy because the very fact that it's not gonna happen is what makes it fun. They get to feel scared the same way you get scared in a haunted house or in a horror movie. That's what this is. That's what is generated by those issues not existential conflict with over like the his the the destiny of Western Civilization that went bye-bye a long time ago. We're along for the ride. Now all that has been squeezed out of the bladder. But we're still here as people trying to manifest make sense of Our Lives even though and make and give life to these dead structures and institutions and signifiers and so we're doing a little scary puppet show for each other and then we get to live in this. This world where politics is just those self-scaring bored anxious suburbanites determining the the shape of politics for the rest of us. And even though our concerns are more real because we have less economic security uh we can't address them on their own terms. We can only address them through the same lens dictated by those scared homeowners Boomers. Okay I think this is a pretty good stream. Uh felt like we got somewhere wrap it up with uh a phrase that came into my head.


While I was having one of my patented uh freakouts. I was in a grocery store. I was getting a little sweaty. I had kind of a little headache and I was like oh. This is when you have the uh the brain aneurysm. This is it. It's gonna happen right here in the  Vons and uh and I realized like when I'm actually scared of is because I do I have gotten to the point where I do think that death is a recognition and it is a an awareness of things coming into awareness of things that were not that you could not address in your life because they were repressed like it returns at death. I really think it does and our fear of death is a lot of it is a fear of not being able to handle that like that's what hell is basically hell is an eternity with our regrets and hell is the denial of of reconciliation which again is a fantasy class. Society creates uh. It is a failure to recognize the that you can't separate in a meaningful way uh yourself from the thing you're seeking to reconcile with which means you're already reconciled with it. But the fear is specifically of of the sudden death deal is like oh I could have eaten better exercise. More I could have gone to the doctor and they could have got a cat stand because I've worried about this for a long time and so even if it's not guilt a sense of guilt of a thing I've done to another person. There is a separate guilt that I have allowed myself to die because I have access to all this information right I have access to this technology of Health Care that should allow me to keep that from ever happening without my consent basically and I think that that is where that's the final stage of of Calvinism is the difference fundamentally at end stage. Secular Calvinism is that uh the saved and the damned are the the quick and the dead or the dead and the Eli to be alive is to be saved really which is why the end state of capitalism now is eternal life in the computer and how even there's there's plenty of people on the the left who broadly have a fantasy of that happening. So the only the the final fatal sin the only meaningful sin because it's the only one that cannot be. Redeemed by Future action is death because once you're dead you can't you can't escape. Reckoning once you're dead you can't put something behind you or ignore it or forget it and so that becomes the only real Sin since you have in your mind the ability to avoid it. I mean that's why rich people take such good care of themselves and make taking care of themselves a core part of their identity and part of their morality. That's the key part uh and so death is the only sin but death is embedded in life and inextricable from life and therefore cannot be a sin so that load-bearing structure of like secular Calvinism that we're all to one degree or another.

Uh enmeshed in I know I am anyway again I'm talking about myself and I just hope. It resonates that's how I'm able to feel like it means something and that I'm not just being crazy. Uh like the difference between me and somebody on the on. The street corner is that the guy in the street corner doesn't have people listening to him going uh-huh right okay that makes sense. But it's not a sin to die so that means that any oh oh oh is as forgivable as any Act because everything will be forgiven. I do believe that I believe damnation is is a heaven is not. Uh. Heaven is not a scam pie and this people say like pie in the sky when you die is a scam no uh because all of that is just a way to talk around the ineffable sensation of uh reconciliation. Uh hell is a permanent state that is a ideological artifact of class Society because if we did all like really know believe that then so much pressure would be off and all the things that make us feel like we need to exploit one another would go away. That's what that's that's always been the apocalyptic rise of Christianity. Christ Christ was I think a political figure. He wanted the Jews to get together and stop uh miserating one another on behalf of the  Romans. They wanted them to they. They wanted the Jews to live as in Covenant with one another but how could they do that if they feared the Romans only if they had no fear so people will go so plenty of we're all going to go to hell to one degree or another. It's not going to be great what it's going to look like how it's going to feel. It's going to vary from person to person. A lot of it is going to be felt here on Earth by living people but it is it's a uh. It's a passage like everything else.

I do think death is going through a black hole. Basically something comes out the other side. It's not you uh. But it's alive because life is eternal in in the orb. In the orb we find ourselves in spaghetti. I don't know why someone wrote that but I'm hungry the butterfly wakes up from the dream that was Shang TSU word. It's true people say dying is like going to sleep but you wake up when you sleep exactly you wake up somewhere because it is localized someone said uh but it's somewhere else and that's the scary part because that's somewhere else can be and I think historically in certain places has been successfully prefigured in the world. The life you live in here but now that's broken. Now we've created hell on Earth so how can it how can we imagine that there's anywhere else to wake up to but hell but the hell we've created is is a is an illusion. It is an imposition a a false sense of a false imposition of a of a disembodied consciousness that has been severed from its uh generative root. But we all individually one way or the other come back into contact with that root throughout our lives and then finally and then summarily in the ending of Our Lives okay. There we go I know that was long sorry now I'm thinking about a dang Fish Fry. At the VFW right. We did go to those in Manitowoc Wisconsin the VFW uh VFW Hall. They had because fried perch rye bread uh applesauce and potato pancakes which I thought were kind of gross. But I really love the perch walleye is good. Also.

I think a part of what's annoying at me is that yes I should be working on a book but it is my fear that stops me from it. It's my fear of being when put on the page misinterpreted because uh I'm a lazy uh kind of dumb guy. Uh and uh a lot of what allows me to think clearly and express. Myself is the crutch of the ephemeral nature of of this sort of stuff and then previous generations of of media which require you know. Uh concrete expression uh freak me out. But I will say that I have co-written all of the uh hell on Earth. Podcasts like this isn't going to be hella about presidents where it's mostly me just sort of riffing which I did because I've of that anxiety. Uh I would try to write stuff down and it would freak me out too much and uh I think it was good. But I I do feel like I have gotten uh. I've got I've been able to refine things more uh in the project here so I have been writing and I do think that the stuff that's in this podcast will be the basis for future writing uh my main challenge right. Now is I is is some way to integrate the spiritual stuff with the historical stuff because it's easy to talk about one or the other but talking about either in isolation feels insufficient uh that's why like fiction seems like it might be the way to do that. Historically it has been but you know again. Fiction requires a aesthetic element that I don't that I I question in myself because of my many uh uh self-doubts ah that was good.

Yeah. I feel like I just fill up kind of with sort of pus because there is so much of my life that I is not the time is not spent constructively. Uh and I I because of my you know because the chains I forged in life. Uh and after a while I perversely try to kind of increase that sense of anxiety because it motivates me to do the things that I've been conditioned to enjoy. Even though I know that they don't bring me any real satisfaction and then I can Lance it. What I want to do more is is integrate my actions in such a way that the build up is less uh. That's what I'm trying to do anyway. I'm I'm very sorry. I hope I hope this hasn't been total gibberish.

Okay folks uh take it sleazy oh. You know what I'll go a little longer because somebody asked about a book. I have not decided whether to do this I want some feedback for anyone who's read this. What about three body problems has anyone read that do you think it would work for this format. I know it's I know. It's a Sci-Fi novel all right. We'll do we'll start uh. Maybe I'll read like the first chapter for next week. I haven't even bought it yet because I just thought of this today as an idea uh. So we'll probably just do like. Maybe first chapter intro uh next week or maybe. I don't know I know Christmas is coming up. But we'll see all right Stella Maris. I'll look that up oh the new the new McCarthy perhaps I think we'll do. I think we'll do three body problem first though all right bye.
