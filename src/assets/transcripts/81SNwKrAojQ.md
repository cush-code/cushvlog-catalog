Hey hey I am indeed america's most trusted news stork. I'm here to be historic delivering news dropping. It swaddled in baby blankets through your chimney which you will now absorb uh. I feel great. I don't know about you guys. I'm definitely not drowning in my own mucus. Unlike some people I know uh man. It's funny how things get interesting very quickly. Isn't it uh. Obviously the big news that just happened is that trump went on to twitter and said yeah no checks no checks before the election if you vote for me maybe you'll get one which is the perfect type of dumbass uh politicking that a  like trump would do thinking that it was smart like. He thinks that that's genius like oh no people are going to want to check and then they're going to vote for me to get one forgetting. The fact that trump that biden is is also saying that he would give checks and bigger ones uh and the fact that with any of trump's promises to make things better if you vote for him. The problem always is well. Why don't you do it now. Why don't you make my life better. Now you're literally waiting you're telling me. I only can get my life better at all. Whether it's stopping the rioting or getting checks to people if you vote for me.

And it's not supposed to be that explicit you know that's the thing with trump is that he he takes the implicit premises of a lot of politicking the stuff that people are supposed to only be subliminally suggested and he makes it explicit and when it comes to stuff like race and dog whistles turning into shouts. People freak out about it. But the fact is is that in general it's a little heavy-handed and I don't know if it has always has the effect he wants it to have and I think in this case it's disastrously terrible idea. The fact that they're letting him do. This honestly tells me that the republicans have written him off. They have made the smart choice to say he is a polarizing figure. His value is is no longer uh no longer excellent we've squeezed all the juice we can out of this particular lemon uh and now the best thing to do especially since we've secured the courts forever from from the entire federal apparatus up to the supreme court uh we can just sit back. Let.

The democrats flail around for four years fail to deal with any of the problems that we've uh created and in fact may do our best to obstruct any attempt at fixing them which of course will be minimal because the republic democrats don't have any more interest in fixing anything than we do and then come sweeping back in in 2024 and take the presidency which of course is always what people who are terrified of what comes after trump uh. I don't know what that is I've given up guessing. I will say though I really think this is true less than a month before an election uh with the entire economy reeling and people facing mass eviction and and huge loss in income to not get a second round of checks out to people before the election. It just tells me that that that that right-wing populism that people are afraid of happening this sort of josh hawley uh heronvolk democracy where we get white medicare for all or something. I don't think that's gonna happen uh. I don't think that that's going to occur. I think that the republican party is still well in control by capital as is the democratic party and capital has a bipartisan consensus to not get people too used to free money from the government and as such no one is has that much leeway to really be the huey long-esque.

Every man a king uh. Uh figure from either party you know and so that means that we're just gonna get more culture war. I would say on the horizon uh well. The material conditions just keep getting worse uh and with no one doing really even suggesting anything to be done about them and no bidding war along actual economic access. It's going to be pure grievance and I mean. I can get it from mcconnell's perspective like mcconnell. He's got he's gonna get amy uh cohen brothers on the court uh and that's all he really cares about. All he's had his eye on and he doesn't really care who the president is because he rightly understands that at this point it's sort of meaningless as long as the constraints as long as the uh aperture of political action stays where it is and making sure that there isn't even a possibility of trump becoming a populist uh kingpin uh uh as long as that's off the table. Then he doesn't really have to worry and now it's off the table. The fact that trump allowed them to do. This really does speak to the fact that he's too stupid to assert the authority that he could have because it is amazing. He is a person who hypothetically could go to war with the entire political apparatus.

He could go to war with the republican party and the democratic party and create and really create a third force in american politics. But it would have to be somebody other than him to do that but nobody other than him could be in a position to do that to me. That's endlessly fascinating the only person who could have threatened the needle in 20 2016 was donald trump but because he was donald trump he does not have the interests uh the political uh the political agenda or ambition or vision like he's not a political person. He doesn't actually care about the structure of american politics in any way which means that he will have no. He has spent no time in the last four years actually doing anything to stand out from conventional republicans when it comes to governing.

It's all been at the level of rhetoric and at the level of spectacle because it would require too much investment to try to push back against the dominant ideologies within the republican party as evidenced by the fate of poor steve bannon who got turfed within six months because there was nobody else who had his back and assure  wasn't going to be trump either and now. The the upshot of that is that they're willing to sacrifice him and they someone convinced him that this was the smart thing to do because it's like I guess because it it makes it. He makes him feel like he's in charge to tell them yeah. No no no more stimulus you got to elect me to get more stimulus with no understanding that this means that he is now the man who is taking responsibility for people suffering through this  crisis for at least months with no end in sight astounding amazingly amazing you know what we love. It folks don't we and of course this is now making it look more and more like you could see a genuine landslide which could lead to biden winning and the democrats taking the senate and it will be very fascinating to watch them fail to do anything with that power on purpose. That'll be that'll be very entertaining to watch uh and I think that that's really what mcconnell's bet is and it's this good one is that he doesn't really have anything to fear from the republi democrats in power in terms of really changing the dynamics of power uh or influence uh in in government or changing popular perceptions of what government can do uh or the responsibility to you.


So he's in a cat bird seat with or I guess the the turtle bird seat. I should say or the cat turtle seat actually just the turtle turtle seat. No other animal just the turtle seat. He's there he's on his flat what a hot rock he's sunning himself. He's in his glory and nancy pelosi of course thinks that she's being a genius too by. It's so funny. Her attempt is very clear like she she doesn't have any incentive to see checks go up before election night. Either right. She wants to see trump get trump have this around his neck but there's usually you would have to worry about your opponent realizing the obviousness of that and not falling into the trap you've laid. Meanwhile they had they just led trump out to fall onto the spikes like a  cow just because they told him that he'd look very strong if he did that you look very strong. Mr president and yes people are definitely gonna care more about in the last three weeks before the election. They're gonna be much more invested in this. Religious weirdo nobody's ever heard of than getting actual money in their bank account you're 100 right about that. Mr president someone says amy kevin garnett that's good amy that's actually one of the best ones amy kindergarten that's not bad so yeah. Pelosi is uh is being gifted in her enemies uh which is the greatest blessing you can have which of course is the blessing that trump had when he had to run against hillary and I think I really hope that this election.

This 2020 final will really clarify retroactively that whole phenomenon and tell us that that the whole trump phenomenon really was partially at least I mean obviously it has real basis but the phenomenon of him being the president for four years is sort of an indian summer situation created by the specific catastrophic insanity of having hillary clinton run for president. I mean just the only person who could have lost that election and I think that over time I i think at the time people recognized that she was the only person who could have lost that election but then trump's specific center of gravity his ability to consume all light kind of obscured that and he became the whole world and I think a lot of people kind of lost that perspective and started thinking okay things are different now we're in a new world. I know I felt like that sometimes but I think now people are sort of sobering up a little bit. You know 200 000 dead no coronavirus elise and and like there could have been something to trump. But as I said he would have had to have been a different person and since he wasn't. It's going to end up being this false dawn and I think we're probably we're not.

I don't think we're going to get some sort of heron volk uh movement because there clearly is not any interest in that at the level of establishment republican power and the only way that you can say that that could be counteracted at the grassroots is if you were to have somebody who could take trump's entire base in hand but direct it uh like to an actual political goal which is what people say they're worried about tucker or whatever happened or josh hawley or or cotton doing and as I said yesterday. I don't think any of those guys have the range. I don't think any of them can fill that role they could get a chunk but I don't think they're going to get the whole thing which is what they need to to be uh effective against resisting the actual party that they're trying to uh push against because we have seen what happens when you try to uh move from with like use party structures in this country against the parties. When trump did in 2016 there was minimal resistance at the institutional level just because he was only seen as a transient threat until he became the candidate at which point he was seen as someone who could be controlled which largely he has been you know like at the individual level. A lot of these guys have been humiliated and some of them are going to die because they thought that they could control trump like  new jersey. Uh but the institutions and the people who actually hold institutional power are largely uh still where they were before uh but bernie. On the other hand. The democrats threw out all the  stops and made sure that he wasn't gonna uh be able to challenge the institutional prerogatives of the democratic party and I don't think there's anybody on the horizon who who can channel that trump lightning in a bottle but not be a tv dumbass because him being a tv dumbass is such a huge part of it.

It's so it's you can't disentangle them. Like the idea of trumpism without trump is a little incoherent like it's. It's the same thinking that tells that a lot of people use to say oh like we can we can do like. We can re-pitch socialism like through the lens of patriotism or whatever or or you know like do entitlement reform but or I mean like a push expansion of entitlements but using nationalist language. When these things are coded in certain ways that are intertwined you know at like the symbolic level and and and pulling one meaning out of them is beyond the the uh abilities of any of any one individual. The only person who can capture the imagination the way trump did is somebody who is a being of pure spectacle of pure td game show energy without any heart to it if he had a heart. If if he had a a political valence. His career would have been different and he wouldn't have been able to be everybody to everyone the way that he was grant cardone who the hell is that who the  is grant cardone if I've never heard of him. I'm not worried about him. I'll say that and the kanye thing no kanye doesn't have the uh. I guess focus to do it. I'm gonna look at some cards. Gonna look at some golf war trading cards see what's going on. He's a scientologist social media guru and real estate. Uh creep well that guy sounds cool and I could definitely see him becoming like a crooked senator or something. But I don't think he's gonna lead the political party in four years.

What have we got. We've got the m60 main battle tank. This thing looks pretty cool. It's got a 105 millimeter gun for more firepower. It was an important part of the desert storm. You know they still make tanks. They still make a ton of tanks and they are the the the army actually says we don't need any more tanks and then they just requisition more because we have places that build tanks and so we just say no no no you need more tanks and so they just have these giant tank graveyards where they just all hang out don't do anything don't use them for anything.

It's pretty amazing then there's another one oh here we go syria oh. They'll come up they'll pop up. A little later didn't get any credit for uncle sam for being on our side in the gulf war. That's the one thing we need to know about america is that those motherf those hoes ain't loyal that is one thing we know about oh. My god military skill heroes don't do drugs. None of the us armed services tolerates drug use drugs impair the ability to think and move just like in civilian life. A soldier's success and survival depend on clear thoughts and careful actions. Good soldiers and good civilians never take chances with illegal drugs and here we got uh geography jerusalem. I don't know what this has to do with the war in iraq. It's interesting how they kind of sneak in these like references to uh israel like sideways in the in the cards as sort of a background context for our deep investment in the middle east as a strategic terrain. But they don't say it explicitly jerusalem and athens the two cities.


But I also think that trump doesn't want to be president anymore. I honestly. I mean at this point. Especially he was not having fun before he got the uh the novel coronavirus and now he's. I think legitimately miserable. But I think yeah this bind this biden. Uh this biden term is going to be very interesting because it is it's going to be a real lab test. It's going to be the exact same admiseration and horror and corruption and institutional failure that we and rot that we have seen in the last four years but there will be none of the hysteric cultural frenzy around his presidency. The way there is with trump and what fills that void that's what I want to know what cultural fixation like do we really get into flagpole sitting and stuffing people into elevators like it's or uh telephone booths. Like it's the 1920s like is it bear baiting. What do we get what do we do. What do we do to fill our emotional void that all this politics is going to leave how are we gonna. How are we gonna process right. Now we're processing the trauma of the political moment through the spectacle of the trump presidency.

But biden's presidency is going to be intentionally uh diffused of that symbolic energy. But that energy's got to go somewhere. Avatar too someone says I agree that would be amazing if the if the biden the biden term is just avatar. Mania like avatar takes over and people are getting full-bodied navy tattoos and and and they're turning into reenactment societies and there's entire intentional communities that are trying to recreate uh uh pandora people living in trees and  each other with uh synthetic uh tails that they've had surgically implanted onto their bodies. Let's do it and then james cameron can run for president as a third party. Uh candidate although he is canadian that could be a problem. But he'll be so popular that we will elect him and uh overturn the constitutional amendment on the same day by acclimation. So how are and most importantly how are these people how are all the people including myself who've like turned politics into a into an identity. How are they going to walk down from that or are.

They not are they going to somehow find a way to get that roundup in the machinations of the biden administration. This senescent old man just sitting in the oval office talking to corn pop in his head. He's having he's having a a meeting with porn pop and uh jane mansfield uh. Beau is there of course and just his dead wife and they're all just uh talking about how they're gonna pass a bill to make sure that root beer tastes good again and meanwhile the gears just continue to turn and you get reassured that well you know if the republic if the democrats just had 75 senators we could finally get something done and it's your fault. You don't you didn't believe in them enough to vote to make sure that there were 100 democratic senators which would allow us to actually make things better one billion senators. Let's do it one billion american senators. Every every man every man a senator but no one wears a sash that's one thing we could bring to american politics. They have that in latin america sashes sashes of office you know we don't we don't wear enough sashes in american politics.

Japan has sashes everyone's got sashes but us god we make politics such a spectacle. Yet we don't have any of the fun putterances of that. My favorite attempt was uh nixon in the in. During nixon's term he made an attempt to have the secret service wear uniforms and they were they basically looked like they were in a marching band they had piping and they had I think epaulets and white gloves and everyone thought. It was very goofy and embarrassing and they got rid of it pretty quickly but yeah for a brief period. Under nixon. The secret service wore uniforms and that makes sense because nixon was one of those guys who actually did take seriously. The the presidency as we imagine it right because the only way the presidency makes sense is an office given how much power they're officially bestowed within the constitutional order and how much in uh focus they have in our political mind and our political imagination.

That person is essentially the one-man embodiment of the state like truly like type deal you're like you are in charge of everything relations with every country in the world. The grand trajectory of american foreign policy and domestic policy uh and when you talk about things like global warming. The  planet which is of course insane and crazy and no president can actually do that and most of them. I think understand at a certain level that that's not the actual job but nixon thought it was. Nixon thought that he was at the crossroads of all human history and that he was the one man who saw the future of the american project and was the one man who could steward it uh to successful fruition. Meaning that he saw the end of unipalat unipolarity uh he saw the end because he saw the end of uh. He saw the end of the amer. He saw the end of america as the industrial uh heart of the world economy. He saw the he saw the end of america as the producer and he saw that it was going to become a consumer because when he took when he removed uh gold convertibility he ended the final vestige of the gold standard with the dollar. It meant that uh dollar circulation was going to be predicated on budget or on trade deficits which meant we were going to have to produce much less and buy much more and that meant that we weren't going to be in that position of our golden age and that we were going to have to walk basically negotiate away from that to a multi-polar world and he was the only one who saw it and he was going to do whatever it took to make it happen which of course is why he was an isolated maniac who tried to run the entire foreign policy of the united states out of his own office with henry kissinger and why the intelligence community saw him as a threat and why he spent his last years in office getting shit-faced on the white house on the presidential yacht and watching patton because that job is not the job as created and conceived of is not doable and shouldn't exist like.

I said this after 2016 trump should be the last president and I hold I hold strong to that and the fact that we're making honestly the fact that we're about to elect biden by such a huge if it happens such a such a big. Uh margin proves that because clearly no one really believes that this job is what we think it is so why not get rid of it. Why not remove this absurd anachronism from our system if we're so cavalier with it. That we're just gonna let anybody who's either entertaining or uh tells us reassuring stories about uh putting hair nets on and fighting people with uh bike chains in the 1950s. Like it's the concrete jungle. No more presidents come on get out of here with the presidency.


I'm looking at some of these questions what's the best ape uh gotta say not humans. Certainly. Orangutans seem pretty chill. I like those guys gorillas too. I mean chimps are generally considered kind of  and of course that's because they're the most similar to humans give me yeah like a nice. A nice chill orangutang nice chill vibing orangut people are saying things like uh gibbons and stuff those are not apes. Those are monkeys that's a different question how dare you okay. So I've watched the first episode of the good lord bird uh and I don't know how many episodes there are. It was only the first one uh.

I will say that I really really did not like it. Uh it was basically the exact opposite of the of what I would want out of something like that and I know understand that it's based on a book and like that it's not about john brown like john brown's a character in another story uh but I get that I just think that the approach the material is bad. I think that it is. It's it's not interesting as I guess what I'd say because I'm not interested in how we from this perspective. This point in history like view this kind of stuff because that's pretty easily designable. I think trying to recreate that psychic terrain and like grapple with you know history as a foreign country is much more interesting and I did not feel that from that at all it really it killed me. The first thing the first scene is. It's it's it's john round about to be hanged being taken to the gallows and it's a voice over from the from the main character who is this.

Uh this former slave who was liberated as a child in kansas by john brown and knew him over the like the last decade or so of his life and he says he says some. He says some black people think that he's uh uh you know he was a hero. Some black people think he was some  heart because okay that's understandable from the this from that from now right like yes. I can understand anybody saying that now black or white or any other racial background. Saying like this is that the like maybe not even as a real person but like as a as a as a historical personages and as a as a character that people like cleave to one way or the other that he is a white savior yes but do. I think that a character who lived through that period would say that or think that or communicate that as a belief. I don't think so and that's the violence to the historical tapestry that I find kind of repulsive were people really thinking about like oh oh sick of these male ass white saviors in when slavery was happening and john brown was one of a handful of white people to take black equality seriously to the point of risking his own life and life of his family maybe. But I'll say this I've never seen it. I've not seen any evidence that that was anything like a common view and it's just more than anything feels.

Not interesting. It just feels like I can get these takes on twitter. I don't need them in a show so I will watch the whole thing but I'm not happy about. It did not like ethan hawk at all because he's playing it as a complete psycho like absolute maniac and we'll see where it goes with that like. I might this might be a misdirect but watching the first episode. I really got the impression that the show was essentially taking at face value.

The old dunning school claimed that john brown had to have been insane because you'd have to be insane to be a white man and take equality seriously and but now this is like in this moment. The woke take is that yeah white people can't really be not racist and the idea of any white person truly pursuing like uh. Uh equality in life is in some way delusional or or is racist but not in a way that they can recognize. And I think that that's a kind of like race pessimism that I think is one wrong and two really depressing and frankly  politically counterproductive because I just do not see the upshot here where everyone is supposed to believe that racial chasms are unbridgeable. We cannot really ever cooperate across racial lines except white people being compelled by guilt. That's the only way and yet. But somehow we're going to create a coalition in this moment of profound crisis that will have the necessary trust to be able to operate meaningfully. I don't think so. I think the opposite is what you're  spectrum to the other that the only safe harbor is race is is the is the certainty of race and you'll have like a few academic white people who will take that to mean well. I need to abnegate my race like pathologically and I'm going to. I'm going to just be the opposite of of what I think my identity is which good luck with that. That's not that's a recipe for uh in first psychological uh uh schizophrenia honestly uh or or you recognize and everyone else is gonna just end up going back towards uh just towards racial politics at its most uh suspicious and hostile and and that means that every demagogue of every stripe will be able to guarantee that where's there's never any meaningful resistance to the capitalist onslaught of uh total uh spiritual and material alienation and and uh and destruction.


So I'll keep an eye on it but not not very pleased with the first episode and also just from a pure aesthetic perspective uh. It did this thing where it would just like skip scenes and just like kind of jump ahead and and it kind of deflated any kind of dramatic tension and made it feel just sort of like uh. It gave it it had that like and then and then picturesque feeling that I i tend not to like because it drains things of momentum because so anyway we'll see not not not encouraged. After the first episode gibbons are apes really huh. I didn't know I thought gibbons had tails learn something. New. Chris is here he's uh he's laying in the cut. He's looking at the at the comments he's judging all of you for your bad questions. He's got a list of bad questions and he has your handles next to them and uh after three strikes you get banned isn't that right chris. Uh. I actually am not sure how to ban people from the chat oh um.

I also watched uh good lord byrd oh what do you think uh. I probably liked it more than you I i I am familiar with with the john brown meet those uh though. I don't have a pre-meditated take on how I would want to portray it um. I've listened to your takes on it and what you would like to see i. I understand your criticism of hawke's performance. But I do think that even given what you've discussed. I appreciate you know even though as you say that he's playing him as a total psychopath not psychopath but a crazy person here. It is like a half step away from what you would want to portray is that you know the the religious fervor and belief people felt at that time is incredibly alien to us today yeah. Uh although I will say that it was often played like when he was talking to that rabbit about you know whether it felt god in its heart or whatever you know as a joke well.

The thing is is that he's the only one who's that yeah religiously like all even his uh. Even his sons and stuff are all rolling their eyes at it. Like every other character is modern and except for him yeah and to me and and then so he's just this this absolute specimen of like a a pre-modern era that is like caught in a glass jar but what that does is. It turns his anti-slavery sentiment just into another pathology of religious mania. Like not that it's rooted in anything like I think that you could make it. I would argue is was john brown insane of course. John brown was insane because the only coherent uh definition of insanity is a social one right. Like you can't say that insanity has some sort of intrinsic definition to a person that is not just a con a social context uh you because you know we're all building reality in our heads. The only way we know if they're conforming to the real world is if other people agree with us and john brown was insane because to be a white man in that era and to truly believe in racial equality was to be by the social contact by the social mores of the time to be insane.

It was it was a it was a disordered thought it was not. It was not a rational or reasoned response to the world around you because everyone knew that that wasn't the case and they and worst of all you ended up if you believe that kind of thing in that social context. Over time your actions will become more violent and erratic because of the inability of you to live in accordance with those beliefs. So yes he was insane but that says more about like the social order of the time and to me what I didn't get what I got from this and we'll see if it persists is that the show has that cynical you know like half-wise like afro-pessimist thing of like yeah that was always true and john brown was kidding himself to think that america could ever think that black and white people were equal which made him insane and and so therefore those all those white racists were more right and more sane than he was you know what I mean yeah. We'll see though yeah um.

I mean currently reading a little bit of 19th century american history. One of the things that stands out to me is you know we've all been keyed up over especially over the last four years of you know the constant frettering that they're that america is on the brink of some psychological break and just really diving into the uh. Especially like post 1830. The state of your average politically engaged american the amount of edging towards insanity over a number basically over the slavery issue. It seems much much higher yeah. I mean we did. We actually did a war. We did yeah yes but but just the general tenor of of denunciations renunciations even just the language that people would use in mainstream from one congress person to another.

They were beating each other up in congress yeah about about like the perfidy uh and and uh destitution of soul and spirit of of of the opposing sides and then was about as uh as it's just on a whole another level of keyed up. It's on that alien level where we we it is a foreign to even try to comprehend how these people built these issues in their psyche yeah because they are insane issues yeah the issue of of agreeing with or disagreeing with the widespread social acceptance of human bondage yeah and it doesn't it. It doesn't seem to me to take like the premise that it is in fact slavery that makes that mania it is the imposition of that system that drives the mania you know uh rather. It's this cynical after the fact observation of well look what happened after the war look at our failure to integrate black people into american society at every level look at the persistence of racism well maybe those uh those you know red. Uh maybe those uh rough border ruffians in kansas. I mean they won they were right and and john brown. Therefore from our perspective is the insane one because his uh dream was unattainable in this country and I don't know if that like.


I said. I don't think that cynicism is is warranted and I sure  art. Nowadays. I did not find it something interesting or uh evocative to watch uh. I did appreciate uh our boy from lodge 49 yonker russell showing up as a young jeb stewart yes young jeb stewart. He did he did a decent job with the accent. I mean he's got the face for uh a civil war guy definitely and the beard but yeah. I think I'm gonna do now after this is over. I'm gonna watch. The whole thing. I'm gonna do a inebriated past on john brown and the coming of the civil war and his sort of place in american history because I feel like we're losing it. It's like we went from dunning school where he was crazy for thinking black. People were equal because obviously they aren't uh to now. He's crazy because he thought white people could be not racist which obviously they can't be which to me. Both of them lead to the same place. Some sort of racial separation in racial endless racial conflict defining american uh society until a point of uh apocalyptic confrontation because what's the alternative if you can't have one polity if you cannot have a trans-racial american polity that can coordinate across racial lines and trust one another across racial lines to build a project and to invest in it. Then how the hell are we going to be anything other than just stripped of everything and then set to war against one another on the most flimsy premises and across the most cynically obs. Uh uh reified racial and and absolutely fundamentally abs uh um illusory racial differences uh. I'm. I'm gonna not I'm gonna switch topics for a bit just because it's funny that uh this came up today with an ongoing project. I have but. I have an answer for your question of where all that anima goes uh in the joe biden administration that cultural fervor that we've built ourselves into arguing over the president uh and it is arguing an eternity about whether infinite jest is good or not god. It's it's eternal recurrence on twitter doc. If you don't believe in eternal recurrence. Just spend a year on twitter and note how many times the same arguments and the exact same contours come up over and over again.

It's like it's like they're they're. David foster wallace takes out of their system and then they go back into dormancy until they arise again. There's something about. I don't know what it is. There's something about there's some sort of gender anxiety. I guess it's so funny that that is the thing that became such a locus of gender anxiety around it. So the background of this is that a few weeks ago uh molly uh my wife uh and I started a project because she has read infinite. Just multiple times loves the book and I have never read infinite. Jest we keep seeing these things come up and we were like we sh we need to to uh I mean excuse me for being flippant but we need to clear this narrative and have the uh the woman of the couple read to me uh the book uh and so that's what we're doing in a podcast. She's reading it on the podcast as an audiobook and and to me and then uh you know we're chatting about it afterwards. And we did it especially because we knew that this would keep coming up and then we could keep promoting it. Every time people were arguing. It's pretty good.

It's pretty smart move you're not going to go broke uh anticipating this bursting forth and what's so funny about it is. It's clearly this gender anxiety. But it's very specific urban. I hate to use the term but there's no other word for it. Pmc or an overproduced elites who are who are who who who live in like this post-feminist world where they're supposed to be you know encountering one another romantically on equal level. But there is this lack of trust and this anxiety about like maleness as this as this toxic set of traits and but because we're talking about a very small subset of you know urban professional educated uh guys. It has to be personified by like the symbols. Around this 1200 page  read infinite jest the very idea that this is a stand-in for like aggressive masculinity is just proof of how distorted this lends in and you're talking about this tiny subsection of american men who at the end of the day it sucks to date because everything sucks everyone's miserable. Everything sucks nobody has any money. Nobody has any security and we uh just project these anxieties about the other that then wrap around these absurd.

Uh shibboleths but anyway I've actually read the book and it's good. I'm not enjoying it so far. But it's only 42 pages in it's going to probably take 500 episodes two-ish years to get done. You will finish you'll finish the project broadcasting from like a  ham radio in a climate refugee camp yep and we will still continue it. It's called infinite cast soundcloud.com infinite dash cast yeah sorry to promo on the cushion. No please do so i. I hope. I know that's a very gauche so in a year and a half when you get to the eschaton scene. I would like to come on because that's my favorite. So I'll pivot to this matt. What's your favorite jacob wool scheme of all time. Uh. I mean the thing where he had the guy come out and talk about uh how he got sexually dominated by elizabeth warren yeah. That's the clear answer. That's what I was. Gonna say that's pretty funny. The guy couldn't even not laugh that's really funny. He was like literally laughing while he read it uh. I actually saw when we saw him in. Uh was it concord or manchester what's the capital of new hampshire new manchester. I think it was manchester. We saw him in manchester at the lobby of hotel.

He brought donuts and the only people who he was able to muster for his press. Conference were us and two autograph hounds who hung out in the lobby to like see political celebrities uh which means they were absolute cool people and the uh bosses 100 one of them was like an old dude and the other one was a young kid in a maga hat who who didn't recognize jacob wall and wall couldn't keep a straight face during that one when he had the guy come out and say that biden has parkinson's and that he had met him at secret rich people. Parkinson's support group meetings with michael j fox and  and that was really a a high point for me was just thinking like okay buddy. What what's in your head what are you up to because now he's in trouble for doing actual voter fraud and voter suppression and vote. Tampering that could get him in actual prison which was not a bit like that was actual uh criminal activity and yet he was clearly doing like the biden stuff as a in some respect as a joke. He's a fascinating figure to me to me. He is the most interesting of all these guys. The the funniest part of uh of that was the the the maga kid who was looking for autographs of like. I don't know one of the hosts of uh fox and friends or whatever and we were like.

Hey are you going to get wolves autograph and he was like. I don't know who that is and it was like. It was like a rock and roll autograph hunter standing two feet from lou reed and that's serious. I don't know. I don't know who this guy is yeah up your game young man yes up your game young bud uh 20 minutes before that. Though when we got to the hotel we got to see brian. Kilmeade failed to open a door for about five minutes that was very funny he kept like rattling on it.


It wouldn't open god what a what a dummy um the roast more uh chat questions in the chat. I have a few from a while ago. But I have no idea how uh how relevant they are today or anymore. These are my oh. I just want to say one other thing about infinite jest uh and it was a tweet that I retweeted from someone else today forget who it was uh that it is very funny to always see. These takes on infinite. Jest specifically takes denigrating it on a website that is a entertainment product so addictive that people spend their entire lives on it and in fact lose their sense of sanity and perspective by gazing at it which even I know is the literal plot of infinite jets. Yes the the the unmarked vid card given to the uh. The attache yep yeah the one that I'm through that part like the thing about that book and you'll find this out as you read it is. It is incredibly uh uh president president he clearly knew where everything was headed. He he saw how uh uh the spectacle was isolating people and and providing this this narcotic for for that sense of alienation uh. But the one thing that he couldn't have predicted because it seems like nobody in the in the 90s really knew what the internet was going to be was the interactivity you know because his his his entertainment ends up being just watching something you know and the thing is is. It was what it turned out is it couldn't be watching something there has to be an interactive element. There has to be a a further not just the fantasy of the narrative that you're absorbing but a fantasy of participation in the narrative.

That's the final ingredient. That's what turns it from morphine to fentanyl and that's that's where we are uh okay. Let's go maybe go back to this let. Me see what this question says uh. I mean. I feel like I know the answer this but I kind of want to go back to talking about this in the future. What happens to stimulus talk to trump in a lame duck session with a big electoral defeat uh and nothing will get passed. I mean. I think we have to be be ready for the fact that I don't think anything's getting passed possibly forever and I think we'll get something if there has to be something in january. Just. I mean for the markets like at the end of the day when you wonder like what needs to happen the thing. That's going to be the gun to the head will always be the markets uh and and for for just like there needed to be a stimulus for the first time. Even though it was not anything anyone wanted to do as a first order preference because of the of the precedent set there's gonna be another situation. They're gonna need that uh but not before that. I don't think and so things are gonna be really really bad uh and like.

I said the thing to watch is if the if the democrats win the senate back which I said. I think they will watch what they do with the filibuster because if they if they if they don't do something to mod to uh to reduce the power of the senate minority to uh to stop legislation. They're not going to do anything in a previous stream. I've said that the uh my prediction for for big signature policy for mobident administration is is some kind of aca but for climate uh and I still think that that might be true if they have the political capital for it. But I i have updated that to having actually read something about the congress priorities.

The uh the hr one which is the voting rights bill yes and that makes total sense because voting rights are the only thing the only thing in the democratic. Uh putative wheelhouse of policies that they actually care about because it impacts impacts their ability to maintain voter share and therefore share of power and without an a consistent vote share that reflects a consistent ability to influence policy. They are not useful to the people that they work for and so they need to protect their vote share and the one thing that I think they've been genuinely scared of under trump is that slide towards just outright vote uh um nullification because and and and that's what they're actually going to spend any of their capital on is re rebalancing the political structure in a way that guarantees their continued access to voteshare after that. I think it'll be a bunch of uh glad-handing  with no real teeth to it which is very is very funny and perfect because right now and especially as we entered the summer. There. The democratic leadership response to literally any issue is vote what are you going to do to prevent uh them filling the supreme court seat nancy pelosi well vote vote you have to vote uh which is why I will be writing in merrick garland uh on the ballot uh in november yeah um but then their signature their move. After they get the votes is to do one big move to get more votes and then after that who knows and then they'll get nothing passed but they'll say we just don't have enough uh senators vote please. Now you can you know no excuse. We we secured your vote. We've secured your voter integrity. So now you better vote for us and if you and if we don't get anything done it's because you didn't vote enough for us.

It's the perfect uh. It's the logic of uh like a water douser or a faith healer. If it doesn't work. It's because you didn't pay enough or believe enough and it can never be disproven which is what's so funny about how many people who think like that really believe that they're being the most logical rational adults in the room. When the thing that they pin their entire political faith on is an is a transparent scam. It's pie in the sky when you die like uh like uh joe hill. I believe wrote um. I don't know if you have any interest in this one matt but somebody keeps asking about jade helm 15 which is just very funny to me because the the move over five years from being terrified that the uh the government is going to use walmart's to stage a national um use net walmart's to stage a a national guard invasion of texas to the republican president pledging to invade democratic cities yeah well. I mean that's that's the thing though is that none of it is none of those principles are real. Everyone's principle is power. That's the only principle americans have is power and the only american uh value is contempt for weakness which is why trump getting coveted is so bad for him because he looks  weak.

That's it doesn't matter. These infected 500 people he's typhoid mary of washington. Dc doesn't matter that his policies helped lead to hundreds of thousands maybe a hundred thousand unnecessary deaths and who many how he knows more after that. It's that he's he's uh he himself got sick he didn't. He lost the mandate of heaven by contracting coronavirus and and it proved that he was a weakling and uh and mercy. Uh mercy is for the weak and the weak must be destroyed and the strong shall inherit the week's reward as they said on wonder chosen.


The strong shall inherit the week's reward people keep posting this and I'm not sure how to believe it but apparently facebook just instituted a full q anon ban oh. That's gonna work remember when 4chan banned pizzagate and then they created 8chan which then created q anon uh yes. Nbc news facebook bands queuing on across its platforms. Oh boy is that part of the hashtag plan do you think like how do you how do you square that how do how are they doing right now. I mean obviously. I know that they're i. I mean obviously no one very few. People are going to be really disillusioned by this some will like I've said like everyone does not have an equal commitment to these things and that's why you can't think of it in terms of like an entire movement flipping overnight or staying loyal overnight. It's going to be a gradual process. Some people are going to fall away. Some people are going to double down and I'm just interested in specifically how the people who double down are going to rationalize everything especially if trump loses and leaves office and especially. I mean if he dies. I'm going to assume. They just think that he's gone but if he leaves office and is just there but not in charge anymore. I really don't know what they're going to do it'll be very interesting a lot of ways for things to go yes a lot of ends a lot of outs a lot of what happens. I do think it's interesting uh because obviously you know the 4chan people just created their own website but I don't know what these boomers are going to do without facebook. Like all they know how to do is post.

They are not computer savvy. I mean half of these people are still paying for aol disks even though they have broadband as part of their cable package. All right let's wrap it up yeah you wanna you wanna call for this evening yeah. Let's do it all right great um. This has been another issue issue. Another uh episode of the kush vlog. Grill stream say good night matt.
