Oh that's better that's better than last time when I make sure this thing was going oh time for some so I facing folks. It's my version of doing the scales musicians I got to do their voice maybe babalu well. I just have to do so face to get my jean the right position to issue the hottest. It takes just got craving some soy. I really want some soy right now ah. Where's my damn soy. Ah I might be getting a grill. Soon I've been thinking about it. They're extending this extending. They're probably never gonna let people out of their homes in New York here and like you know even if I wanted to ignore. It wouldn't know what if there's nowhere to go because nobody else is gonna ignore it either. So I'm stuck indoors. So I might as well actually start grilling yeah well. I want to try to do those beyond burners. They're pretty good and also sausages are very good. Too. I also have some steaks oh. They're in my freezer and I want to finish before they go bad so can. I grill it up. I got to get like a small medium sized. Weber or something. We've got to use car coal.

That's can't be too big either because they don't have a lot of space. Yet people were seeing. Bo bunglers place in the Hamptons which bore Thomas on Martha's Vineyard life is a drama. It's now where all the Democrats go apparently. It's a little st. James north and his awful house that looks like it's made of. Popsicle sticks his beige mansion. He's got one tiny little grill grill like that's probably gonna be about the size of the one. I get it my postage stamp back area. This guy's got 7 million acres if he can hunt humans for sport on and he's got one tiny little ass charcoal grill he doesn't even want to grill. The guy has no interest in grilling. It's a bad looking house and it reminds you.

These people have no taste that Edmund Burke you know in his defenses of the upper class. His defense against the French Revolutionary grand leveling his defense against the old ancient Society of orders was yes you have this wild disproportionate distribution of resources. But what that means is that people at the top who are able to spend less time. Working are able to have more refined. Tastes and sensibilities are able to use that money to build beautiful things that the rest of us can enjoy so the stained-glass cathedrals and you know the works of the Renaissance and all the beautiful just hung beautiful homes and in architecture and everything that the wealthy you know indulge in all their luxury has a certain aesthetic beauty to it that enlivens all of us. Even if we don't get to directly experience that through owning it. I mean of course you can argue about that and you can talk about you know. It's pretty clearly a specious argument on the behalf of a total ass kisser. But I don't think if you if you brought. Burke up from the dead he'd be able to say that there is any redeeming aesthetic sense any of the rich. We have now it's just been burned out of them. There's nothing left because the only reference point now is luxury. There's no cult wealth is so disconnected from people from my actual culture that there's no remaining sense of of like luxury expressing any kind of aesthetic or cultural values.

I think a good example of this is if anyone has been to Vegas you know in the past like. It's I think it's been within the last ten years. So Vegas the big the big places that went up in the first generation you know we're off the mob the mob places. The place is the Howard Hughes own. The casino era ones that like forget about that that's old Vegas new. Modern Vegas started in the early 90s with a big infusion of corporate money that went into the building of a bunch of themed family-style casinos. Getting rid of Vegas is seamy reputation and mob affiliations and replacing it with the idea of it being a place for the whole family. So what kind of things did they bake what kind of building what kind of casinos did they build. They built the Luxor which is a big crystal pyramid with us Fink's in front of it to recall agent Egypt xcalibur which is just a giant cheesy castle of medieval Europe. They got they got jealous to the bay in the basement New York New York which is supposed to be a recreation of the hustle and bustle of Midtown and Rhenish Village and all that hilariously people put signed items and mementos in front of it after 9/11 and then steve wynn shows up in the mid 90s. In the sights. On this family shit's fine but we need something that's gonna be like classy to get people to spend more money because there's family vacation type places have a certain limit. They get a lot of money from a lot of hot charging people's stuff.

But it's there's a limit to you know how much you can for example how high in a restaurant a family place is going to be able to have and so he wanted some places that bespoke elegance and so he built the Bellagio in 97 which you know became famous especially in ocean the first Ocean's eleven remake and it was you Italian mazu like modern Italian architecture. Like the idea of this is Italy. This is the continent this is. This is sophistication. They had an art gallery that was the first to student have an art gallery. Sophistication was the whole idea and then they built the Venetian which was Italy in the Renaissance with with the front. That's that's the model after the Doge is Palace and then they built Paris which is supposed to be like Second Empire France. These are all things that are supposed to be fancy. It's just the eloquent and beautiful and of course they're tacky because the recreations but at least they're referring to some type of cultural memory of value in the last 10 years. Like the last 10 years they built a couple of new casinos and big developments there. Like the cosmopolitan an re are the two big ones and if you've seen these you can go and look at them online. They have no theme they have no aesthetic anything.

They're just big glass cubes because that is the modern architectural language of of urban wealth. It's hidden in giant glass buildings because of the vast amount of inequality that urban areas have you have to you have to concentrate all that wealth. In a in it you know basically one giant tube and everything is sleek and it all kind of looks like a iPod store. But it's not referencing anything culturally. It's totally self referential. It's purely expressing money unadorned by any kind of accumulated culture that that money might have gone into influencing and it really shows you that the wealthy haven't reached escape velocity for the rest of us to the point where they're not even in the same world.

As we are in meaningful ways. They're building an entirely different world. Brutal isms interesting I think Brutalism I understand why people want to say Brutalism is good but I mean when you consider the constraints that went into Brutalism and how much of it was done out of necessity or to cut corners rather than any. Due to any real vision. It becomes harder to defend in practice but I could certainly see it being good in the funniest brutalist building I know of the University of Cincinnati. When I lived there there is a giant there's a big building that was that house there design school. They have a pretty well-known design school and it was actually designed by one of the professors at their design school and it's a big brutalist tower that fans out at the top no windows. It looks like a giant Lego but the guy in the original design they forgot to put bathrooms in it. At all. There are no bathrooms in the building and they built it before they realize that and then they had to go back in and install the bathrooms and then in addition to that. It was also set in his foundation poorly because it's a very hilly campus and it's now essentially Leaning and it's gonna fall over and I think if it hasn't been evacuated. Yet they're gonna end up evacuating the whole thing and having to destroy it so and it lasted for like 30 years so that's not a great example. But I mean that's the kind of thing to happen with with Brutalism. It got thrown in there haphazardly and and cheaply. I mean I I don't know. If anyone wants to defend Boston City Hall. You can try but I have a hard time with it myself. But I'm not really an architecture guy anyway. I'm kind of talking out of my ass more so than usual. But I do know an ugly house with I see one and the I do think.

It's funny that the vast majority of a large colleges have brutalist libraries because they are they all experience a huge boom in in admission around the same time because of the baby boom which led to you know increased endowment and like that around the same time and a need to build a new library around the same time and that was the public or that was the public architecture style and so they all look like that. It's astounding how many even on campuses that have a dominant you know early modern aesthetic or something. They still will have the goddamn or like bricks or something. They'll still have the brutalist library well art. Deco. I mean come on what's not to love. I fell in love with Art Deco watching Ghostbusters as a child. My first ever encounter of it was was Dana Barrett's apartment building designed by Yves oh Sh and or cold riveted steel girders with poke cores of pure serene 'I'm. It's the same sort of telemetry tracker that nASA uses to track dead pulsars a deep-space. I say we bring back two to half.

Timbers make every village make every town look like an absurd whimsical medieval village. Oh everything's like falling towards each other no more toilets just throwing. Out of the out of the street. Ice I tried to read the questions out loud or at least get. The look at the idea of the question out loud so that people know what it is. I'm sorry if I don't well yeah getting back to the main point is that there's no redeeming aesthetic element to our current oligarchy just noting a Wyatt Koch teeth Wyatt Koch shirts and big ugly glass towers that's all we got.

It sucks the new dude on my own TV show I haven't read the book. I I don't know I mean I always I'm a big fan if any of the attempt to you know put Brown John Brown on TV but or in anything. But I watched the trailer and it looked intense and Ethan Hawke looked like he's doing gonna do a good job but it also looked like it was trying to be a little epic. It looked like it was trying to be like funny and I could see that may be working. But I don't know if it will. I'm gonna see it for sure. I'm I'm withdrawing I'm withholding judgment. But I'll definitely watch it even though even with the goofy the goofy feeling of the trailer when he's like thundering away it still gives you goosebumps. The rowdy Piper movie is it good. I don't know which one you refer to if you're talking about they live yes. It's very good. If you're talking about hell comes to Frogtown not as good favorite seafood oysters. Baby give me the masters a little a little sustainable non conscious guilt-free delicious little seat seafood flavor balls. Oh I love them anyway make them okay this is an interesting someone asked what I would do for a if I was gonna do an elf reboot. It's a good question I've mentioned this before how to do an Alf reboot it would have to be hard are with deep eroticism. I don't know if I would have Alf having sex with a human but you might see his genitals. I would need that that would be at a minimum swearing of course all the sweaters and a lot of gore. It would be very bloody.

He would eat the first shot would be of him eating actually eating a cat. That's all I know very first shot would be a cute little kitty cat that would he would eat like that scene in Oldboy. When he eats the octopus one shot no cut him just eating a cat. I don't know how we would do that CGI maybe. Maybe it shooted on international waters or something but that would definitely be the first shot just to establish. This is not your dad's elf. This is a serious gritty take on what would happen if there was an alien life-form who craved house cats living in a suburban Chicago family's home. But I could definitely see like out because there was an elf movie that ended up the show where they get caught. He gets caught by the army and they're gonna dissect him or something. I think that could work like elf is a pawn between the white hats and the black hats in the Qun on deep state war like they're nuking each other's deep underground military bunkers and trying to catch him and swap in for other stuff. I think that could be pretty fun and the whole time he's just eating this. Out of cats oh my god what if elf was cute that would be perfect actually.

He's the one he's caught in a deep. He's Kissin area 51 or something and he has limited internet access and all he's able to do is communicate. Just on this one account because that's the only way that like he's piggybacking on one of his unlike the 4chan account of one of his captors or something like he has technology that allows him to ghost his computer. But he has to go where he goes so he has to go to 4chan and he ascribes what's happening and then trump and Alf decapitate the deep state and execute Hillary Clinton on live television and then Alf eats. Socks would I cast in the elf reboot okay. That's a good question alright. Hopefully. You can get the same guy for the voice because I feel like the voice of Alf was pretty iconic if we can't get him. Giamatti seems like I mean this is obvious but also he's got that yeah. He's got a honk all right kill. Me can't you hear Giamatti saying I kill me can you hear. It can't you hear the people sing you can hear it. You can hear him. Say I kill me then to play the dad. What was this a max. No Willie.

Here's the guy's real name was max little-known fact alfe's dad on the show after the show when he was in his 60s was photographed in a crack house with no pants and it ended up getting in there and a like the National Enquirer or something Bryan Cranston great perfect welcome in the middle perfect perfect Bryan Cranston. We're already there we're cooking with gas. I don't even remember who played the mom because she didn't really have much of a role to play other than telling Willie to be nicer to Alf and vice-versa. Just playing you know just being a housekeeper. You need somebody who could just be a nap how about Julianne Moore. There you go she could just she could kind of like he heard a version of her character from safe and then the kid the little child I'm not gonna be. Stranger things there's all there's all those Punk kids now just get one of those kids who cares the kids suck. The kids only gonna be in a very a little bit and he might even die there. In the gorse. The movie the kid is like secondary. It doesn't matter what just randomly grab someone from the cast of a stranger thing so what the kid with no teeth whatever I don't care doesn't matter.

He's only gonna be in two or three scenes and then he's gonna get hit by a Humvee or something when the army comes to get out that to raise the stakes that would be ideal. Wow Eric Roberts is the cat has proven he could do it in the film a talking cat yes that was a hell of a film Oh. Someone says they want to re-watch the 80s blob. If you have not seen the 80s blob watch. It one of my favorite movies wildly underrated there's three really great gory remakes of classic horror films in the 80s and some of them bombed at the time. Some of those were successful some of them but all of them have gained an estimation the thing obviously the fly and but I feel like underestimated and underrated compared to those two but just as good as either of them. I would argue is the blob the blob rule. Some of the best practical effects gruesome brutal very unsentimental willing to kill characters. You would not expect at times you wouldn't expect keeps you off of your. Like narrative. Lee keeps you on your toes and what's really funny is that it it totally inverts the politics of the original blob because everybody took the original blob is about communism right. Oh. There's this big red thing is coming again everybody it's it's communism or you could say actually the blob is you know anti-communist hysteria if you wanted to be a smartass about it but either way that was the metaphor. In this one. The blob isn't even alien quote spoiler alert. It's a military experiment and the military is trying to keep it alive so it could be used as a weapon so the bad guys like the military-industrial complex and fanatical Christianity. Basically Reagan like Reagan's America's is the bet is the bad guy in the blob remake but forget it the politics just on a pure level of craft. One of the best horror films that of that decade and belongs absolutely the same conversation with those other great remakes written by Frank Darabont man that makes me want to re-watch that I watched it a few months ago I want to watch it again.

Now. It's it's never free streaming anywhere of course wait a minute. Someone says that if they switch between this channel and stop it means I'm insane. I don't get what compared to stop of course staff is I mean. Stop has a level of enlightenment that I will never reach I'm struggling here. I'm gonna earthly plane.

[25:07](https://youtu.be/o3ug6DmfKEw?t=25m07s)

He hasn't transcended me. So I don't think that's a fair comparison favorite John Carpenter movie that is always a tough one. I will say that I have and I don't really like Escape from New York. I'll admit that that's that's an alzheimer that I just can't enjoy the pace of it has never really worked for me and like the the score for once is a real dud for me too. And it's like it's it's the least interesting Kurt Russell performance that he gave four carpenter in my opinion. I don't know but I really really liked the thing obviously and they live. There's a darkness of course. I just re-watched in the mouth of madness and it's much better than I remember it being. It's a really good movie Big Trouble in Little China honestly has a soft spot for me it might honestly be that if I think about it certainly my favorite Kurt Russell performance with with carpenter and since there's such a great duo that kind of gives it an inside track. Oh man ghosts on Mars. Whoo I shall we watch that one too you know I kind of even like vampires because it had a good James Woods performance.

But there's a reliance on montage instead of action scenes it's kind of troubling it kind of feels like they ran out of money which they probably did. I know carpenters has never had a great time getting funding for his movies which is obviously awful. But at the same time I don't really think that even if you gave him money now he'd really want to make a movie. He seems to be actually where a person like him should be chilled at ease with their with their legacy. Gaming smoking weed following pro basketball rocking out with his son sounds fun he doesn't need to make any more movies yes Jim John Carpenter is 100% Grove Hill well they when I asked them. What do you think of this movie that's coming up based on your thing.

It's like if they're not paying me. So I don't care if they paid me and then I would care what else our attitude did you have towards your old work. There's nothing you can do about it. It'll stand the test of time on its own does anyone remember the mary elizabeth winstead thing. It was technically like a prequel so they were trying to like to not to be sacrilegious so look this isn't actually a sequel. This is what happens to the skin and avians before the thing starts okay. Apparently they did practical effects by the way that whole movie and then they showed it to this executives and the executives were so weirded out by it. Because practical effects they don't. They don't look more realistic as the thing that CGI they look different. They look more. They look like they take up space but they don't necessarily look more convincing what CGI shows you is that that's not. The only thing that matters convincing is not the only thing that matters if it feels like it's actually present to mass weight. It's in the room you will forgive anything else but these guys have been so hardwired to think that realism is what you're after. But they freaked out had to reshoot it all with CGI which of course now already looks like.

Music video director come out and a couple people from a WB show star in it and it makes fifty million dollars and nobody ever thinks about it again. The originals are still there. They're still gay he still he still beloved by all people who who seek quality cinema. The guy's twitter handle is master of horror for God's sake. He has secured himself because master of horror is the kind of thing that only someone who really thought they were would ever put in their. You Ernest skinned stupid does hold up and speaking of good effects. The Ernest scared stupid effects are pretty damn good. The the trolls look good and it's some of Barney's finest acting when he does all the different characters no he was really talented. Jim Varney I don't think I don't think Lee Carter's coming. On trap Oh. Guys sorry probably not gonna happen. I think we can let that one go hopefully did I like the new David Gordon Green Halloween movie. I actually did I thought it was really good. I was very surprised at how effective. It was as a horror movie because I've never really been that impressed with you know Gordon Green as a stylist.

He was I thought he was very good at creating food but I didn't really feel like he was necessarily someone who was terribly adapted. You know pacing and lighting and editing the kind of things that make a horror scene pop. But it was good have I seen tremors have. I seen tremors to even ask the question another movie that is almost flawless. It has ambitions that it that is perfectly suited to achievement. It is yes it is a reach not exceeding its grasp. It's it's it's beautiful. I've only seen a couple of the tremors sequels. I saw the one the second one where they run and I saw the third one where they fly from farting. They get keep getting worse.

[31:20](https://youtu.be/o3ug6DmfKEw?t=31m20s)

Man I never saw the Old West one. I think I watched the first ten minutes of the fifth one on Netflix and I was like now. I can't even do this and I seen bordello of blood by Dennis. Miller. I saw Porcello blood with Dennis Miller in the theater because at the time is as a young man I loved I loved him because his jokes had very obscure references in them and if I got them I felt smart so. That's why I liked it wasn't because he was funny. It's because he was flattering to me as a awful nerd and so when he had that brief awful abortive acting career in the 90s. I was there I was all there for dello blood. Not very good. There's a lot of nudity in it which is nice. He is pretty funny and apparently he's a huge jerk. During the making of the film he wouldn't talk to anybody. He basically wrote his own dialogue if any refused to promote. It. Just was above it all the whole time but still catch the checks absolute prick as you would imagine. Demon Knight is much better the first.

The first telecrib movie is much better I heard that M night Shyamalan was remaking tales for the trip for TNT. I don't know if that got cancelled I hope. So because the whole point of telling the Crypt was EC comedy or EC Comics which you know for for HB L meant it would had to be exploitation so it was wildly gory and filled immunity and it's if you're not gonna do that what's the point of doing Tales from the Crypt. The stories aren't that clever. It's like oh oh that's metros those dummies. Gonna kill him now. It's not like this. Wasn't Twilight Zone I watched the new Creepshow and it was okay. None of them were that great they just seem a little literal literal-minded. We're good for a question I'm having a hard time. Finding anyone. I always look kind of dead oh dear that doesn't sound good. I hope I look the camera looks like this image is clearer. I know it wasn't so good yesterday.

I don't know I need to get a new phone. I think someone wants to talk about the robot police state that's coming I don't really know what to say about it. Other than that's what the trajectory we're on. We can stop it hopefully. We certainly should try to with all of our fibers of being because it is. It's a it's a bad outcome that we should all try to avoid. But I really don't know at this point what to say I just I feel like we're still still taking in the Meg. The magnitude of the shifting grounds underneath us our berkland drug dealers delivering I'm assuming all drug dealers everywhere are delivering opinions on move a poll.

I'll pick that one just because I love move a bull because he thinks he's funny and the way he thinks he's funny is is actually hilarious. Postville is really the movie to watch I mean most of them are just too inept to be funny but when he's actually trying to be humorous they're pretty good and also what's really baffling is an interesting movie from an ideological perspective are his assault on what are his ramp I Ria's movie assault on Wall Street and then his rampage movies which over time became these like kind of Chomsky essays intermixed with just nihilistic violence. Actually. Someone asked if I was excited for them as streaming the Hamilton film I I mean. At this point I will watch it this thing that I've talked about. It was speculated about for years and helped make my career in many ways. I'm not gonna not watch it.

I gotta find out and I want to find out how a bastard orphan child of a and a Scotsman became a hero and a scholar because he was a self-starter who worked a lot harder and was a lot smarter I am watching SNL zoom and I've said this. It's brutally depressing and I hope they don't do it anymore. This is the end of the season I honestly hope they just cancel it if everyone's still quarantined and they're not doing live shows anymore. In September. They should just get just take this as a sign from God because I'm not getting anything from this anymore. I'm not getting any even just like hey. What's what are the kids up to these days which I usually get from SNL yeah like I've said it's like if they're like terrorists suicide. Martyr videos like hey me and my friend are. Gonna make this hilarious sketch before I go and blow up myself at a marketplace grim grim grim grim bring back MADtv I mean obviously now more than ever now more than ever we need MADtv in a soundstage in the desert. No studio audience either you do a laugh track or nothing oh. God I saw the mr. Show zoom thing oh. I couldn't resist it. I mean. Mr. Show is such a part of my humor DNA but man it was grim everything and all this all these table read stuff. All the zoom stuff is really really grim and it makes everything worse because it reminds you of how quickly and frantically people will try to adapt to an unsustainable situation just because they have no all they can't think of anything else too do.

[40:28](https://youtu.be/o3ug6DmfKEw?t=40m28s)

Somebody asked about how EVOC ins in the green party if you want to vote for them go for it. I don't care I mean I don't think it's gonna matter. I just can't see third party presidential politics. I mean that party anyway and in this context we've got with candidates like Howie Hawkins mattering like I said Jesse mature now you got another story. But I just it seems like if you if you if you want if you feel like it's worth it to you go for it. I'm not gonna judge you but I'm just not. I don't see the point feels like everyone in the Xoom. Based content has a gun pointed at them off-screen and the writers are all crying while writing that is a very accurate. Thank you strong goose shout out there. That is the correct comment everyone feels coerced everyone feels on the verge of tears. It's not good well what soul wants us to know why we haven't covered Tara Reid.

I don't know what at this point where there is more to say than what we already know. The the the the depths to which the Democratic Party will go to degree to which their their commitment to any any of the principles they claim to supported is was actually just a fig leaf for their coercive power. Over the discourse is all obvious it's not like if you sound like it's gonna bring down Biden. I think people have this delusion that no if we if we bring down Biden with this they're gonna put Bernie in there no some of us enough I'm doing anything else with Gnosticism. I mean I've gone through a few stages you know of thinking about things and I've realized that at a certain level of abstraction there's really no way to get across anything I'm trying to say in a way that won't just sound to most people like insanity or something that they you know understand intellectually but give no real you know meaning to don't don't give any credence to as something that's explanatory. So I'm trying to figure out sort of how to sum fuse my understandings into things that operate it at a more and a lower and more comprehensible mutually comprehensible level. But I definitely still I'm thinking about the Demiurge and how the Demiurge is you and me and we all make a shadow of the world and we have to live in it and we think it's the whole thing but it's not where's just laying a very good question.

The question I'd never thought we would get the answer to the fact that she's apparently suing. This epstein estate is absolutely mind-blowing to me holy crap. I don't know I mean my assumption is that that is a paper move to keep her alive because remember that every other statement about her whereabouts has then never followed up upon or substantiate it from the fake in and out pictures to her hanging out with the billionaire in Massachusetts her supposedly being triangulated by her cell phone to a resort in Brazil and now she's somehow pursuing legal cases. Defamation suits and lawsuits again for the estate I mean all of those things can be done through shells and straws any account. So I don't know. I think it it makes me think that she was taken care of and that she hasn't been around for a while alive and nothing that has happened since then has really made me doubt that because it does seem so weird how it'll be quiet for three or four months and then there'll be some gossip thing about how oh.just lanes friends. They're talking about how she wants to get back out there then nothing three months later on a triangulated cell phone places just laying in Brazil nothing three months later oh she's suing someone. It's like just putting up a flare every once in a while just to keep people from wondering too much where she might be. How people are really mad that Michael Hudson's has a been on the path.

We've asked him. He prefers to just post why hasn't she Caleb Jacobi but on the podcast Oh God you don't think I ask myself that every day I would love to have young Caleb on I would love him to spit fire. About the time he hitchhiked to New York and went to the M&M store and I found the fact that he apparently makes he makes hip hop beats. Influenced by the Kabbalah and the sacred geometry of the of the Torah. I need to talk to this man I would like to have Mike dunk it on again. I should ask him soon I kind of want to have mine after he ends the rest. The whole show I don't know we'll see maybe before he comes back from. The hiatus have Elan musk on the show. We have had a LAN musk on the show in the form of James Adomian. I don't know I don't think he I don't think you would want to go on. I don't think he really wants to anybody to talk to him. It wasn't like Joe Rogan is just gonna be like all cool. Wow oh man may 4th Oh like Star Wars dan aykroyd going on true and on I don't know I don't know how deep Danny Ackroyd's connections go Danny Aykroyd.

Cookie be compromised realistically. I mean he claims to know a lot of stuff and he's still out. There. It makes you wonder if he's been compromised in some way if you might be orchestrating limited hangouts. It's the same thing you gotta wonder about that Tom DeLonge character. Oh.

[50:20](https://youtu.be/o3ug6DmfKEw?t=50m20s)

Somebody asked me yesterday to talk about the fact that now we have the name of a guy from the actual name of one of the guys from the Saudi embassy who helped the 9/11 hijackers navigate the u.s. And given money and stuff. I mean it's just they forget to block out a name. We knew there was a guy in the air. You know there was a direct part of the Saudi government who is involved. We've always known that that's that's the hilarious is that it all just went out right in the open and because it's one of those things it's so vast. It can't be dealt with. It can kind of go out there because there's no one who's gonna do anything with it because it's too all-encompassing same thing with Epstein kind of there's no you don't really have to worry about one side of the other using it if it's out in the open because it's too all-encompassing in it. It's too bipartisan in its condemnation so and it's too central to the perpetuation of the existing systems at both sides support so there's no way for them to effectively leverage it.

So we just sort of like over time. Let this Afghan tapes the Afghan papers which were like the Afghanistan war version of the Pentagon Papers saying basically the same thing that they lied the entire time about the Afghanistan war. They lied about the metrics they lied about America's progress. They lied about the viability of the government. They lied about the viability of the Taliban opposition. They lied about everything for the entire way that they did and it didn't matter because it's no one's gonna change any of this. So then what so who is there to even make anything of it other than individual citizens that they can see everyone else not doing anything about it and internalize the idea that even though this thing seems huge it must mean nothing because if it did mean something why isn't anybody doing anything I mean I wouldn't be surprised with those JFK files.

I wouldn't be surprised at a certain point. It'll be so long ago that memories will be so short and there'll be no there very little remaining emotional attachment to the 60s. Basically once the boomers are gone the ones who still fixate on the Kennedy assassination as soon as they're gone or most of them or they're out of positions where they're still exercising authority through the vote. In any significant number. You can put it out there and then people will just be like oh wow h . Wow will you look at that they'll look around and nobody's gonna do anything so h okay. I guess that's just a thing you know it does feel like we're just getting these. This series of limited hangouts all designed to ignore us to the vast amount of more than anything because it's very hard not to take the message of conspiracy theory worldview. To be there can be no change because their control is total. Boomer. High school history teacher had them watch JFK in class that is irresponsible teaching and I'm here for it give it to me way better than whatever the hell you were are. Gonna have them do what just have them listen to Constitution and the founding fathers and then the rest of it is yeah. You can buy the time together in the 20th century. It's just they just play. We didn't start the fire and then you the test is you have to fill in the lyrics. Ashlin says their teacher did play. We didn't start the fire and then gave them a test. Hit I love American public schools also private ones what conditions would it take for the US military to seize control of government.

Basically whether at the point when the alternative would be a collapse of the government I assume it would take that much because as I said these guys are all time serving. Fat heads they have no vision they have no real ambition beyond punk climbing through the court. Essentially the corporate ranks of the Pentagon. They're just time servers so they're gonna take orders up until the end until if it's just roll up the tents and go home or try to maintain America as it exists as you know as it has traditionally existed with its flags and symbols under their rule. Then they would do it but that would have to be in there. There there it would have to be at their level of perception. They would have to see it that way themselves as the only thing standing between and because they're so short-sighted and so uncreative. I don't I think it would take very very very much to get them there. So I think we would have to be in a state of very deep. Crisis I don't know how it would specifically look. But I think the Constitution and its inability to adapt to situations of crisis and like extreme shifts in material. Conditions and political reality is going to be the thing that makes it happen one way or the other.

How do our imagination become so limited because we don't talk to each other. Anymore. I hate to sound like a Jimmy Stewart character. But I mean we don't have a social understanding. If you don't see yourself as part of a social and organ a social mechanism. How can you imagine any sort of future that will feature your input in any way. How can you imagine future as something that is constructed by people and not something endured that's the only way we've experienced it. We've felt no sense of agency or ownership over any part of our lives and so we assume that that's the inevitable and an only way that the world works that there is no way that we could assert control over our destinies like what's happening.

We're just shrugging our shoulders and going back out because that's just what happens because these things are one way or the other natural occurrences and we can blame when you blamed the presidents and we can get mad at him but we're basically like fans of a baseball team who get really mad at the manager. Everybody knows everybody really knows that the manager is the most in essential member of the team. You're gonna have the greatest if you have a good enough talent on a baseball team. You'd have to be a really bad coach to squander. It vice versa because there's not much for a manager to do as opposed to. He's not drawing up plays for the most part but people still get mad at them and if the team does badly they still get fired and if the team does well they get promoted they get extended that's how we treat the presidents. But we kind of know at some level that they're not in charge. We just endure things we just endure it and that's why we can't imagine anything better.

That's why we can't imagine any other way to deal with this virus than enduring thousands and hundreds of thousands more dead and higher risk to ourselves and our loved ones. Every time. We go out somebody wants to know about what I said about how fascism is implausible in the short term. That's what I mean if we can't imagine a social being that we're part of how can we imagine fascism. Fascism is the is the absolute. The ideal of fascism is the sub sumption of all all those pesky liberal subjects. All those fractious I atomized liberal subjects compressed with the power of the state into one mass into one corporal being that's about as far from our core perception of ourselves in relationship to each other. In this society as you could imagine they have fascism has farther to go to like engage the creative you know political mind of imagination.

The American political imagination than almost any mindset and you pull any ideology if if that changes if if politics becomes more real if people feel like they're they can control things it's because there's been some deeper breakdown. It's because there's been some drop dello devolution of authority downward where it could be reachable and in a situation like that where you have breakdown at a local level. You could have very quickly you could have fascism take control but if we assume that the American state structure maintains its integrity then politics is going to become less and less relevant. People are going to be less and less aware of themselves as political engage people which means the space is gonna get filled. The authoritarian spaces are gonna get filled by stormtroopers and even or even troops.

It's gonna be felt by technology. It's gonna be filled by every smart device. Around they can pinpoint your exact location anywhere. They can listen to you almost anywhere you might be by turning on a speaker see any communication you might give. The technology already is essentially being perfected in here and in China that and and automated an almost automated AI controlled drone war that does all the work that you would need the all right guys. I'm gonna wrap it up a couple more questions tonight.

Then I'll say good night have some dinner robots should be harnessed for the people yes like that's what I said is that the two baths the socialism or barbarism path that we're on is is it's capitalism and and and communism as as the states that are allowed to be possible by technology technology makes communism. Possible technology makes capitalism possible and and and at sufficiently advanced levels. Technology can make communism make socialism become communism or in the hands of capital can make can accelerate us towards total submission to machinery total al guerrillas ation where we are just we are just inputs. We're like we're like bulbs in a string of Christmas lights interchangeable. We are we are we are pure Skinner creatures of reward and punishment for a given amount of exertion to the degree that we're necessary. So it's I mean. The the the Luddite path is is back towards you know the slave empires so the technology that we have been able to to create over the course of you know the the progressive of the economic complexity and stuff that shouldn't be thrown away but right now we have to confront the fact that we have very little power over it that it's almost entirely in the hands of capital and that they're going to use it in a short term to maximize their control over a increasingly untenable social space that is going to become harder and harder to govern through conventional political means. As conditions deteriorate and that is something we have to deal with and I don't think you deal with it by getting rid of technology. They don't think of that's work that would work you're not the ewoks but it has to be reckoned with all right guys. I'm gonna say good night help you guys had a good time I know I did bye bye.
