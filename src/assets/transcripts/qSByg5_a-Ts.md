Mustang the Sailor. I guess you better slow oh that Mustang now Mustangs salad and a bear about them and get your very slow down. You've been running all over the town on the ground bought me a brand new Mustang 1965. Now you've come around signify a woman and you don't want to let me ride. Mustangs selling a baby all right yes you better slow your Mustang oh. This is gonna be wiping your weeping hours oh um yeah. I'll take a request. I don't know every song but if I do know a song I'll build it out how's everybody doing. It's a beautiful day here in Los Angeles. Finally after a lot of rain maybe it'll stay that way who knows either way. I'll be here America. The Beautiful God spread her legs for me. I mostly don't know rap think my mom still winter in Europe well. I know it was like the the mildest winter ever right. That's why Putin got owned because he was expecting everybody to start eating each other because of heating costs. But then it was too nice out and nobody had to pay to prevent freezing to death.

I finished the second book of the three body. Trilogy I finished number two and it definitely does get wild when they start going telescoping out the time frame and you're 200 mile 200 years into the future and it's fun. I still don't really I don't know it still isn't hitting for me. I'll read the third one now. I'm committed but It's just it ain't hitting and I mean maybe part of. That is that I just fundamentally disagree with the thesis about aliens and the the the underlying assumption about other species that might exist in the galaxy somewhere I love okay yes 

The Vatican has disowned the doctrine of Discovery yes huge huge deal. I'm sure all those countries are going to be given back now because the pope doesn't say you can do it anymore. It's been a while since the pope had any had any divisions or any ability to even be a broker between secular authorities. yeah the pope should should do something really wacky. Although he might be out of time he might be he might be done for in which case we could get my favorite thing which is a Papal election don't get better than the papal elections and there's been so frustratingly few in my lifetime in the Middle Ages. You'd get a Papal election every two weeks because um Rome was essentially a malarial swamp and anybody who got elected Pope who didn't live in Rome as soon as they made the trip to Rome. They risked getting sick getting malaria and dying and so it was the popes the popes did not last long. We get to I get to show up like almost at the same time as this ratzinger just pulling the plug pulling the shoot it wouldn't even have had We would have only had one election and it would have been just now after he what just died and where another interesting thing is that I think we're on.

We were before John Paul II. I think we were on something like a 400 year long string of Italian popes like I think. Once the Avignon papacy papacy collapsed. It was just Italian popes and then I have not had an Italian Pope my entire life. The closest thing is is Francis because he's Argentinian which means he's basically Italian but still you know not technically from there. And I don't think we might never get another Italian Pope. Depending on you know how they wanna try to keep the the papacy relevant keeping waiting for the African Pope which that will be awesome you had young Pope. You had new pope we need black. Pope I think there's a guy in Ghana. Maybe Robert Sarah. He's like a rat singer reactionary guy. He always ends up being on the on the lists when they're talking about popes but you can't beat the pageantry of it because you get the lists of all the potential people candidates you can you know you can handicap them and figure out who's who who's got the likelihood and then of course. The wonderful smoke the smoke billowing out of the chimney as they vote It's lovely. It's a lovely tradition and I've seen frustratingly few so.

Maybe Francis will kick off and we'll get another one Indonesian Pope Filipino Pope. We need some sort of wacky. Pope yeah Muslim Pope. How about that Mel Gibson make him the Pope. You don't have to be an ordained clergyman to be Pope. The same way that you do not have to be an a lawyer to be a Supreme Court Justice though and the last time that we've had one I believe was Hugo Black. It was the last Supreme Court Justice to have not been a lawyer foreign. Pope too bad and yes you do not have to be a representative to be speaker of the house which frustratingly has never been taken. Advantage of I hope maybe as gridlock continues and as that job becomes less and less appealing for people in Congress. I'm hoping that farming that job out to gimmick candidates becomes more popular yeah. People talk about making Trump speaker. He would not want that job because it's work and he doesn't like doing work but it's pop. It's certainly something that I'm kind of annoyed has not been brought broached more because it's absolutely legal. It's all perfectly legal Robert Sarah that's his that's his name.

He's he's a cardinal from Guinea. They always talk about him being a maybe Pope but then it doesn't happen well. You could definitely use a good anti-pope I think all these saint of Atticus dorks should stop complaining and set up a goddamn Avenue on papacy somewhere like Branson Missouri yeah. No it wouldn't be Brooklyn. It would have to be It would have to be in Diamond square right the Pope the Pope's the Vatican would be in like that Popeyes on Canal Street or something Popeyes.

I don't know I feel like. It's time to pull the plug. Christianity washed if you want to believe in a monotheistic God if you want to believe in the abrahamic conception of a god. An intervening all-powerful embodied reflection of humanity that you feel a a spiritual and social connection to then just be a Muslim. It's the Perfection. It's the Perfection of Christianity. It is it is It is monotheism fully uprooted from its pre-christian tribal. Roots like all the stuff that makes Christianity so baffling the that they by the way people say oh. It's that's not that confusing the first as soon as Christian when Christianity was eight was made a established religion of the Roman Empire. The next what hundred years of the church is just people fighting about the nature of Christ. There's nothing intuitive of about any of that. It is very very weird and it's because you have Christ embodying this specific historical cultural role of Messiah which really does complicate the notion of of monotheism.

But then a couple hundred years later out in the desert in the margins of the big Empires where the people who don't want to be a subject of the sasanids or the byzantines are living in tribal existence out in the in the in the desert. Surviving on trade and piracy yeah M ammad comes up and it's like hey we figured this out. We squared the circle here I'm talking to God but that's it. I'm just a guy. Just the regular guy God decided to talk to and I have contended that that the Messianic heart of Christianity was continued by in Europe. was continued by the Socialist movement but that has Ended as I said a few weeks ago. The battle of Armageddon was fought all over the world and lost. Now we have this this worship of the self in the West.

 that's it whereas Christian yes Joseph Smith did islamify protestantism that has been pointed out many times. Harold Bloom wrote a whole book about how Mormonism is is American Islam and that is very true the whole the prophetic tradition because you have Saints and Christianity obviously. But what you don't have after Jesus is anyone who can be the prophet a prophet whereas by allowing M ammad you know to be a man among men in contact with God. You've opened up the the flutes and allowed in the in the chimney and that's what Joseph Smith did for Christianity in America because they needed to avoid becoming subjects they needed to avoid the encroaching extinguishment of the American promise that justified all that had been done on the American continent. All the violence. All the misery of of dominating and settling that land was to allow for the creation of fully autonomous social beings to live in a way that was impossible in Old Europe. But around the time that Smith has his Revelation and a bunch of other people are having revelations in the same place upstate New York. The frontier is closing now obviously America still has this huge Frontier but it is for the most adventurous. It's for the boldest.

It's for the craziest. It's for the Scotch Irish people who are willing to risk fighting. Indians all day to keep their land but like say the but the states the former colonies are no longer in play. They're no longer um. There's no longer any promise within them of continued escape from a degraded social relation like New York. For example. A lot of that Upstate land was dominated by the Old Dutch families who had settled there before the Revolution. They became known as the patrons cool name and then a lot of other Upstate land was given as reward to military veterans of the revolution and some Some veterans made that land their home. They became successful farmers but a lot of people ended up having to sell their land to the local land owner who is able to out compete them due to economies of scale and you see this internal migration first from New England of those who can't make it there to Upstate New York to try to grab some of that land in the last little burst of it after the Revolution and then it is exactly at eight in the 1820s when the Erie Canal has created this commercial Corridor Through The Heart Of Agricultural New York and the possibility of holding your own property in New York in the long run starts to go away and that is when everyone finds Christ again because they're searching for that apocalyptic Horizon. Now that their dream of of territorial Paradise has been denied them oh.

No we're not all gonna get to live on our own perfect little plots and work on our own terms and interact with the market on our own terms. We're going to be thrust into commercial relationships that are going to strip us of all of that all that allows us to feel unalienated ah. No. This is all itchy today and it's not because I did cocaine okay. I don't do that thank you I just have some I don't know it's dry air now that it's stopped raining. I don't know The Omen dream which is heaven on Earth which is the paradise promised is is going away so you have to find it elsewhere and so you have. The Seventh-Day Adventists emerge out of the millerite movement. You've got the Mormons. We've got a bunch of things exploding all the same time and place and the political expression of that is the anti-masonic party because you've got everybody searching for a new way to find Heaven a new way to find Paradise looking to grab Christ's hands because the old ways aren't working anymore because the material basis for them has been dissolved. But there is also the desire for a political solution. To this problem. Maybe there is a way for us to reclaim our patrimony through the political process. We do live in a democracy. Don't we and yet someone in Upstate New York looks around in the 1820s and they see only political organ all political organizations dedicated to dispossessing them in the name of the banks so where how can we solve this how can we fix this. If both parties which at this point is really just the dissolving Corpus of the old Democratic Republican party. You have the jacksonians emerging around this new Democratic Party which has been created which is being created in the back rooms by Martin Van Buren. Part of the same process and there's really no other organized opposition to the democracy. Now Jackson's promise is enough for many Yeoman in other parts of the country but in New York specifically where for example the canal and Associated internal improvements which Jacksonian Democracy is finds. Holds in anathema are crucial to the economy. The jacksonianism is not as appealing but there's no alternative.

So how can we organize our opposition to the current existence around a paranoid narrative that there are these people in government the Masons who are conspiring to Rob us of our Liberty and they are aided in that by a sensational True Crime case that occurs around this time when this guy William Morgan who had been an Upstate New York Freemason had left and was going around claiming that he was going to write a book about it and expose the Masons and all their secrets. He was arrested for fraud on an unrelated charge and he was in a County Jail when a couple of guys came and sprung them out and he and disappeared with him and his body was later discovered in a river and this caused a huge sensation in the press. The the Masons had murdered this guy as part of their capitalistic desire to protect their secrets and it led to this political movement in opposition to the current consensus and a lot of the people who arise in anti-masonic politics end up becoming very important. Whigs when the Whig party does finally coalesce to oppose jacksonianism over the course of its term guys like Millard Fillmore and thurlo weed who later becomes one of the founders of the Republican Party. They start off as animations not necessarily because they believe this but because they see it as a road to power and influence now a little bit before this at this in the same context. Though you have Martin Van Buren who is Martin Van Buren. He is the son of a Tavern keeper who lives on who rents property from one of these Dutch patroons so you have a downwardly mobile Dutch family.

They've got a little bit of something but it's certainly not It's not the established land holding that'll keep you away from being dominated by Commerce. But it is. It's a holding action. They don't own. They're renters. I mean they gotta. This he does what you could do back then which is just read. A bunch of law books doesn't go to school or nothing just like Lincoln actually It then becomes a Apprentice at a law. Firm becomes a lawyer and then becomes a politician and what he does is. He realizes power can be had in New York for people like me people who are not of the massive landed power landed families if I can organize the other guys who are like me around a program by using nothing more complicated than the technology of writing a letter. It's it's Committees of Correspondence just writing to other legislators and saying hey do you like me check yes check. No do you want to do do you want to vote the same way on things and of course. This is a violation of the principles of government as set down by the founding fathers.

The premise of democracy according to the founders was men of principle and standing come together and make choices that are for the best. According to their understanding of that Van Buren said how about we all vote the same way that will advance our Collective interest a party if you will and seal connections not through just ideology although there's part of that but through patronage make it in people's best self-interest to go along with our line and to vote our way and to have their friends and families on our way and it and but Van Buren sees that the route to power given the broken Retreat to provincialism that occurred after the Era of Good Feeling and the Democratic Republican party starts to break down under Madison or under Monroe is an alliance between these commercial New Yorkers and the Virginia planter aristocracy okay because they had a shared hostility to the big. Merchant interests of the northern states because these guys the Van Buren boys were not of that class. They were of the arrivast Insurgent middle so they could ally with the old aristocracy in Virginia. Of course guys like Van Buren in Virginia. were very hostile to those interests and ended up becoming wigs. But that's not Van Buren's problem. He creates a coalition that works both ways and so among the most successful maybe charismatic maybe hustling I don't know whatever word you want to use among those people in New York.

You have this there's still a political prize to be grabbed and then for voters. There's the dream of some sort of cleansing anti-masonic fire and then among the the commoner folk. There is the dream of imminent apocalypse either through mormonists the Mormon vision of collective life or the millerites who just figured oh my God. This guy did the math in the Bible and God's gonna show up next Tuesday and we can just chill until then but now all that all that all the juice is gone. Nobody believes that there's any apocalyptic Horizon except for the science worshipers who think that they're going to live in a robot Forever on Mars some of that. Everybody else is now just in a terminal either denial or violent hostility to a future that they cannot imagine as being anything other than an annihilation and that's why Islam is the only Live Wire. But it is linguistically and culturally alien. I think to westerners in a way that means there's you're not you're not going to see any large-scale conversion to it. I think you're just going to see it further doubling down on the worship of the self clinging it to its technology. As of imagined Deliverance foreign we all need have to have some sort of imaginative intervener.

There has to be some symbolic conception of forgiveness because without that then you really only have doubling tripling quadrupling down into Oblivion. like Thomas Hobbs is one of the first people in Western political thought to take God out of the equation of of statecraft and of justification of authority. He was he was able to he was like okay if we're not saying God God is Wills this social order then why what does justify and and validate this social order and and his premise that the nature of humanity is all consuming war with one. Another does follow from that original premise of okay take. God out of the equation take forgiveness reconciliation out of the equation take the world as it is which is a series of vastly unequal vastly exploitative class societies that are organized around internal domination and remove the structures of authority that underpin them like a Jenga Tower pull down. The one pull pull the slats at the bottom that keep this thing going the the the concepts of legitimacy that keep people obeying them because it is all at a base level. Consensual like we are all consenting every moment because we value something that we are given by this order enough to continue to survive and persist within it.

If you remove those slats. What will you have you will have the war of all against all you will have red and tooth and Claw nasty Brutus in short existence because you will have these broken shards of pottery that cannot be brought back together. But that is not the Eternal transcendent nature of humanity I mean Humanity only was able to come into itself to the extent it has through a fundamental cooperation. Human evolution becomes Collective at a certain point once a sufficient Technologies accrue to facilitate communication and then you have a collective process a collective endeavor that pushes Humanity into into new Heights of abstraction and ability to act collectively to uproot and redefine nature and once you get to that point talking about individuals individual rights. Individual anything is kind of nonsensical because it is a social fiction that facilitates social action until technology develops enough to reify the individual and put every human at War at transcended interdimensional Jihad with the natural and what Christianity allowed for for a long time and then the Socialist Vision allowed for afterwards was a was the capacity to imagine a radical transformation of subjectivity in a positive direction. I think now in the aftermath of the battle battle of Armageddon.

One of the things that fixes us and freezes us into this death. Spiral is that we can only conceive of radical changes of subjectivity as catastrophe as disaster because our subjectivity are the ones that we hold is all that there is it is they they have become. Transcendent categories that must be protected for civilization to mean anything. Civilization doesn't have worth if it does not if it's not a vessel for the Ambitions and and concepts of these reified individuals that we've that we find ourselves to be so yeah. Now all we have is the bad Armageddon on the horizon to be constantly feared. I I have stipulated though can never arrive because we're afraid of it. But we're also kind of seeking it because even if it is the end of this subjectivity. If this subjectivity is a curse then even that can be thought of as a Deliverance but only in that nihilistic Death Drive sense not in the idea that we could transcend it that is foreclosed so whatever decline we might be imagining.

It will not have the collective simultaneous apocalyptic time frame that we're fantasizing about it will happen individually and the people left who have not been swallowed will maintain their agonized interposition between the abyss that they fear and secretly crave and the unbearable but also addictive now unless there's a nuclear war of course. But I honestly think if there was a nuclear war it would not be the planet. Ender that people feared in the 50s I think you'd have I think you I could see very definitely like in the next hundred years conflicts arising that lead to some sort of nuclear Exchange. But I don't think that the. networks to trigger total unleashing of nuclear payloads really exists now let alone will in the future. They will only Decay further with time but I mean nuclear winner. You know the dinosaurs were taken out by a giant asteroid that created similar conditions and we're here now so what could survive that and come later and retrospectively redeem all that came before which is what we're actually talking about right.

That that is that is that is the The Socialist continuation of the of the Christian apocalyptic vision is to transform Humanity not just at the point of apotheosis but then retrospectively throughout all of time and as long as that like cycle persists. And I think that it is eternal you can talk about oh heat death of the universe but what happens after the heat death of the universe. You have the same conditions that persisted before the Big Bang you get another universe. It's all in one thing. There's no effort to go you know. There's no outside of this so like there is no end there can't be so that means that we are always on the board. We are all we always have it. We always have a chance. We're always in the game and the fact that we are all here having these conversations does in. My gut make me think that the thing that we're all despairing for being impossible has already happened because it was.

It's what retrospectively animates all of us because if we are in a Consciousness field what is the nature of Consciousness. It is retrospective. It is a response to phenomena. It is not phenomenon itself like that's all a bunch of Airy. But what it does for me is it allows for presence. It'll it allows me to imbue the moment that I embody with meaning yeah.

Somebody asked about Brazil and China making an agreement to pay each other without having to go to dollars. I mean that is inevitable. I mean honestly people talk about how like the dollar is losing its footing because of you know we're printing too many bills or any of that moralistic gold bug hogwash. I think a lot of it comes down to that we have radically abused the notion of sanctions like we have gone so sanctions crazy in the post Soviet era like sanctions as a tool of American statecraft and warfare such that like only using the dollar becomes a surrendering of sovereignty if you're if you're another country. So I think that is driving a lot of this I really still don't think anybody is trying to create an alternative to the dollar because you would have to destroy your Sovereign control like who is because the Chinese are really the only people who have any viable claim to doing that. But if they did it I've said this before and nobody they would have to surrender the party's control of their economy.

They would have to get rid of the capital controls that they have on their currency that would be cutting their own throats if they don't want to be like us. If they don't want to be in a position where the government is control is. The government is a hollow shell where a bunch of totally senile buffoons Bang into each other like they're on a Electric football table well. Finance actually makes every meaningful decision and government is essentially vestigial if they don't want that then they have to keep their control of their currency and that is if we're if we're if if you have a project and it does seem. I gotta say as much I would not call it socialism. But I do think that there is a a national economic program that the Chinese Communist party is able to hold control of and has not seated yet their ability to hold on to that goes away if they become a Reserve currency.

Now the question is what about going back to Keynes and creating a separate currency for international transactions which was what he proposed at Bretton Wood and hilariously this is very funny so Keynes at at brettonwood. They're talking how are we going to make the post-war economy. How are we going to make the post-war Financial system work. We don't want another. War how are we going to do it and everybody understood. There's going to have to be a global Reserve currency. Also that God loved the Brits but it wasn't going to be the pound sterling with a gold standard anymore. So what is it going to be and Kane says there should be a a separate currency that is not any International currency that is used for International Exchange and I believe he said that it should be pegged to like a basket of the value of a basket a certain basket of commodities and it was really never I mean it was a non-starter nobody no because America was writing the rules and they weren't going to give up that that trump card but the big guy who maneuvered to neutralize that was one of the chief Bretton Woods negotiators for the United States Harry Dexter white who was also a Soviet spy. So the a Soviet spy helped entrench post-war American economic hegemony the post the very post-war economic hegemony that eventually strangled the Soviet Union of course that's because at that point in 1944 all the all the Communists and fellow Travelers at the high levels of government in the United States had convinced themselves that they would take over the United States from within that they would through the vessel of the Democratic Party eventually be able to direct the politics of the United States.

Like MacArthur obviously was a was a demagogue and a crook but there absolutely were Communists at the highest levels of government in the United States. The thing was their goals were the same as American Imperial goals because America needed to win the war and be create the dominant structures so that they could be taken over but then we all know what happened. They kicked Wallace off the ticket that little Thug Truman becomes president and it's all over folks all over. But the shouting yes Wallace was. Wallace was the thin end of the spear he was. He was the lever he was going to be the guy and he was not a communist himself. He was a pure strain American Mainline Protestant do-gooder the the the like the end of the Midwest Prairie populist tradition but in the context of the popular front that meant that he was Allied with a lot of self-conscious Communists like either people who were working for the Soviets or who considered themselves to have a socialist political Horizon.

No of course it's very funny that the birchers start freaking out about how the U.N is a communist plot. All these institutions are communist plots because they because the Birch John Birch Society represented the small manufacturers and capitalists in America who depended upon this new international order but who had no responsibility for it and so were alienated from it and could blame all of their discontent with a life that is not as good as it should be on these evil machinations. Even though the real problem is that the society that they fetishized only creates discom unhappiness only manufactures misery.

It sells Eternal happiness. It sells unbounded pleasures and those can be a sought and briefly attained but the consistent experience is of continual disappointment of continual agitation because you have a society running on the The empty desire of the consumer Wallace definitely would not have dropped a bomb on Japan. There's no question about that the real interesting thing is would. FDR have dropped the bomb on Japan and FDR surviving isn't actually as crazy as I used to think it was because for me I always used to think oh the question is always Wallace because FDR by the time he was. By the time he got erected he was circling the train.

 I've said this before. But it's very funny that right before he went to his final Retreat to Warm Springs Georgia. He had a physical and the doctors took his blood pressure and it was like over 300 like the top line was over 300. But what are you gonna do good luck. Maybe take a bath maybe that'll help but apparently blood pressure medication was patented only a like a year or so after he died so what about the way we do a little wave there and they figure out how to control blood pressure a couple years earlier 350 195. That's it yeah and all they could do is be like well. maybe sitting in warm water will help because there's nothing to do there's no there is no treatment for it but then they but the first effective blood pressure drugs were patented only a few years later.

So FDR doesn't die FDR gets to like at least a couple years into his. The fourth term does he drop the bomb. Kinda don't think so I suspect he would not because I do feel that FDR and and like right Wingers now have figured this out and are now like condemning him. For this. I think conceptual James had a whole thread about this a while ago ago where it's like yeah what you're saying is correct. But it's also good and that was that FDR really did not see Stalin as a post-war enemy. He did not invest Envision the end of the war being a process of confrontation with the Soviet Union. He and the people around him were imagining that it would be a that it would be a genuine world. It would be a continuation of the Yalta and Tehran process because the whole through the war Churchill Stalin and and FDR are having these conferences and they're moving through all of these big questions and I believe FDR thought that's going to be the future post-war is us having these continual periodic negotiations around these big questions. But of course he dies. Truman gets in and then Yalta is the last one there's a story about how they successfully tested the um the bomb at Trinity and they tell um trumaness and he just goes in swinging his dick around like. Anymore because we got the bomb so yeah FDR lives I think but here's the very important thing though when you imagine this stuff and you imagine any number of different ways that the great conflict of the 20th century could have gone say you do have a longer lived FDR or you get Wallace as president in 45 that does not mean you're going to have some sort of peaceful transition to socialism.

I think guys like FDR and Wallace thought that was what was going to happen you would have had a century as bloody as the one we got. But the battle lines would have been different and I really think that is the dream that died not actually getting not only to experience yourself but to even conceptualize in the in the in the life of your children. An actualized socialist world where human potential can be unlocked rather. It is a world where that fight can be made in earnest like that you can participate in that conflict with your whole heart and not have that battle be waged largely by people who are making emotional compensations for other problems in their lives because now politics is for sickos that's that's the reality of the post-war world.

This politics becomes the domain of people who are compensating not people who are trying to advance an agenda because that agenda has been obscured like people want to blame the new left for being a bunch of self-indulgent. narcissists whose politics is entirely personalized and and moralized. It's not their fault. That's all that was left. The people who in the previous generations were funneled into political action by the promise of advancement through it through struggle had been in America.

Bought off a deal was struck in in a bunch of different battles culminating in a number of large-scale legislative victories for labor that made politics no longer a rational reasonable thing to care that much about and so their kids come up and they want to do politics. They want to make things better but not really for themselves because they are the most God blessed and lucky people to ever live on earth. They're living in trajan's Rome. They've got the fruits of everything at their fingertips but what they have inherited is this finely calibrated moral sense that seeks to push Beyond consumption push Beyond plenty as the as as a as the only index of human advancement and and of satisfaction and of course fails miserably because it's not connected to a drivetrain of class struggle. It's been detached by mass home ownership and mass media and that's why you can write all day about the failings of the new left and the Contemporary left such as it exists not as an actual political movement but as individuals making political. Politically. Inflected consumer choices really is all we're talking about but it's all meaningless. It's beside the point because they didn't drive anybody off.

They did not set the conditions that we live in. They're responding as we all are to conditions that have been made at the material Level and that are being re produced materially and had the effect of blunting class politics redirecting it redefining class in America. Redefining the subjective experience of living mass media changed what it meant to experience class. It broke up the reinforcing social experience of collective exploitation and created instead into fully individualized fully customized consumer experiences mediated experiences of life in America that definitionally and as first principle deny and neutralize class. As a subjective element of American Life. I don't know there's assess your class they have mass media. They have Collective class identity kind of the the data. I talked a few times ago about how France was the closest place that had like a alliance between new left students and workers. Because there were the factories did shut down in May of 68. But what happened there was a huge huge huge sector-wide raise given to workers to get them back and work and it did. It worked the same mechanisms work.

They work more in America because people's lives are already mediated by space in a way that they aren't in a European country because of free real estate. The post-war suburbanization of the country is the necessary social terrain where media can intervene and redefine human subjectivity and that that spatial intervention of suburbanization that's really only happens in America and that is why America is this Vanguard in so many respects and where and why socialism does not adhere here and there is no self-conscious socialist political party. But Eric foner wrote a article about this once that was very very influential for me um because this is a long-standing question in American Political Science. Why is there never a Socialist Party in the United States. We had socialist parties of course but they're always third parties. They never became dominant structures the way they did in Europe. Why not there's been a bunch of quite answers to this question that have been promoted and and this article that fona wrote 

He goes through a lot of them. He says why they might make sense why they might not. But then he ends it by just reversing the question and saying when we look at what the Socialist parties of Europe ended up from like the standpoint of History because that that question was first posed in 1911. You know when when socialist parties were everywhere and were redefining politics throughout Europe. They looked at America and they said what's going on but now. But he was writing into the 90s and or the or the early odds and and from that position he looks back and says well all of these socialist parties that the early 19th centuries American socialists were so envious of and have been wondering after for a century where did they end up this the labor party of of the UK. The the the Socialist Party of France. The sdp. Where do they end up SPD I guess they ended up exactly where the Democratic party was. They ended up exactly where the U.S left-wing party ended up. So then it's not really a question of why didn't America get a Socialist Party.

It's what what was present in America earlier that ended up occurring everywhere else and to my mind. It is simply that it created a non-class based political identity subjectivity for workers earlier and what allowed it to do that was Mass home ownership first mass access to exporporated Native lands Yeoman a yeoman um Horizon but then once that ended a home and land ownership for the individual and those processes ended up happening in Europe. Too you know the the the the European working class got access to those Imperial super profits too like that's how the world system post-war was set up. It was to keep the keep these Europeans from going crazy again with nihilistic or utopian social fantasies communism or fascism by allowing them some of that American Consumer experience and it worked. It worked enough to detach workers from an intuitive drive towards struggling for political power. Someone says even Khrushchev tried to do that yeah and and people to this day love yelling at Khrushchev and condemning Khrushchev as an awful revisionism for shifting to a consumer economy.

In the 50s he had no choice Stalin and he had every reason to do this Stalin. At the end of World War II was like okay let's just let's take a breather. Here we just got our asses. Hammered we need we need we need some space and some time but that meant allowing the United States to define the post-war economic order which they did and in that post-war economic order. If the Soviets were to compete with the West. They were going to have to continue exploiting labor creating State profits that could be invested into the project especially military spending. Once the bomb gets invented and that means that the the the hope the Soviet dream of worker control over their lives has to be delayed further what do you give them. In return you have to give them something else and the only thing left is some simulacrum of the consumer experience that they were certainly aware existed in the West foreign. So it's like if you don't think Stalin was wrong to make a make peace with this with the West. After World War II. Then you can't get that mad at cruise ships because he could not have continued the stalinist production Five-Year Plan vision without getting overthrown. Christian was able to take power by getting zukov on his side against um barrier and Barrio. At that time. He was he was he was able to hold power for like a number of months after Stalin's death and in that time he was making feelers to fully transform the Soviet Union into a capitalist economy he was willing to ex. He wanted to extend the Marshall Plan into the Soviet Union at the price of demobilizing class war forever so that's the other thing that was on the table.

When Khrushchev took power the fantasy that you're going to turn into a Albania just not possible I mean Mao is Mao actually tried to do that and what happened you had the cultural revolution and this massive this social wide cannibalistic Frenzy to try to resolve the contradictions of maintaining alienation at the point of Labor. With the idea that you're it. The you are in the Communist Utopia. How do you make that you have to have action. There has to be movement as I said it's not about a condition. It's about a trajectory. That is what we that's the dream that is what communism seeks to continue and uphold and so if you can't overthrow class relations at the point of production which they couldn't if they wanted to be a radios give them give them vacations to the Black Sea give them hamburgers miles idea no no. That we're going to give them We're going to give them a pageant of purification and after they burn through the country.

The last one standing was dang and said no give them burgers oh my god. Of course. There's still hope I just said it already happened you. I already said that the Hope has already been fulfilled that we are living in the back splash of it. We're we're living in the Halo. It's happened man. We did it we if you use that term ecumenically we did it if you use we as as as as nodes of consciousness. We did it subjective expressions of the objective permanence of Consciousness. We did it so that means our lives are infused with that meaning with that trajectory even if it appears hopeless but to really Embrace that is to sever yourself from a specific type of Hope and that hope is as I said for the culmination and Perfection and Redemption of a specific type of Western subjectivity that we are all captured by that is not going to be it and I think accepting that is the first step towards meaningful action. Meaningful political action meaningful social interactions of all kinds because at this point I think clinging to that hope is really clinging to the ego.

What is the restrict. Act is that the one about tick tock so it's the people are acting like this is going to be like the great Chinese firewall. Coming to America is that what's happening if so yeah I do kind of think having to go elsewhere for than the internet to have politically meaningful conversations is probably a good thing because yes we communicate ideas through this ether. But we also communicate stasis because we promise Deliverance through concentration and through deliberation they're going to ban all vpns damn. What's the penalty for having a VPN in China is it 20 years. It seems unlikely since so many of them use them. There's no penalty for using a VPN in China that's hilarious hahaha oh my God. That's so funny oh we're going to defend America's specific beautiful democracy against the threat of the horrible yellow Peril by by seeing their restrictions on internet and and vastly raising them. That's very funny. I don't think we'll probably do that.

We don't really need to do it as a thing. You know all right. I guess. That's it for now I hope. Some of that once again made sense. But I understand that you people are just enabling me as I am enabling you in a mutual cycle of enabling but that's all right all right peace and chicken grease.
