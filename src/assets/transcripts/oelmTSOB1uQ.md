Roots I showed up in boots and ruined your black tie affair the last one to know the last one to go. I was the last one you thought you'd see there and I saw the surprise and the fear in his eyes. When I took his glass of champagne. I toasted you said darling. We may be through but you'll never hear me complain cause. I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chase is my blues away and I'll be okay. Now. I'm not good at social graces. I guess I'll slip on down to the old ways that's cause I got friends in love with places down. How's everybody doing so bear with me. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go deep with this one. I'm gonna follow some of the uh some of like the uh. What do you call it the epistemological stuff you know or no that's not the word phenomenology that's it the phenomenological stuff the most goofy. But I really feel like this is part of my. I mean i. I realize that at the end of the day what I am doing with this series is therapy boils down to therapy like trying to heal like the pain that I feel like alleviate the pain of my life through talking about it and of course that's true of all social media. It is therapeutic and we've created a new genre of therapy which is like a collective group therapy where we talk up to each other and then use what we hear to inform ourselves and change our relationship to our pain and like. I think what people imagine they're doing when they do politics. Online is that they are participating in a program of alleviating some of the pain in their lives through pursuing control over their lives. I think that's the motivation that gets people to communicate politically on the internet like if we get this if we get this out of here if we explain our pain in a way that makes sense of it. Because that's what therapy's supposed to be right. It takes the fear and anxiety of not knowing why you're doing something why you're feeling. Some way what's going on with the the the calm and the centeredness of feeling like you understand what's happening to you and politics is about creating a structure that allows for understanding to accumulate.

Now the reason it doesn't is because we live in this inverted gnostic iron prison where up is down and all of the horrors that we uh that make our lives worse all the things that hurt not just humans but everything in the universe as in uh as in like or on earth. Rather. I should say as in things that uh harm at the expense that create a a pain that doesn't need to be there all of that stuff is what builds our structures of social order and that we compete within politically which means all we can ever do is create a new wound and then argue over how to treat it. We can never address the wound. We can only build a uh a symptomatic response like all of our political institutions under democracy are reactive. Problem pops up we figure out a way to solve it but the thing but the assumption of that new thing existing is unchallengeable because it directly emerges from the social structures that we have that allow us to exist within these hierarchies in places that we would prefer to be rather than others. So we try to assert ourselves politically and make the world better but we just end up dragging ourselves through this historical process that is governed by material forces beyond our control. We can only dimly uh perceive them and only in the backlash of events. We can only react that's the problem is the culture.

The counter culture to capitalist uh like action is in the backdraft of it. It our structures exist to sustain it above all else which means no matter what bad stuff happens under capitalism. We operate in a paradigm that can only address symptoms but that just creates new problems. It just creates new wounds and new pathologies that then have to be addressed. Now that is why political structures in a given um mode of production over time collapse internally because they cannot adapt to changing conditions and that is the whole fundamental driver of all of this is the fact that you are going from a structure that accommodated one x number of people under y amount of resources to one that is radically different radically more complicated and we create these incredibly intricate structures of coordinating resources and control on the top of this mindless engine of capitalism that refuses to accept that we are connected to the degree that our institutions are because we would not exploit each other the way we do if we felt that way and we don't feel that way because we live immersed in a culture defined by inverted values where where that which is uh harmful is good and I think the root for this. The root of this is the fact that as human beings as we come into like awareness of our body that our bodies exist like that it is a separate thing from the universe that that is a provisional and arbitrary division. It is essentially there just so that the infinite unified universe can experience itself basically and what drives that is entropy is change of energy in a system and so humans emerge as these individual beings that have individual uh best interests like narrow survival instincts and the body comes into the ability to arrange all of the stimulus that it gets on on a plate from most uh pleasurable to least pleasurable and then it coordinates where the pleasure comes. What doing what will reinforce the pleasure make more pleasure happen and what will reduce the bad feeling and it is that binary relationship that defines early consciousness. So you are a being that feels sensation then. It creates a moral world an emotional world around those sensations that is not that is essentially the the end result of a body trying to make sense of a feeling as in turn a uh a bodily sensation into a more abstract compact symbolic technology that can essentially reduce the latency in that uh sensation being perceived like you can turn that feeling a very very uh subtle sensation into a very densely packed uh informational uh uh system that you can then use to create a world that allows you to rewire your relationship to uh your ins your uh perceptions like if you feel. Good. You now have a whole complex of simple systems and symbols telling you. What good feels like and a whole bunch of symbols that tell you what bad feels like and then you as you feel good and bad you apply one or the other to those feelings now in the homeostatic relationship of verbally early tribal man. There's lots of bad feelings feel it sucks. Life is nasty british and short but this is the important part. Those bad feelings are not associated with your tribe with the social order that you live in all of the good things you feel you associate with the tribe. So even though things suck objectively. It's a bad life to live. It causes violence. It causes uh hostility to other tribes and and causes the kind of like unnecessary social conflict that gives rise to like machines of exploitation.

But you are fundamentally still wedded to this social organism because that is where that residual feeling of oneness that we are all capable of sensing with our full capacity of sense but which we basically can't to operate as of individual beings. In order to be individual beings. We have to build this false idea of a self that is separate and viable. It has a contained perspective and that's necessary but it does not have to be all-consuming. We are living now in a world at the end of this process of of civilizational uh uh development and class war and fight war over resources uh we are now fully divorced from that like our our our. If you're a first world subject. You have been so fully abstracted away from your actual body and its perceptions that you are so stuck in a removed universe where you are like god uh that it is impossible to imagine living in that world because what happens at the end of that process and the system and the situation we face ourselves now with every bad feeling that we feel we associate with other people we associate with the society we live in the social order that undergirds it the relationships that we have with others that is where all of our misery comes from. The only pleasures that we register are pleasures of the self because there is this fundamental opposition the same way that if you're thinking in tribal terms the other tribe can only gain at your uh. Your loss caught like a zero-sum situation which happens as resource. Scarcity encroaches at the end at the end of this system. At the end of that machine of civilizational uh mechanisms and worked out contradictions. You only feel pleasure and selfish pleasure under capitalism can only be pursued selfishly as in motivating you to cooperate not with what you think you are cooperating with as a citizen as a leftist as an american as as a human being as a consumer within capitalism and everything else that is social that actually has a residue of of of trans individualism. Uh is stamped with full alienation. It is uh. It is it is a monster to us it we can only uh we can only ever be hurt from outside and of course. That's what happened because all the institutions that we were building to protect us and to keep us warm have over time failed to do so because we were never once we created capitalism we were now ver. We were not serving our own desires. We were serving the desires of this algorithm because if you have a hierarchical social order that is dominated on intimate that is defined by intimate exploitation of others labor as in making them feel more pain so that you could feel more pleasure. It gives you a lot of time and you and your friends a lot of time to sit around and when you're sitting around you have to justify your idleness not even just the guilt of knowing that what you're sitting on is on on others labor but the question of now what what do I value at this point. What do I care about and for a while people in that situation.

The burgeoning bourgeois were wrestling with notions of like a transcendent god that they believed in or after that a nation or an ethnicity or a set of ideas or or even adherence to a a class. If you they were part of like the radical bourgeois imagine that they could be part of a a working class led movement for human liberation. All those were live wires. All of those beliefs had institutions that people associated with that which is good in their lives but now every institution has been fully alienated and so we have the ghosts of these ideas. We have the skeletons of these old notions because that's all we've been able to build and now we're fighting in them like history as mark said is a nightmare weighing on the brains of the living. That's what he means by. This is that even though we are feeling intense alienation from capitalism our ability to identify our pain has been fundamentally reversed and the only thing that checks that historically has been a class politics class consciousness class conflict directed from a working class that is self-aware and we had that once again part of the reason that we're all very dis confused at the end of history. Here is that a lot of us on the left are working with these structures. These ideas that we're live that were invested in institutions that people could identify with their uh with their pleasure with their their individual and and and you know communal because it's always a mix of very few pure psychopaths out. There. It's like we are having every moment to repress our humanity and that's why we become neurotic. That's why we become a racked with uh with this compulsion to undermine our pleasure because we feel guilty about it. You need class conflict because absent a self-interested class material formation as in people who are working together to build institutions that then reinforce behavior because right now all that we have that reinforces. Behavior is a mediated reality defined completely by capitalism and by market logic and by individualism that denies as irrational. The conception of there being a real self-interest that is beyond the self that is outside of the it cannot be viewed. It is invisible now to our uh to our systemic observation of the universe. We can cloud that we can try to mess with it.

We can commit ourselves formally to religious fanaticism but it has to be fanatic to make up for the lack of belief at the heart of it. What you would need to defeat that historically has been the counter hegemony that that gramsci identified where people are having their experience marked not by just their interaction with the markets but by their interaction with institutions governed by non-market logic and in fact anti-capitalist logic like a militant working class and of course. It's very fitting that gramsci was talking about italy because he basically called how it went a war of position between a hegemony a capitalist hegemony in italy among uh within its uh bourgeois state and then this counter hegemony within the uh massive uh base of the uh italian communist party which was able to build institutions like guild halls. Recreation centers schools radio stations newspapers and of course. A durable set of uh political power structures that they had access to. There were communist mayors all over italy who were able to exercise power through these institutions. Now of course this had to be destroyed. This is why you had gladio because this was the biggest threat to the capitalist post-war order that we'd set up after world war ii that had emerged because it was mass-based because it generated its own uh.


Overriding behavioral structures is what I'm saying because the individual cast in this lot is still obligated by some simple self-preservation. The task of trying to come back into harmony try to live according to uh like a self-motivated sense that the good thing you're doing is the right thing that you should be doing the good thing feels good rewiring essentially your brain so that it is not a question of fee of indulging yourself and then feeling guilty about it because the guilt is part of the pleasure. This is the key. This is the key thing about the the neuroses of of of middle class liberalism that defines everybody who is in the lap of capital right. Now even though they're feeling precarious and terrified it is in a position where they feel like. They have benefited from a system because they are wired in to a notion of self-interest that is deeply bound and as we all are though struggling against it. It is a not in our stomach that we're trying to untie it's just the tools. At our disposal are the our own shoddy intuition made worse. By the the conditions we live under of isolation and then social institutions that only reinforce behavior that dot that reinforces that belief so if you're operating from an understanding of yourself as part of a social unit. Social organism that by its existence assumes a supernatural or transcendent power that you are in communion with right because that's what faith is right. That's the it's it's.

It is the thing that doesn't show up in the x-ray because it cannot be described in sterile uh symbols because it is a temporally fixed moment in time when you felt something because the feeling is what you're actually being imprinted with the thing you tell yourself happened is your brain figuring in this orthogonal world that you that you experience because this is the key point that I'm trying to make above all else with this is that you're feeling good and you're feeling bad why you're feeling that you can only guess at now the more you're present in your body in the moment. The better you're able to guess. The more you are elsewhere which means the more you have are either if idle guiltily idle or if busy anguishly gets busy forced to labor doing unpleasant and painful and scary things. Those experiences literally are your identity. Those trauma points are your identity and then you build a a world out of them. But that world is an approximation and because we are so often traumatized by by the fact that our lives are defined by trauma and more trauma as time goes on because of uh how much we're feeling unchanneled misery because feeling a bad sensation is not that bad. If you know why and you know it's not a big deal if you feel every pain. As just this disembodied injury. Over time you have to start you have to explain where that's coming from and if you are understanding what it is you can act in a way that alleviates it. But if you don't understand what it is all you can do is ignore it and you can only ignore it by indulging in the stuff that is making things worse.

It is distracting like my. I always have now after my leg spinal injury. I always have my entire right leg on fire with uh with nerve ending uh inflammation. It's like. It's like. It's all asleep and that is just that's a constant feeling. I have now I could if I like sat and like really tried to feel it all the time that would be unpleasant. But if I kept feeling it all the time I would know where it came from and I would be able to correlate more accurately the source of my bad feeling like yeah my leg hurts. It tingles it's because of my spinal injury that was permanent damage to the spine. Now it sucks to do that so the only other option if you're not going to feel. It is to try to not feel it and like if you're living a normal life the easiest way to do that is try to ignore it but to ignore a felt sensation of pain.

You have to indulge some fantasy of pleasure. You have to be seeking pleasure like a goddamn hound dog. You're driven to it. And I think you're driven to it to some degree no matter how un pained you are like. This is the defining characteristic of life is. It's. It's these sensations good and bad and then the the the the trauma of sitting between the two and not knowing what's coming next and not being able to to get ready for it and not being able to understand it. And we're trying to arrange that but we're doing it with our our our mind. This separate thing and uh and so. I would like try to pleasure myself like literally jack off uh sit and watch tv instead of move around which sucks uh read but then watch a movie do something pleasurable because doing something unpleasurable just grinds you in your grounds in your body. More so.

I was just turned into this lump but every pursuit of pleasure that I did to get out of my body was only making it harder for me to be aware of what is actually happening and so of course. I became very quickly a very very bad hypochondriac. Every pain in my body became fatal. This is going to kill me because it really was my fear of what. I was doing to myself sublimated like. I knew that the things I was doing were bad for my health. Therefore. I would die earlier than I would otherwise so. I had that knowledge that I didn't want to face though because I could ignore it but that comes out then in my body my brain as a separate thing. It's like an intermediary. Uh uh hologram version of the world says oh uh yeah. No that's killing you you have cancer because I cannot be morally dissuaded from doing the most pleasurable thing because nobody's stopping me and in fact the market is telling me. That's what I should do. And in fact all these things are worthy pursuits and then one way or another I i should be doing them and that me doing them is worth it the the the the pain and misery. The world of the the howling screams of misery that are pulled out of the earth to to allow me to do. This are worth it so. I could only so I could only express so.

There's no god right. There's no god overhead. Like that puritan figure has now been extinguished by modernity. There can only be fear of my death as in the time when I am no longer god when I am dethroned as god a thing that as time goes on becomes harder to process as I spend more and more time in your head reifying this thing and as you're driven into anxiety by these feelings that if you were grounded in your body you would be able to understand and process and not let them. Spike. Your heart rate make you fearful and I mean that's why why the opium epidemic is literally bodies in pain trying to get out of pain. You know in a with with an exterior thing because we don't have the ability to do it ourselves. We literally don't have the ability to do it ourselves we feel it. We feel our soul just screaming because we are more aware of death every moment and we are literally feeling it. In our bodies in different ways we are ignoring those feelings and turning them into these boogeymen to to to wake us up. These feelings are our brains check engine light telling you. This is a problem and the thing is drugs are a necessary way at this end of history to deal with this realistically because every context all throughout social civilization.


You have exploitation on one hand and then human beings trying to establish a stable social order on the other. Those two things are happening at the same time one is driving the other because once you have settled in agricultural civilization you have a situation where the pain of living is now no longer being distributed equitably through a social body. It is being hierarchically assigned now. This is a necessary condition for civilization is the thing this is where anarchists are wrong. This is where this marx is correct mark's. This is like the deep  that I think makes mar becoming btfo in my opinion is that as we see on the senegalese islands and in in the amazon uh in in a in a fekund uh material context. The hunter-gatherer tribal mode of human civilization is essentially uh uh eternal. It is homeostatic. It's not going to go anywhere. What changes. It is the introduction of scarcity into the environment. The requirement to adapt to survive now adapting to survival is how you literally. This is how you get a social evolution that's how social evolution works. It works at the same time and alongside individual evolution. The two are a single process and so humans adapted to survive in their specific geographic environment and in so doing created hierarchies because that division of labor is necessary for an efficient exploitation of the environment which you need to use to create the technology to uh to do what you can't individually and collectively as people which is adapt to the environment distribute resources and that means some people are going to have to sit in rooms and think of what to do. While other people are are working because there is an unequal distribution of talents in the universe and they have to be gathered around facilities if they are to uh be effective.

Now the thing is is in those early days in the very early era. There's an assumption. I'm sure the people creating the system that okay yeah. They'll do the hard work. We'll do the easier work. But it'll be okay because you know. We're all in this together and at first they are but then over time the reality of spending most of your day at physical labor versus sitting around or training to do military service creates a cultural gap and creates two new competing orders classes within this thing that had previously been a unified social organism. It splits the cell and now that hierarchy and that technology are going to go to work on the people within them and create classes around positions of power within them and those are going to change over time because remember we're creating a stable system right. This technology this social technology this actual technology. This will allow us to thrive in this uh environment but the environment changes resources are depleted.

Action creates reaction and the system cannot see them and adapt to them because it is wired around maintaining this class's uh uh hedonic uh uh cocoon which they want now more than they want their species to survive or to live in a  in any kind of harmony with anything they want. They want their position within the hierarchy to be maintained and then the history of class struggle that marx talks about is these two classes going to war now the thing is well. It is pressure from below that breaks up the thing that pressure is always going to be harnessed to one faction within the sit and around group because being in the sit and around group gives them technological advantages over the people who do not have access to that time literally to that time to that unalienated time to that time. When you're feeling good that time when you are thinking yeah you know this social system is actually good and I like it. It's good for me because you're associating pleasures with it. Now at the bottom and the reason your conflict is emerging. Is those people increasingly see the system as the cause of their misery but they're insufficiently uh.

They are compelled by like either slavery or later more refined technologies. Like like feudalism or capitalism. They are kept away from the social formations that would allow them to uh assert control of the technology of hierarchy and you see that fight through all of your world history. The emergence the the the stasis of feudalism broken up by the black death in europe capitalism emerging and the capitalist mode of production creates something that is new in history. The lower half of that equation that I was talking about uh being turned into the type of people that are on the top of the distribution that the technology and the proximity of working of the working class would allow them essentially to use time more efficiently.

The same way that the ruling class does by writing newspapers by taking by acting uh within a like a self-interested context cooperating uh along like a class line. That is not what they're telling you like you have to come to class consciousness against everything you're being taught by your social order. You have to break against it and you need help doing that you need help to sustain that breach and this is the first time we have a class for itself at the lower end. Now at the top end. They're not really of themselves but their self-interest binds them. Their individual neurotic personal self-interest is identical no matter where they are within that divide side of the divide on the other side of it. There is this fundamental alienation that grows greater over time but has a harder time being politically uh useful absent something like a working class and marx's vision which I think is still correct in every meaningful sense is that once you have this working class that can more efficiently utilize time to create structures of power hierarchy and technology that are not based on the individual desires of a bunch of capitalists but on the collective social desires of a self-conscious working class that they claim they battle with capitalism for control of that technology and that was the 20th century.

The law. I'd say the long 20th century. Hell started in 1848 started with the with the with the uh with the festival of the nations or whatever but ended in 8 1989 because once you have the fall of the soviet union. You have the fall of a project that is understood to be working-class self-con self organization and now we are in the aftermath of that. So we have these social forms that were created by this process in a moment after the extinguishment of the conflict. I think we can say in a real sense. Marx predicted that the struggle between classes results in one winning or the common ruin and I am afraid. We are in the early stages of the common ruin. Now that doesn't mean humanity is doomed and it certainly doesn't mean that there's no reason to do anything in life but but hedonically enjoy as we've discussed it builds up. It builds up. You are rakianly army armoring yourself every second as you pursue any kind of black-pilled lifestyle because no matter what pleasure you're getting out of it. Your body is registering a constant and increasing cringe as every cell of your body is freaking out about your. Alarm clock in it that is going to go off and you're not going to be god anymore and that that is the individual version of the social crisis that emerge around revolutionary moments and the reason that this is.


This is like a meaningful distinction here when you say the working class is the first to come into itself. The fact is is that well mark well. Mark said previous um you know the previous eras of uh human social production. Like slave society and feudalism. You had a class in conflict and then one winning. But it really was in all cases a civil war within a ruling class different types of rulers at war with each other and um. Traditionally it has been rulers who have uh organized themselves around different types of capital capital that is uh embodied in like the the total abstractions of the market the international capital or the grounded geographically defined capital of like national capital and that's why like we're now in this post post-89 world seeing what looks like this titanic battle between the left and right but is in fact a like all previous uh class extinguishing civil wars uh a inter inter-nessing battle within the ruling class represented by the republican and democratic parties representing in turn national uh capital and international capital. These are simply people who have all benefited from capitalism are all deeply invested in maintaining capitalism but have felt increasingly alienated from the social order as their ability to enjoy themselves in it declines i.e boomers. I'm talking about at the political level here because this is just a puppet show for us to watch while the real uh worms are turning uh outside of the democratic process and so it is a civil war between the boomers. The people who in the sixties believed either whether they were right or left the middle class of the 60s believed and and the workers believed too at this point. This is the thing it was it was a there was a a situation where you had workers who were part of a meaningful part of a political project and and had uh power and and coordination and the ability to assert workers class interests as like an actual poll of identity and activity. But it was this it was a three-part stool but that broke away in the seventies. The democratic party no longer relied on the working on the labor movement for money and that was the end of that and that gave us this symbolic battle between the two. The last people in america to believe that america the americans political institutions are meaningful. We're talking about the last people to experience america on an upward trajectory for most of their lives.

These are people who saw things get better in their adult lives. They fought as kids to make things better because they thought they had control of political institutions and they lived that way they they acted that way and a lot of them did want to create a transcendent moment. They wanted to get where communism should get you which is a collective consciousness shift. I do think that that is the teleology of of marxism and I think it is where the human race is destined to arrive somewhere sometime. I think it has already happened not necessarily though in this universe and so now politics is dominated by these people who tried to change the whole universe. I want. I want I wanted to be anything. I want which means to be a capitalist consumer subject uh but I also want everybody else to have that too so.

I don't feel guilty that was the uh new left in a nutshell. It was the children suburban children of uh of the suburbs who would experience lives that were idyllic in a way that no human experience had ever been a democratized luxury that had never been a human never existed in human history and this new class of people who thought my god I could do anything. We can do anything and tried to do it but could only do it as individuals because at this point they were no longer hooked to the working class movement. It had been broken after the war red scare and the taft-hartley bill rip the heart and soul of the labor movement. It still is a part of influence. It's still there as a as a player at the table and you can still as a working class person in the 60s vote for democrats and have that help you and understand it to help you but its ability to respond to changing events has been destroyed because now it is uh socially reactionary and that broke up happened because it wasn't strong enough and I honestly think it's because we there's a way we could have gone after world war ii and we didn't and all those things that were going to burst forth and and subsume the american cultural landscape and br create the current uh like schizophrenic uh uh american identity. It was the fact that we we had we we we we were losing. You can look at this stuff sort of as like a a cultural nervous breakdown as a society becomes self-aware and realizes the limits of its uh mortality like that's that could be the 60s like if the great depression is the america reaching the edges of its viability as an individual state as a project of land accumulation like that shock happens and then there is enough of a working-class momentum to build an actual material machinery to address that which is what the new deal was. But it was a compromise with capitalism. A compromise that led to a truce during the great uh uh the great patriotic war. But then when hostilities resumed after the war. I think for a lot of reasons. I think truman being president of being a significant one of them. Uh the working class was not able to uh resist the counter-revolution but it's still hat but the deal that had been struck for high wages a seat at the table control like real influence over the domestic policy of the of the democratic party my god and increasingly the republican party too like eisenhower codifies the new deal.

This is upward momentum for everybody. This is life gonna be better for everybody life better for my kids. So it felt like it was a real thing but it was unmore to the cultural questions that their kids were going to have because those are the questions not of working-class people who went through the trauma of the depression and world war ii and then got a nice piece of land and didn't want to lose it and people who took that  for granted and who wanted their government to reflect their values and they tried but they could only try alone and so they thrashed and fraught and and and were crushed. The state did a hell of a lot to do that. Cointelpro did a lot to do that mk. Ultra did a lot honestly. I think to do that the assassinations the  deep state just deciding like in italy to say to supplement the the uh the edifice of capitalist democracy uh with this iron hand which is inevitable and necessary. This is the system kicking into self-preservation. This is the immune system of capitalism kicking in okay. You guys have had your democratic fund but let's get serious here and what happened was we all learned. We all reckoned at the end of the 60s okay.

We can't change this thing. What are we gonna do and the avenues that were opened to us by capitalism were well if you already have a little money or you can imagine getting. Some you can be anything you can do anything but just you and for a broad cross-section of america that was a good deal. California ideology that underpin the internet was a bunch of uh hippies who came back after the war to realize that uh their dreams of of transcending the miseries of capitalism that they understood to be deeper than just uh you know um that they were deeper and more uh more spiritual and existential than just a matter of material exploitation. They could still dream of making that happen still still dream of a truly democratized space online. The new frontier. The frontier that always emerges to let us imagine to let off steam for the for that class. For those hippies. It was either silicon valley or just uh the humanities department. Those are the two places you could go you go into the the dream of the internet or or or teaching the new next generation of kids all these ideas about uh about class that you learned in books for the people who didn't give a  about any of that their their parents. The homeowners they got home ownership as a guarantee of investment in the system. Your taxes are going to go down and the value of your home is going to go up. You're not going to go up. You're not going to get higher wages but you're going to get that and you're going to be able to access credit markets from that equity. That's a deal and now we're at the end state where all of these people the people who the hippies who got bought off with uh with their mind palace and the hippies who got bought off uh and the hippies and the squares who got bought off with um with home ownership and of course. There are a lot of the same people. Like these. The the comfortable hippies are homeowners that's why they're so  happy imagining making things better in this in the cyber realm or with their politics or like caring so much about black lives matter.

It's because they're very comfortable and they're happy about it. But they're also guilty about it. The squares and the reactionaries aren't guilty but their lives aren't as good anymore. Their lives suck because they're old they're gonna die. They're gonna give it all up forgetting the fact that they're bored with it all anyway. They can only feel their bodies. They feel their bodies. Their bodies are in pain they're in misery at every moment and they don't know why they cannot correlate their physical sensations to an accurate understanding of the world. They're filtering through an entire life of neuroses of living out the schizophrenic break of the post-60s world and so it is a schizophrenic break that creates two cultural uh polls around two political parties because in this new realm you are free to do anything as long as it's spend and consume and create an identity through that consumption and that includes voting and rooting for people in politics. Just like it does sports and so these things are intertwined and part of the same process. So these people vote to reaffirm their identities. The majority of democrats and republicans because everybody else nobody else believes in it anymore. Everybody who came later or is the same age but didn't get that has given up long ago in this system giving anybody anything so they have a rightful total disillusionment with the political system. Some of them still vote but they are disillusioned from the system. These people still  q anon deep state pedophile network to be your enemy and uh you have to imagine if you're a liberal that there's that tucker the nazis and putin are gonna come and destroy you. It's schizophrenia. It is one identity that cannot reconcile itself and that is what we're all trying to do is reconcile our identities but doing that requires being in your body and that's easier for some people to do than others. And this is why traditionally the uh the wise men of a religion tend to find a way for it to actually be good that they get to uh just sit around all the time like you know what I understand you're working for this stuff but don't worry. I'm gonna say some really cool  to you like that's the priestly class for anything and it's now people like the media social media stars myself just the new priestly class to tell you that it's okay that you're working so that.


I don't because. I got some stuff to tell you and the thing is they do they're not lying. They're important. You need to have the  sit on some anxiety and try to make sense of it so that you can make sense of your pain. But the thing is is if you look at that without good faith. In others intentions. It becomes uh horrible to contemplate because that means everybody is a say it with me. Now grifter everybody is a damn grifter because we assume the bad faith of everyone else because of our own bad faith because politics is pleasure. Sport play and spectacle and our pain around politics is not real pain. It is redirected pain that we use to spin a narrative that gives us pleasure and that means that we're not good faith political actors. So we go out to to to do what we think we have to we we go to do our duty. But it's piggybacked on top of our just id like desire to indulge and that is why the task of social. The the the human being in these in these emesi is the mesh always in these structures. The structures are there to determine every moment of their life but this is the important thing the structures.

The determinative structures that we are enmeshed in the the clockwork logic of stimulus and response that we are or that we are made up of and the reality of which denies the the possibility of free will that is real. Those actions do happen and they often form the basis of our of our decisive action and therefore abnegate our free will but they don't entirely because we are not fully aware of them. It is our ignorance that gives us free will because we're getting at the other side of these feelings right so you get a sensation of some kind at a certain point. It disappears then it comes back as symbols. Then it comes back as visual and then later uh linguistic sensory packaged abstracted symbols of the thing and the the closer you are attuned to that transaction. The better. You're gonna get the the closer to what your body is actually experiencing you're gonna get but over time as you're being traumatized as your attention is being pulled out of your body because it hurts too much to be in it your ability to correlate gets obstructed and you build a world that is not that actual world. You live in you build a hologram that you live inside and you live in the hologram the matrix. But when you act it actually acts on the real world and it causes reactions. So you break up at every point the cause and effect uh structure and the way that works is everything has happened. There is indeed a multiverse where everything every possible movement of an atom is accounted for consciousness moves through this space building up a narrative that corresponds to what that body is feeling but it is moving through these universes. It is not actually moving the body the body is going to move depending on that rigorous uh billiard ball causality but which mind is in it that's determined by the mind that is you stepping through the quantum.

Gate. Now you're going to largely be determined like where you end up in that is going to be determined by the structures you live under. Not just the material structures value systems symbolic orders experiences with people and the way that you correlate those people to symbolic orders. What your body senses how it experiences things is great like. I don't have a lot. I have way fewer options than I used to to be what what kind of life. I'm gonna have and what. I'm gonna have what's gonna happen in it and what's gonna happen when I die and all that stuff. I had more options earlier in my life. I had more options earlier but at every point those options are being winnowed down by the forces of the universe but the specific shape of it is an experiential phenomenon. It is me remembering things I am remembering them across and through this gauze this quantum gauze of of multiverses so like think of it. As a think of the universe all universes as like it's just a  giant bowling ball like a giant basketball right just filled with possibilities every every item every every every single uh piece of matter ever they can be arranged in different ways right well. No they're that at a given point they're fixed right because we know within the the causality we understand it. There is a a deterministic element here like you can you're only thinking about something after you experience it and that means that it's been caused and then so you have all these atoms little points little points in space time all throughout and then the individual consciousness is essentially a little ghost playing connect. The dots within this basketball does this make sense that is how you square in my mind freeville and determinism. He said yes everything is fully determined but which universe you're experiencing is determined by your choices which are mostly over determined by your structures but not entirely because you are still there.

You are still in your body in a moment which gives you the ability. The hypothetical ability to actually take that feeling that thread of sensation reach through that black hole where it's bring brought into uh abstraction and then pull it out and actually feel connected fully through a chain of reasoning and emotion to emotion reasoning to emotion and this is all that the religions seek to do is to give you symbols that are packed enough with positive emotional uh emotional sensation. Memory of pleasure that when you see them when you think about them you feel that way and if you feel that that will change the way you react to the work that you you interact with the world. It will change how you react to stimuli. Bad things won't feel the same way good things won't feel the same way. The same grooves that rep repetition has put in your brain will not operate the same way and you can in fact regroove your brain but what you're actually doing even though if you look at the brain in a microscope it'll say yeah. No this brain is regrooved in reality. What happened is there's a universe where your brain wasn't grooved. There's a universe where your brain is grooved when that gets grooved a certain way is different in every universe and each one of us. If our brain gets grooved in a certain way has an experience of that happening that makes it happen but it's determined by the choices they make and so this is like this is what all the great religious traditions seek like if you're smart in a certain way not like smart basically means you are able to abstract down symbols to a certain degree of um of pleasure basically that you can do them in a way that totally invests your attention. Like that is what sharpness is to me and it varies based on all the other stimuli places you're getting like what signals you're getting from x y and z and like how you then um are able to express them and those things are determined by your biology and by what your biology encounters. So we all have different skills and abilities because of that and the challenge of life is to orient those pleasant sensations. Those things that make you think there's nothing to worry about like like a feeling beyond just a a pleasure pleasure standing in for the fact that you wrote this program.

This is your  game you are the one in charge of this thing you are the projector of the hologram but what that means is that you are also literally the goddamn universe and that you are standing in the uh in the tension between those two things that will resolve and there and when it resolves it will resolve on your terms because you're there the thing that's preventing you from thinking. That is that we have an ego structured out of necessity to pilot this body along narrow self-interest but that in so doing puts us closer and closer to death. Because our bodies are saying one thing we are doing the opposite. Therefore we are draw pulling ourselves to death. Our body makes more and more noise like our body and I'm not. I'm not talking like you know tumors or anything like that. I'm just talking about just and not even things you could necessarily sense like a lot of anxiety. I feel is like is is is is detecting bad physical sensations and then filtering through your neuroses instead of confronting them for what they are because you're in this fantasy ego land and at a certain level. When the question becomes you now are going to go across. There's a bridge that you have to cross to godhood that requires breaking up and destroying the ego but that is where all value resides that is what good and bad are and we have no understanding outside of uh. We have no understanding of good or bad outside of that. But that's only if we have spent our time wiring our brains towards self-annihilation because death approaching slowly and being aware of it. As it's unfolding should move you through a series of insights that will literally pilot your body through space-time to the sensation of full unity of consciousness. But there's a catch in order to pursu see it that way. When the actual unfolding of demise happens you have to have faith that that other is out there that that other is you that your reasoning is solid that you're on the right track literally the right mind track. If you're not you will pull up. You will project with whatever brain power you have left for the rest of your life. Visions of torment and misery meant to to punish you as a way to imaginatively process the fear that you're feeling as your body is feeling the sensation of death. Now of course the way to avoid that is.

I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm dead you get the big white light you don't have to reckon with anything and that is the death that we seek subconsciously and in pursuing it we make hell for ourselves. We think we're getting it off easy but in reality we are making it so that we make the world around us worse. We make our own lives worse. We feel worse and we feel worse about other people and then you die.


Like this is why I think the great one of the great films. I do think that uncut gems is brilliant in a way that is deep beyond just like a fun movie. Like howard ratner is essentially a cabalist. He is an unconscious cabalic master. Howard ratner knows he's gonna die as we all do but he knows it and he knows it deeply into a deep sensation because he has been whittled into a being of perception by his life experience by his uh by the brain the body and and the life that he was inherent that he inherited. He knows that he knows he's gonna die. He knows he's going to cease to be. He also knows that there is a universal consciousness. He knows that there is a god that he will be one with but he cannot imagine the sacrifice of pleasure. It would take to meet him to meet it to meet everything without fear. He could think about god all day and it'll only make him feel his own pain more and as he and so he gambles. He gambles to seek the divine. He gambles to get that feeling to him in his mind. It's just the feeling of winning but it's not it's that sense of no thinking. No thought the sense of all of that but not as an extinguishment. As a apotheosis. He wants that feeling and he engineers his life beautifully through the through the through the divining of the kabbalah such that he will go out at the very top of his life which means that he can meet that moment of happiness moment of reunion without fear and that is the flip. That's that's the catch of this is that this means that you have to always be thinking present about your body being in it and for me.

This is very difficult. I spent my first half of my life. I mean we'll see. It could be the whole of my life. I could be dead soon who knows. I mean. I do have a persistent thing. That like is that I i recognize is is the is the my immune system my ego's immune system kicking in which is to say oh. This is all happening like your spiritual awakening and  and like your new vocabulary. This is literally like your body being aware like like feeling below your level of perception something changing something deadly and that you're responding here by trying to get to a point of uh acceptance before it's too late before it's too late and I think that's true to an extent. But the thing is of course my bo my my brain my subconscious is not perceiving my bodily experience my pains as they actually are being generated. But I can't it is captured to deep subterranean structures of meaning which means that feelings that I have and have had my entire adult life are experienced at like the la gonadal primal fear level as threats to life now if I had spent the years since my injury in my body that probably would be true. So I understand that my life is like me having to basically hone myself honed down this like edifice of of neuroses of of egotistical self-creation that I have like. I have basically determined for myself what level of discomfort. I am based I am able to sit on and what actions feel good in that context. Basically I'm trying to have been trying to like a tv like an old tv antenna try to orient myself in a way that I can correlate the good feelings in my body. The good moments in my life to that sense that knowledge that symbolic representation of a feeling that gets lost in the translation a bridge and my ability to recognize my bad feelings as coming from my uh insistence on continually reascribing this ego. But this is all part of understanding my limitations. That's that's becoming my uh real motto clint eastwood and I believe magnum force a man's got to know his limitations. I talked about before about this with billy joel versus garth brooks and everything like given what I really think about how the mind works now what I really believe like deeper than anyone is going to convince me.

I'm wrong. I do think that it is possible as a human being to spend enough time like in your body to fulfill like the highest levels of enlightenment and achievement like bodhisattva like the  taoist alchemical process absolutely. I also believe that it is possible to be a believing christian or a muslim. Not in the sense of that they believe so hard that they have to punish others for their lack of belief because it only reminds them of their lack of belief. I mean people who correlate god to the actual universe and not to just their ego which is what most monotheists do at this point. But most everybody does at this point. That's what he that's what capitalism has done to us and of course. Part of me wants to be one of those guys oh my god who wouldn't to just be like an immortal uh sword emperor or whatever the  or like obviously not like literally but in the mind like able to harness the power of the mind. The the the unused and unusable without practice capacities of the mind to drill so deeply into experience as to be one like to stay there or just below there for like a large portion of your human life. I think that's possible.

I also think it's not gonna be me. It ain't gonna be the  fat old american who spent the his entire life until very recently doing rituals of misery reinscribing the opposite of the truth on every in every feeling. I've ever had as I've been living in my own head building this luciferian temple that I thought was the world and now it's my body and it's like these grooves are deep and if I try to like press against them. I know. I sure should know that I'm going to have to use like drugs and  and that guarantees that there's no way this body is going to hold on for that state for very long. I would destroy myself. I'm gonna have to accept either some kind of just up or if I do have a little bit of time and the motivation of mortality to really focus. I can work through it but it's going to be. It's going to involve a lot of fear and pain and a lot of old structures grooves that are going to have to be rewired like I'm going to have to shift significantly off of this axis and I feel like I am. But it is that sense that I am you know still still not there that I'm not attuned that helps pull me I think. I hope in the right direction like right. Now. I'm able to say I feel good enough about what I'm doing here. The other projects I've got going and we're gonna start doing a lot more stuff.

I feel like it is not hurting anybody at least as little as something like engaging in the monstrous murder. Festival of uh western capitalism can be it's not hurting anybody and of course it's hurting people my god. It's hurting millions of people. There's their screams are echoing but here's the thing taking that misery and putting it on your individual discrete actions. As a person in capitalism is an act of neuroses. It is you are too distanced from the pain to register it properly because you are an ego and you have to filter everything through an ego. You have to when you encounter this misery and you want to give it the name of a human solidarity. Because you are a civilized person. You want to take responsibility but you can't not in a way that will be commensurate with your participation in the system and your distance from changing it. Yes you can do politics but you're still going to be consuming you're still going to be at the end of the supply chain and you're never going to be able to do anything enough to make up for that unless you fetishize it unless you turn it into a ritual of performance. You think you're doing politics. You think you're fighting for rights but you are actually indulging your ident your uh your ego.

Now. The thing is these motivations are going to uh power most bourgeois uh revolutionaries and have throughout history powered bourgeois revolutionaries. That's not the problem. The problem is that in previous generations those bourgeois revolutionaries were hooked into a actual mass working-class movement that had democratic accountability throughout it and that enforced courses of action that broke through the bourgeois narcissistic miasma of their leaders and allowed them to act in accordance with understanding of what's going on around them. Now we exclusively have at the most active edge in terms of the spectacle. I'm talking about posting the media creation that we then interact with and it makes us that makes for our understanding of the world and of politics and that is about where that's where they're here. That's where their limitations come in ask yourself. What what right now can.


I do right now what if I don't feel good why don't. I what should I be doing that. I'm not and more importantly why don't. I want to do it if you do know what you what you should be doing and you don't do it that builds up this anxiety that then gets turned into these fantasies and and uh and ghouls and projections of of uh of oppression and uh and judgment. So if you do know what you should be doing you do know it feels in one sense. What you should be doing then find out why you're not and then reorient yourself. That's what I am in my own way trying to do like. I find that as I if I sit around too much. I really can't enjoy it and then I can either try to fix that by intensifying the experience of sitting around or I can do something else that feels good and even though my body hurts right now. I can feel it. I feel my pain and it is in some senses emotionally a little overwhelming because I am very very connected to it. Uh as like this the way that I structure my ego which is trying to defend itself and which I have to immediate at some point if not permanently defeat break and the way I can do that is choosing to do things that reinforce feelings of harmony break up and reduce that feeling of of doing the wrong thing and that is how you square the question of like oh no ethical consumption under capitalism. No ethical consumption as socialism of course not but you have a duty to yourself to do what you think is right and just saying no ethical consumption under capitalism just patches over it and leaves you feeling worse so yeah. That's why I've come to terms with see. This is this is where I really think I've come to terms with my hypochondria. I have not fixed the thought that I am going to die soon I really. I really have not. I've given up trying to argue myself rationally out of the belief.

What I've done instead or what I'm trying to do is to feel that and then remind myself that that's cool that that's fine that you can handle it that you know how this works not specifically. And it's the specifics that  us up as we get closer to it. We get more anxious we need proof. We need more and more and more proof because we don't have the feeling. But it's a certain point our hand falters and if our hand falters and our body is giving us signals that it can't comprehend and is going to fall back on that old programming. You will be cast into some sort of torment not permanently though that's the thing nothing. I can't handle. I'll still be there at the end of it with everything and even if I don't understand completely even if I don't get that aha moment which it probably won't which very very few people historically have it won't matter because I will be able to cross a bridge of faith. I will be able to have enough stored associations with certain memories and symbols that they can bridge that uh logic gap that can't be filled because there's always going to be the remainder that cannot be resolved for because that is the inflection point of uh of abstraction before it is by definition ineffable. All right does that make some sense. I know it got in the weeds there. A little bit. I was talking about trying to imagine. The universe is like a ball with things going through it and I realized like a  brain. I mean I'm not the first person to have said this. This is very banal but I don't think it gets emphasized. Enough is that understanding a human life in the universe is not to imagine a person on a planet in in a in a fixed physical environment. It is a neuron firing through a full enclosed brain. It is it is a electrical charge running from one end to the other of a brain filling in the spot and the entirety of it is and imagine that like each one of those is. Like lighted up and the thing is they're not all going at once. They're going in different time spaces they're going in places but not they're never going all at once. That's why you can't experience that and why you can't live with it and why you can't be the immortal god emperor because you're always falling away from it. But the course that you take the experience you have makes up for that synaptic. Uh action and the and all of those synaptic functions simultaneously is is god. I know this is uh. This is also  but god damn it.

It's true. Everybody realized this in the 60s and then they just eventually couldn't keep it up. Some of them did a lot of them burned out but the system didn't allow them because they got to still be able to pursue pleasure they got to pursue pleasure. They got to be turned themselves into pleasure lizards and that's what they did and that is why their politics is schizophrenic denial of death and why they literally all want to die and why the republican ones of them are literally killing themselves. Everybody is seeking an end on their own terms. That is what everybody is trying to do. It's just they're doing it with greater or less degree of acuity. Howie ratner is like the  uh is the is the is the anti-buddha like he is able to get what he wants. But the rest of us we're only grasping towards it. Now when I say he gets what he wants and the rest of us don't that's not really true as. I said it. It all ends up fine it at the last moment's the only one that counts and it's fine. It's nice. It's good. It's good. There really is nothing to worry about for anybody anybody. I know that's hard for some people to hear but it's true for everybody. It's fine but our actions are causing. Other people. Harm our actions can hurt others and that pain is then you know felt and we feel it. We are the depositories of it of the pain we cause and that has to go somewhere and then that is why if we're really thinking about death that end is excruciating because we're thinking of all the pain we caused. We're thinking of our inability to do anything about it. Now at a certain point. You can forgive yourself and that is where jesus and amitada and pure land buddhism come in a brit.

A symbolic bridge powerful enough thwarted with association enough to carry you over the problem is for most people in our position. Those symbols are too raggedy and dead to invest with that meaning. So we have to build new ones but our on we have to live as though that weren't true we have to live as though our consequences have actions because that's what powers us through the thing and that's the engine of the thing and the question is what is our end what is going to power our engine what algorithm is going to power our engine and if it's our algorithm is one of that is in tuned with like the pursuit of uh of a harmony. We'll create systems that reinforce good behavior things that make people happy and then we will invest our institutions. Political social religious with meaning there will be meaning in what we do because we will feel that we are contributing positively. We can't do that. Now we have been stripped of that ability by capitalism. We fought for it but we lost but there is this doesn't mean that we will necessarily be enslaved by the system and turned into just ants because there is a mere coercion coercive and consent requirement for any order. Capitalism can only coerce so much it needs consent and it's losing that now the problem is. There's no working-class movement to right now to direct that feeling but there are movements of workers. You know like there still are people out there working and they still are working together and they have a vocabulary to bring themselves together using their new more abstracted notions of social relationships and they can build something and that that is like the thing that it doesn't matter if it happens or not.

This is the thing that's wrong about like thinking of these notions as teleological or saying like oh that like the historical uh uh process. The the contradictions stop after the end of uh class society that's not true but even if it did. It wouldn't matter because that state has to be at the basis of how you order politics for politics to make sense for you to decide what is the good thing to do and what's the bad thing to do because if you operate from the liberal lens. If you assume no we are just disaggregated consciousnesses that must be hierarchically controlled through technologies powered by self-interest not by people working together imagining a self that is expansive. If they assume a narrow self-interest is the motive is the has to be has to be the functional engine of uh technological hierarchy. Then they are going to create auschwitz no matter what they think their politics are or they're going to try to anyway. They're going to contribute to it because terminal capitalism at the end of uh. The promise of scarcity is a combination of humans at the very top of it as buffeted as possible from any contact with misery or discomfort and then at the bottom a class of increasingly uh perishable and unnecessary human labor inputs that can eventually hypothetically be replaced entirely by technological uh intensification and those are that's the only political project currently happening and even though we have to all engage in politics as it is unfolding. We should be aware that that is what we're seeing we're seeing a civil war within the petty bourgeois of america. The ones who vote over whether we're going to have a hierarchy of blood and nation or a hierarchy of meritocracy combined with social justice because in capitalism. Over time there just ain't enough surplus to go around. Somebody has to go hungry at someone else's expense and if you have fully developed capitalist institutions of power.

Those decisions are being made entirely by people who want and understand at a deep level that their real job is sorting out the people the right the landed gentry the geographically fixed less abstract capital wants it to be something that is not abstract. They want it to be skin color and language and religion and nationality something you can. See in here the most abstracted the liberal bourgeois. The cosmopolitan people in in touch with uh the knowledge sector and and finance want an abstracted meritocracy one around ability and morality people who have risen of their own uh combination of ability and morality. Not just people who are smart but moral smart people and the thing is is that moral smart people can't be moral in the sense that it has been developed by liberal society at its most refined edge if they are racist because their entire political project has been about feeling okay with being in the cat in in the bosom of capitalism and they do that by disavowing responsibility they have to hate somebody the landed the landed uh bourgeois. They just hate the poor. They hate the other. The bourgeois knows you can't hate the others the bourgeois. The the liberal bourgeois knows you're supposed to love the other because civic morality really is the same basic uh. Like you have you have uh. Religions are all expressing differently. You know the same vital truths and christianity does have at its base a hypothetical moral order that is in a tune with what is good that is in attune with what you should do that's in tune with what other religious traditions say you should do. But of course it's codified by systems of power and exploitation that have to turn it around but the desire is still there the understanding that that's what morality is hypothetically is still there. So that means the modern liberal at the most refined edge of capitalism has essentially a secular christian morality and that means that they have to to be moral have to act morally which means saving those among the doomed who don't deserve it. They want them to deserve it. They want the ones who suffered to deserve it and they want the ones who survive on the inside of the gilded cage to deserve it and that means punishing racists and it means uplifting minorities and that is a scripture that is a moral goal. It is right to try to do that if you accept capitalism as the baseline as the inviable reality and if you are working more than anything to preserve it and that is the if that we must reject because it's the same if that underpower that powers the right nationalism ordering of misery who gets hurt most who goes in who gets to be on the inside looking out who has to be on the outside looking in that's it and todd and like I'm sorry but a lot of the of the cultural language around toxic masculinity and  like that is really about sorting the worthwhile from the un and college exists to sort the unworthy from the worthy we don't have god to tell you who deserves it. We have the ivy league and the big ten we have this uh the california state school system we have nyu and that is why the liberal formula for uh for social justice after the fall of working-class power and the beginning of neoliberalism was uh university meritocracy plus affirmative action. Now of course affirmative action has been shown to not really help with concentrated poverty in black communities. What it has done is. It has given an easier route to middle-class black kids and for the liberal meritocrat the left meritocrat that's fine because now these people. These people who deserve it among the blacks are going to now be on the inside and are now going to be welcomed into the social sphere and can reflect to me my own virtue when I see them that's the most important part and more importantly. These will be people who went to college who got the  skill set who understood the manners of of uh. Abs totally abstracted finance capital and its cultural superstructure and and that's all that the left broadly speaking in this country can fight for because it's just backdrafting the democratic party we as individuals have to just identify that and engage with politics with that as an uns as an assumption not taking a side on this stuff as a partisan thinking that you're going to uh advance anything no you're advancing the wheel of this neurotic this.


This cultural nervous breakdown is all working within these structures to generate the momentum that they need just like capitalism is a flow media and culture is a flow. It can't be static. It requires movement but movement between our uh poles that are essentially uh unresolved cultural neuroses. But capitalist flow is consumptive as it flows it destroys which is not true of other natural systems. Other natural systems find limits and then respond to those limits but because this this social organism is commandeered at the top by people who have who have turned themselves into god. They cannot recognize limitations that's why the next stage of history if we should reach it which is has to be considered. An advanced stage is one where that dynamic is arrested where a whereas where a complex social organism of humanity using technology to distribute pain basically and labor through a system while maintaining a cultural cultural structure and maintaining um free time for all would be. The inevitable outcrop would be the eventual uh outcome of a uh of a some group of humans operating from a spiritual understanding. I would say of uh human interconnectedness. However you want to say it. I don't want to use. I don't think it'll be any language. We currently have because they're all exhausted. These are all ragged banners every believe every one of these things that we have believed in we have seen in our lives lose all credibility but just because if for no other reason than the alternative is the destruction of the entire biome and the end of the human experiment.

Eventually you get to equilibrium where the cyst where the body can pull back and say that's enough be able to sit in silence in a room and not have to be somewhere else not as an individual but as a society as in social structures organized to reproduce behavior to reinforce ideas to reinforce connections between feeling good and other people and the structures of government and and and hierarchy that those people create and this is once again. I'm getting back to the problem with anarchism. The hierarchy is necessary. The hierarchy is how you effectively distribute information through the system but the hierarchy does not have to confer with it. Social stratification and asymmetry of pain felt and comfort enjoyed. The hierarchy is the same hierarchy that the human body has where some parts tell other parts what to do. Some things do other work that others do but none feel aggrieved by it all are sustained by it and all of our our feelings things. We can't put into words things that we used to talk about in religious terms. Things that we're grasping now badly to try to find a new vocabulary for can be imbued with that idea of humanity and then people not everyone and not at the same amount but enough and over large enough groups enough times and over large enough groups will make decisions that keep the thing going there's going to be conflict. There's going to be continued contradiction but at a at a different level a new evolutionary stage.

I see this person says anarchism isn't against hierarchy. It's against unjust hierarchies but they think things like the state are inherently unjust hierarchies and I don't see there you go. I disagree with that because they say the state is an unjust hierarchy. No you need the state. The state was made by capitalism but also by human beings to deal with the issues of a mass social organism. It would be necessary at least for a while to carry out creating a social order where people have faith in their interactions with other people and are we are uh positively reinforced by other people. The state manages entropy thank you so that means that no unless you're going to tell me that anarchists don't don't think that the state is unjust. Then I do disagree with them. State structures are those that that a working class could seize two social ends. Now you can point to the soviet union. All you want that happened because they fundamentally failed at their task which was to ignite a world revolution everything after that was improv yeah. That's a good point somebody says there are it's not about just run just that is the moralism at the heart of anarchism just schmushed that is a necessary structure for human relationships. At the level of civilizational complexity. It is a necessary structure just unjust doesn't have anything to do with it. In the in a capitalist context. The state is useful and therefore just in the only sense that matters useful so please at least tell me that I am not an I'm not agreeing with anarchists here because I feel like I have discovered I'm hallucinating here a significant difference in belief. Now of course. I'm not an anarchist but I'm not a socialist either. I'm just an american. I'm just a consumer. I'm a schmuck. This is all in my palace. I'm making for myself so that I can inscribe actions with meaning the reason. Everything is anarchism really in america is because everything is theoretical.

The left is a theoretical proposition because to act politically in the given such in the current moment is to suffer it's to not have fun by every way that we have defined fun. It is deny ourselves to deny ourselves the pleasure that we have come addicted to myself. Included of course we are operating out of our our politics are operated out of pleasure seeking not entirely but the stuff that's the least fun is the stuff that most has to get done and here's where once again. I run out of road because what is to get done cannot be prescribed. It's being prescribed by people who are in a pleasure dome. I am in a pleasure dome. I am in a stately pleasure dome decreeing smoking some opium on that coal ridge ship. But we all have to act also in addition to what we absorb theoretically and I think there is something to be found in the understanding to yourself. What you believe because it makes it clearer when you have to do something instead of allowing your mind to be clouded by these reflexive reactive ego. Defense mechanisms got to give it to uh l ron hubbard. He he picked a very very good metaphor like aron hubbard wanted to make some sort of post-christianity for the jet age something that could fill in the spiritual hole of people who had seen god annihilated in nagasaki and hiroshima and auschwitz and he gave them a story and the basic metaphor that we are inhabited by dead. Traumatized ghosts is correct because the traumas of our lives are largely the traumas of our bodies banging off of institutions structures. Other people who have been forged by institutions and structures made by horrified dead ghosts and I realized and of course that's not true you know like literally. But it's a way to talk about the anxiety of of being a post war. American comfortable more comfortable than ever but still un unhappy still anxious still feeling a pain that can't be defined. He helped answer it in a way that they'd understand in the sci-fi lingo of that moment. Now it was a bunch of  and it created a cult of weirdos because hubbard was using this true insight to his own personal neurotic.

Uh ends which is what happens in the absence of a disciplining mass movement and like the 70s cult boom was people trying to escape the reality of capitalism's victory. They were trying to get ahead of the mushroom cloud the pure and that is an american tradition. Every american burst of like idealism and activism is is this attempt to get ahead of the mushroom cloud. Like first you had the rise of capitalism in england and those who still sought even though they were pr english even though they were protestants still sought community fled ahead of the mushroom cloud to find it in the woods but it fell apart very quickly because it was a capitalist concern. It was overwhelmed by the the project of american capital formation more people fled. The mormons are the next attempt to flee ahead and to establish some sort of community that keeps god in the land and then they got swallowed up too. The hippies were the first generation to think they could do it collectively because in the 1950s and 60s it felt like america could literally do anything if it wanted to if power was exerted and it felt like power could be exerted. They tried to do a  by their sheer will. A phased consciousness shift of humanity failed and then they fled the mushroom cloud the reckoning of the 70s. But why this moment is different is that what every point what has sustained the system was the comfort or the promise of comfort of the the lower middle class. The petty bourgeois the working class had fallen out of organization. They were now basically at the mercy of the of the bourgeois now but their pleasure is winding down and so the political sphere is dominated by these psychotic boomers who are denying their death and seeking it simultaneously. But the people younger than them have checked out of this political thing and things are getting worse and worse and they're gonna come to the question of what to do and it will not be press buttons because if they can't afford to press buttons literally the way that the boomers can that is where hope comes from it's not virtue. It is disillusionment. I think a lot of people like to think it's a progressive movement. Inherently that youth is progressive because they're scared of the alternative which is no people are being traumatized at a level unfor un not before seen amongst people with that access to cultural capital. How are they going to respond to it. It's going to be a lot of misdirected rage and a lot of it is going to get captured by the existing political structure but not all of it and the demands of helping yourself are going to intertwine with the demands to help your neighbor because it's going to be the only way you can.

Even if you are at the very end of self-serving you will not be able to sustain yourself without helping others and this is not a process that's going to happen in the future. This is a process that is undergoing has been undergoing and if it does lead to something when you look back at it retrospectively you will see a whole. Arc that is invisible to us now and all we can do is try to believe enough in each other believe enough in the poll that we have towards each other to act in accordance with it and therefore to act not according to what will feel good but to what will feel good what will because we'll still feel bad. Our bodies will still feel bad but the body never feels nothing but misery. The body feels pleasures too and how do you align the pleasures with someone else. How do you align the pain with this thing that has to change all right. I hope some of that made sense talk soon folks bye.
