Blew out the chicken man in philly last night. They blew up his house too down on the boardwalk. They're looking for a fight. Let's see what them racket boys can do trouble busting in from out of state and the d.a. Can't get no relief be a rumble on the promenade and the gambling commission is hanging on by the skin of his teeth. Anything meet me tonight in atlantic city. I got a job put some money away but I got the kind of deaths. No honest man can pay so. I drowned all. I have from the central trust. I bought us two tickets on the pub city maybe everything that does someday meet me tonight in atlantic city.

Everybody's giving me business about my background. What would you want right behind me. Here. I'm afraid. I'm not an interior decorator. What kind of art. What would you like to see behind me. I'm going to do a little uh poll here. I don't know there's something about the blankness of it. I kind of like like. We're talking here right. We're like we're we're spinning things out of nothingness concepts and ideas. We're bouncing them around. It's. It's a it's a fragile moment in time and that background is sort of the the palette you know if there's something there it seems like it's too over determined you know like it it. It shapes subconsciously for the person watching it what they're going to be responding to and I don't know if I like that. I kind of like the idea that's just empty. I mean. I gotta say the options.

I'm seeing here in the list are a little try hard soviet. Soviet flag really really have you not gotten anything out of these talking about the pointlessness of fetishizing uh irrelevant social formations. Funko pops you know what I should do. I should nail a bunch of dvd covers for kids movies like from the uh elizabeth warren uh barber shop if anyone remembers that one of the funniest bits of fake campaign shenanigans ever if anyone doesn't remember this during the uh. During the 2020 campaign there was a there was an attempt to create a elizabeth warren barber shop where they showed a bunch of black dudes hanging around in a what was clearly a recently rented office space and to make it appear more authentic. They hung a bunch of dvd covers. Dvd covers like peter rabbit. The the  you know like a a weed alien you know or yeah like a franz fazetta thing something kind of cosmic nothing too not grounded or political because that's not really the vibe we're trying to curate here all right so I'm settling on a book to do starting next not next wednesday. The wednesday after that uh for a book club about the german revolution and I think I'm gonna go with at least the beginning of uh. I just gotta make sure it's available because okay that's kindle that's easy you can rent it. You can rent kindles wow weird uh. I don't know maybe that's too long. Maybe we'll do like the first quarter of it or something uh the weimar republic by eberhard kolb. We're gonna start reading that and uh we'll like we did with reconstruction.

We'll go through another pivotal turning point that didn't turn to explain how we got where we are because I really do feel that we can only understand our moment if we understand it as one of capital triumph of the defeat of of socialism as a challenge to capitalism. Now that doesn't mean that we're doomed it doesn't mean we have nothing to do. It. Just means that our uh the the concepts that we have inherited from the left. Uh tradition need to be re-examined in a way that we really aren't doing instead. What we tend to do is fetishize uh what in retrospect are are a lot of movements that were always circumscribed by the failure uh to achieve the kind of critical mass necessary to challenge capitalism but that'll be fun. We'll talk about uh we'll talk about the sdp because uh it is amazing to think that in the country where socialism was always supposed to emerge and meaning the place where the culture the balance. The cultural national uh and economic balance of capitalism sustained exactly the sort of uh counter-hegemonic socialist uh milieu that marx predicted was in the end bourgeoisie out of revolutionary potential before the radical moment occurred and you know if it's interesting enough. We might read the whole thing we'll see but uh because the weimar the entire weimar republic is of course a fascinating period and and uh I i mean. I don't.


I don't really think it's terribly um relevant to the current moment as we've discussed many times. But I think it is relevant to why we're at the moment we are meaning. We have the ingredients for a socialist response to the crisis of capitalism. Uh that emerged in europe in the early 20th century that failed it failed and and say since the father soviet union we have been living in a in the uh in the world. The capital of capitalism triumphant and that means looking at how we got here and it means looking at as I've become more and more fixated on recently contingency historical contingency because that's the only thing that can rescue us from the horror at the end of history because that is the real joke of fukiyama. You know people made fun of people made fun of fukuyama for 20 years after 9 11 happened. Oh. Lol history ended considering what fukiyama meant by that he was basically correct because we might have things like islamic terrorism and and uh you know crisis is emerging uh uh and a continual uh conflicts within and between systems and societies in america in the world. But they're all totalized within capitalism.

Like we are there there is no more uh conflict between uh social orders. There's no more conflict between something other than capitalism whatever it might be uh communism or or pre-capitalist social orders that resisted capitalism being imposed on it. Those are all those have all been defeated but capitalism as marx knew uh unchecked will still at some point reach a point of critical and unresolvable crisis because of the contradictions contained within it. Whether or not socialism as it was understood uh in the 19th and 20th century can challenge it it still has a crisis within itself that has to be chap has to be confronted. I mean it's it's all of our duties as human beings to confront the crisis that we see around us and that make up our own lives and the thing about that cold war with china is. I'm sorry china is not an alternative to capitalism. You might it might be an alternative. It might be an alternative state structure and I would. I would agree that it has that uh that chinese capitalism is a uh more socialized.

I guess or coordinated restrained whatever you want to call it version of capitalism. Uh but its essential engine is the same and the process and you could really say that like what distinguishes it from from our like capitalism. The conflict between china and amer anglo-america really is a snake. It's the snake eating its own tail. It's the most advanced end of capitalism smack dab running into the tail end. The most recent uh uh formation of capitalism uh on literally the other side of the world from where it was uh originally conceived and so I really do think you either get con you either get apocalyptic confrontation if and that's that would be determined more by resources than anything more by external and exogenous crises created by things like uh global warming and you know uh conflict over real like real conflict over resources uh or it'll be some sort of merger. It'll be some sort of leveraged buyout because within those systems there's nothing within any of them that is not capitalism. But the thing that we can really take is solace.

First is that we're all going to die everybody's gonna die so all the really horrible stuff you're worried about imagining happening. The real monstrosities you're not gonna. See them you're gonna die before that and even the people who have to live in those horrible worlds. They're gonna die too and that's not the worst thing in the world. We've made it the worst thing in the world but it really isn't and the world will continue. The worlds will continue the the the eternal universe. The the the self-conscious mind that is the universe will still persist and and on the land on on land. Somewhere.

There will be some conscious beings who are able to bring together and synthesize the strands of history to to to transcend what seems to be the intractable horror of history. Why would you rather your species lives on you wha why be speciesist like we are we have like humans. Obviously. We talk about like species being and all that but like that really is only one level of a process like coming into awareness of humanity. As like a collective organism is really just one stage because that distinction between human and non-human is also as arbitrary as the distinction between an individual person and humanity and I mean when I really get when I really get shooed up. I think about the fact that you know time moves both backwards and forwards and the very fact that we're all here that there is a thing that we're experiencing means that somewhere someplace at some time in some part of the universe.


Some collective con contact um happened so what's happening with aaron rodgers. I've stopped caring about football for a long time. I really just was rooting for aaron rodgers to get another super bowl because I think he's really good quarterback. It's really funny. I I actually used to be as a high schooler. I was super super super super into football. Uh it was an unhealthy thing you know. I was. I was a loser. I was. I was relatively friendless but I lived in wisconsin and uh football was a was a ritual of of catharsis that I could engage in uh. I when I was a kid. I saw the super bowl where the I saw the packers win a super bowl and that was I thought oh my god. I'll never get happier than this. But then the next year uh well when they went back to play the broncos. I watched that super bowl. I watched the super bowl. They won uh against the patriots in a uh. Uh. I saw that in a basement with the friends I did have had a great time. I was very excited. Uh thought it was amazing next year. I was in a hospital bed uh with my folks watching it on a tv because I had to have surgery on my spine the next day and I watched them lose and I just couldn't care. It was like it just. I could not invest any kind of emotional energy into it and I think that experience kind of broke me when it came to football later on. I did end up having a weird fixation on the brewers when they were good but uh but I could never really get back into the packers and when they won the super bowl against the steelers. It was just like hey cool. I didn't really care that much but I do honestly more than anything.

I would like aaron rodgers to get uh what is get his real wish and become jeopardy host. He should just get rid of football. I only watch soccer at the world cup single. The elimination format the nationalism that's the good stuff somebody says you should host jeopardy uh. I mean they won't even they wouldn't even call me to be on. I have I've auditioned for jeopardy three times and I made it to the audition round where like they talk to you and you do the fake game and like you give them your photograph and they give you your phone number and everything three times and I never got a call. I have been pre covered. I was a big bar trivia guy as you can imagine. I would never call it a pub quiz because I'm not pretending to be english nothing lower than an american who uses british slang. Just no thank you somebody's mom is mad at me for some reason. I don't know what I did. I'm sorry sorry mom whoever's mom. It is somebody asked the trip my our bar trivia name. When I lived in milwaukee. We had a team that won dominated every every play every time. We played it at this one bar and we were called the hezballahs.

I thought that was pretty good my opinion on cajuns. How why would I have an opinion on a a rel any an ethnic or or linguistic group. That's like isn't that like 19th century. Like what is your like oh yes they're they're. They're a cleric people. Uh the their tropic blood. Uh they seem like they have a good time. I'll say that with the zydeco music and the and the gumbo seems to be at a good time you get you go down. There you get that you get that good gumbo oh yeah. You go down there.


That's good you get that rule you pull you guys stood that rule going. I will say that new orleans is is yeah one of the only american cities with its own character. I mean it is astounding when you if you live in america and you visit our cities how similar they are. They really do have at this point us template like they really did just start spamming like williamsburg at most mid-sized american cities. New orleans is it's its own thing. I do love that uh that louisiana apparently their like civic code is based on the code napoleon and not common law that rules seattle's I mean seattle's fine. The thing is a lot of american cities have gorgeous surroundings like have they have beautiful natural environments and some of them have interesting architecture but for the most part they're like the stuff in them is is very like. It's from a box and I'd say like at this point. Seattle definitely is like that you know because the tech money tech like tech money is colonizing urban areas because it's the only money there is thank you and of course that money just exists to do things like uh like dominate urban spaces.

It's not actually productive which is the like. I said in the last stream the real. The real sign that you know as as totalizing in the as the system appears something on the horizon. Either horrifying or liberatory or most likely. A combination of both is on the horizon because there is nowhere to put there's nowhere to get profit there's nowhere to get profit in the system which was what marx predicted what happened. But what we don't have is a working class mobilized to take the productive forces created by capitalism and socialize their products.

You know it's a good historic speaking of new orleans though you know what's a good uh alternate history. Idea is after napoleon was uh defeated. He was offered asylum in uh new orleans and he said he decided to say he decided to not do it and I always wondered like what if napoleon comes to the u.s. Like how much of a headache would that have been for the american government and what would he have done but you know he he had his  up yeah uh what if napoleon moves the united states another good one. What if marx moves to the united states because marx and engels wanted to go to texas after the 48 revolution and it's not even like marx decided not to go he needed uh because he was in exile from prussian authorities and they denied his uh submission for a passport. So he couldn't go the hor the thing that I like that seems like it might be cool but like I imagine him getting  hung by the confederates like a bunch of the other uh german uh unionists at the beginning of the war.

The nuances massacre for example is this making a bunch of noise are people having like are people having issues because this is going by the by this the thing nobody. The guy didn't tell me why his mom's mad at me by the way I want to know if you're still in here please tell me why your mother is mad at me. I can't believe andrew yang is gonna be the next mayor of new york. That's so perfect it really. It does show that we've reached just total critical exhaustion with politics and there's a civil war. Shooter wait a minute so like first person like you got a musket and then you gotta reload it. And then you shoot it again like call of duty that seems like the single worst way to do civil war combat in a video game. So you're just like a private or are you like are you organizing at like what at like the the company level or the regimental level. What is it because I think a game a game from like the of a civil war game from the position of like a captain or a kernel of a regiment. I think could be interesting because it seems like that is like the level of size of of unit for that war that would be the most interesting to deal with like if it's too big.

Then you know you might as well be playing uh. Uh you know any other of those big strategy games but too small and it's like what the  because I've I've tried to play those civil war games where you're like clicking on the units and moving them and it feels a little cold. I feel like like like a regimental or company would be a better better unit to bet to fight from but who am I kidding. I'm not going to play any video games. I've never really found a video game style that I've really enjoyed like I uh shooters to me are either uh too chaotic or tedious uh the like. Even the board game click things are it's too much stuff. It's weird. I just it's not. It's like. It's a it's at this point. It is a universal pastime for people but I just have never been able to find one that made me want to keep playing yeah.

I mean twitter is my game. Twitter is the video game. I play although I gotta say. I'm on it much less. I know. I told people to tell me to log off and I i haven't completely but I don't tweet nearly as much as I used to. I don't get the endorphins anymore. I do scroll more than I wish. I did but part of that is just. I do feel this weird frankly. I mean you know it is a professional obligation to sort of swish through the the the currents. Although you know it's also just. It's at this point an ingrained uh an ingrained habit but yeah like I've even lost like the gamification part of twitter. I'm not even really even gamifying it anymore because I'm no longer you know doing the uh the engagement farming that I used to subconsciously. I don't know someone's asking about pre-history. I wish. I knew more. I'm going to start listening to the patrick. Wyman series that he's doing on tides of history about prehistory do.


I think it's possible for biden to be primary. I mean it's possible and that someone could primary him obviously but you mean he could be defeated for the nomination. Obviously. No uh could it be like a productive use of time. I also kind of doubt. I think national politics is done for and I know some people are mad at me for saying that because well you guys cared so much about it.

And it's like yeah. We thought things were one way and then as marlowe pointed out. Uh. They're another way and we've been having to deal with the reality of that and that we all have to deal with that we all have to deal with the world of we understand it not conforming to our understanding and our expectation of it. And I think with a lot of people who who hold on to partisan politics who decide we're gonna that uh we're gonna like stake out the traitors who who let us down this pat. Path or we're going to uh own our our enemies by rooting for the republicans. Instead are people who just can't give up on the idea that there is something meaningful that there is something uh. Uh. There is some agency to engaging in in electoral politics and like retrospectively. I now realize that a lot of what we thought mattered didn't matter but we had to learn we had to learn and I think that is one of the big. Uh unexamined. Blind spots of a lot of radical leftists is that they uh demand that people accept their maximalist positions on the need for revolution on this uh strength of their argument for them. But arguments aren't what make people believe things. Arguments are not what make people believe things. Experience is what makes people believe things and so somebody tells you what are you bothering with electoral politics for you should be picking up a gun well first of all you're not picking up a gun second of all.

I might die why would I want to do that. I could vote instead they have you have to experience it. You have to try and and fail and then reassess the alamo. Nervous flies at dusk indeed the stuff with the pro act and the fact that you got mansion on board and biden supporting it. It's interesting. It's certainly more than obama did with card check in 2008 where he said during the campaign. I'll support it and then they just let it die without really any kind of fun fair in the senate and now they're saying now you got buying supporting pro act. I mean what is the difference there. The difference one of the big differences is that obama had 60 votes in the senate and if he had made uh card check a priority uh. It would have actually been something that might have passed here with a 50 50 senate and uh and the nice diffusion of responsibility between warner and uh kristen cinema and mark kelly. You can have a guy like manchin who is taking heat for things like 15 minimum wage come out in favor of the pro act with no expectation that it will pass like the real problem is that there is no there is no mechanism to compel these people to do anything. So they're only going to pass the pro act if they find it in their interest to and as currently constructed there's no way that I see the democratic party imagining its interest to be the passage of the pro act. Because at this point it is far more captured by business interests than it is by uh organized labor which is of course. You know a shadow of its former self and and yes the pro act could change that. But it does it. It hasn't changed it. Yet. There isn't the influence yet to push it forward.

I have someone asked weirdly if I've eaten alligator. I had alligator at a state fair. The wisconsin state fair. I believe it was. I have been to three state fairs. I believe. I've been to a number of wisconsin state fairs. Obviously the minnesota state fair and a couple years ago. The iowa state fair. They're always delightful uh dionysian rituals and yeah. Sometimes you can get exotic foods and I remember got some fried alligator. I don't even remember what it tasted like state fairs are not free to enter you gotta pay they're very expensive. This is interesting how can we be confident something historically contingent will emerge that we can plug into.

We can't be we can't be confident of anything. We can't be confident of anything that is one thing that I become more and more convinced of as time passes is that confidence which is something that absolutely uh dominated my mind for years and and really uh hindered me in a lot of ways and made me. Uh a frightened and uh and cowardly person is. Uh was this fixation on on feeling confident about something about feeling like something was real before. I took a step uh and I realized now hopefully not you know not too late because I'm still here that that we we have we can only have confidence in in uh. We can't have confidence in anything abstract confidence meaning like setting our course on its. We can only have confidence in things that are concrete in our lives and a lot of us. I know. I often get dominated by by and neurotic fixation on uh like the veracity of of institutions and concepts and and um and persistent states that is irrelevant to it that are irrelevant to us uh and leave us unequipped to deal with the world in front of us because that that lack of that that anxiety about confidence that the anxiety about about the certainty of the persistence of things robs us of our uh of our focus and our and our ability to be present. So I would say there is. I have no confidence that something will emerge that we can latch on to. But I do know I know from my life that uh that such contingency is possible that there is nothing else that I can wait for or rely on and that I have to operate day to day for the assumption that even if this thing won't materialize that I it is my duty to myself and to the world and to the people around me to be ready for it.

And then if it doesn't happen what if it doesn't happen well what have you lost the only thing you've lost is neurosis is raleigh fingers best name for a pitcher that's a good question. Raleigh fingers is a good pitcher's name. The brewers those early 80s brewers had a bunch of good pictures names. Pete. Vukovic was another great pitcher's name goose gossage very good catfish hunter vita blue oh my god that's such a good one mark fidrich satchel page. Not a huge fan of him but dennis eckersley has like a musicality to it. That's really cool lefty grove dizzy dean. So this is the kind of baseball. Uh fan. I was like when I was a little kid. I didn't know how to play baseball. I was very uncoordinated. I was on a soft. I was the second baseman on a softball team that lost every game it played. But I had. I was hugely uh. Well read on uh baseball history and facts and  mordecai. Three finger brown god randy.


Johnson randy. Johnson might be the best he's not. He's not because pedro. Martinez is the greatest pure pitcher of all time in my opinion but randy. Johnson is probably the best doc ellis great name probably the best left-handed pitcher of all time and he's got one of the most like boring ass names ever. Nolan ryan is honestly a great pitcher or a great name. Craig maddox is fine but come on randy. Johnson get out of here brett saberhagen. Oral hirschheiser bert blylevin these are all fantastic uh fernando valenzuela bill spaceman lee bill lee isn't too good but you throw space man in there huh hoyt wilhelm knuckleballer clayton. Kershaw isn't really like that cool of a name by itself. But it is nice because it makes him seem like a civil war. General oil can't boyd that's a good one ferguson. Jenkins yes very good madison bumgardner excellent grover cleveland alexander sandy koufax not bad. Some people are naming non-pitchers and this is annoying to me carlos. Zumbrano pretty good old haas radborn. Another great one just literally naming baseball players here. But I don't know how you don't like.

I guess. It's for nerds baseball's for nerds at the end of the day because it's got the most history. It's got all the names. It's just. You can like swirl it around like a snifter of brandy but yes like as a thing to watch of course. It's boring but that's the whole point is that you can watch it and be thinking about all this other stuff and the context makes it interesting adios great one ben sheets. Ben sheets man the brewers really they never gave him a team worthy of his talent. He was a he should have won at least one sai young but that was before people realized that wins weren't real chief bender. That's a good one daisuke nachuzaka that was a great one pedeo nomo. John smolt sounded like someone taking a dump oh man throwing me back to the to the 2010 brewers that was a hell of a team that was probably the last time I really cared about baseball was uh were those were those brewer teams or that was 2008 joba chamberlain that's another good one artolo. Cologne also good louis tiant yes juan marishall who famously uh went beast mode on a catcher when he was uh batting he. He believed he thought that a catcher threw the ball back like nicked his ear and he just went insane and started hitting the  catcher with a bat wild. It's funny.

The the dh debate has like super hyper partisans on both sides and it's honestly. I can I honestly can see both sides of that because there is something elegant about the idea of a nine person team. Nine guys on the field nine buys bat but then there is something uh also. I mean like the fact that you've got a guy like ohtani with the angels right he couldn't play for the national league and bat as much as he pitches the way that he can with the dh and like a guy a a two-way player like him. There should be a mechanism to allow him to to do his thing and really. The dh is the only thing that allows that to to happen I kind of like the idea of the fact that there's one one league with one and one or the other. I I always thought that was kind of neat. But what's ruined. It is that they broke down the dividing line between the leagues when I was a kid. The  umpires had hats that said al or nl on them and they never played each other.


Now they're all smushed together and eventually you're going to have a total by definition. Everything has to get squished squished together into one thing I mean if I had my way honestly people talk about like what to do with uh with uh you know pace of play and and making it more interesting. I think the way they're going is they're going to shorten the games they're going to shorten the season and they're going to extend the playoffs. They're going to make it like basketball and you know that's inevitable there's no point arguing about it. But if you're going to keep 162 game season. I really do think that with that many games played you should have as little postseason contingency. As possible you have played 162 games you know who the best teams are so have. The two best teams play no no play no playoffs at all.

Like the old pennant days 162 games at the end of it. The best record of the american league and the best record of the national league play a nine game world series that would be my preference. But if they're gonna make it like a  hundred game season or whatever and have half the teams and they're fine whatever but you have to short you have to short the season if you do that because it's absurd why are you playing 162 games. Why are you playing that many games because the whole point of that is to have the numbers like clear out the contingency and the randomness and show you the actual  and then okay now have them play having like three game season three uh game playoff seasons after 162 games to me is absurd because how that you don't know anything out of that. It's it's totally random. At that point yeah. Baseball has too many games for me to follow like basketball. That is why if they're going to expand the playoffs they need to short in the regular season shorten. The season extend the playoffs or leave the season the way it is and get rid of the playoffs.

Those those are the two options as I see them of course. I'm not totally unbiased here because in 2011 the brewers clearly the best team in the national league central by far were defeated by the. The only real abiding emotion I have related to any sport isn't love for any team. It is hatred for the cardinals like at this point. I don't really even care about the brewers although I mean hell if they like really tore into it. I would start caring again but all I really have is hatred for the cardinals so I have a have  earth open up and swallow them. There's a book about a college football call to hate like. This is to be happy forever and I do think that that gets it something very very important. About sports which is that the hatred of the enemy is much more uh deeply felt than the love of of the team that you root for and I think that extends to a lot of other things talk about jesus talking about  shoes. I would love to talk to david roth about baseball but I don't think anybody else knows anything. No nobody else is a baseball fan on the show. Felix just likes fighting sports. I have to say that uh to this day I'm proud of myself that in 2001 when the yankees were in the world series against the the absolutely flavorless. Uh expansion dog  diamondbacks and I was when craig council. Uh won that game. I was out of my chair because  the yankees forever all right gonzalez.

What did council was there though right was council. The run that came in council was on that team right can't remember all. I know is I was happy when it happened all right. He scored the run yeah. Okay yeah. He scored the one for the marlins and the diamondbacks two dog ship expansion teams that shouldn't exist. Now the one sport. I would like to watch but I can't because there's no american version is probably rugby because at this point and football is just except for you know the playoffs and  it just there's it's too it's too glacial. It's amazing how people talk about how baseball's boring and then they watch football. The best baseball movie is major league that's a question with an easy one uh unarguable answer. Major league best baseball movie of all time well. There's a red fire burning on the kaiahoga river rolling into cleveland to the lake that was shot at uh old county stadium. In milwaukee.

The lord can make you tumble the lord can make you turn. The lord can make you overflow but the lord can't make you burn. It's funny uh. I remember reading moneyball and be devouring it and feeling like oh my god. This is amazing but you look back on it now and it's just another brick in the wall of turning everybody uh who watches the game into into management. It turns and and you know that's not just the fault of statistic of sabermetrics and all that but the instinctual side the instinctual uh sports fan uh identification in the inherently um conflictual relationship between players and owners is always owners. It's always going to be owners because you're a fan of the team right has anyone ever told me.


I look like philip seymour hoffman. We did a live show in la uh two years ago. I think it was that I uh it was at a church. It was at a church that was being renovated and to pay for the renovation they had were having uh public. They were having events you know and so they were getting a share. They were getting like a fee for for hosting events. So we did this show in this church and everyone was at pews and apparently people who were there said the sound was absolutely dog. Nobody could hear us but the tickets were cheap um and afterwards the wife of the deacon who had helped us set up stopped me on the stairs as we were leaving the church and said you know you look just like that philip seymour. She was like 55 years old. You look just like that philip seymour hoffman. He was still alive at that point so thank you very much for the he because she thought you meant dead. You looked dead or maybe. He was dead. Well congratulations.

I got owned now. I won't do any heroin. Not. A fan of any opiates never been no thank you psychedelics yes of course crucial part of a balanced diet uh. No no no opiates for me ketamine is a psychedelic. I would say or dissociative whatever you want to call it. It's fine. I would do ayahuasca. I've never huffed gas like philip seymour hoffman in love lies. I know. I mean. I've obviously you know smelled gas when I was pumping it and been like oh that smells nice. I've never done. The isolation tank the john lily thing and I kind of want to one of these days. I'm going to get. I'm going to get the tank. I mean of course. I go on joe rogan obviously. Why would I want to talk to 10 million of the most soft-minded people. On earth. You go in there and you just get to like  carl spackler caddyshack with the plastic explosive of course. I would do that oh the snortable weed all right. I'm gonna go in a second. This is the last thing I'll talk about. I just saw that yesterday the thing about the snorty snortable weed and that is absolutely fascinating to me. So. Presumably this is people who want to feel something edgy about doing doing weed. Now that we weed is uh been domesticated and so the way that they've decided to do that is to pretend wheat is cocaine and to me that is amazing. I don't know what kind of what it would give you yeah. Like are you gonna start like boiling weed over a spoon and then like injecting dabs like at a certain point. You just have to accept okay weed is uh is normie. Now weed is basically budweiser do you like doing.

It then do it if you don't don't maybe. Now you just have to confront that your subcultural relationship to it can't persist. But some people say no no no no no no no confront the the the uh confront what goes into my preferences and like maybe tease out what I really am going for here. No no no no no. I would much much rather uh just pretend and bang out some. Uh some rails of of weed you got to imagine that a lot of like uh moms who got made fun of for saying things like are you. Snorting weed can now vindicate be vindicated and say see you can snort weed if somebody offered it to me. I would try it though of course just to see what the  that what would that do like is it. An instantaneous thing is it like an edible one. I mean presumably like because it's right there. It would like hit your brain very quickly. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not buying any though that's for sure yeah weed suppositories. That's next stuff it up your ass you gotta figure that the time release effect of that would be very good okay.

So see you guys next week and then I think the next week the week after next week. I'll try to do once again. I don't know what the assignment will be because I haven't really looked at the book yet. I'll put it on twitter probably week after next week. We'll I'll start talking about the beginning of uh. Kobe's book the weimar republic and we'll figure out hey what the hell is going on with. Uh those guys you have this huge robust self-uh organized labor movement and you've got. Uh. This crisis here at the end of world war. One wha wha wha what happened and we'll find out or we'll at least try to figure it out. At least what we'll try to do is tell a story that can be useful because that's all we can ever really do. We're not going to. Know anything we can never know anything. We can tell stories to ourselves that have use all right bye.
