No no are you dead are you sleeping oh. You're dead. you sleeping are you dead are you sleeping. I sure hope you are dead and now now now coffee. I said. Do you believe what you're saying yeah right. Now. We're not that are you dead you sleeping are you dead or you sleep. Oh you did are you sleeping God. I sure hope you are dead not putting the O in there's the o there. It is got. It. I killed it human animal hybrids folks. We gotta we gotta watch out about human animal hybrids for the kids out there.

There's two things that there's three things that George Bush like to talk about during um his State of the Union addresses and it's very funny because he would bring these things up that seemed like hugely important like potentially game changing Visionary plans or fears and then they would just be forgotten. He never even pursued them. It was all the war in Iraq and then Social Security privatization. A tax cut Warren Iraq Social Security privatization and immigration reform and he got the first two and then the second two he ate. On. But he would go in front of Congress and the American people and talk about human animal hybrids. We have to guard against the danger of potentially making human animal hybrids. I don't know if you guys are up on any of the latest human animal hybrid Trends but that one really hasn't materialized. He also like to talk about hydrogen cars which we just not even close we.

We eventually settled on incredibly expensive luxury coated lithium-powered electronic vehicle of vehicles with insufficient battery infrastructure and now an insane subsidy system where now all they're getting a the auto companies are stopped. They're stopping producing relatively efficient electric cars to make electric SUVs. That's where we ended up on solving that problem well done. I don't know I guess the hydrogen problem is. It blows up right so maybe. That's why we never got the hydrogen cars. But there was a while there during the bush years when everyone thought hydrogen cars were going to happen did that hit a technological barrier or did it literally just threaten to destroy the Petro dollar because that's the answer. Then we know why it didn't happen and the other thing you talked about that we've now got in a privatized form. Mars colonies.

Now we just have Carnival Parkers and frauds like musk who have no ability or intention of doing it using it as a utopian Horizon. Oh right yeah. They get to make more another thing the reason they're embracing EVS is because they can use a non-union Workforce to build them because they're not covered by the The UAW contract human animal hybrid. Yeah Newt Gingrich was talking about Moon colonies in 2012 and that is kind of the cute thing about Newt Gingrich and there is like no one is entirely evil and certainly nobody imagines that the world that they're trying to make is a bad one and they might be you know motivated by some basic evil alignment that they probably aren't even aware of. But they don't know that so like the Nazis had a vision of the future it was sort of a combination of you know like Tech utopianism and then like feudal um Noble the return of like a feudal Noble class so like nerds can stay in the city and build rocket ships and then the the Chads the jocks. The Warriors could go out and subdue the slobs on the on the steps because that is the question of any utopian society that is abolished like conflict either between states or between classes within a state. What do you do with your Elite Class. How do they keep themselves busy because they like different things. There's a fundamental nerds versus jocks divide within our Elite that is like cognitive and social and it's not. These are the smartest and best of anything. They are the ones who represent these values. Like at one point you know the the The Jock nerd alliances that took over societies were made up of the smartest and the best athletes.

 the kenokian Society in the Mississippi Valley. We talked about this when we were reading dawn of everything they had this like tributary state in the Mississippi Delta that had like huge temple building. Temple complexes residences for Elites extractive agriculture all the stuff that you see in the early metal Americans or the early Mesoamerican cities and early Middle Eastern. cities and China too and it collapsed after a couple hundred years and was never rebuilt and that really is the distinction between North America and the rest of the World. By the time of contact between Europe and the Americas is that that tributary Society collapsed and wasn't rebuilt as opposed to in Eurasia where every tributary collapse was followed by the creation of a new tributary state. But anyway this cahokian Society was it is speculated.

I don't think we know but it's a very good story anyway that the the basis of this whole situation. This extractive economy which took people who had lived you know in bands and were able to live and sustain themselves at band level and like kin level and then would come together cyclically for Exchange in a fixed position and while they did that they would do rituals of real affirmation of bonds between each other's. You know. Like this is how you get the situation where there are Clans that extend throughout huge Geographic areas and go between tribes. It's so that you can travel and always have some sort of local connection and those local connections are forged. During these ritual meetings and sports is part of it. Specifically this game called Chucky which is involved taking javelins basically and trying to spear them through the Ring of the hole. In a spinning like Stone wheel like you're trying to throw a javelin through this hole. and the cocain Society gets fixed there and becomes extractive due to the accumulation of debts revolving around gambling on Chucky games all right and who are the who's benefiting from that early Arrangement. The best athletes the best Chucky players and the people who bet on it correctly who engaged with the game structure most advantageously and of course.

Like this is what right Wingers reactionaries think they're hearkening for this is sort of like Purity but what they don't realize is once you get to capitalism. The line between like actual like what a person does with their time related to you know the system that they are part of has become so drastically abstracted like our literal specific labor contributes to our economic engines. to a much much much smaller degree than the elites of previous iterations of class rule did and that means that at the top is just like the children of the children of the children of the children which means that they have had any connection to the virtues that had been crafted through that struggle to take and hold power have been completely removed and abstracted and turned into automatic processes. So we're literally we're just genetically selecting the worst Elite possible which is why any attempt to codify the current Elite structure through appeals to Social Darwinism and the need to you know make sure that we have the most eugenically perfect people to see the future to to to travel through space and all this.

No you have the most genetically perfect people to sit in front of a computer. That's it. That's what you've selected for you've selected for passivity. You've you've selected for an arid abstraction that cannot effectively engage with the world except through all these layers of technology and they'll say oh yes but we'll always have the technology but at a certain point. The technology strips you of any human involvement at all any human space that you have not been instrumentalized so that's what they're. They think they're going to preserve. You know this Legacy of Virtues one in battle and toil and and like through you know the will to power but they're actually enthroning a bunch of Wi-Fi enabled immersion blenders they're going to become. Wi-Fi connected that grown human husks all the while having a pathetic internet culture telling each other that they're oh.

We're actually the based inheritors of human civilization even though they're actually sitting in the living tomb of of like the human spirit. So that's why that you know if you are self-consciously identifying with with class hierarchy as the inevitable and fundamental structure of human relations. If you think that that is is fixed and unchanging. Then you are an enemy of humanity because what you're really defending is the algorithm you think you're defending Humanity but you're really just defending the accruisance of a civilization that is always dominated by a a corrupt decadent and unjustly enthroned. Elite no matter how what meritocratic dance you play or or how you're the Hoops you go through. You reassert a unworthy cast benefiting from the labor of people who through the struggle of their lives are accumulating actual meaningful abilities. actual effective ways to stop the total Destruction of the biome and reverse it even that's only being made outside of power structures because power is synonymous with ease with comfort with this. This connection from oneself one surroundings everybody else in one's life so the closest thing these people have to a fashion of an idea of a human.

Utopia is the Jetsons. It's It's it's the Epcot Center moon base where where Tommy and Frankie are sitting around and playing parchesi in a in a bubble on the moon and they've got little laser beanies or something. That's it technical technology enshrining what the the pleasures of a 20th century American beneficiary of Imperial domination Suburban comfort and total isolation but there is something cute about it and childish and like and and relatable and you can see how someone could imagine with that in their head getting there being a politically virtuous path and yeah stuff. Like the moon. He wrote a book about like the future of like what he wrote a futurist Manifesto about like what the near future America would look like. This was in the 90s right when he was big when he was like this guy might be president someday and he talked about how like oh there'll be a diagnostic chair in your house and you instead of going to the doctor you just sit in it and a bunch of sensors tell you how you're doing and you know essentially a Wall-E. He just described different ways that like the furniture in your home would bring things to you and we are trying to construct that but in the janky busted infrastructure deficient way that we can in a like a stripped down state and a pirated privatized order where the you know. The vision of these people have is the vision of NASA in the 50s. In the 60s it's the vision of the Keynesian military.

 Fortis state that we have been strip mining for the past 40 years for parts so that means instead of press a button and you get a food materializing out of a hole in the wall. You press a button and an immigrant on a motorcycle drives down to a restaurant and brings it over to your house because you press the button that is what we got instead of that and we get Elon Musk selling fake tickets to Mars as the Martian colonies that these guys have fantasized about but you can see sketched out the vision of the whole thing and our phones our cell phones. That's what we got instead of the like digital interface that was going to revolutionize our subjectivity that we imagined in the future and all of those things. They represent the same consumer experience as the vision promised but involve instead of a fully automated technological process that involves no human labor. It's animated by vast vast levels of hyper exploitation of human labor and that's always what's embedded in the fantasy of automated capitalism. The only way you get to that fantasy. This is the great irony the only way you get to The Jetsons fantasy.

Although it would not be that isolated it would not reproduce that like Suburban psychotic loneliness because it wouldn't have it wouldn't win if it did. You know like a communism that could take control of the means of production is going to build a social imaginary that is not going to want to reinforce those patterns of of atomization but that that level of comfort and ease and that and that lack of friction between people and between and people in their environment that technology is promising us the only way you get that is through humans taking power over the the technological supply chain and there is no point and these guys will admit it. There's no point in this progression where we take power we only hand over the reins to the AIS which is really just them confessing without saying so that they've already surrendered to the AI in the form of the algorithmic imperative to extract profit maximally at every point in every moment. Now that people say what's neoliberalism what's like capitalism and you can say it's.

It's that moment. It's when all other prerogatives have been overwritten everywhere and of course the rejoiner to that as always. That's always been how capitalism is what's different and the difference is not the imperative at the heart of the system. That's always there. What is different is the lack of points of resistance. Within. These greater systems that capitalism is embedded in our economic our political our cultural institutions that are filled with human beings and human beings who have to form they have to connect the circuit. They have to be there to connect the circuit metabolically and cognitively. They have to do the actions and make the decisions of computers to this point can't because they do not have anything other than this single prerogative powering them and we push back through our institutions to some degree or another and during the the fordist compromise years after the war.

These imperative to extract profit at every point was not extinguished. It was merely controlled and reduced and pushed back against by robust institutions of governance and regulation like the federal government like post Wagner labor movement. Those things dissolved away and so that those resistance points are now gone so that means that the the imperative that was always there is now the only thing it is now. The only thing that people at positions of power have to reckon with when they're thinking about what to do. They don't have to triangulate between that and other demands by other constituencies because those constituencies have been de-politicized demobilized and replaced by Price signals in a market and if that's the only thing you're getting. Then the only imperative that will be followed by any person is going to be maximizing profit which means we have already been taken over. We have all the The Singularity already happens. Skynet already became aware you can argue about when it's sometimes after the oil shot you.

Gotta say the oil shock of 1973 is where you the pistol goes off. We're gonna argue all day about what causes the the specific shape of the oil crisis and why oil is the thing that sets it off. But that is what sets it off like the tremors are already occurring earlier than that and you see with Nixon doing wage and price controls this attempt to bottle up this problem of trying to equalize capitalism away from the United States. Now that you have created an actual networked global system which means you've got to start doing things like creating consumer economies in former formerly dominated places unless in because if you don't do that over production at the center will tip the whole thing over but how do you do how do you manage that when you have constituencies in the United States that have grown used to gaining some percentage of profits and and laying claim to the accompanying political power that comes from those profits they had to be dealt with and what made that go from a A simmering crisis to a permanent condition of decline was the oil crisis so you can argue at what point from then do you have a system where oh the final resistance has been defeated. Here there will be no internal challenge to the full final domination of humanity by capital. The fall of the Soviet Union. I think is probably the the top candidate in my opinion because that Rose does remove the last State entity that provides any resistance to capitalist imperatives at the level of national International relationships Affairs and as a result trade because you have the non-aligned world as as this zone of contention and that disciplines. All actors down through the chains of the United States governing institutions political and economic gone and once that happens we're there we're in we're in there. But that's should not be as I often say that should not be dispiriting it should be liberating because it means you don't have to depend on these things fixing themselves you can depend on yourself responding to changing conditions under these. This permanent crisis like you have the power and nobody else is really going to be able to resist. What comes they can only adapt. We're all going to have a chance to do that and that's scary.

But every you know every moment in human history is scary like we talk about how oh this is the first generation to feel like there's no future in the depths of the Cold War. The the the cultural shadow of the bomb is kind of hard to overestimate I mean they were teaching kids how to get underneath desks like and this is at the height of American Prosperity where there was a vision of a future that people believed in you know the Space Needle is is a monument to it But there was this Cloud around it that like we're going to kill ourselves before we get there all right. But a really good candidate for a year that this happens that Skynet becomes self-aware is 1991. Which is when the Soviet Union Falls and also when Operation Desert Storm occurs holy crap I just checked to make sure and confirm this. But 1991 also as I suspected the release date of the film Terminator 2 Judgment Day film director because that's the only place you can exercise that will to power that Napoleon held it has been bred out of us to want those things. But yes he saw it Skynet self-aware 1991.

To do because once you get this the Desert Storm post Desert Storm New World Order in place and then hand it over to the Bill Bill Clinton to give it the gloss of liberal virtue to say don't worry guys. This is not the old reaganite blood death war machine. This is a new system that seeks to impose democratic values on the world actually. We're doing the good stuff We're doing good sort of interventions now don't worry about it. We're gonna beat up those pesky serbs. Hey you guys don't think that you need NATO now that the war's over you don't think that you need a defense pack. You don't think you need a reason to um. You don't think you need to rely on American military power. You think you can just stop There's these serbs we gotta blow out because they're being mean to everybody. Turkey is doing the same thing to the Kurds at the same moment but just not even an agenda. I don't know of course. Rwanda gets looked back looked on because the US doesn't have that kind of strategic interest there but what are their strategic interests.

There's a fake moral quandary and a fake responsibility to protect and then we get this new bipartisan death. Machine and the beauty part is is that you can when you're in power. You can imagine that you're doing the good sort of Warfare not the bad sword and this of course goes for Republicans too like they don't like that kind of fruity Democrat militarism. They don't care about that kind of stuff. They want to kick ass and so they have their own fantasies of of military domination and of course. The Iraq War allowed both sides because they had to like the left was destroyed. This was the only politics left the only way to respond to something like the spectacular nature of 911 is going to be some Mass sacrifice somewhere else who's going to pay for this both sides want someone to pay for this and Iraq is a perfect way for both sides to be happy. You can be like. We're saving the Iraqis from a dictator or you can say we're bombing their ass and taking their gas. It didn't matter and now part of our real cultural fragmentation and the reason that we have this political crisis in our Center is that now we can't agree on where to have our Collective venting War. The the libs wanted in Ukraine which stands for Russia which stands for all bad governance everywhere Russia stands for Trump stands for dictatorships stands for all that is unclean and unvirtuous in politics for the liberals so perfect and and you don't have to even send U.S soldiers there for icky caskets getting brought back. Nobody wants that but for the Republicans that's no good they like Russia Russia's cool and they they cannot imagine fighting Russians as a way to vent their anxieties and frustrations.

Now Mexico now you're talking. We've talked about this last week. So now that's why the new Republican vision of Empire is redirecting in our powers where they need to be put which is into protect to defending the border and going across the border and trying to and going to war with the cartels that we armed and and it'll be the exact same thing as when we go blow up Saddam Hussein. After we gave him chemical weapons and support. During the Iran Iraq War we went into Panama after we used them as a cutout for drug dealing and and funding. The contras we have been piping billions of dollars of weapons there to serve the political purpose of neutralizing a challenge to the corrupt. vassal state that we run down there and that's why amlo is such a fascinating figure because he does he is trying to secure a like a a a a a a a popular poll. Not a fully transactional poll but like a popular nationalistic and idealistic challenge to the cartel state that they got there so perfect time to go in there if his if his power stays as is is difficult to unlatch as it appears if he keeps making noises about privatizing like or like further privatizing their natural their natural gas and oil industry or their their infrastructure. Then you're going to have bipartisan.

Elite interest in seeing it carried out and then one one side can Hoot and Holler and and Patch the chips while they're watching Fox News. Footage of you know cartel guys getting blown up in drone strikes with all of these standing in for the final dream of apocalyptic Annihilation at the hands of a conflict with China all right so this. Brings us back to the Iraq War as I said the first Iraq war which in 1991 the year that we made contact the year that the algorithm became self-aware the year that the antibodies in the human system against a full takeover of this viral. This viral imperative that was part of a matrix of social realities powering the capitalist state. After 1991 it becomes the only thing it dominates everything and it Hollows out the body from the inside and we're we've we're in there.

But the reason I say that's not a bummer is because a corpse will grow flowers. You know like it's. It's we we we have to get out of the idea that that like that the Western teleology is real rather than kind of just a mental organizing principle like Cycles are the dominant reality of life cycles of death and rebirth and renewal that is the dialectical process churning through matter and energy. But in my view it is a circle that is directionally upward a funnel if you will and if you see drawings of like the dialectical historical process. It's not a line up. It is a circle. This is a corkscrew up and we're somewhere aligned along in this Corkscrew formation.

But okay we will never know specifically where and that's fine but 1991 is when we got. We got terminal. We became terminal and we celebrated it with blowing up a bunch of Iraqi infrastructure and then turning it into trading cards yeah. The Iraq war did not take place well tell that to the good people at Desert Storm Pro Set sir because to them it very much happened so let's start. Here. We've got a military asset in the Armory armor and artillery category.

It is the M60 main battle tank look at this bad. Boy I gotta say I really like that this the shape of this guy. I like that big old cannon coming out of the front. It's pretty badass. Like the M60. I don't really like the Abrams as much so the Mainstay of American armor. Since the mid 60s the M60 replaced the slower and smaller and the 48. armed with the larger 105 millimeter gun for more Firepower yeah. That's right. The M60 had substantially improved armor protection. Yet its Road speed and range were comparable to the lighter tank. An important part of Operation Desert Storm. The M60 MBT performed well in the ground war and as I said last week there were some tank battles as Walter subject had predicted. He did see some tank battles you know but a bunch of figaters trying to find reverse on the Soviet tank. It's just not the same and then here are the specs manufacturer Detroit Arsenal tank General Dynamics Armament 105 millimeter gun 1.17. six 7.62 millimeter machine gun 112.7 millimeter machine gun for anti-aircraft defense speed 30 miles per hour range. 298 miles crew 4. So I'm assuming the Abrams is bigger than that one. This guy's like a little zooping around zipping around zapping around all right. Here we go next one and it's the military skill of health and hygiene wash your.

Ass folks wash your ass you better be washing your ass. If you can't see this. It's got a canteen. It's got a towel. It's got a. It's got a generic stick of deodorant and a a silver bucket. I gotta say if I was a kid and I got this one I would be bummed. I don't think anybody is trading for this one at the lunch table soldiers in the field learn quickly that staying staying. Clean keeps them in fighting shape a clean pair of socks every day and Proper bathing. Wards off athlete's foot trench foot and other painful conditions under clothing loses its insulating qualities after use and must be changed. Combat so combat soldiers often use their helmets as a basin to sponge bathe and have orders to brush their teeth at least once a day. That is a standing order in the Army is wash your. Goddamn teeth cleanliness and health add up to top military to top performance every day so that yeah they had to tell the kids wash your ass which reminds me that apparently there's been just a complete collapse in hygiene and basic human functionality of military recruits. Now like they have to put signs out like at the cafeterias.

They have to put out signs with colors on them to tell the kids how much of it they're supposed to eat so like they don't just eat 500 chicken fingers so like chicken fingers is is red just have a few chicken fingers and then you know like a carb or a or vegetables. It's like that's green go for it. So you probably do have to remind them to watch. They asked so yeah can you imagine like yeah. You you you join the Army and then there's the cafeteria and you just eat 50. Chicken fingers you're just like oh. This is wonderful. Here we go Personnel U.S marine Warrior oh baby U.S marine. Warrior. This is a shitty photo. This is one of the worst photos yeah. It's like. It's a it's a it's very. It's from a distance. It's blurry. You can't see his face. He's like going over what appears to be a wall. There's a flame in the front. It's supposed to be an action shot.

It's absolutely incoherent. It stinks this is a terrible card thumbs down just from a design perspective U.S Marines train to be infantry. First. They are taught that they will face nine common elements in combat violent sights and sounds oh boy so wait a minute so they get trigger warnings. In the Marine. You go to Wake Island and Gunnery Sergeant Hartman has given you a trigger warning listen. Here maggots you will experience violent science and sounds casualties confusion and lack of information feeling of isolation communication breakdowns discomfort and fatigue fear and stress continuous operations and homesickness imposter syndrome I made up imposter syndrome. Five characteristics enable Marines to overcome fear morale discipline Esprit Decor proficiency and motivation so wait a minute so one of the things that motivates overcoming fear is motivation okay. The proficiency I can understand and who doesn't love Esprit de corps which just means hanging with your boys all right.

Here we go we got government interesting Iraqi system. I don't know this is a little problematic. It's just a guy on a camel in darkness again. These things are very There's very. There's a few I kind of realize that they'd probably do this to avoid having to license anyone's image so like there's no pictures of people in in Focus really in any of this. There's a few but it's it's very rare that's probably it's probably a way to save money spokes smokes person Joe Campbell Iraqi system. The Iraqi government is a republic broadly speaking since the chief of state is not a monarch. Since the coup d'etat. In July 1968 Iraq has been governed by decrees of the Arab bath Socialist Party through the Council of command. The president Saddam Hussein leads the council and the Council of ministers I guess yeah like they didn't want to put Saddam on the card what they thought the kids would think he was cool. This is very different from the second Iraq war where they were selling. Those. Book about those two different card sets that you could buy about those two Wars and like this representing you know like mid-century all geez Americana like oh gee whiz you know like a modernist popular culture because you know baseball cards put them in the spoke to your bicycle riding down to the phosphate shop and on your news on your on your um paper route but then by 2003 the the 90s happened the end of History. The the Gen X or the rise of Gen X and now you're putting war criminals on a deck of trading playing cards like it's fully ironized. Here we go oh my God geography Netherlands. They're talking about the Dutch now the Dutch.

There it is the Netherlands the low countries or at least some of them I mean we've said this before. But the most successful criminal Enterprise in history is the Dutch Republic. Those raped the entire world started a process that would see the desperation of all human value and it's turned into abstract dead trinkets to be traded by a dwindling band of a European sex pests and now they have a nice incredibly walkable series of of medieval cities and then Charming bistros and legal weed and swamp Germans man Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands utilizing much land reclaimed from the Sea by drainage drainage lies in Northeast Western Europe on the North Sea formed by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Netherlands became a charter member of the United Nations in 1945.

For Operation Desert Storm the Netherlands contributed air and Naval units well I hope Naval units and you know they're famously a seafaring people. It was um more than almost anything. It was the development of Naval technology and specifically advances in um fishing boat design that drove the Innovative engine of Dutch like economic power like what allowed them to create this incredibly Rich trade economy was that they had this industrial proto-industrial process for fishing and then processing fish for Market because there's a big problem when you're fishing con whatnot you gotta get it very quickly to a processing facility or it goes bad which limits how much you can actually get in your boat before you have to return to Harbor. The Dutch created these Giant floating fish processing plants that allowed for the capture fish and their immediate processing which meant you could stack them up and stay out longer and so you're getting you're getting wage laborers wage laboring fishermen coming in here. Instead of you know people who own their own boats and the attendant economic activity of that. You have this huge amount of fish which is in huge demand. It's like it is the is the most portable fungible protein Source in Europe.

So it's a huge demand everywhere and you're the you are the final point so they were able to just stockpile capital in a huge way which allowed them to then turn it into. Eventually the stock certificates of the East and West Indian company okay. This is interesting where the Dutch the least horrific of the global Empires. This is one of those deals where you can say like just by numbers yeah because the Dutch never really held any that much territory for that long and they didn't have they they other than South Africa. They didn't really have any like settler colonies well and I'm sorry and New Amsterdam. But they lost that one well that's the thing they lost it very early so they couldn't really develop this stuff. But I mean when you're the first or one of the first you know like it was the Portuguese too. One of the very first powers to like embed these structures you know like create this wind up this hurdy Gertie that pulls humans out of West Africa and into the Caribbean in exchange for a molasses and going to Europe for species like that's gotta be very high level crime that can't be made up for by the fact that other people ended up you know racking up higher numbers. They were doing it in structures of your design right. Like that's it. They could have South Africa and they had New Amsterdam and a few islands in the Caribbean but like Indonesia that they didn't really try to settle that oh man the swedes Delaware they showed up late when they were at their most ambitious and then it all kind of fell away.

All right. Here we go the Republic. Another geography one the Republic of Niger oh wait a minute did I even read this I didn't read this one did. I all right I didn't read the I didn't read the Netherlands stats which are important geographical area. 15 770 square miles population 14.8 million language Dutch predominant religions Roman Catholicism and Dutch reformed protestantism more the latter than the former. Although at this point Islam more than either of them in terms of like a religion people actually believe in capital Amsterdam government type parliamentary democracy with a constitutional Monarch head of government prime minister Reed libers. Guy's name was rude lubers r-u-u-d-l-u-b-b-e-r-s. These people are a prank on the world. The okay so we got geography another country Nigeria. Here Niger a former French Colony Nigeria gained its independence in 1958. Its geography is strongly influenced by the Sahara arable land constituting three percent supports peanuts.

Cotton and Millet uranium is a principal export. Trading partners include France Nigeria and Japan. In recent years drought and famine have plagued the country. Nigeria is a member of the United Nations and the Coalition forces. So I think Nigeria just like signed a car. Nigerians just signed a card. They were passing a card around at the U.N and they signed it and nobody expected them to send anybody geographical area. 489 206 miles per square miles population 7.9 million languages French hausa Songhai and Arabic predominant religions Islam animism Christianity. Capital government type Republic military regime since 1974. Head of government president not as funny as rude louvers oh boy Nigeria. The Sahel man that that area is 

 they were they were absolutely five star pimps no question masamusa. fat racks around on his way to Mecca The Mirage 2000 warbird used by both the French and the United Arab Emirates Air Forces. The Mirage is a delta wing Interceptor and air superiority fighter but is hampered in anything other than a defense rule by its high fuel consumption and large wing you with your giant Wings sucking up all your energy limited intact. Limited in attack mode. It is however able to carry air to surface. EXO. Shot is it I've never seen. This pronounced I've already I've read it in a bunch of Tom Clancy books. It's EXO Chet Airship or as MP cruise missiles exochet anti-ship missiles. They're always shooting those off in Tom Clancy books. But I don't think I've ever seen it or heard. It said sat exoset exocet okay This is very funny because so this is a French air. This is a French fighter right that they sold to the UAE and the front and the fresher part of the Coalition. But they're still this is like this isn't later when they didn't go along. They went along with us and yet this card is still just owning The Mirage and making fun of it. Like every American piece of equipment is incredibly powerful. Dynamic multi-use kicks ass but the Mirage you know is. It's hampered in anything other than a defensible by its high fuel consumption. In large wing. You know it's limited in attack mode but it's able to carry ship to ship. Extra Airship or asmp cruise missile very condescending so like. We've got another warbird.

The mig-21 fish head fish bed fish bed fish bed that is a hell of a name. Yes. It's the mig-21 fish bed. It's a fish bed folks. What do you want what do you want. It's a fish bed look. The Soviet Union was having a hard time okay. They were having a hard time thinking names. The Iraqi Air Force has more mig-21s than any other aircraft at the beginning of Operation Desert Storm primarily a swept-winged fighter. The mig-21 can be used as a bomber or reconnaissance aircraft but a combat load limits its range. A Mach 2 aircraft at higher altitudes. The mig-21 fish bed slows considerably in a low altitude attack mode also kind of Catty about the migs you. Oh so this is not what the Russians called it. This is what the Americans call it. This is like how the the the Lakota did not call themselves. Sue Sue is like a pejorative name from their their tribal rivals. So we're using the American name. So there you go. I don't know what they called it. But we called it the fish bed and according to them it's not that great all right. Here.

We go military skill women in combat yeah. That's right see here. It is even in the Shell of like the Reagan bush. you know reactionary Empire State. We have the glimmerings of the coming clintonite. Millennial liberal military. You see it coming. Women's military skill is not restricted to men. Women are represented in all branches of the US military although legally banned from combat women served in support roles including resupply and transportation. Their close proximity to the front lines of a modern war put them in the same risk as their male counterparts. It's the same risk they're right there. I mean in work. It's kind of funny because it's like yeah sure you're correct but in the Iraq war that in the first Persian Gulf the Persian Gulf War that means basically no danger at all oh my God the risks here we go Personnel United States Air Force highway to the danger zone.

Foreign. I know that I know that was the Navy I know that was at the Air Force. But it's still a fun song to sing and they should honestly abolish the Air Force. It was stupid that they made it and they should get rid of it. The name's Rickenbacker Mitchell Doolittle Vandenberg Arnold and Lemay are synonymous with the history of the U.S Air Force and props to them for putting Lemay in there yeah. The guy who like massacred half a million Japanese people. He's our guy until September 1947. America's air power was with the Army Navy and Marine Services. Today's U.S Air Force grew out of the U.S Army's early 1900s flying Corps reconnaissance aircraft. The true potential of air Warfare was evident throughout World War II. On January 16th 1991 the strength of America's air power was demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm. That's certainly true. We did show that in certain circumstances you could just ton of bombs and just go home This is a the top see here we go. This is a perfect example of why they don't want to license names you've got. This picture of you know Sunset cockpit and then underneath it where you would think would be you know above. It says top officer Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Merrell a McPeak why wouldn't you just put a picture of Merrill McPeak in here because you don't want to pay for them drop any cash on Merrill McPeak peek and finally this is a hilariously anticlimactic way to end the show.

Today. Oh yes our American Junior helping out sorry for all those times we tried to invade you and take you over no hard feelings will you come help us blow up a Middle Eastern country together oh yeah no problem eh oh wait a minute I'm sorry. I misread this. It's even more about. It's even better than that and it definitely tells me that they must have needed to pad a ton of these cards with content because this isn't Canada. This is the Canadian national anthem. This it's just the anthem of a country that stuck a lot that like tagged along and I guess now I have to sing it by the way I would just like to say that Canada I make fun of them of course America Junior but they have a better Anthem than us and they have a better flag. Also since 1980 the national anthem of Canada has been O Canada. Before then. The official Anthem had been God save the king or queen. Oh Canada was written by yeah 1842 to 1891 in 1880 for a contest held by a French Canadian organization to select a national anthem. The words in French were written later by Sir but did not gain wide acceptance until 1908 when they were translated into English by R S Weir. Interesting Oh. Canada started off as a French song I wonder if that annoys the separatists so they didn't have the lyrics to it which is good because I realized that I don't actually know how it goes after the first line.

I know it's Oh Canada our home and native land true patriot love and all our Sun's command and then there's some other stuff. But I don't know exactly how it sounds like I don't know what the melody is so probably for the best you got enough. You got enough of that song in all of us command and not in all our sons. Command. Okay didn't know that someone says it sounds better in French. I'm sure it does. I mean they've got the best national anthem. The French do the actual French do so it would make sense that the quebecuas would put up a good anthem. The Soviet National Anthem is amazing and I love it but I still I think I might give them La Masai The Edge just barely to me. It goes the Maasai the Soviet National Anthem and then in the international which is good but not as good I gotta listen to the East German National Anthem.

Apparently someone's asking about Sudan I have no idea what's going on over there yeah. You gotta you gotta. This looks like a little Bruin Civil War can't imagine that's going to be less common. In the coming years did Serbia just get mass shootings. So now we know how how fashion gets to the the former Eastern Bloc well. I'm glad that I'm glad that the continued export of American cultural objects is is going unimpeded. Good news and now the serbs are giving up their guns. Now they're gonna get they're gonna get caught lacking the albanians are gonna. Win the cat lacking challenge against Serbia. If they do this somebody's asking about like did the Serbia have it coming that did they deserve to be bombed or whatever to me and this is I mean I know that he's now problematic obviously and he was before for other more banal reasons. But chomsky's the specific point that Chomsky made that has gotten him called a genocide desire both in the 70s and in the 90s was to when asked about like Vietnamese or when asked about the Cambodia would say they're killing a million. They killed a million Communists and predominantly Chinese ethnic like ethnic Chinese communists in Indonesia at the same time just slightly before I'm sorry. No They were killing everybody in East Timor at that point and they are already killed a million largely Chinese Communists in Indonesia and it's like well.

If that's the case. Then the entire premise of the question is reduced to absurdity. Morality doesn't enter in because we know that there is no line. There's no existential line being crossed with the behavior and the point made in the 90s. In the same. Parallel is that I said this earlier in the show. There was a extended air and ground offensive against restive Kurdish provinces in South Eastern Turkey in a Southwestern turkey. in this the exact same time that we were bombing Serbia and using the exact same sort of techniques that the serbs were using so again. If that's the case then what are we really what is the real question here because if they also deserved it and didn't get that treatment the Turks didn't get intervened on. Then we're not talking about a real moral line that anyone with any any in any position of power actually cares about. So what does talking about it serve serves to vindicate a fantasy of a morally guided foreign policy all right on that fun topic. I'll sign off for this week see you guys soon bye-bye.
