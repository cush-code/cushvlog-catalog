Hey guys I'm out here guess what guess what happened. I got it. We're building it baby. We're putting this mofo together not gonna cook it tonight. I don't know if I'm gonna get to do it. This weekend I was trying to. I was thinking Thursday but sadly I think it's gonna rain and if it does I'll probably have to postpone till next week. But next time I have freedom.

I've got my chimney. Somebody told me to get so I got that and I've got got some. Kingsford got some Kings food for cats. Gonna do it up first though we got to put it together. That's the first time so we gotta find. When we do hickeys. We gotta put on these things I like to think that the charcoal is still made by secretive artisans who go out into the forest and chop down trees and burn them into coals secretly plotting to overthrow the kingdom of the two sicilies. Anybody get that reference anybody gets that reference congratulations to you you went. The Dennis Miller tote bag all right guys. Here we go brain like whoa jack I don't know if that's good or not is. He stupid he could also be very smart though right rogue jack or is whoa Jack always dumb because the thing is is that like so there's the brain lit whoa Jack where will Jack's stupid and that's considered earnest right that's that's sort of considered to be him. I always think of the brainy whoa - as sarcastic the brainy watch actors are never earnest. You never earnestly employ the brainy well Jack but you do employ only earnestly the dummy dummy dummy spa brain limo Jack making me think that Jack is inherently dumb.

No this is not gonna take that long it's it's I looked at the direction that's actually pretty straightforward and not just not that complicated I mean look what I just did no. I did the first step already done already. Done look how good I am one of the things that motivated me to actually. I got this thing over the weekend and what really motivated me today to build it. I was kind of like do. I really want to do it. I don't know if I'm gonna have time to grill. Even before next week. It was seeing the discourse today by being a fool that I am and I don't know I mean I kind of have the excuse that it's part of my livelihood hilariously enough but going online and seeing that we're having the same arguments exactly the same arguments that everyone was having before Bernie and then nothing has changed at all. Not even another you could change. You could just repost all your old posts and the same people would reply with the same posts why why would you do that what you can't be because you think it's gonna change anything the fact that you're still doing it proves you know nothing will change so why are you doing it. You'd ask yourself that question. Well. I put these guys in these guys. These directions are very helpful. They tell you how to do it and then how not to do it and that's actually good for people.

Like me. I tend to have bad instincts with putting things together and I end up going like no no. This is right and then now it's a disaster. There we go okay you got to do the whole wall first. All right life does come with an instruction manual. It's true all right. I got the arms got the arms ready please. Don't yell at me just because I don't know how to buy buy grills wherever is a name that I trust okay. Buddy don't go judging my my grill purchases. I'm I people need to remember. I'm a grill novice I've been to many a grill. But I've never been the grill master. I'm elect I'm a late capitalist baby man and as a result I have an Arrested Development. Now I'm trying to correct it by reclaiming my male heritage that's right me and bronze ain't pervert are gonna get a podcast together. Those are that's irony in case anyone was wondering oh shoot did I do it wrong. No I did right and we're gonna know this sucks about the big green egg - that thing seems way too fancy. It does so much stuff well. It's just I don't need to do everything I'm gonna do. It. Yes max weber grill one of my one of my favorite nerd tweets. That did the max weber grill for the slow cooking of hard meats.

I do want to do corn but sadly my grocery store does not have corn alright. Okay. I think this is working. I need corn. This is New York. If the corn desert I know if I were to go home there'd be corn everywhere but sadly here in the city. No they've got. Jicama I would do maybe baked potatoes right potato summit in the foil. Fish would be really nice used to do that when I was a kid fish in the foil with the lemon very good all right next. What do we do after we snap these puppies at all right. Now we got this triangular thing. Here. Here we go do the delicate dance of connecting this I would I would like to try to smoke something. I know that's a little ambitious but I'd like to try rub Mayo before you wrap him up I bet that is good. Then you can do a ello days afterwards oh okay. I got it. I got it this thing. It's gotta go yeah. Not doing this isn't going well. I'm being proved to be a silly boy in my in fairness to me. I am trying to do it and talk. I don't want to leave so much dead air. So I'm not not as focused as I would normally be oh. That's like okay oh. I get it now. I get I did wrong yes. I'm faster. You have a point man stop being a soy boy supposed to go through the thing all right. Now we're cookin all right now all right see little trial and error look.

I'm teasing this out. All right I might cook something. I might cook something. I don't think I have enough time I might I don't know I I have this available to cook right now or some Nathan's Hot Dogs. It's a thing I forgot to take the steak out of the fridge. So I freezer so I can't cook it today. That's the problem all I got is. Holly got us some hot dogs. I don't know if that's enough all right. But what am I gonna do just I'm here by myself right. Now am I gonna eat a bunch of hotdogs and then just we go one man Coney Island hot dog eating contest. I was gonna start with one steak and I was gonna be like banging. Put a steak on the grill eat. It myself like a guy in a p-wave idiot or like a red pill man going his own way I own people with my carnivorous lifestyle. But I miscalculated I forgot to unfollow them. My mistake I have so now I'm stuck. I'm sorry I just can't bring myself to do that.

So I think it'll come it'll happen. There will be great there will be grill streaming besides think of it as sort of like the way that those dang Hollywood studios will draw things out. At the end you know how they had to make to Hunger Games Movies out of one book getting as much grill content as I can out of here I am on that grind you guys saw the tweets you guys saw. All the the political economy of Chapo takes that that displayed our reactionary goal to the world. I gotta say it is pretty funny having people have the exact same arguments that got resolved along the exact same axis when people basically just got bored and stopped talking about it. I mean has anyone do you ever noticed that but that's the only way these things ever end is that people just get bored doesn't that make you think it doesn't they all of the talking isn't really doing anything.

But I gotta say there is. I wouldn't say that we ever encouraged this. But the simple fact is like the charge that were the tempos are grifters or whatever that means never really made sense because it's not like we were saying hey give us money and we're gonna elect somebody to a high office or hey give us money and we're gonna like start a new like some new paradigm for something. It was hey give us money. You can listen to an episode of us talking and that was always the deal and we explicitly said that was the deal and we said from the first episode. Like the thing we were most worried about was giving people the idea that you can do politics through consumption of media and we said don't do that but the thing is we've talked enough about how and I've talked a lot in these streams about how there is no such thing as political action outside of the internet for most people they can't conceive of it.

They don't have anything in their lives that feels even vaguely political and so they're going to make that assumption even if they're not even conscious of it. They can say oh yeah I know it's not real. I know it's I know that this is about politics but it is it is because what else is politics. It's not like there's a lot of practice in your daily daily life that you can look at and say that was a political act. Most people are living their lives. They're trying to keep a food ahead of trying to either find a job if they can't or or you know keep their head above water. They're not really eight and they wouldn't know what to do if they wanted to and even the ones who do want to find themselves alienated from everything and so they seek the only community they can find at the click of a button which is online because in their lives it's too difficult.

The questions are too hard but the fear of rejection and the fear of getting a alienating people is too high and also the return is so low what are you gonna do talk to everybody in your life about politics and then all they all just stop talking to you. The internet is there you're gonna find it and then going there is going to define your own conception of your political identity and so even though we said it's not politics to listen to the show and even though I'm sure most people who who listen to the show agree with that. In principle. I think for all of us that myself included there's an element of self-deception there just because there's no alternative you know and and that is why when like the Bernie campaign Hovind of you is like a real nationwide moment that could potentially have no shifted the understanding the understanding of basic. You know political reality by more and more working-class people.

It was it was worth doing and our our role with our role related to the campaign was because we think this is a good thing. We want to tell people to do it. But it's not politics until they do it. You know there has to be that that alchemy that decision to get off the couch and listening to podcasts can help you determine what that is by exposing you to things like hey. Here's this candidate here's this campaign here's this thing you could do and then you can follow that up that provides the context and that provides you with motivation to get up. But the act itself is the real political act. The attempt to impress your will on the world. It's not being impressed on the world. On the Internet. We collectively impress the world on the internet but our individual contributions are basically non-existent. All of our all of our meaning comes from our actions and so we benefited from that delusion and we suffer from that delusion. So but I I will say and of course if their people don't want to believe this. They won't it was never an intentional. It was never an attempt to mislead. There was never an attempt where we were saying ha. These idiots don't think this is politics. We knew it wasn't politics. We never thought it was. We knew that what we were doing was creating these Frenchness.

A friendship simulator basically for this new group of you know underemployed millennial mostly at the time people who were wildly alienated from the political world because of it's failure to live up to their expectations of it and who went online to find people who share the same view so well. I really don't think that any of those criticisms are right because those people who believe them are at a fundamental level captured by this fantasy in a way that even pointing it out infuriates emblem. They need us to be political because they need podcasts to be political. They need posts to be political. They need that or else their identities it will be undermined. I mean the person who is saying you know why are you. I wish left us posted harder about defending North Korea than they do about defending Chappell Chapas. It's like well okay what if they did why would that make you happy what what about that would make you happy and make the world better for you even just individually because you can't be delusional enough to think it would mean that anything would change that any of those regimes oh look they're able to cooperate against the hegemon more effectively. Thanks to those posts you don't really think that what you think is those posts about chip will make me mad and the post about North Korea make me happy. I would like to see the papac by. It's like to see more happy posts. Please. I would like to see more posts that validate me. That's that's what everyone wants. But that's just what you're looking for you're looking for for identity formation and invalidation.

It's not political. I've got to get a hammer and a screwdriver I'll be right back. I'm back here. We go now I got to put on these little doohickeys to keep the wheel on with the hammer. I'm sorry Bentley garage yeah. The Beltway garage has been closed with that who knows what the future will bring. There we go we now have we have wheels we got some wheels on this bad boy. This guy oh no anyway. This is well looks like now. We're gonna flip it. Over there we go the kettle the kettle itself 22-inch er. The classic here will be feasts and delights of the senses and the saw alright. Next. We put this plate guy having some difficulty with the yeah I get that we asked to check your questionnaire to get people to hand see because I know you can't see me while I'm getting in this. But I'm an honest ly kind of honest honestly kind of happy cuz. They suck what why is it bad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry just trying to grill yeah. There's this hubcap thing I gotta hook it out at the bottom. Here I might have to get a little awkward well. That's the thing is I think they're kind of mad that I'm not grilling today.

But I guess that the spirit moved me and it was a little too and it was didn't have time to get my steaks thawed and also I want to I want to stretch this. Out I might make a nice marinara sauce tonight though might do that kind of been feeling like I went home wha I mean that is a good point actually if I wanted to be up my ass here and let's do it. Let's get up my own ass for a minute. Oh the reason I should show the reason it's good that I'm streaming building the grill before I even think of grilling on the stream is that you can't skip steps some of the key things. That's why you end up on the internet all day. Thinking you're doing politics because you look for a place that will be emotionally route validating without stopping to realize how far you abstracted yourself away from your actual day-to-day life. So you can't just eat the hot dog or the steak until you have built. The grill put it in the dank coals lit up the dang coals heat it up the dang coals. It's all necessary and the act of doing it impregnates it all with more meaning building. A grill makes you appreciate the grill more what is happening to my brain. That's a good question. I've been asking myself that same thing and I don't know people have opinions. That's for sure people got a lot of opinions. I don't really know yet. The jury is out in my opinion. I guess that is my only opinion is that the jury is out.

I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do the pie plate. Later. It's not that important right now. I'm gonna put in the grill and now you got your classic. Now you got your classic setup here your classic American all-american setup. Yeah I want to do corn I would like to do peppers. I've actually found it like those blistered peppers are really good and they'd be really good on a grill definitely that potatoes like I said well. Somebody says don't do beer can chicken. I don't know I don't know I have some other thing is. I have a question snakes in my freezer I got to get through before I think of doing anything else. I got those a bag bad boys cooked. I also have some pork shoulder that like I said my dream would be to to smoke that one. But I know that's work that's more ambitious. I'm gonna need a little more time to be sure that I can pull that one off and then they got to keep things branded very clever. But I also would love to do the beyond sausages because I've been eating more of those Felix is basically kind of guilting me into it because I don't really at. This point even have you can't even have much of a flavor objection because those things are damn good and I think they'd be good in the drill so I'd also like to do some sauce holy SH and those are patties are good too. Oh man lamb kabobs that sounds fantastic oh Jesus. I'm gonna do it. How am I learning in the stakes I think I'll probably do it. The marination man ate that bad boy all right now. I'll go through both probably do this maybe overnight a couple hours. I I mean they're really good. So I don't. I'm not too worried about. I'm not tasting good wob stirs I have done. I did a grilled lobster tail. It was phenomenal that's a really good idea.

I mean honestly the fact that Hank Hill will used was. It was a propane salesman. You could kind of look at it as an interesting case in ideological formation. You know because Upton Sinclair had a famous quote where he said no no man can understand something if his paycheck depends on him not understanding it and so if you're Hank Hill II you know I don't know how he got into the propane game. But if he didn't come at it from love if he came out it out of necessity. Over time he would convince himself that propane was better even though in his heart his his Texas heart he knows that's not he knows that it's all coals. So he's literally like lobotomizing himself to to reduce the cognitive dissonance of alienating his labor on behalf of an inferior meat grilling method. He is that he is a sham. His his unmanned and all of his masculine virtue signaling is just a hollow pathetic attempt to Dannette to reclaim agency over a life that is essentially as a serf in on the properties of mr.

Strickland I mean the main thing is is that it's not. I don't have anywhere near the space back here for a girl for a they're probably just as deadly but at least I'm not hurting other animals just me and I had it coming so. It's fine so you get through you get through certain levels of enlightenment like there's one level of enlightenment where it's like oh my pleasure doesn't have to come at the expense of these animals. Then there's another level where oh I can get something that's similar but it's still killing and then you get to the point where you say it doesn't matter that it's killing me at least. It's not killing them and then you get to the point where you'll realize. I don't actually have to eat this salty thing to enjoy to enjoy my life that I can I can find pleasure in all experiences if I apply myself to them of the right mindset.

[34:21](https://youtu.be/wrvLnnjVh1o?t=34m21s)

All right. So I got this guy on here yeah. There's a little wingnut guy little wingnut. I gotta find my little wingnut now. I don't mean ben shapiro boom drop. The mike mike has been dropped. Now. I'll probably like move through the ranks of the animal kingdom just like Felix has away from bigger will bigger more expressively faced more sympathetic animals like it'll be hard for me to ever really care about chickens the way that the chickens are exploited of course yes but like the Platonic the kind of the idea of a chicken getting killed in general never giving up my oyster. So I'm never giving up my little my little salty darlings did I not get that peace or am. I forget to bring it out screw. I can't do it. I hope I didn't lose it somewhere very h . I hope I didn't lose the screw.

This is not Wilson's once again not rebounding to my benefit as a he-man yes yes I am a Wisconsinite but love oysters but I am a coastal Wisconsin. I remember the call of open ocean is is deeply part of me as my being as anybody who grows up next to the next to either of the great oceans in the world because because Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes are inland oceans in the sense of you stand before them and they have the enormity of the sea you can't see across them. They contain they consume in fact I might read from Moby Dick. On this point. Oh yes I will read from the man himself on the subject of our Third Coast in describing a character known as steelkilt. He refers to him as a lake man and in in this chapter Ishmael is talking to some Spaniards in Peru about the experiences of a ship where there was a mutiny one of the mutineers. The mutineer leaders named steelkilt a lakeman from buffalo and they asked him what those words mean and he says on the eastern shore of our Lake Erie Don. But I crave your courtesy.

Maybe you shall soon hear further about now gentlemen and square sail. Briggs and three-masted ships well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old kalau too far far manila. This Lake man in the landlocked heart of our America had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean for in their inner flowing aggregate those five freshmen. Those grand freshwater seas of ours Erie and Ontario Huron and Superior in Michigan possess an ocean-like expansiveness with many of the ocean's noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They contain round archipelagos of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters due in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations. As the Atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all around their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goat Lake craggy guns of Lac des Mackinac. They are her the fleet thunderings of naval.

Victories and intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their paltry wigwams. Four leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and uninjured forests where the gaunt pine stands like serried lines of kings and gothic genealogies. Those same woods. Harbor wild Africa beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors. They mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland as well as Winnebago villages. They float.

Alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beach canoe they're swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lashed the salted wave. They know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland that they have drowned beautiful of many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus gentlemen though an Inlander steelkilt was wild ocean born and wild ocean nurtured as much as an audacious Mariner as any and for and etho in his infancy. He may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beached to noose at his maternal sea. Though an afterlife he had long followed our austere Atlantic and here can template it. It is was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of Buckhorn handled bowie knives. It was this Nantucket or a man with some good-hearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet be inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slaves right thus treated this steelkilt has long been retained harmless and docile at all events. He had proved so far thus but Radney a doomed and made mad and steelkilt but gentlemen you shall hear Edmund Fitzgerald exactly know the Third Coast I remember I did it. I said I tweeted something about coastal Wisconsin the other day and people freaked out. It's a coast and I honestly do feel like there is something cultural different about living by water and obviously. It's you know. It starts with the fact that people have to go buy water because you need water to live and to get things from one place to another absent an absence mechanical power. But there's something else. There's a feedback loop. I mean what's how it's it's weird like. It's the only part of the non.

[41:40](https://youtu.be/wrvLnnjVh1o?t=41m40s)

It's really the only part of the country other than the coast that routinely voted Democratic. Even though it's it's demographics are pretty much the same as the rest of the seething mass of square state reactionaries. I'll take your word for it on Duluth. I've never been I'm still trying to figure out what happened to those nuts yeah. Jill Jill pair is great. I know it's from Buffalo and the funny thing is. It's the same accent to Rochester Buffalo. Those people have the flat nasal vowels of the Upper Midwest from Michigan across to coastal Wisconsin and then you get in you get past the coast and it turns into the Fargo accent which is real and is associated with the inland Squarehead Scandinavians who make up western Wisconsin and Minnesota and that's the thing I mean. Obviously.

These terms are all arbitrary but the Midwest. Even though I have a pretty strong opinion about what I think the definition of the Midwest is I think a strong argument can be made that there are different different Midwest sand and that state you know straight like Indiana to me is less similar to Wisconsin. Then you know northern New York is like I said and that is why Ohio is such a weird one and honestly. It's why it's the most Midwestern state. Ohio is. The art is D Midwestern state and it is because the northern tier is is that it's on the water. It has even the same even the same settler group. The the Western Reserve in northern Ohio was settled by the same Congregationalist experience from New England who settled Wisconsin and Michigan and then the southern half was settled by butternut southerners from Virginia and Tennessee in Kentucky and that is the Midwest you know because Indiana is much more butternut than that. Ohio is then you got Illinois which is basically entirely butternut except for Chicago but then like Wisconsin is not really butternut at all and that's why I think it was reliably more democratic because these things have residences that echo through history or at least ahead of contributing role. Anyway so Ohio has everything whereas not all the other Midwestern states have almost that perfect balance of the things that shape the Midwest.

The the the first migration like settler migration patterns before you know subsequent cuz obviously. Then you get the Germans you have the Germans and you get the German triangle between st. Louis Cincinnati and Milwaukee. That's the but that's all laid on top of the first generations who set the like cultural firmament that then got built up. The pot. Butternuts are were the name for settlers and recent emigrate and who had moved to the Northwest Territories of Ohio and Illinois and Indiana from Virginia might move because everybody just kept moving kind of straight across once this once. The Northwest Passage Northwest Territory opened up to settlement after the Revolution because we were mostly fighting for the right to keep expanding past the Appalachians which the British said no to because they didn't want to pay for it so everybody. Once they started moving. They moved basically straight west.

So New Englanders settled northern the northern chair for Scott of the Midwest and the Tidewater and and like border south more. There's border southerners did the lower tier of the Midwest because like you got a state like Wisconsin which is almost entirely which is all which is pure New England Congregational. Then you got a state like Michigan and Missouri which is some people consider the Midwest and in some definitions I guess you could say that's arguable but that's all butternut. But what they have in. Common is then that overlaying of German immigration from the mid 1800s and that German immigration by the way is the only reason. Missouri did not join the Confederacy because once the secession started the German citizens of st. Louis essentially which was the only major city of any size in the in the in the in the in the state immediately mobilized militia forces that were able to drive the pro-confederate a political faction out of out of the cities and they then allowed the Union to like march. In those anyway I could talk all day about the Midwest.

The Germans hated the slave power because they saw it as as they saw it as class domination. They saw this rich dominating poor and just because the it was black people today it would be white people. If things were different which as I've discussed on the show at the very high levels of planter's society is what they thought they thought why are you having these dumb Irish immigrants running around your cities and paying them you know pennies to live in tenements and working in factories when you could just keep them keep them in a humane conditions under control and but but like the overlay of race and and and the fact that so many people were directly or indirectly related to slavery as an institution in the south chain made that impossible to see but the Germans showed up and they didn't have any of that they didn't have any investment in slavery. As an institution. They didn't have the ideological the ideological structures that grown up around slavery so they just saw it as exploitation as another element of of workers not just some of them thought of it as workers against against capital. But a lot of them were thinking about. Does Lutheran psychos and Prussia ruling Catholic Rhineland and nobody was happy about that.

But they saw the same they saw the same pattern folk they were. They were foes of princes yes because because and the Irish were the opposite because the Irish were generally poorer and had a harder time assimilating into the United States which means that they were lower on the labor pool lower lower lower on the labor and social totem pole and had more interest in maintaining a racial distinction to keep them on the right side of getting enslaved. Yeah. I'm talking about Carl Schurz little sure said it was kind of got shitty after the war but of course. The king of this is my boy August Willick. Somebody told me that they were writing in August village biography which was a project.

[50:04](https://youtu.be/wrvLnnjVh1o?t=50m04s)

A long time ago I wanted to do but I was stymied by German and frock tour and then I started doing the podcast and I was like I'll just talk about him all the time. That's the way less work. But if he does it I hope I hope it comes out. I would love to read it. It's funny I've tried learning dude. III had a German my entire collegiate life. I just I can't I mean maybe now would be different. Maybe I would take a different approach trip. I think my elasticity is in my brain where there just got some bad wiring in. Some places are another related to symbolic orders and like abstraction and stuff because you could do very good abstract reasoning but not along not if it's outside of the the terms of English language. If it's not English language. My understanding of what the symbols mean just kind of goes away I can't hold them in my head long enough to move them around and that's true of math and foreign languages. I really don't know why it is I mean part of it is not as lazy but it also was very very difficult seemed harder for me than others.

I don't know oh man. The Garibaldi and the Civil War thing is fun I mean it's not as real as people like to think it is. It's the deal that's not like Garibaldi was almost Union General. What happened is somebody offered on behalf of the of the America. But not authorized by Lincoln is the thing offered him a general ship and and he said I'll do it if you say that and slavery and then Lincoln said no and honestly. It was probably more of just a way to get out of a thing that he didn't want to do anyway. I mean he had never in the first place. But the thing is is that the war that Garibaldi would have fought is a war that the United States couldn't have authorized in 1861 because it would have been a Revolutionary War and the American and the American position from Lincoln to from Lincoln debt everyone signing up to fight to everyone on the homefront for the most part except for radicals was relatively was not revolutionary all because Garibaldi would have done the things he would have taken the the contraband strategy of you know Fremont and Butler and and turned it into a kind of I mean. He was sort of a pow he would have turned it into an army like a like.

He would have like I talked about with the idea of Toussaint rolling through the underbelly of the deep south out of French Louisiana and just collecting troops as he moved obviously that has logistical problems. But it also has benefits but it would have required making ending slavery the central goal of the war from day one and entrusting arming and in the authorizing the idea of arming and training ex-slaves immediately. It's one of those deals where the conditions the actual material conditions without a lot of it. But it is a cool idea to think about certainly go to imagine a different reconstruction. Felix I don't think is vegan yet but he's pretty close by worry though is that he basically just eats replacement meat instead of meat and like you guys have said that stuff has got a lot of sodium. What working sounds really good. I've always thought that would be fun but it.

I'm I'm very physically disinclined in a way that I think especially I don't want to make too much noise around here too well. I consider my best practical skill. Ooh. That's a toughy. I really I'm pretty good driver I guess I am pretty good driver. Some some disagree. But I know I'm correct I have tried pottery. I think I would have to to go into it into a with a very open mind and I think I could do that now. I've been trying to draw a little more. As the thing cuz I used to draw a lot as a kid before I got horny basically and used to draw Civil War battle scenes big ones like three or four pieces of paper like a cyclorama at Gettysburg I've looked at them as an adult I'm not terrible. I can't draw hands like no one could draw. John toss Paso and Orwell being a prick. Oh yes the hundred years war that is a good one mostly because it's most see. It's very few battles. You know you got your Agincourt and watches and shut. But it's mostly seizures and then just going out and burning down a village just doing gregor clegane in the trident. Chevy Shaye's hey we're gonna do some war. What is that just gonna stab some peasants and burn a bunch of wheat and then you'd have I think one of the most interesting things about the Hundred Years War.

The jacker a where peasants like you keep getting your ass kicked and we keep creating Stamper. That's for these. What are you doing like what is this. What does this whole aristocracy thing doing you guys are supposed to be badasses. You know I like Knightly Knightly Authority. It comes from military prowess like that's that's who got that's who the that's who the second estate is and so they had a huge peasant revolt massacred the out of a bunch of fat. Lords for getting they'll keep forgetting them killed and then they they just got their asses kicked no no respect for Henry the eighth. He was a button masher or I'm sorry. Henry the fifth Henry. The fifth was a button masher he just hit. He's hit Welsh longbowman over and over again like I wouldn't respect him as a it's like he's like the guy who plays a street fighter. It just does a Honda and just does the hand the whole time. I'm talking about me because I am a bad video game player and a button masher so yeah if you're as good at war as I am at video games you get no respect for me.

I love Mothman in fact what I would do something about moth Nana specifically the book the Mothman Prophecies which is so good and weird and it still amazes me the movie that they made out of that piece of amazes me a terrible movie John keel is like an all-time weirdo come on like an Americans like classic and they had Richard Gere play him as just this sleepwalking douche. Just like all the different theories I would like the thing about Mothman is. It's not just Mothman the Mothman stuff was happening at the same time as an insane bunch of weird-ass alien stuff and not just Close Encounters. You know of the second kindly people having long conversations with aliens people going out into space and coming back or at least claiming to have people getting visited by men in black. It's like it's just. It's a prism of all of that jet age of paranoia in a small West Virginia town which then had a giant bridge collapse. Yes I would like to do some more about bossman the alternative dimension theory of aliens that's the only theory that makes sense I doubt that any civilization would get to a level of advancement allowing for actual interstellar travel through space by itself. But it possible to imagine one getting to a point where it could like interpose at its own will direction through the quantum space and then into another area because obviously we're gonna multiverse yes that's infinite it's exploding. It's coming out of everything yeah. There's there's multi it's it's.

It is a Rick and Morty annoyingly is basically right. No time travel just dimensional travel that is what actually would be. But then the thing is that could technically be time. Oh. I'm sorry they have. I'm talking about space travel both of them but either space travel or time travel would be essentially dimensional travel not actually going through time from one timeline to another or space from one place to another. I don't think either one of those are possible through any kind of technological advancement but going through either because if I go through the quantum space and find another parallel dimension that started a little later or a little earlier then you're at a different point in time and if it's similar to my world in almost every other respect. It's for all intents and purposes I'm going back in time but what this means and this is very important is that time travel cannot work like it does in Back to the Future or looper or anything where if you do something to yourself in the future.

After you come back. It does something to you like where the guy's hand gets cut off and then his arc is kid. Version arm gets cut off and his on gets cut off or when they fade out like in Back to the Future. Nope every time you go back you are creating a new reality there. But the one you came from is the same nothing has changed. You cannot change the future by going back in the past not for the people who experienced it only for different people in a different dimension. So there is no so that resolves the whole grandfather paradox thing you create a new world where that person didn't exist. You go. There you're not there and you can hang out. There you go back to where you were so you if you if they ever develop time travel. It can just be really for entertainment purposes. Only you can't change anything. You don't even need. Timecop because it's impossible. It'll it might up other dimensions but the one you're in nothing will have changed the clapping should be beginning. Shortly actually it hasn't happened yet yeah exactly you're not traveling through time you're going to a different dimension that happens on a different time scale but is otherwise the same.

So. It has the same people and this is the same historical development of humanity down to the individual level. I'll hear it a little bit. It's quiet. This is the quietest it's been that I've noticed I think people are sick of it. You know what it is.

I think people are sick of it hear this not clamping anymore sort of the live version of wanting to go to Lake of the Ozarks or Red Lobster or something. It signals that even they are running out of that sense of self-worth that comes from denying denying themselves by staying in all time is simultaneous correct. Yes we're not going to be able to ignore the second wave. But I think we're going to try to be normal through it and that's going to be very weird because I really don't think they're gonna do another shelter-in-place. I don't think they can muster the will for one but people are still not. Gonna go out as much because they're still gonna be afraid of getting it. So that's a weird limbo and I don't know how viable how long you can last how adorable. It is how durable yeah everyone's rollin. I think the antibody test might help if that becomes more widely available and they're ramping up actual testing for this thing itself. So who knows I don't know that might change.

Things is there this name everybody is there some sort of mean making fun making it pretending that I'm a weeb is this happening people keep making weeb references. Here. I don't know and I and I'm like I'm not not one of you but now. I'm actually my guess is that's I bet that honestly I think most of that. The fact that it's it's part of this. Like this. It's wrapped up in a TV show I mean come on man come on man. There. Will Nino demmed convention in July so I'm not going because it does not. Gonna exist because it is not going to be in the interests of the party. The party is the Democratic Party's interests are not served by having a convention because it will look like things are normal and their whole deal is gonna be mister not normal made everything not normal. We have to stay home can't have a convention not to mention the fact that they have an actual split the party a little bit they don't want to exacerbating Trump.

The other hand has to have one because if even the Republicans are staying home that undermines the entire thing that he's been saying for the past four months but at the same time how how much are these ritual people willing to just to risk their lives. Because these people are a little you know they're I think a little less cool a drinky. But I don't know I think maybe that generation is gone maybe they're all who they were all kool-aid all the time and they are all. Gonna just run into the law of death and if they do that I will be there I will I will go to the Charlotte Convention if it happens for sure. No like how do you beat that how do you how do you how do you not go to like the plague convention. How do you not go to the orange rapist game show man the Chito himself presiding over obeying arena filled with carbuncle er jackals all coughing in each other's faces and some sort of weird death. Ritual well outside the economy is in ruins and they're stacking bodies and that is Bosh and not the show on Amazon and I gotta see it eat your heart 1968 suck me I'm probably not gonna die. I think I don't know I mean if I've had it. By then maybe I'll do it if I haven't had a pair. Then maybe I won't but I don't know I'm kind of getting to the point where I kind of think everyone's gonna get it. Oh.

I will definitely be well well well Tinka church to go to that rest assured Biden might refuse to see. That's the thing as a Biden I refuse to debate Trump especially if he's up in the polls. Now that would be very funny for a Democrat to do that because that's the kind of that they finish fetishize and love so would be very hard to justify it in a way that didn't just reveal oh his brain doesn't work and he doesn't want to talk. But if it's in the set necessary they'll figure out a way they always do. They always buckle but the main reason it won't happen whether one of them's gonna say no or there's gonna be. Some third wave that a second wave thing that just knocks the whole thing off the front pages and we just have military rule and one way or another. We're not. We're not lucky enough to have that debate a world where Trump and Biden are the nominees is not a world where you get to watch them debate alright guys.

I'm sorry this is mostly done the only other thing I don't have the only day I haven't done is screw the handle on but that'll take two minutes when I get this bolt. And if I can't I'll go buy one so that's step one. The grill is basically ready. It will be fully prepared fully functional. It'll be a fully armed and operational Death Star in time. Sometime I think next week I do have a chimney thank you for whoever first suggested the chimney I made sure to get one I'm all set I'm gonna start grilling. I'm hoping to do a steak test steak next week. All right talk to you guys bye bye.
