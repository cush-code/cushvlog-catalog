How does it feel to treat me like you do and I'll tell you who you are. I say how does it feel how does it feel to treat me like you do. How does it feel how how does it feel. Is it. How does it feel how how does it feel. I don't really know the words to that song sorry beyond the very very catchy um chorus.

There well. It is a historic day in america where a rubicon that many people thought would never be crossed as a fact officially even though we all knew it was coming. They kind of soften it up and honestly the um. The theory that makes sense to me about who leaked the thing is that it was one of the conservatives for the very purpose of staggering the horror here so instead of it being an announcement yeah we broke through we did this we have severed this connection. We have we've cut this social gordian knot. We've done it and have everyone have to process that like instantaneously they figured that just if their goal is to allow this to be metabolized without an unacceptable amount of blowback. It's in their interest to stagger that reaction so you get two days two little bursts of horror instead of one maybe bigger one now of course not saying that that would have led to anything meaningful happening.

But if you've got the option and if you're there sitting on the if you're sitting at the supreme court you're one of those disgusting federalist society. Goblins who clerk for these people or you're. One of the demons in robes themselves. One of the archons themselves you have the option of letting it all go up in one day or you. You prep the ground a little bit see what's going to happen like oh how much response really emerges oh look. At this. There's basically nothing you know It's it's. It's more way more useful. I mean. I could see maybe a liberal insanely releasing it thinking oh everyone will be so horrified that they'll be scared into backing down and you know. I guess it comes down to do you think that the person who leaks the document like that is more likely to be stupid or evil of course in the broader sense. All these people are evil they're upholding an evil institution.

I'm talking about their their self-conception like do they adhere to a model of virtue that has been propagated now by like The political economic model of you know. Contemporary technological capitalism that we live in. There is a like a model of citizenship. There is a model of political virtues that adhere to liberal principles and I've talked before about how you know. Marxism is part of this tradition like like the the emergence of like liberal concepts of right. Are key to unlocking the um the like class consciousness of the workers. If you don't have those notions of like liberal right you can't organize your alienation politically. It's the language you speak of the alienation and and the liberal subjectivity that you're being forced into by living in a capitalist mode of production is liberal. Now that's not to mean that if you get communism we're all going to stay little liberal subjects forever the process of fighting for it transforms social relations transforms our values destroys bourgeois sentimentality and replaces it with like real solitaristic. Social like consciousness and that's the hardest thing to talk about when you're trying to you know sketch out um. The contours of of ideological difference is that the process of like making socialism is an action. It is not a thought but right now everybody who adheres to socialism is only thinking.

There is no praxis. No meaning like rubber hits the ground you have to make life or death decisions practice. I'm not saying people don't live like life or death decisions every day. I'm saying that they're not doing it as part of a organized structured class based project. The thing that makes effort reinforce that that reinforces your efforts instead of letting them be diffused and absorbed and sublimated and so that's why you have this idiot confusion where people. Some people idiots people who are trying to who have ulterior motives and are just trying to convince themselves that they're making. The right decision look at liberal subjectivity and say oh look the fact that capitalism is liberal means that act the opposite is marxist like the the crudest like blood and soil reactionary. Identity. Categories that uphold capitalism are right because that's the only alternative like the thing that the social conservative of conservativism that they that they adhere to was a fundamental building block of the cultural and political hegemony of capitalism and it still is in certain geographic locations. It's just now that we have this other more advanced capitalism and in its center you have a more literally advanced technologically socially capitalism and so now because capitalism has gone way past its historic. Sell-by date like for a roof and this is why like capitalism is progressive to a point and then it just becomes destructive and we've been in that point for a very long time now but that liberal subjectivity keeps creating like the values that end up being organized around like the broader liberal and socialist critique of modern life and there is an alternative value system and I will say that it is one that looks at the evils of capitalism. The evils of hierarchy that capitalism is created to sustain and makes them good now.

[08:27](https://youtu.be/OJbeTzm2pVQ?t=08m27s)

I'm not saying that the people who believe this stuff are necessarily evil because they're not making a choice. Any more than any of us are to adhere to a set of cultural values. They are largely imprinted upon us and so at the level of supreme court clerks you've got yeah sure they're both evil but one of them thinks themselves to be good in the sense that we understand it speaking through the the understood language of individual autonomy. Individual freedom rights the market property all that stuff that's built on top of like the real machinery of exploitation and that is super structural but which actually forms like the mindset and value system of people within it namely liberals within the system liberals because if you're not a liberal you're not in the system you will get spit out so you've got. At that level you got this evil person who thinks they're good. As you know we understand those terms and then you've got an evil person who knows they're evil and thinks that that is good now. I know that's manichaean. But it's less so when you remember that we're not talking about like the like defining characteristics of human beings like we're not saying people are evil.

We're saying that you have to identify not just the structure of capitalism but also it's supporting superstructures that reinforce it and I'm sorry. All those traditional values are all part of that set of support structures and what they're supporting is. Now this this localized extraction and real estate the remnant the literal remnant of the land-based social order. The capitalism supplanted the last barons we've talked about this before the last true aristocrats as in people who own their wealth not to financial abstractions that flow across the globe in an endless invisible sea and could never really be held. They hold land. They hold what is underneath land. They hold the labor of others. They hold those things and they're still able and yes. They're at the mercy of these global flows and the fact that they are is what drives them insane because they understand that they are fundamentally not free in the way they imagine themselves to be and that's what drives their neurotic pursuit of the death drive through the expression of the annihilatory politics of fascism and again. It's not like the the version of these liberal values that we get from liberal society are bad. They're racially essentialist in their own way. They they are as dedicated in their own way practically in the day-to-day to the maintenance of capitalism. But in them is the seed of the next thing. It's the next form of consciousness that has to emerge if humans are going to put take on the machine if you cannot have solidarity across racial gender lines. If the multiplicity of like humans under liberal freedom cannot be recognized then you can't have sufficient organization to overthrow capitalism. You will be defeated. You will either be absorbed into the thing itself or isolated and annihilated. Those are your options just ask the strasser brothers if you're defending capitalism in crisis like a land-based feudal remnant. Capitalism. Extractive capitalism call it rather than circulatory capitalism which of course again. They're totally connected to one another. But it's a it's a can.

It's like a tumor. It doesn't recognize the body as itself because it's been too traumatized not by economic insecurity economic. What's the word. They always use sarcastically economic anxiety not really not in the real true sense but psychically yes the position of precarity when you're supposed to be at the top of a hierarchy and there's someone above you that is alien to you and that you can't defeat that drives you crazy and that is what our american and worldwide small bourgeois are doing they're going. Insane and the liberals are going insane too because they're trying to adhere to this politics of liberation that only makes everything worse for everyone and so instead of imagining a future an emancipatory future. They imagine a sadistic fantasy of punishment for those they think are responsible only instead of it being the other. It's themselves in the mirror. It's whatever they most hate about themselves and what makes them adherent to that system instead of fighting against it. It's their whiteness. It's their maleness whatever and that gets turned into a totem and anybody who wants to stand behind that banner gets eliminated now of course. What's really happening is that poor people are just being fed to a thresher no matter who's in charge but the order they get put in changes depending on the political machine. These two insane schizoid halves of the bourgeois psyche and people want to say why the hell are the democrats like this and I think and I understand they're terrible. They're awful. It's it's a joke. It's a joke of a party but I think people who want them to be more confrontational.

You know like do things like for example like throw trump in jail. You know tell the supreme court to off or like. They say like why are you adhering to these institutions. Why do you have this because the institutions are what they actually believe in they don't believe in being in charge. In fact they don't want to be in charge because they know the machine is a murder machine and they imagine themselves good remember. These people want an excuse to not be responsible for what the machine is doing so. They adhere to these norms to as is the buffer between them and responsibility. The other side doesn't care about that because they have taken responsibility in fact they want to take responsibility. They want their politics to be a ritual affirmation of the virtue of destroying the weak. So if liberals really were to push the way that people are yelling at them to they know in their minds if they can't say it out loud that if they decide we're not adhering to norms and therefore there's no remaining benefit to keeping us around to keep things smoothly moving because now we can't assure ourselves of our dominion over you. Then it's over then they will just all of them including all of the good ones who convince themselves. They're doing what they have to do the leading spear of the country. The people who actually pull triggers and not I'm talking. I'm not talking about the five percent of funko pops that's all they are and it makes sense because the gun is just the consumer ritual symbol for your lost yeoman liberty that you fetishize you think you're a yeoman even though everything around you shows that you have no self-sufficiency no control over your life but you've got a gun and that means that if they come for the rest of it even though it's all shoot you and they know that if they fight you they'll win so. That's why they're not afraid of it. Going there. The thing. I want to ask everybody who wants the democrats to pursue a maximally confrontational position vis-a-vis norms. I mean it's futile anyway because they're not going to do it and there's nothing you can say to make them. But I'm just saying theoretically. I think those people because it might help them redirect their actions in their lives because my god everything seems so terrible and nobody knows what to do hey maybe you could see what's in front of you more. If you weren't freaking out. Do you have the horses for that. So whatever you're fantasizing about your best case scenario of like resistance. Ask yourself do you have the horses for that as tom wilkinson said in michael clayton. You think you have the horses for that because they will escalate.

I know people say they don't care about norms but they are not just in charge. Now you know like if they really didn't care about like. I don't understand this. The democrats will say that like the coup almost happened like this thing almost occurred my god. We almost had an overthrow why didn't we because they decided not to that was it the center of gravity of like you know capital and its cultural superstructure. The ball of the human feces that gravitate around it. They have no respect for the norms they like them to the degree that they keep you at arm's length and so if there is some breach of norms it will be like okay you told us because the center of gravity of the rights decided. No we're not going to let trump do this even though they could have they really could have one of the big reasons they decided not to is because they trusted that the democrats would keep playing along like people have asked like what if it was trump versus bernie instead of trump versus biden what happens then and it wouldn't be because of trump's brilliant coup. It would have been because of the actions of democrats and so that means you know wait but get the horses man you need to get the horses you got to get the team set up before you even think about trying to escalate and so that means. I would like to hear less people talking in maximalist terms and more people doing their response at a more intimate level. I guess saying stuff that for one way or another if you thought it really mattered you wouldn't make public let's put it that way that is the main thing that makes me discount the valid. The ability of like you know the left is in like leftist people with of a leftist social affect and like adherence inside like.

Do you have what it takes to get something out of a raising of the stakes. I guess. I'd say because hey if you want to go down fighting and cleanse yourself of responsibility. You can. But it's really at that point and isn't it about ego. Then isn't it just the death drive of itself. Is it just the mirror image of the fascist. It's just. It let's be legends. Some people say john brown I don't know you can disagree with me. But I i don't know how you can look at the last 20 years of america american life and say that um spectacular acts of violence can be meaningful. Shapers of like social life like have a sustained impact on like the the balance of powers like the war of position between the sides that you're supposed to be playing the send. I know and the thing is like what is the sight. I don't know the sight.

[22:12](https://youtu.be/OJbeTzm2pVQ?t=22m12s)

That's where I have to cop cop out. I mean. I'd say the workplace see someone says. I say like a defeatist. I don't want to spend my juice spouting off on here. I don't want to spend any anima I have accidentally. I don't want to dump my oregon into fantasies because that's it at the end of the day it robs you. It does it robs you of your essence but I mean take heart here like if you if you do have faith in your fellow citizens like enough of them that if called to the moment would rise to the occasion if you believe that and this is what it boils down to right do you think that there is that group of people or not whereas right now you can't see them because they are not organized they are not disciplined. They are not shaped in any way. They're protein that doesn't mean they're not active that doesn't mean they're not on a path. It means that identifying the specific formation is almost impossible because the level that you dis that you're talking about the national level is a barren wasteland has been rendered so has been irradiated basically by the if you. If if at the local level there are like candidates for city office people who like control budgets like who actually gets to hold guns for example you know that's certainly worth doing but like if if you come to it from the imperial the wasteland. The sauron eye that we're all glancing through to try to talk to ourselves in a legible language because that's the thing we want to communicate with like this hive mind and we can only do that if we're talking about common reference points which are by definition de-territorialized they're pulled from their local context. They're sterilized and turned into just fuel for arguments. I'm gonna put up. I'm gonna put up some signage. I'm gonna put up my my posters don't worry about it or my portraits and like the answer to like what to do is. It's like you know It's like the ghostbusters pke meter where they're like trying to find ghost vibes if you do something and it makes that sense of hopelessness and anxiety that everybody talks about all the time that they're feel trapped by if it makes it go away a little bit.

It might be the right thing to do if it intensifies it but like you find yourself enraptured by the intensity. Then you might have just replaced one fix for another but again that only comes from a personal experience rooted in a time and place that I can't speak to. I know that sucks. But it's all I have and if I try to if. I start trying to reason myself away from that to indulge myself or anybody else. I'm gonna just. I'm gonna lose the sense of of that that I have now like what I'm talking about the feeling. I'm talking about is a feeling. I have right now and you might say oh that's easy for you to see your posting. You know you're doing internet. It's like right but that's also my job. You know that's not very many people's job. Most people have different jobs. The big problem is you got people whose jobs are dependent on this. This pleasure coming at an abstract level that they're going to be incentivized to get others to think that way too. Like this the real trap at the at the center of the entire project of trying to organize a left online which is all we've been doing since bernie and all we have been able to do think of this white blank room as my mind cube. So for me. It comes down to do people like it enough people do people keep wanting to hear me then it beats digging ditches and I have time to do other things that means I gotta be able to take the hit on you are being a you're saying exactly what you need to hear to avoid like really doing something and it's like yeah. That's probably true that's why you shouldn't listen people like us about everything but you know everybody is a cybernetic being and they have to spend time online and so the question is what are they going to spend it on. You know what's maddening is that we can't know because like we're all waiting for some moment of truth and like the good news is those are real. The bad news is It's not like there's one moment of truth. Every moment is a moment of truth. It's just whether it's degree to the degree it. Ends up being retrospectively like a hinge point to your life and that means you can't know you're in the um at the moment of truth um when it happens unless you assume as it's happening that every moment is the moment of truth. So that's what you got to do you got to act. Like every moment is the moment of truth because it's not about what your opinions are on all the topics of the day. It matters. What is what are you valuing when you interact with the world and have to make choices. I know.

This is all cops. I hear it coming out and I'm like this. I can understand absolutely hating this cop out but like you know at a certain you know at a certain level. You have to assume the universe is benevolent. It's the only way for anything else to make sense and yes it is bougie as hell. I I would say technically artisanal but basically yeah certainly not the type of subjectivity. That socialist struggle will build that makes sense because I've never really carried out any socialist struggle. I've never gone out on strike. Like I've interacted with you know volunteer organizations but that at a certain level is is not where the rubber meets the road because of the volunteer aspect. One of the things that shapes movements towards effectiveness is necessity. In fact. It's the thing it's the darwinian accelerator. So it's a grim state of affairs certainly where how do we get here. We might ask ourselves. If we were david byrne. We might ask ourselves how did we get here and our friends panic and gidland. I believe are answering that question in their book. The making of global capitalism look at that look at that. Segway look at me just ease into this material. Ah so we are now at the stage when according to this book according to panden we go from a global capitalist system being knit into like a structure to one that becomes like fully realized the tipping point basically where a alternative models can no longer stand against it. Like during the cold war. You had this real balance of forces and it wasn't just between communism and capitalism. It was also like just like the indigenous bourgeois arising in the recently colonized world. Like that's its own. Like you have class formation happening at like this geometric rate in the former colonial world and it doesn't build just communism. It builds its own bourgeois politics that then work themselves out But they're all contending and it's contending over resources and over over building a technological social machine capable of self defense and this is when fall soviet union happens.

The western left is buck broken. The the insurgent political tides and the rest of the world are just assassinated and cooed and bombed out of existence that leads to the situation where we now have a fully realized global capitalism. Not one force among forces contesting over the space the global space but a dominant fully fully dominated one and so these chapters are telling that story which is a story of breaking the left at home and abroad basically and then reimposing a new deal basically between labor and capitalism that would replace wage demands. Shares of profit or like claims of profit social claims of profit with borrowed money with credit basically. A further immisration right you take the land away from the peasant so that all they can sell is his time in exchange for money and like have that relationship like form a psychic bond like he's alienated but the more money he makes the less alienated. He feels right because he's able to justify why he's working to himself and not hate himself for doing it which is how you feel when you feel dominated. It does legitimately reduce alienation to get that higher percentage of profit that you get to demand socially as part of a union. We're going to replace that money with money that you're going to borrow from basically your bosses which means you have to pay it back which means. It's never really your money so instead of saving for a retirement when the interest that you've made on all those same money that you made and then was able to wisely save and buy a house with thanks to huge government subsidized suburbanization. All of it bought with labor like the sweat of my brow bought this cadillac. Now it's a bank in delaware bought this cadillac and they're letting me use.

It introduces a a new level of hopelessness and an admiseration and conscious alienation a felt sense of compulsion within their relationship to their jobs. So this is just putting a neutron bomb in the heart of like the the social and spiritual health of the working class. This is like a psychic psychic war. This is a psyop as much as anything else and now it's in terminal decline and all the political structures that it needs to sustain itself are coming into critical conflict. Even though they don't really need to. We could accommodate this transition much more smoothly. But we can't because we only have political institutions to carry out that will that's counter to profit and they're like burned over wasteland. It's gonna come like from the purging of fire like. I know that's apocalyptic but that forgets to that forgets the fact that the apocalypse is always happening so imagining an apocalypse in the future is not some fantasy rendition of like an unimagined world. It is just a universalization of particular conditions of the present so if we think of it that way if we think of the apocalypse already having happened right well. There are people who live there it sucks but they're there. There's stuff. There's the refuse. There's the infrastructure that we've built and that means life is going to find a way as ian. Malcolm said that we're all going to be part of it. One way or the other and acting from the heart is the only guide we can have because everything else just leads you to apocalypse. Like when we talk about politics. It ends in apocalypse and that means well and I have to act like that's this day and if you really ask yourself. What does that mean this is my last day does it mean you go suicide bomb. Some love. I think I think that would be most people's number one choice and so I do think that like the the brain virus of of capitalism which has like decapitated us and and fully sky fully skynet at us. It's also dependent on a system that is destroying itself and that people are going to persist beyond the destruction of those systems. The thing is it's not going to all happen at once. It's going to be a process of a combined and uneven apocalypse as it is now and if there's no recovery from an apocalypse okay.

If they're saying well no four degrees. It doesn't matter. Everything's gone well okay. Then so what are you gonna act like kiefer sutherland in melancholia or are you gonna hang around and if you hang around what are you gonna do with your time. That's all that you can do with these questions. These things that haunt us and I know they haunt me.

[38:21](https://youtu.be/OJbeTzm2pVQ?t=38m21s)

It's just to remember that and I still say that as long as there is life of any kind there is consciousness a consciousness that we are eternally connected to you can call it god whatever. But I think you have to believe that in some way to justify doing anything other than hurting other people for your own narrow pleasure. I honestly don't know how you can justify in the current conditions on altruistic politics. Why wouldn't every other thing tell you get off on hurting other people like the end of like solo. Like that is what possalini is talking about in that movie that is the end stage of capitalism in final peroxisms of violence or of collapse. At the very end of collapse. All you have are dominators and dominated and all you have is this displaced horror that the ones one's impending annihilation that a sovereign consciousness that does not admit any connection to anything else cannot reconcile. It just can't so you have to smash into the wall and the way to do that is to seek a life of domination to pleasure to create a politics of domination and pleasure and that is the appeal of fascism. And that's why so much of the left like militant response to the right is ineffective is because it's carried out by people who just want to fight other people. I'm not saying everyone but I'm saying a chunk and that has an effect.

But that's not to blame anybody for what they do. They're doing what they think is best what you have to do you. Not. They have to do is ask yourself what what am I adhering to because if you want to destroy make somebody pay even given the idea that it is all gonna. It's all over and there's no it's turning back from annihilation. If you still think someone has to pay that's the only thing you can care about and then you're going to feel pleasure at others expense. First physical like look at my life look what I have compared to what other people don't look at the pleasures. I get to feel versus the miseries they get to feel.

Eventually that of course goes away because that pesky thin slice of profit starts to burn out of the equation the ability to and hear and hold on to surplus and sit on it and and enjoy a life of leisure not have to productively work not fake work productively work that's known that's not given up willingly and then even at the end where at every point the rational logical long-term best interest to do would be to steer out of this. We're not we're steering into it. That's because capitalism is not a rational system. It is an it is rational on its own satanic terms in that it adheres to what extracts surplus what derives profit from transaction and that is domination of one over another and that is once you have that social relationship intact. It is its own god. It is its own rational structure but it is only incidentally connected to humanity. We are all trying to you know grasp towards some best time what time to do what time to spend on earth. What do we adhere to what do we care about. We're all just trying to do that like well. That's what we're born into and then we're presented with political relations that guide us towards a relationship with each other that makes it impossible to imagine anything other than domination.

The long-term best interest would have been a a glide path down from the consumption mania of the 80 that led that went to the 70s a coordinated reversal of of capital flows from the center to the periphery basically and doing that new deal for the world. Like an actual no deal for the world that the bretton woods people thought they were building and in the conditions the political and economic conditions of the late 40s. They were but then the contest started you know the the the the clock of history kicked in and it was only a matter of time and yeah like natural law human nature. All that stuff the lockheed tradition is a religion. It's a fanta. It's a it's a it's essentially the last remnant of paganism. It says that the relationship of a person to a piece of property is essentially magical all rationality within capitalism dissolves at that initial moment of extraction. It says that by dominating one has proprietary relationship to now that is not an inherent human belief that is not something that we are born with. We are capable of operating outside of that paradigm one where the notion of ownership is not socially reproducible or conceivable.

Those that's what david graber writes about in his book but those guys got steamrolled by the people who had built a machine powered by this reversed satanic logic that would benefit the people at the top. At the expense of those at the bottom. It literally is a pact with satan and it is the dark like black mass of capitalism is in. That is in that transition that that's why it's not about like people need religion is that you can't escape religion belief is embedded. The rationalist worldview is just a is a pagan adherence to to domination as as domination as signal of virtue of worth of dessert. This is this is a this is a metastasis within the human psyche that turns into a brain tumor that is now in the process of completely consuming the patient and that's why you have the schizophrenia of like the wars of religion of the early modern period. These people fighting over protestantism or catholicism all of them trying to live trying to hold on to one system of values in the face of another that is just tearing at the roots because you go first from you know.

There is no property relationship that can that can transcend every social value because that's what it's about says there's no social thing that can transcend property right like the if the global economy does collapse and they're in the economy and capitalism is destroyed at no point. Would that anyone who like really adheres to capitalism call that a failure of capitalism it is a god. It cannot fail. It can only be failed. Everything that's happening has to happen and should be happening according to capitalism and there's bumps along the way and there's criers but the thing is happening. The thing that's happening is profits are being accumulated because everything else all their assumptions about what human virtue is human. Value is what the good life is what effective. Altruism is boils down to wealth to property and the distribution of it which is based on this global system of extraction can't be disembeded from it.

Okay getting back to this dank book. I'm very sorry. I keep I haven't even gotten to it. Yet so this is the moment here when the thing comes into dominance of the planet and it's a crisis that in the u.s leads to so. This is chapter seven renewing imperial capacity. So you have a crisis in the in the american economy. The unpacking of the dollar. The neoliberal turn and one of the things that's pushing that is that this crisis creates a unified business political front that brings together. All the disparate strains of american capitalism that are often at battle at the political level are often like the legislative level policy level. They're often in conflict with one another because they have different short-term interests. But like this crisis necessity all pushes them in the same direction so they can effectively address the moment. Meanwhile the labor movement is totally uncoordinated and cannot deal with the crisis. Because their people are trying to you know strike for better working conditions. They're struggling in their lives and they're trying to make their lives like less miserable. These people are all sitting in country clubs and basting like hams and saunas and eating. Ten thousand dollar endangered ostrich eggs and they get to sit around with their giant vats of money and talk. They don't need to go and sit one among many in a and like what so that you can you know Maybe have a strike and who knows what happens as opposed to get to sit down with politicians and tell them what you want. So. They're able to effectively address the shared interest in making this re shift not towards that soft landing.

I was talking about that would have replaced consumption with greater not not necessarily wages but greater worker control of production and that would have dismantled the consumerist imperative that made exploitation have to be exponentially increased within the system in order to maintain profit. If you get rid of that you can can produce for consumption especially since we have the computing capacity to administer a technological state sufficient to allow us to you know leave a lot of things to machinery that we have programmed that we have reprogrammed the t800 the terp arnold from t2. So there's a unified front that pushes for legislation that pushes to do things like insist that when the new york city needs a bailout because new york is now like one of these european countries. That's seen their balance sheet go in the wrong direction because of inflation because there's nowhere for this alienation to go it's being dissipated. These organized business class is able to insist on a bailout that leads to one of the first american structural adjustments. First structural adjustments anyway where new york was gonna have to cut salaries of public employees and pension contributions and benefits significantly and cut hiring and like you know reduce the quality of life of the city and that set the tone for what was going to come. The last gasp of like the electoral left the democratic party and the labor unions behind it like the afl-cio the last guess with their influence in government and the keynesianism that was debate their like base. Political understanding the basis of their ideology was this bill that was passed around and argued over in carter's term. The humphrey hawkins full employment act because this was because we say like inflation is this push and pull or that monetary policy government fiduciary. Like money policy comes down to The do you favor keeping inflation low or do you in favor. Keeping unemployment low you can't have both that's the whole premise of the monetarist notion and so the the the the idea that you could actually you should actually deal with this by just giving everybody jobs which again means giving people democratically more control over production more control over work. Because this is not work that is being compelled by the profit motive. It's politically generated means it is the will of like other organized section of the american broad working and middle class so they got. This bill together got good old hubert humphrey who is one of the most tragic figures in american history.

He's like one of the one of the one of the fire brand progressives of the party in the early during world war. During the new deal era he had been mayor of minneapolis. He saw the creation of a civil rights plank for the 48 democratic platform that led to the walk out of the dixiecrats and then he becomes he runs against kennedy but he can't beat that smile. Then he becomes johnson's vp because he can just lead him around by the pecker and then he's forced to publicly support a war in vietnam that he doesn't believe in gets just narrowly defeated by nixon who was secretly sabotaging the negotiations in vietnam to extend the conflict which if there had been a peace treaty signed before november. Hubert humphrey would have won in a landslide or at least considering how close it was. I think a very good chance of winning comfortably and certainly narrowly. I don't want to get too specific whatever but that was a intervention that cost the lives of millions of vietnamese and cambodians and hundreds and tens of thousands of americans and he just had to take it. Johnson knew about it from wiretaps but they couldn't make it public because that would admit that they had wiretaps and it would make it would undermine the credibility of the institutions. So. I'm very carter does not really support humphrey hawkins. It's really just this it's a baby of these you know these old guard liberals like humphrey and teddy kennedy and it gets passed but in such a watered-down form that has no enforcement capacity. So there is no gov during this time of crisis. There's no government commitment to full employment. Instead we get the volcker shock instead of that. It isn't either or instead of a full employment. We get the volcker shock. The huge jump in interest rates that leads to a massive recession but that also breaks the inflationary cycle. The spiral you see double-digit unemployment by 1982. And like reagan was very unpopular. At that point. There was a lot of buyers remorse around him and they got the republicans got killed in the midterms but thanks to that. Real business cycle after bottoming out the fundamentals reinserted themselves and you know you've got some defense spending. You've got this new credit credit economy. Wages aren't going up anymore but hey you know there's still there's still a consumer lifestyle.

That's accessible but it's at the cost of any coordinated working class. Political power um and so wage is not going to go up anymore. So what's going to fill. The gap now is going to be emptied by you know manufacturing by by the consumer power of like this middle class american. This middle this bourgeois aspiring american working class and the answer is financial derivatives. They're gonna chop up. Every transaction turn it into another transaction. They're going to use a spa a temporal fix there's two fixes that happen in the 70s. One is a spatial fix where manufacturing is taken into the periphery and like capitalism is developed peripherally. At the expense of you know industrial capital which is too expensive thanks to the labor demands of an organized working class with political influence. It's got to go elsewhere to be continued to be profitable and so that is of spatial fix moving capital from one place to another and then there's the temporal fix of turning this trade network into a synthetic world of sales on hypothetical future iterations of this object turning turning things into theoretical synthetic capital. It's a it's a simulated virtual economy and it is at the total control of the high-level monetary decision makers in institutions like the federal reserve and the imf. There's no democratic accountability for this economy because it's all controlled by things like interest rate that are not politically determined so what we get instead is cheap money everywhere pl. New places to invest new hypothetical fortunes to be made and new ways for foreign capital to come back to the united states. Oh boy. I might have to make this on a two-parter. I've really. I really went too far afield here I have we'll see how far I can get um so you get derivatives markets through deregulating industry like a lot of the reasons you didn't have.

These is because there were limits on things like interest rates that banks could give on the deposits that limited how much money you could make in these hypothetical economies. And they got rid of those and so it exploded but also with it exploded regulations in the form of in guarantees of bailout of of a new structure of too big to fail institutions that have an implicit understood relationship with like the central banks to provide liquidity in the case of crisis so that is state intervention in the economy big time. This is cardinal sin according to neo liberal economics and yet it is the basis for everything else and in this context the working class is just dissolved like a tooth and coca-cola. The uaw starts making concessions and backing down from their commitment to you know continually rising wages. They assess the assent to a lot of outsourcing and and de-industrialization. The moving from factories from the unionized rust belt to the union-free southern southeast and then later southwest and so the wage line flattens completely. So there's no raises in wages for 30 years. But tax cuts are supposed to now fill the gap. Okay yes you're not taking it up anymore taking out how many more money than you used to be. But that's not enough that's out of our hands. That's the market. What is in our control is how much taxes you pay and then therefore what we spend those taxes on so you get into a mindset a individualist panicky mindset that is totally understandable because you're in crisis that all I can do to stay ahead of the eight ball here is vote to get lower taxes because I know I'll get them the repub. Democrats will promise me xyz but the republicans lower taxes so that means I get why I get more money and it's like. I've totally normalized the fact that I'm being more exploited and the thing is what else are they supposed to do. There's no more institution that can embody their greater aspirations. They've been dissolved and you and the national labor relations board and the department of labor get staffed with pro cap pro business people. Former capitalists themselves who were just there in government for a few years to ride herd on These these cocky unions and and union the capacity to organize is dismantled and one of the big set pieces of that is of course.

The patco strike when the air traffic controllers who endorsed reagan in 1980 because carter had been such an enemy of and labored so hostile that they thought they might get a better deal with reagan not realizing how far they were going to go because boom they got wiped out. They got fired end mass and it just put a shock through the entire labor. Movement put him on the back feet so the economy is now just a series of bubbles from now on and then they start popping through the 80s. The first one to pop is the savings and loan industry. Savings and loans were known hilariously as thrifts were these new deal era. Organizations like jimmy stewart in It's a wonderful life. They were supposed to allow for community level retail banking that would give high interest rates to savers that would then allow for the extension of mortgages to people who were in the within the savings loan. Membership now this business model is just getting annihilated by um by deregulation. It cannot handle it and it should have been euthanized but instead it was allowed to metastasize into this just ridiculous bubble that went way that made them inflate way beyond any ability to substantiate the speculation and so it popped. A lot of it were slush funds for contras and pedophiles that that is sort of the thing. They don't talk about here that I would really like to read a book specifically about It's about the way that savings and loans were used by like local political power structures to like distribute um patronage and launder money. I'd like to know more about that they don't really talk about it. Because there was so much fraudulent underwriting. They were just making up numbers and so of course you can make that money go anywhere. Of course. It will and if you can't sustain it it pops and they're out. The government has to pay back all this money.

[64:57](https://youtu.be/OJbeTzm2pVQ?t=64m57s)

 it's always an injection of liquidity saves the day the thing that saves the market after sessionals is mortgage-backed securities. This is a thing that is a solid gold investment and it becomes a huge source of foreign capital flowing into the united states. People were buying up mortgage-backed securities and it propped back up that industry because remember that had been one way of funding people's homes. Gotta get a nice stable interest rate mortgage from a family from a neighborhood thrift where your body's in steve's house and it's in bill's house that's gone instead. We have a deal where you can get a mortgage from whoever will offer you the most enticing interest rate. In the moment you can get it at a consumer level and that allows for much bigger securitization. It allows you to to allows you to trade the and speculate on it. This leads to among other things a huge collapse of independent banks like huge consolidation around big regional power powerful banks which of course is totally inevitable in a situation. Like this 36 percent of all independent banks in the united states closed between 1979 and 1994.

I thought that was a wild statistic so this new emphasis on derivatives but and things like bond securities and leads to an opportunity to make a lot of money trading the and doing the actual facilitating of the trades and that's where firms like golden stacks become like the huge powers that they end up being is in trading these bonds and trading these securities. And a lot of this is money flowing into the u.s to buy treasury bonds because with the volcker shock those interest rates are so attractive that foreign money from japan from europe just flooded the united states in the 80s um and that money had to be managed and one thing that these instruments did is that they blended different types of capital different rates of interest different currency exchange rates and it allowed them to to synthesize those things to work out those those incongruities within like one synthetic um commodity like you can buy it and you have within. It guaranteed the translation basically across interest rates and time frames and and exchange rates and this new. These new instruments then become the thing that creates a like a real global financial structure because now you have something that like you know is like the petro dollar in that its circulation guarantees all the other transactions and so it will facilitate this the realization of this global capitalism and one of the things ironically that fuels this money that's coming in to invest here is not from foreign countries. It's from pensions because you still have a lot of people who had gotten pensions as part of their union. Contracts that they still had and that money had to be invested somewhere while they waited for to put it out in checks and so this because of no huge huge flow towards the the derivatives market and makes pensions and the dependent on the success of these institutions.

So because of all this money flashing around and all these new instruments glass-steagall even though they repealed it in 99 or whatever it was already a dead letter in reality. By this point it just could not keep up with the speed of things and then of course and we can't forget talking about the vulgar shock how the rise of interest rates leads to the overall overnight almost default of almost all of latin america who could who were depending on the ability to continue to service one level of interest and then we're totally incapable. It's like when the apr's changed in 2009. It's like we can't pay this and the us bailed them out with structural adjustments. But the money did not go to the countries the countries had to make do with their domestic product. It was not an investment into anything. It went to the banks that had underwritten the debt because the fantasy of risk under the justifying capitalism. Is that there is any chance to this stuff that these people aren't being held in the everlasting arms of of the state which they claim to be different from at every level. It's a pantomime so that's more money flowing into the system. That's more just a distract direct state influx of cash into this financialized economy.

All that of course leads to another more general bubble thing gets too fast gets ahead of its skis and then you have bloody monday in 1987 and how and it's a huge crash bigger percentage fall than on than on What was it black monday black friday. The the one in the 29 more a larger percent drop but instantly met with liquidity which of course the institutions to do that didn't exist in 1929. Now though you have a bump like that boom instant liquidity so the stock market gets back up and is zooming until the early odds hits this unprecedented boom time and during this period the us uses a threat of protectionism because you know even though you have this huge stock market boom.

You have wages stagnant and unemployment up in manufacturing sectors people are losing their jobs. They're good union jobs and are having to live more precariously and it's causing a real politics of protectionism and they mostly just at government level use it cynically to force free trade regimes on foreign countries. We we used it as a as the as the pride against mexico and canada to be like look. We don't want to do tariffs and so we can provide them with cheap imports to make up for the fact that their wages aren't going down or that they make less money than they used to so you have a big boom and as I said profits up but wages flat all of this because of increased technology and increased productivity brought about by technology which used to be distributed more broadly across the the labor divide but is now wholly hoarded. Prophet is holy hoarded so so that's stagnant so you have a stagnant bringing class. At the end of this and then there's four key shifts in the u.s. Economy during this period that put it on a completely different footing. By the turn of the millennium.

One is the shift from manufacturing to finance that we talked about manufacturing went down. I mean we still manufactured and there was manufacturing. There was manufacturing investment in the 80s too mostly from japan but but you know moving from high-wage union states to low-wage non-union states mostly but the the percentage of the economy they spent. The percentage of corporate profits that went to finance went from 17 roughly year to year from 1960 to 1984 to 30 from 1984 to 2007. So you got this financialization of the economy and therefore the the rise of shareholder value as a framework for understanding regulations morality itself. Shareholder value is the closest thing there is to a moral heart to capitalism and it's just the prophet mode of enshrined as a religion. The religion of he has it. Therefore he deserves it that becomes the dominant ethos of capitalism which makes it much more short term which leads to accelerating cycles of bust accelerating crisis within the institutions which we're not living through But they can't be stopped because there is no working class resisting it number two 

[74:04](https://youtu.be/OJbeTzm2pVQ?t=74m04s)

You see that that what I was talking about earlier the shift in manufacturing internally from high wage midwest to the low age south and south southwest and the introduction of like mean product. Lean production techniques the kind that were pioneered in japan where the working glass is much weaker and therefore much more of the sort of efficiencies that capitalism tried to impose to shore up profits in the early 70s that were resisted in europe and the united states by the organized working class being like I'm not doing that in japan. They said okay I'll do that because they did not have sufficient organizational capacity to resist it and since organizational capacity is exactly what the u.s left had lost or the u.s. Working class had They were able to impose it the lean systems of production which increased a exploitation. Then you have the boom and this is the thing that really made sure that the united states was always going to maintain its its hegemony as the world currency.

 is that even though you know you've got advanced capitalist economies developing in japan and in europe. The united states dominates the high-tech production sector not just computers but pharmaceuticals bio biotech. All that stuff the united states was the absolutely dominated the entire world of that and as such had a advantage over everyone else in gathering capital keeping capital on flowing within the american spear not not not losing that precious buying power and then fourth the rise of professional services. This is the david ruiz. These are the david graber. Jobs consultants administrators the people who the jobs that you're offering the the broad middle and working class they're kids. I should say because you've offered a house to the one generation. Now the next generation coming up you're not gonna get a house maybe or you'll be able to get a house but you're going to pay a lot more and it's going to take you longer blah. Blah.

You know it's going to get worse over time but you can still aspire to it. You can still aspire to a middle class and that but now instead of that being something that anybody who went to high school could do anybody who learned to stand in the line could do because that was accessible to working class people people with un no advanced degrees who are using their bodies exploiting their labor power in order to generate surplus. Now that path is closed. Those jobs are gone and going away. But these new jobs are there but you have to go through the hoops you have to go through efficiency. Additional social hoops. You have to provide more levels of financialization and profit. You have to turn this transaction into a trance of transactions that they can be chopped up purchased and swapped. I know mmt describes how state currency is created work for the fafsa.

It doesn't matter you're like the georgists you think that because it's right it means it'll win. It's an interesting factoid but it is not the to think so so you have this new creation of a new class you want to call it the professional managerial class whatever it is a new. I wouldn't say it is a new. Is it a new class that's interesting you honestly might call it a new class in that it is something that is post-class. It's it's a it is a post-class that you can't talk once. Once the heart of the working class. The labor movement is pulled out once that like and drive train of the left broadly understood is removed. You can't really talk about Us all right so you don't have classes anymore because what is organizing people along a class access. Nothing consumer access racial access gender access demographic access demographic representative consumer yes they have jobs people have jobs. They are extractive to one degree if you're paid by if you're paid by another to do it.

You are alienated there's no getting rid of that you do not control the conditions of your work. Therefore you are not You are at one level or another of proletarianization as opposed to the capitalist who is on the other side of that transition. They are then their whole political agenda is staying there. That's why there could be no national socialism because the imperative to stay at the top will dissolve all of the flimsy moral architecture that gets along people who are in it for confused but real human interest as opposed to just being a monstrous demon mouth oh no I i violated orthodoxy about the vulcan rate or something. I don't the vulcan rate hike actually isn't that important to a lot of this stuff. It really was the creation of these liquidity. Ins these structures.

These things that instantly pump liquidity into capitalism at moments of crisis which is a state intervention but also then like the removal of regulators on speculation. That's what really did it that was just one structure that helped drive it in a direction because again. I don't care what really caused inflation's menstruation. It was a totem of discipline to labor everything revolved around it and that's what it accomplished and one of the things that accomplished is by financializing the lives of workers. They totally facilitated an intensification of their social alienation so because I said instead of people buying things with money. They earned. They started buying it with money they had borrowed and that that is a soul eater and certainly eats away your ability to imagine being politically effective like to have a political voice.

[81:42](https://youtu.be/OJbeTzm2pVQ?t=81m42s)

So when we're that when we're talking about the response to this. This is what we're talking about who cares what they actually did nerd. I'm sorry I'm talking at the level that where things actually move and that's why we can't speak of classes anymore because the existence sufficient to build class consciousness no longer exists so it doesn't make sense to talk about classes other than as academic categories. The problem is if we only address academic subjects we could only we'll only ever use academic categories because what other categories are are relevant and so we can only have academic answers trying to argue who is the working class is a literal waste of time. It can be fun but it's a waste of time because you're talking about like who is barry bonds better than babe ruth. We live in a reality of post-class and we have to reckon with what that means all right. I gotta I gotta cut it off here guys. I will. I only did one chapter but I think maybe like early next week. I'll drop in and do the second one and then do the next two on friday still bye-bye.
