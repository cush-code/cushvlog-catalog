A place where Lovers Go to cry the troubles away and they call it alone some town where the broken heart stay going down alone. Sometimes weather. Broken hearts stay going down alone some town to grab my troubles away in the land of Broken Dreams. The streets are paved with regrets. Maybe now now and alone. Some time I can learn to forget Billy ran around with a railroad crew.

He knew a national Tottenham glue yeah. Blue I probably saw a copper and he had him in that knee from six for the five foot two hit him right Square on the door and me the copper won't be wearing any family. Hey Billy son where are you now don't you know that we need you now well. They're all Tata the old Papa where are Billy Bones rested. Now. Billy went away with a peacekeeping for us because he loved him. Let a good fight of course ran away in a big cookie van to the backs of the Lily. Jordan really saw the Arabs and he had him on the run so he had them in the range of a seven-seeing gun had the Israelis in his sights of the ratata and they ran like. I'd say really son where are you. Now don't you know that we need you. Now. We're not downtown the old tattoo where Billy Bones rested now one not really at a rare old time. Laughing and singing on the Lebanon line came into Captain up looking too pretty never even got to see the holy city. Now Billy's out there in the Desert Sun and his mother cries in the morning comes and there's mothers crying all over this world for the poor. Little darling boys and girls play on a Tuesday I have been a second Friday on a Sunday.

I'm not gonna wear blue green even though it is my favorite color and I have plenty of green outfits not gonna not gonna count out to the finians no thank you. Potato munchers came over to America and immediately said hey if you give us guns. We will be your thuggish enforcers of capitalism way to go. They came over here and they're like hey as long as we're not at the bottom of the racial hierarchy. We will kill anybody that you ask us to and you know what rational decision in the context. Nothing you can blame them for everybody does what the incentives drive them to do you can judge people individually although in the end we only ever judge ourselves but as an aggregate you can never judge anyone because people are moving in the through the shoot as it's been designed if things change.

If there's eruptions of resistance they emerge out of disruption. Moments specific moments of disruption of of overflow overflow of rage overflow of fear and new forms of resistance emerge out of that. When things are going as planned. Things tend to just have a brutal accumulatory logic. What is accumulated is human activity that is then turned into culture then directed backward towards us so yeah can't blame the Irish too much but certainly no reason to die a River. For them. Good Lord get over it but and that is why anybody wants to get rid of Columbus Day. I'm sorry you got to think of something better to trade the chain. The trade to the Italians sorry because they are another one of those perilous white groups that came in late and still have the memory the the the social memory of not quite being American of course. It's a joke now because it's been literally Generations since then but that feeling of not being part of America. It's deeply um enticing. Everybody wants a piece of that really including people who think they love America.

They want to feel in some way divorced from culpability with the broader American project because even a reactionary has parts of America's projects that they're horrified by one way or the other and being a subject to America rather than a embodiment of America allows for that. So everybody wants that everybody seeks that regardless of where they are politically and that's why the concept of identity politics. Is so absurdly used and used in a way that's meant to abolish understanding rather than increase it because all politics is identity politics. That's what we have instead of class politics. There's a material base to it and there is a client relationship between identity groups where there's an understanding explicit or implicit that your group getting in there will be represented in part by government. Large yes flowing in One Direction one way or the other. That's it the only thing that disrupts that is class politics that cuts through identity because it's separate. It is. It is not one identity among other. It is the identity that structures all the other ones. Lens is the class what we do with our day or if our labor is exploited taken from us. If we live off of the labor of others. The experience of living as a member of a class is the emotional fulcrum. Catalyst for all of our understandings of every other element of our identity and as such it's can't be represented among them culturally and isn't it has to emerge from struggle and we built in this country briefly cultural organs of class struggle. But they have all been absorbed into now the post-class American political and media economy.

Hey Germans don't need a parade. They got an entire month. They got the month of October and they got the Fest of October which is usually in September because you're getting excited about October showing up call that whole month. But the reason the Germans don't have a holiday isn't just that the German Germany did World War One and Two and that made German Americans very quick to kind of get rid of their little special part of Separation because it's connected too much to the specific German project as unlike you know Ireland and Italy. I mean yes Italy fought World War II but you know that wasn't even really the high point of anti-german sentiment in America that was World War One. When Italy was an ally. A lot of it is that the Germans got the land the Germans showed up in time to get the land. The big German immigrations to the United States happened in the mid 19th century. The 48 Rebellion is a big Pusher but even a little before that and after that and it started as we talked about a couple weeks ago. It started in eastern Pennsylvania in the colonial era so that means that you get this middle strata of peasants with enough money to be able to come to America but not enough Security in their employment to stay in Germany.

Comfortably they come here and they're able to grab some of that free real estate and they fill in the midwest all through the 19th century creating these nodes that bring in people which is always how it always works. Early adapters create family networks that pull people like with capillary action across the ocean because you know somebody. There you know a cousin or something. You would. It's much more difficult to go cold turkey to another country so people go where their their people are. So. The Midwest fills up with these crowds who get the land and then they get to be beneficiaries of the American project 

But of course there are those who bring their socialism with them and who try to assert on the centrality of socialism to German identity and they do have outsized influence in in politics. We have the sewer socialists in Milwaukee only came to power because of the German immigrant population there but again that's the ones who are in the cities well people. If you have the Germans who filled in the land. They become the backbone of the post-war Republican party post-civil War Republican Party. The smallholder class when they get Irish show up. They show up at the same time as the Germans but the Irish who show up are the broke as boys in the continent because they're not making they're not because there was a blight across all of Europe in the early 50s. That's why it's called the hungry fifth early 1840s. This guy why it was called The Hungry 40s and it's why you had the 48 rebellions there. Because things were bad. Harvests were destroyed. The potato blight affected potato crops all across Europe and potatoes had been brought in across through the Atlantic Atlantic exchange. The American Exchange brought to Europe to fill in the calories of of farmers so that they could grow more cash crops. So everybody was having a bad time but in in Germany you know it was not the Colonial holding of England they treated it the way they treated India that means the Americans would come or the Germans who come. During this period.

They have a they have a nickel to rub together and they can set themselves up in America. The Irish got nothing the Irish are fleeing literally death or being enslaved at a road gang or being get stealing trevelians corn and being transported to Australia. So the ones who came to America just huddled next to the shore and they took the first job that was offered to them which was from the state in one form or another as part of the political machines that emerged among these workers. These Urban Irish to leverage their position in the society. Like hey we are at the very least we're here there's numbers of us and we could be organized to vote a certain way and they create um political machines that generate patronage and a way for Irish people to make wages that is preferable to the one thing. Everybody in America is trying to avoid wage a wage relationship with a private employer so they they gave him the guns here shoot shoot the other patties and and we'll keep you above the blacks and there's that deal.

The Italians show up a little later after the Italy is reorganized and unified as one country so that and so it takes a while once that thing is stitched together for the vast numbers of for the modernization of agriculture in southern Italy to start throwing people off the land the way it had in Northern. Northern Europe decades Generations before the fact that in that industrialized urbanized Northern Italy and Rural southern Italy were different completely different. Political organs until the mid 19th century means that you do not have this the modernizing impact of those of that Capital there with a time when you're dealing with you know much more nationalized economies before you really have the the world system pulling everybody in One Direction.

 so the thing that does it first before that is industrialization and urbanization pulling people to cities and then modernizing Agriculture and reducing the amount of Labor inputs needed to do agriculture. Italy doesn't get that until the night mid-19th Century so it's in the late 1800s that you have these huge numbers of of extra miles in southern Italy who can no longer hang around in the Mafia which of course is fused with the police at a fundamental level organized crime and the police are one organ our one structure of violent enforcement of the broader economic system in the white market and in the black market but doing the same job what is it that Henry Hill says in Goodfellas. The mafia is the police department for Wise Guys. They are the same guys and they are wedded welded together in their own way. The same way that the political class is with the Capital holders bribes. We don't call them that in the political class because they've legalized it but at the Grassroots here at the level of corruption which is the same exact thing that we're doing legally. It's just.

It has to be off the menu because it's dealing with a part of the economy that while necessary for the economy to function cannot be legally acknowledged by the greater economy and by the legal system has to catch the economic activity that is pathological to the to the social system but generated by that social system. Nonetheless. Like you have capitalism you have a bunch of people packed into miserable cities working in factories. They're going to want to do Vice they're going to want to do criminal. So how is that organized to minimize destabilizing social effect of crime and that's what organized crime does so the Italians show up later and it's like no all the cop jobs are taken here you be the cops of the criminals but even and the way you know that it's the same thing is that it had the same effect of upward Mobility among the Immigrant Italian population that the the Irish becoming cops did because a few Generations later boom the Italian and the Irish. They now are. They're all now in the same. Cities in or the same towns in Long Island. They're all living next to each other cheek to jail in Long Island. For example hmm. The fredericis next to the O'Malley's and then to fill it out the people who came last and were left to the to their own devices.

The Jews you got you got the one three. It's like a third and third and third in Long Island between the Italians the Irish Institutes but that that's what happens when you show up late to the party and without any money to move to really move. Once you get to America you just you settle into the crevices at the at the Edge. At the water's edge. The middle is filled with a big fat Square Germans and you can tell that the pollacks show up later because they end up feeling the same role in Chicago and everybody is doing what they're doing to to make it because the emergence of meaningful class. Consciousness never really takes off in America during this whole period. It's it's banked off by the the expansionary project. The same way it was banked off by the colonial project in Europe but even more effectively because you're integrating these things into the system as opposed to creating this this Perpetual periphery you are incorporating the periphery and that means opportunities to live as Americans grow over time until they stop and then we all go and sing all right so what I want to talk about today a little bit if we can make sense of it.

It's the follow-up on last week when I said that our battle of Armageddon already happened and that we are now living in a permanently Fallen World where God has fled. Jesus has been cast into the outer darkness and Satan rules unchallenged what does that practically mean I think it should be seen as liberating as freeing and not as something to to repent to gnash your teeth over and feel um and to feel oh God damn. It disheartened by to be to be made inert to be paralyzed by it should be somebody's mad that we didn't talk about the jacobites and how on Earth we wanted to tie it off in 1688 because that is the year that I think this whole thing is knitted together into a functioning organ of power. But we will talk about the Jack bites in our bonus episode where we get to some of the stuff that we we missed but wanted to talk about and also answer some questions from listeners things that they want clarified or. They want more information on so we're still going to do that and I'll talk about Jack bites that but the Jack bites are very interesting sort of some. Sore Luger lugers losers there yeah we're actually thinking we might do a shorter maybe three four episodes series on the Seven Years War because which occurs in the 17 60s 1750s and 60s so about about a hundred years after we end or about like 75 years after we end the narrative because well our the 30 Years War Story sort of ends with England.

[21:54](https://youtu.be/ouHccdRJnlY?t=21m54s)

As this new thing this new state okay with this new capacity the rest of Europe isn't going to be sort of forced into unleashing their own Bourgeois and playing the game by the same rules that the British are until they win the Seven Years War. That is what gets the that wallenstinian World System cranking into overdrive is the British conquering British being the British being the winner in the Continental contest with France for control of the colonial world because I mean you see what the losing the Seven Years War does to France. It causes an almost instantaneous economic crisis that Echoes through a few decades and leads to a Revolution but they're so they're having their but when France is having their English Civil War moment right which is what the set the French Revolution Is by that point. Victorious Britain has entered the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution really gets kicked into overdrive by the military economy that had been built during the Seven Years War because it is Wars that build the capital necessary to make technological advancements. That's what motivates money. Capital to flow to science is the practical application of it of its military use that is the only thing that is that's the necessity that sharpens the state's interests towards that funding. So this means that France even with all of its huge advantages it.

Was the state of Western Europe it was the place with the most people the most rich agriculture. The biggest city they ended up behind the eight ball. They never really industrialized. Europe France was still disproportionately agrarian well into the late 19th century which by the way is why the French even though they had that revolutionary tradition were not the place where the Socialist movement became effective and and coordinated that was Germany like we when when we blame the the social Democrats in Germany for not for voting for war credits in 1914. One of the things that one of the things that made them make that decision yes they were craving opportunists yes. They were they were fat cats they they wanted to keep their job that's part of it. But they were making what they thought were rational interest.

 decisions made in the interest of the movement and one of the things that made them make that decision is. They had no there was no comparable French socialist movement that they could have coordinated a mutual general strike with or something like that like there was no partner in France for the German social Democrats to say hey if you and if you guys both promise to vote no on war credits and to mobilize our unions to to resist mobilization. We'll do it together didn't have a partner there because France never really industrialized because they didn't want to because nobody wants to that's the whole point.

Here nobody wanted to do this except for a very thin strata of of motivated God touched incandescent Merchant types. The the landowners didn't want to do this. The Peasants didn't want to do it. Artisans didn't want to do it. No one wanted to do capitalism and France because of their robust Democratic traditions pull back the reins. They don't let what they don't let what they they don't let the the state or the capitalist class do to them. What the English allowed their capitalist class to do them which is pull them into these giant cities by the by the bush alone clear the countryside and turn them into. Factory workers on anywhere near the scale because English politics had been drained of the language of social justice it had been it. The market had been turned into a god.

It's dictates it because then turned into God's will and the political zone of action was self-consciously shrunk. But the Socialist movement is where Christianity stayed that's the the the the teleological heart of Christianity right. There's two Christ Christianity is a teleology. It leads towards an apocalypse which is something that has two conceptions that we imagine of a good one and a bad one. There is the end of all things as a terrifying horrifying Mass death event and then there's the end of all things as the return of Christ and the reveal of a new way of being in the world. It's always been a two-faced that way what the scientific revolution industrial revolution and the rise of capitalism in the 19th century did in Europe was to split those permanently Christianity as we understand as a as a self-conscious religious movement becomes eventually a worship of the South and a denial of that reunion that we're talking about making the end of the world.

Only an annihilation which we can try to avoid that's why they end up coalescing around being left behind by the tribulation. I'm sorry being raptured away from the tribulation of it. No thanks check please because what they're actually doing is serving capitalism which pulls them every day farther from themselves from each other. Denies the possibility of a reunion with Humanity or the planet insists on Eternal Eternal separation and even though you a lot of these people really thought this they were Christian. Their actions just served this force that just deepened it over the generations to the point that you get to now where nobody. In America. I think really believes in any kind of Christian God. They believe maybe in a supernatural validation of their own best interests. Like they brought back paganism but the apocalypse as a unveiling of a new way of being that did still live after this big moment of Crisis gizmogenesis. But it lived among the laboring classes foreign because their relationship to the system was fundamentally self-consciously alienated in a way that the small Bourgeois who make culture and make religion under the regimes of capital.

[30:43](https://youtu.be/ouHccdRJnlY?t=30m43s)

 don't feel it that means they can count and it's the end of the system as such for the Bourgeois. The end of the system is the end of them. It's the annihilation that is as akin to being cast into the Lake of Fire because they feel dependent for their position upon this system and they feel they feel the resentment of those who work for them one way or the other. However however they try to deny it. It's felt. It's all our bodies inscribe all of this stuff. So the Socialist movement becomes the residue of Christianity and Marx emerges as the prophet of it. The person who can take this ambient feeling give it shape form scripture. I know this is facile but you can't have a social movement if it's counter hegemonic. If it's not depending on the existing structures of um cons of coercion and consent that hegemonic social structures have that it needs an alternative truth. It needs an alternative World in symbols that can be read and agreed upon and that's what Marxist becomes necessarily not visit. People like popper in these idiots like to say this is bad or somehow d legitimizing no this is unnecessary. There's nothing is up nothing works in any other way than this so does your your.

Precious rationalist capitalism is is fueled by religious texts and a religious understanding of the world. It's just made it visible because that's what capitalism does that's why it allows P. That's why people will allow it to make them do things that they would have found abhorrent if they had any regard for their fellow man because they're it's not their responsibility. That is the free that is Lucifer in the ear. That is what thou likes to live deliciously for for Western Christian capitalists and so for people like that anything that is like a self-conscious subconsciously based on a faith in something is anathema but their faith is is just.

It's a dark Faith. It's like it's dark matter. It cannot be read by the person who's been idealized to it. Who's been fully propagandized to it. And so when the Great moment came the the real Armageddon trumpet was blown in 1914. Which is when the thing starts when when because World War One is not just this battle between these European Empires who are competing over resources and markets it is. It is systems trying to survive the eruption of social crisis at their heart that happens when you get X number of people with Y amount of Technology meaning that regular people are able to create their own parallel structures to demand power and to exercise it that had traditionally been monopolized by the ruling class that has to be dealt with and it's that that contradiction that fuels everything else and leads to World War One and it's the great Triumph of the capitalists that they get to fight World War One on the in the context of national dispute and the national question which is of course going to happen.

It's inevitable to happen because the bourgeois got rid of God and they replaced it with the nation which is just of course them because the whole thing about Christianity is that it is universal which necessarily reduces you. The the individual is contextually downgraded thanks to that universality. Triumph their language their they have to still use the language of meaning in their culture. Everyone everything has to have meaning so where does meaning come from. It comes from this mystical concept of the nation which now has made me special again. I'm not just one person among God's children. I'm not just one child of God I am part of the special elect children of God which is of course exactly what the Jews did in ancient Mesopotamia to survive in their contest with the other tribes foreign by the time that the real crisis hits in the early Fort early 19th century.

The working class has only barely come into political action and cultural formation in most of these countries. But they have had by this point 100 years in many cases to build these Notions of nationalism and who started this the French Revolution happens. The working class doesn't really exist yet you have these these sankulat. These. These unemployed artisans who are able to mobilize effectively as a military force essentially in the capital but who who whose relationship to a production is nothing like what you see later on with a developed cap working class so they can't take power so that means that it is sort of taken by these. This group of lawyers and Merchants. So what do they consecrate. They consecrate the nation and it's incredibly powerful.

[37:55](https://youtu.be/ouHccdRJnlY?t=37m55s)

They take over the entire continent behind that because it is a force multiplier it is a new technology. You can't understand French military dominance during the Napoleonic era without understanding nationalism as a technological innovation. Among the other innovations that built modern military forces and much of modern European nationalism is a response to that people getting their asses kicked by the French and going hey we need. Some of that. We need some of that Nation stuff that is what kickstarts modern German nationalism. It's this contest conflict the the being dominated by an other because there is no Horizon.

The Horizon has been abolished because it is what has been totalized is not the concept of a working class in itself by itself for all but instead a per every man for themselves and the market is the place to battle for Supremacy and so we have this 30-year spasm of violence from 1914 to 1945 that sees Europe destroyed in twice. It sees the entire world become a battlefield that sees the incorporation of China and Japan into this Global competitive State framework but it is only fitfully and occasionally fought by self-conscious class elements. Most famously of course the French the Russian Revolution. The place where capitalism had developed the least during this period where the crisis of this of the world war one broke the state and left the only Force capable of wielding power one that was fired by belief in something nobody else believed in anything even the right. Wingers couldn't really believe in the nation anymore. The nation kept getting its ass kicked so a combination of workers whose experience of alienation had forged them into the Revolutionary weapon that Marx predicted and a leadership made up of the children of the disaffected children of the other classes with the leisure to devote themselves to Revolution as a vocation.

Now there was a there was a Russian nationalism. I mean they were an Empire and they also have been fighting the Ottomans for about 200 years. By that point. So there was a but there was a nationalism but it was protein and it was very much geared around the Royal Family which made their failure in the war disqualifying and why were they willing to why were they able to act in that moment we've talked about this too why were the Bolsheviks Lenin specifically able to act in 1917.

Well everyone else was standing around with their thumbs up their ass waiting for somebody to do something while the entire thing just fell apart because they believed in a rev. They believed in a apocalyptic Horizon. They believe that their victory in Russia would spark a World Revolution that would define the rest of human history. They might all die fighting in it but they would die for something and you know what if they've been right you would have had 30 years of war from 1914 to 1945 at least and as many dead probably maybe more but at the end of it you would have had a human race capable of living as humans again as capable of imagining collectively a project of building that world that Christ spoke of in other words a Victorious Godly Army after Armageddon the fun part of revelation after all the nastiness has been concluded the Thousand Years of peace on Earth even if it's hard even if it's struggle even if it's not Paradise. The struggle and the pain means something because it is a movement towards wholeness and and reunion that is the that's the Horizon that the Bolsheviks were pointing towards that every element of the late of the of the of the Socialist movement during this period was pushing towards but the tide rolled back because the antibodies the capitalism builds the cultural antibodies. It builds through technology through Mass technology labor-saving convenience devices and media change.

The radical change the calculus of a country. The calculus of its citizens the the decision-making Matrix of a person in a in a position of power. What do I do in X situation. Yeah I think if Lena had not died he and bakarin would have tried to force them to just capitalize the country by by making a deal with the peasantry because they were fundamentally incapable of of undertaking a project of dispossession like Lenin of course was happy to kill people during the Civil War. You saw he would write these frantic letters like we got to kill him. We got to kill him because he thought those deaths meant something and it's in the after. It's when the war ends that that this torpor sits in this fear of like oh God what are we going to do how are we going to square this and Lenin's brain just killed itself instead of dealing with this contradiction. Lenin's brain exploded so that he wouldn't have to deal with it and then Trotsky just stood there like a Gomer and waited for somebody to get him out of the out of there. And pukaran of course got the neutralized and eventually executed and the only one who was willing to do with Lenin. Shrunk form. From was the the Georgian Thug.

The the the the underworld guy the sociopath what was it about Mao isn't that got the peasants on board versus leninism because it was not a traditional Marxist movement. It was not made up of Working Class People which was the bulk of the Bolshevik support in Saint Petersburg that sort of pushed the thing off them and the Soldiers and Sailors. They had the working class in these cities. The Chinese Communist Party tried to organize the working class in the cities but the nationalists at every turn up and eventually there was a huge Massacre of the Communist party and their cadres in Shanghai that's basically the end of the the project of trying to create a Orthodox Marxist movement in China. Mao and those guys looked around and saw that this mass of dispossessed Haka peasantry in southern China. These people who were generationally rural proletarians who had had no land because they were the descendants of immigrants from northern China. They had been working generationally as laborers in the countryside. They could be organized and were organized and they made up the the center of the art. They were the heart of the army that ended up overthrowing the nationalists whereas the the rural peasants in Russia were inert at that point and this is down to time frame. By the time the Chinese show up in the Chinese I'm sorry um and that's not really the case in rural Russia. There there were landless workers in rural Russia but communal ownership of land by peasants still existed in large amounts throughout Russia and small holding was the norm but even then more of the Revolution. The Peasants were by and large Pros Bolshevik even though they were they voted Sr. When they did. They supported the revolution. They supported exproperating landlords and because the the land policy of the Bolsheviks was the land policy of the social revolutionaries at first but that was basically a scam but why but it wasn't a scam because guys because Lenin they didn't really believe in just giving the Farmers their their land. They knew that that would not allow for the development that it needed to happen in Russia but they assumed again that World Revolution would make this Hall.

[48:37](https://youtu.be/ouHccdRJnlY?t=48m37s)

Irrelevant and German agricultural help would allow for them to modernize agriculture in the countryside with minimal conflict with the peasantry but of course that doesn't happen what do we do now and so by the time the second big Reckoning happens in 1941 19. The late 30s World War II capitalism divided against itself temporally and geographically between those who got there early the allies and those who got there late Germany Italy Japan Germany and Italy's case it's because they were not brought together as Sovereign entities until much later than the other countries of Western Europe and for Japan because they were closed up to the West until their Gates were blown open by Matthew Perry and they had to industrialize basically overnight. They did an amazing job of it but they were still showing up late to the party and that meant that the path that the Allies had taken to stabilize their economic systems in their Growing Pains colonialism. Was no longer possible for them because all the stuff was spoken for all. The land was spoken for and they reacted the way that a capitalist state will with its borders. To fully constrain it will eat itself and then lash out in a death spasm.

The only government anywhere that stood for the working class as such and therefore a Christian apocalyptic Horizon was Russia. This country that had just massacred Millions to build an industrial economy did what the capitalist States had done again. They had to do it to survive as a state but socialism in one country was the first revision you want to talk about revisionism socialism. In one country is a big ass revision but they thought they had to do it why because they could not imagine them being in charge and that is what constrains all human social movements is that they're made up of humans. Eventually though the collective effort draws us towards one another unless we fossilize into regimes of exploitation which I'm sorry.

The Soviet economy was workers did not have control over their workplaces. They did not have control over their amount of Labor. Performed capitalists did not take the labor it was not a capitalist economy. They did socialize that Surplus towards building a state with a project extend Global World Revolution like I said if you're An American in the 30s being a communist makes sense not believing what they say about the show trials makes sense. This is this is if you want a horizon if you want to believe that we can actually change the world and change what it means to live amongst each other. Then you've got to be with the Soviet Union. It's all that we had but it was due to failures not success and as a result when that war ended the wild dogs of capitalism had been euthanized. But the but the worker state of the Soviet Union had suffered such massive damage that it was forced to concede to the capitalist. West ain't a the ability to create a global economic Trade Network and and World System that the Soviets would participate in as subject and in the process of fighting this war.

All these huge technological innovations emerge again. We get the technology we get the first industrial Evolution. Because of the Seven Years War. We get the explosion of technology in the last 50 70 80 years and the technological Revolution from World War One or from World War II. Foreign ological regime supported by the atomic bomb the ER technological innovation. The one that everything else flows out of one way or the other and that secures the victory of capitalism and the reign of Satan over us all and it's disproportionate holding in the hands of the West. That is what Dooms the Socialist movement from that point because capitalism then is able to defeat the national populations of all of these subject people and underdeveloped Colonial countries piece by piece one by one capitalism. Show knocks on the door says sorry about all that colonialism that's awful but you guys and you guys get to create your own economies.

Good go for it. We're very proud of you you welcome to the family of Nations but here's the debt that you owe here's the cost of these things what can you pay for them with oh your raw resources. Oh that's funny well. We'll certainly take those off your hands. But that means that you have to essentially replicate the Colonial economy that your former overlords had imposed. Only now you're replacing Colonial administrators with your own government's bureaucrats and turning the comprador class into a national bourgeois and there's class conflict.

But it is all. It's separated. It's it's it's it's isolated. It's. It's all these people struggling together but without access to those tools that had been developed in the initial struggles. In Europe. They were all being hoarded by the capitalists and the the the Socialist block was behind the eight ball the whole time and always always at a massive disadvantage. I mean Russian GDP exploded in the 50s but that's because they had to build up from such a low level after the devastations of World War II. That is a lot of that like miraculous economic activity of the 50s is just rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and capital formations that the U.S was just building on top of as that means it's just a matter of time until the West calls in the debts and that's what starts happening in the 70s and because no communist country is going to launch the nuke because that would be to annihilate every reason for being they've ever had the thing that goes beneath consciousness of even the most cynical operators. Nobody could launch the nukes so they stepped out and we now live in the aftermath of that but as I said what this should free us of is our enslavement to a teleology of the idea that our efforts as humans on Earth don't mean anything unless they build a story of Western individual Humanity not Humanity as as a species. But humanity is a specific sort of subject formed by specific regimes of accumulation over time in our case. The Roman world that Christ emerged during our actions have meaning no matter what happens in the future because we are carrying them out we believe in something every minute of Our Lives. It's just a question of what that thing is and the the reason that there's so much endemic social pathology and sadness misery. Self-destructive Behavior is because the only thing we believe in the only thing that we can all agree to believe in the only belief that is rewarded in the marketplace and resonated outward is ourselves. But if we believed in other people then every moment can be clarified and and action meaningful action can be taken which makes all those other bigger questions irrelevant. It doesn't matter you don't have to have a carrot at the end of a stick I believe yeah. The Western individual subject is not long for this world but that does not mean that life that that conscious life even is going to be extinguished.

I don't think that's possible I think Consciousness isn't is is the definition of existence that you can't imagine that it does not exist outside of consciousness. So there is a future that we're all part of even now and we're building without knowing it. But the thing we're building is not something we can imagine. This is what I mean by worth. We're in a pot. We're living in the post-apocalypse. The apocalyptic Horizon I'm talking about is one where the world as we understand it and humans as we understand. Them can live together and face each other as friends and as brothers and sisters and live that way that is that's the apocalyptic Horizon. And that's what gives our political actions or should give our political actions. Meaning did anyway what I'm saying is that's gone but that does not mean anything because what comes after will be as much us as as what are narrow conceptions of identity would have us believe and when that happens this period this I this Con per this subjectivity that we cling to I know I do that we cling to so terrifiably will look like the transitional fossil that it always was and that's fine. We're all part of the story. Now how does does that mean like oh the world's gonna end oh absolutely not like we're not going to get I that total Annihilation. That is at the end of the capitalist Christian teleology. The death drive if you will. That's that's not something they're afraid of it's something they're seeking and like anything you don't get what you want what what the what the what the Cat. The final catastrophic destruction fantasy is is of a collective something a final reunion they can't it cannot be conceived of as a conscious restitution and healing because being separated and wounded is how we now Define being a person. But if we all die at once or or if all of our structures collapse at once. There is at least finally a collective experience that we can be part of which we're longing for even though we deny it yes Union through nuke.

We all go together when we go the classic Tom layer song for the bomb that if the bomb that drops on you takes your friends and neighbors too there'll be nobody left around to grieve so that's not what they're. Gonna get everyone's still going to die alone in somewhere on an economic totem pole that leaves them feeling at the end of their lives. Defeated including the luckiest and most powerful and most successful the ones in the Cocoon but yeah all that's going to happen is that apocalyptic conditions that currently exist on Earth that would to people who worry about the end of the world would absolutely be processed by those people as the apocalypse if they happened everywhere simultaneously. They'd be like oh yeah. This is the end of the world. They will just slowly increase the territory that they occupy and the the elite and their Hangers On will retreat to to citadels an archipelago well talked about this before and just slowly shrink over time and that means that nobody ever gets an apocalypse. Nobody ever gets the ecstatic reunion of catastrophe unless somebody does press a nuke to make it happen if somebody is able to take that world historical weight on their shoulders to be I'm going to be the one at the end of this story who pressed the button I'm going to be the Beast I I'm going to actually become Antichrist and maybe that happens I mean but again I don't know but the lives the lives that are lived while this is happening subjectively and individually still can be made. Meaningful and deaths can have meaning and all that meaning will come around somewhere in some form because nothing goes away and that's the thing like will the U.S use nukes rather than lose hegemony and that is a very very open question. I would say at some point it probably will happen but I have no idea but that's not the end either that's only likely the end of one form of subjectivity. One way to be a conscious being and there are many other ways. There are infinite ways to be be a human to have to have a collective understanding of what that is and there exists one that is able to harmonize that is able to utilize technology towards human ends. I know like Jacques you and those guys say nope can't do it. Technology always takes over but I look at history and there's so much contingency there that I really think that enough enough tosses of the dice bring up possibilities that we could not conceive of because the people dealing with those situations and dealing with that technology and building that technology are doing it from a completely different subjective perspective crab people. Why not I do think that there actually could be a human a future a human a future for this brand of humanity. This run this Factory run of humanity if there could be a negotiated step down of American hegemony although part of me thinks you're just delaying the inevitable there but that does seem sort of beside the point because it's very difficult to see the American state stepping down that way all the incentives pushed the other direction and as I've said before you can just witness that in the fact that you've got this chasmus massive culture war with these hugely polarized political structures and and political parties that represent like these mannequin mirror images of each other to their middle class voters.

But they're both on the same page on the on the long term. The most important question how do we relate to China. They have this they have there's basically no real Gap. There I know that Republicans love to say oh the the the Democrats love China. They want to kiss. China look at what they do in power what was Obama's big. Foreign policy. Push Obama did do some stuff to stand down U.S military commitments in the Middle East. He he bitched out in Afghanistan and he let Hillary he let Hillary lure him into Libya but he did refuse to go into Syria even though they wanted him to and he did hold to the withdrawal from Iraq and why did he do that stuff so that he could make an Asian pivot which meant confront and contain China diplomatically economically and militarily oh. Biden right now is trying to de-link American technological economy from China's. That's what they're actually doing forget about what they say oh. They don't say China virus enough like this is for children. They're blaming Russia now but Russia in the long term can't really be your Boogeyman one because their culture the culture War coding doesn't work for half the country. They look like based white people and also because they're just not really a threat on their own and the big and the the right wing resistance to the Ukraine war is they they say this publicly the anti-war voices who say stop fighting Russia do so because they think no we need to suck to We need to link up with based Putin to confront China so someone needs to take our nukes before if they if they're really serious about about about taking the car keys from us. They also need to prevent us from just trying to Bluff our way into holding permanent domination because like I think at this point looking back on it. The invasion of Iraq is an attempt by a a radical segment of the greater American ruling class to prevent the long-term migration away from the United States of the organs of World capitalism.

Because that's the thing capitalism passes through these like National hosts is it as it colonizes the globe but once you get fully fully nationalized capitalism. Then it shouldn't really have a single national headquarters anymore and that is the natural progression which by the turn of the century many people in DC were very well aware of and you had this faction of those people who thought as a tactical matter. The U.S should attempt to use its massive military to stop that from happening by trying to reassert a formal Colonial relationship to the most important energy sector energy pools in the world I am very excited for the Oppenheimer movie. It's interesting because like Nolan seems like he is a full reptile like he is an anglos. Anglo. All human emotion has been drained from him although he does like also though understand like love as this you know Universal bonding thing. But he I think he kind of his films have that reptilian feeling because he understands like what anglo-ism means so it'll be interesting to see how he takes that moment which really is the the hinge point. So I I want to say I'm going to see it on IMAX. Baby. Yes let me see that nuke let me see the Satan's eye open up. I mean the fact that it happened at the Trinity site get out of here get out of here too much symbolism is killing me here because yeah it's an atomic Lucifer that takes over the whole world. So yeah. It doesn't seem now though so that failed the war on terror failed in its effort. It actually only exacerbated America's hegemonic decline by creating this just a whole bucket with a hole in the bottom that didn't do anything except in Rich defense contractors which hey that's part of it. But that's not supposed to be the whole thing. It's supposed to also convert American military power into economic power which it has not done the way they wanted it to their reach exceeded their grasp. That's why it had to be a a a segment. Within the political economic and military types to do it and I think it's no coincidence that they're EX trotskyites because they still had that apocalyptic it had been inverted and twisted at this point. But they were True Believers and now an American apocalypse and they because of 911 however that happened and I am at this point I would say I am agnostic entirely. On 911 I don't know I know that whenever they put my in the report is not true 9 11 Commission report obviously is fiction same way. The Warren report is but past that I have no idea but that context created this attempt to extend American hegemony by saying okay. We're going to actually stop doing capitalism. It was great thank you we appreciated it but now we're going to just do American Imperium thank you very much and now. We've got China who's over here actually trying to do capitalism but they're doing it when they had used capitalism to build legitimacy in their institutions as opposed to us who had seen it. Hollow ours out so we'll see.

We still have all those nukes and Russia does too and Russia doesn't want to get dismembered and destroyed which is clearly the only answer that NATO and the us are going to take. It's all feels very tenuous but it always is and we still live lives that that means something even if we can't see it and that we can take a good faith effort to try to find it. It gets reflected somewhere I do think that and even if it's not true what difference does it make because you're still here might as well try all right. I think that's good next week if we're still here. I had a thing but I forgot it. I'll remember bye-bye.
