Sit and dug with their sweat and their guts. They never drank water but whiskey by pints and their shantytowns rang with their songs and their fights. Navigator navigator rise up and be strong oh. I have to. I have to  okay. I have to on uh yeah okay okay. I got to uh edit stream info right okay that goes is it still going. I go oh. There. I am oh. I'm there. I'm there. I'm doing it oh. This is great okay. Now. I will go to twitter and promote this so people can know. I'm back. Let me get the guys. Here. It's moving slow now because I'm doing stuff. But I gotta get this finished maybe. I can do it on my phone uh am I getting people. I got one person out there am.

I choppy am I okay because I haven't had great internet that's one of the problems. I've had is my phone stopped working like. I was no longer able to stream from my phone. I thought it was my wi-fi for a while but then I found out no. It's not the wi-fi. It's the phone. So the reason I haven't been streaming. The last week or so is because of technical difficulties and I know that that's pathetic uh. But I am not a technically depth person. I finally decided okay now. I'm going to just stream from my laptop directly because that's right folks this entire time. I have been streaming exclusively on my phone because I did not uh. I didn't have the dashboard twitch thing on my laptop and it was too much technology for me. It made me uncomfortable so I just literally did it on the phone because the phone already had it loaded uh and I didn't have to set anything up so it no longer works. I need a new phone but in the meantime I finally got it set up today for the laptop so let me just post. This all right. We're back to talk today about chapters six and seven of reconstruction. So next week we're gonna go back to wednesday fridays that's always what I wanted to do. This was all an unexpected mistake bungle. I want to try to keep two a week. I'm not trying to stop because I'm having fun. I think these are useful. So on wednesday. We're gonna do just chapter eight because it's a little late just after eight for on wednesday. But then on friday.

We're gonna do a game stream with chris. We're going to play anno domine 1800 or something uh something like that see. This is what I don't understand audio gets getting compressed to hell. But we can hear you really well. What is the difference between those two things. What does compressed audio mean if you can hear it. Okay can someone explain that can someone explain it for me please. What is what is it tinny wow fine. It's teeny because I don't have a dedicated mic right now uh. But I will now that I'm here because I only have because I only stream here and I use. I use an xlr for the podcast. I only have the uh. I only have the lapel mic that I've been using with my phone this thing but since I don't have the phone anymore. I don't have that uh microphone I think I brought it but I'm not sure where it is. I can't find it right now. So I'll have to at least for now use the uh the laptop microphone. But I'll probably in the near future be getting a a uh because I want to be professional here. I want to be a little professional so. I'm going to bring a uh a mic stand hopefully for next one but anyway yes so chapter 8 on wednesday anno 1800 stream with chris on friday. We're back into it. We're getting into it. We're loving it the cadillac stayed by the house and the yanks they were within and the tinker boys are best advice for them there. Without ken. They turned and shook. They had a look in the room where the dead man lay two big dimmed wire right his last tip. Though all right here. We go is so weird.

I have the dashboard open up and I have my uh. I have oh. I have the whole command center here. I can see the chat uh. I can see the session length and the viewers oh man. I can see the bit rate. I feel like. I feel like neo. I feel like the lawnmower man like I'm absorbing the internet. I'm becoming a true gamer let me get it. This is more power than I can handle you guys okay.


So we're talking today about this is long delayed so hopefully. Everybody who's been trying to get these red had time to get them read. So we start with chapter six and the beginning of radical reconstruction baby. This is congress coming back hard post passing the 14th amendment ready to lay  down uh and able to govern with andrew johnson essentially as an annoying uh hindrance but not a genuine threat to their power uh. This really does show that congress is the real source of power in the constitutional system. It really only has been the uh the mutating effects of america's role as a global hegemon in a world empire that made it so that our presidents are so much more powerful now because they have so much of uh so much of like the state's capacity for violence is has been totally abrogated to them but in terms of legislation in terms of creating like a legal framework for domestic concerns. Power really does reside in congress and so after the big wave election that put the radical republicans in the cath bird seat.

Uh although not uh not just the radicals and we'll get to that uh. It meant that john johnson the audio I sound like a robot well. What do you want me to do. I don't know is there a button. I can press if there's a button. I can press. I'll do it okay so they could govern without the president interfering but when they get to congress. When congress comes into session there false 1868 uh 1867 they have to say what are we gonna do how are we gonna govern and that makes it and that is when the divisions within the republican party really start uh breaking the place breaking the thing up because while the republicans are all on the same page that this union had to be defended and slavery had to end in order to cease the the conflict between the the competing social orders. In the north and south. There was no agreement within the republican coalition among anything else because remember.

The republican party is this frankenstein creature of northern anti-slavery sentiment that encompasses everything from the old uh american system wigs like uh abraham. Lincoln was an example of that strand to anti-masons to the  know-nothings but then also uh democrats. Anti-slavery democrats who held a lot of the pre-war democracies ideas about fiscal responsibility and private property and uh so this new part. This new party doesn't really have a coherent uh uh ideology but the war covers that up the war and the fact that they all agreed on things like the homestead act cover that up uh like obviously the saw the hard money men hated the greenback but it was a necessity for winning the war so they had to take it uh but but at the war's end all of these conflicts re-emerge because slavery is now over so what kind of people are within this republican coalition.

On one side on the far left you have the radical populists and I would say that these guys are if you want to get presented about it. These are the good guys. These are the guys who understand most the political terrain and have accorded it uh and understand also the moral terrain they understand what the good is most the closest of anyone who could have been they understand what the good is and how to go about it in that they understand that we need racial equality in this country. But the only thing that will let that happen is if we have economic equality. They understand that one cannot exist without the other which makes them the progressive force. What we in the 21st century were called the good guys and these are people like ali uh thaddeus stevens in the house.

Uh benjamin wade in the senate and benjamin wade is another real tantalizing former president uh uh alternative presidential. What if after the civil war and then another one benjamin butler and I'm honestly. I'm getting more and more fixed on butler as a character. I think he is one of the most fascinating figures of the 19th century and I have an idea that I actually want to pitch to hollywood uh about a limited series about the the life of benjamin butler starring paul giamatti because as I have said this is a guy who started the war as a copperhead and became the most radical of one of the most radical of the radical republicans after the war while being a spoilsman and a crook the whole time uh. I'm thinking about it. My first step is when I get done with the this book. I might take a little break from the book club uh. I mean I'll still stream but I won't be like doing about a book like this where I'm trying to get coverage every week while I do other stuff uh more at for pleasure. I'm gonna read butler's autobiography to start with and then start looking more deeply into his uh character because he is to me considering that he was almost uh lincoln's nominee or could have been lincoln's vp nominee in 64. It's very tantalizing.

So anyway those are your radical populist republicans. Then you've got the liberals. Now these are the guys who think slavery is an abhorrence and they may even say it's a moral importance. They may even say that racial caste distinction is a moral abhorrence but class uh class distinction is necessary and in fact good and must be protected. These are the people who say we must free the slaves so that he can become a uh a worker so that he can be enter into market transactions because I'm sorry there is truly a hierarchy of humanity. We are at the top of it. We must maintain our position at the top of it and that means but that doesn't mean the brutal catastrophe of slavery which re destroys um destroys virtue and destroys uh democracy and that's all true we need a more rationalized tyranny that uses contracts and markets and private property. This is the rationalizing impulse. This is literally the capitalist train.


These people the radical uh republicans the liberal radicals are the progressive movement from that point till. Now they are the progressives of the 19th century. They are the warren voting radical liberals of the current moment and uh one of the one of their chief numbers is a guy who otherwise is one of the heroes of 19th century politics. Charles sumner a lion of abolitionism who was martyred in his senate seat by the grotesque southern neanderthal. Uh preston brooks carried. Lifelong injuries thanks to his gutter snipe and but he was a hard money. Uh low tariff lazar fair uh politician and because he didn't really know or care about uh about economics and so he had no coherent uh objection to slavery. It was pure moralism. Like there are people. There were uh industrialists who hated slavery because it was inefficient and they had no moral objection to it. They had a practical objection to it and then you had people like sumner who had a fully moral objection. But that's because he was a  senator he was not a capitalist or he did not take him. He did not see himself as part of a capitalist edifice. He saw himself as a statesman and so he could have a fully moralized opposition to slavery. He could even have a fully he could have a full uh revulsion at slavery uh as a racial classification he could be for full equality and I think sumner was one of the most radical. He was the most radical liberal and I would say that it's not because he was a bad person.

It's like oh yes let's use. Let's use this uh abolitionism to get to a yankee leviathan corporate state. He just didn't know any better. He didn't know no better because how would he he was not in power like you have to learn power when you're near it and he wasn't. He was a speech maker. He wasn't even a vote whipper in uh in the senate he just gave speeches mostly and then you have the rest of the party you have the moderates. These are the people. I was talking about who hated slavery because it's inefficient. They're not necessarily motivated by racial hatred because hey most of them live in the north where there aren't very many black people at all and that it's not their problem if they're black people or not. It's not a thing they're scared of uh. So they don't have to worry about like living near black people and having that be a point of con attention or anything because they're too rich to do it. These were represented by people like uh senator james sherman of ohio who is william tecumseh. Sherman's brother sherman by the way as much as we love him for destroying uh the south uh but he was a moderate.

Uh uh racial moderate meaning sure give him the give him the vote but otherwise equality is no good and then you had the conservatives like francis blair. The old unreconstructed jacksonian democrats who just hated slavery because it was inefficient and hated the idea of sectionalism in uh interfering with america's destiny as a nation and they were wildly racist. They were deeply motivated by racial animus but they were still republicans because they wanted the union preserved and these guys almost all and their relationship to uh to money question to to to the question of the currency runs uh along the same spectrum. The farther left you were racially the more you were uh supported at least within the republicans. It's different in the democrats but amongst the republicans who were the party of at the end of slavery and therefore some sort of integration of ex-slaves into american society. They were the racially progressive party amongst them soft money equaled uh racial egalitarianism.

Hard money equaled racial exclusionism and race panic and hatred because hard money is the real basis of social hierarchy because it is the currency. It's what distributes resources and uh hard money is a mystification that says no no value is not determined. By us the government. It is the state capitalists. It is determined by uh this special uh metal that's in the ground and the amount of metal we have is how much we can how much stuff we can use and how much of the world how we can distribute resources and so it is associated with hierarchy. It is associated with reaction and the only radicals who were for hard money were ones who were either lying about being uh in favor of black equality or didn't know didn't understand. What money is so this split revolves throughout the entire party uh so the party is split on these questions of race and even the eastern money that deport supports.

The republicans at this point is also split. Uh the the the uh new york wall street uh commodities fortunes that uh revolved around cotton trade were all in favor of presidential reconstruction and wanted to keep what he was doing going reintegrate the south as quickly as possible on the basis of racial classified labor uh extortion basically. That's what they were uh trying to get done as quickly as possible uh and but there was other money in the north that wanted to see the south really brought uh into compliance in order for nothing else than to facilitate a modernized um a modernized like a streamlined political economy uh but oh I i forgot to say this about uh sumner sumner objected vehemently to racial class uh separation on in trains. He was opposed to any attempt in the south and in the north to segregate train travel by race but he had no problem with uh class separations because that's a matter of money that's objective who has money and who doesn't is determined by the market not me. Not us. It's not being done by uh by some sort of discrimination uh of humans. No no it is done by the the hand of god he decides who has the money to try in the first class and of course. This is not true. This is of course ideology so one thing these republicans are able to organize. Around is a civil rights act that uses federal courts as an instrument to protect black rights in the south and this is a way to reduce uh the federal intervention into uh the southern economy because er into the southern society because there was a great fear especially on the right that wanted to pay back all that debt in species as quickly as possible um that they didn't want a long or expensive military occupation of the south so having uh and of course.

Local authorities couldn't be trusted to enforce the law. So the answer they got up with was. Federal courts and courts are always going to be the last resort of hidden power because it's it allows you to the way. The currency does the way that uh a gold-backed currency does allows you to de-politicize. Something take something out of the realm of um of politics of right and wrong and into the realm of objectivity. The objectivity of the amount of gold that uh something is worth the objectivity of a of.


A judicial decision so there was no so they tried to fob off justice for friedman on to the uh federal court system. Even though those court rulings would have to be you know sought and enforced at some point something they didn't really care about or care to think about kicking the can down the road uh and then land redistribution was limited to a southern homestead act that allowed government land in the south to be sold cheaply of course all of the good land in the south. The good profitable. The black soil that could be used for productive agriculture was  land giant landowners by the latifuntists and so all that was left was swamp and timber uh and very few uh. Blacks were able to take advantage of it because even if they could have done it even if they could have gotten that land and made it useful they didn't have the capital to improve it because remember the homestead act says not here's some land and some tools. It says here's some land and you have to use your own capital your own tools to  build the thing out and improve it so that it's now yours.

No one had former slaves by definition. Pretty. Much did not have capital because all of their all of their uh labor values surplus to their life had been taken from them. So the only people ended up. Most people ended up buying southern homestead. Act land were white strawberry straw owners who were there to do it for lumber companies and of course this whole time. There's all this good rich bottomland that these traders had just forfeited by their actions. These people who had been defeated in battle on the question of what constituted their property and that property could have been taken but no no we cannot have. We cannot give people something for nothing which of course is absurd. They  literally were they worked on it their whole lives. They deserved it more than anyone who sat like a tick and the goddamn veranda did uh and but also because private property was sacrosanct. It was a power the state didn't want to reveal its power to print money and it didn't want to reveal its power to compel through force because if it can compel through force who's doing the forcing is it the  answer if you're at the top of economic hierarchy.

This whole war was fought by I would say the mainstream of the republican party party itself as as like a machine not the voters. The voters were more up in the air but at the party it was fought specifically. I would say to uh bring about a bourgeois revolution in america that severed for the last and tota the last gasp and for the last time the relationship between the people and the land of the country so that they could be part so that everything could be privatized and parceled out which had to happen in order to have full bourgeois social order emerge. The american revolution was a partial bourgeois revolution but land concentrated land ownership and land fixedness was not totally defeated because capital wasn't powerful enough. Yet it took until the 1860s for the north to become powerful enough to when challenged by the galloping self-defeating mania of this of the south to uh to gain its independence. Uh it was there to crush it. It was there to crush the  out of it and finally bring about a liberal bourgeois order and things like land dis redistribution went against that now once again that does not mean it was inevitable that that happened because this is a party and a party is just a it is a leading edge of a social movement and it does direct it to some degree but if conditions change at the base that brittle structure can snap. We've seen it before it could have happened then. That's why I have butler as president. I just I make fantasies in my head to live in the world. I do but I think that was the party.

That's what the party wanted and the fourteenth amendment uh empowered the union forces in the south uh by disqualifying many confederate veterans from service uh and imply. It finally compelled a civic equality in in in elections uh but it left a lot of things to the courts and of course. Most of those provisions would end up doing much more to help corporations than former slaves the 14th amendment once it starts getting uh once it starts getting interpreted by gilded age courts after the social tide has fallen back and we're stuck in this moment of uh of like corporate power building and and corporate uh assimilation of all levels of uh state power uh. There all of a sudden deciding that these provisions which were about freed slaves actually referred to  companies and and corporate uh corporate uh ventures because that's where the power was it's not because that was the correct interpretation. It's not because that's what the text said or any fair interpretation of the text said it's what power said at the time so. Johnson who could have let this ship go by decides to veto the civil rights bill and not only that he goes on a tour of the north uh to try to whip up support in cities.

Uh very trumpian like he was a trump figure like there's a few presidents who who fit who fit a general mold of bitter resentment uh paranoia uh hostility to the press and the political system in general uh. But in other respects they're different. I would say johnson. Nixon and trump are all in that mold the difference being that johnson and nixon had genuinely felt and deserved and earned senses of grievance uh and resentment to powers that be. Johnson always felt himself uh to have been scored by the elite aristocratic society of the south because he was a a lowly poor white trash taylor nixon with his good republican cloth coat. Uh the son of a whittier grocer couldn't go to  yale uh felt had to go to duke law school which was just starting a law school uh felt like he was always having to bow and scrape before those more powerful than him and they and but trump was born on third base. He was born at home plate after a home run he was born sliding in and the difference.

I think between our ruling class and uh the former ruling class is that we have reached a point now where power has been so dispersed to the algorithm of capitalism. Like all of the superstructural uh authority points where people had the ability to actually make a decision and have it mean something and have it be dictated by their conscience and good good judgment instead of by a number on a  piece of paper that has gotten smaller and smaller and that means that the people on top are now as filled with grievance and anxiety and resentment as the middle strata usually are because everyone feels compelled. No one feels free or powerful because there's always some other person no matter the most powerful people in the world. If they're all there. There's one person who's not there and that is the algorithm now all previous generations of power all different arrangements of power in the world. There was always someone there and it was god but god just meant your conscience and good judgment. It was up to humans now you're never in charge no one's ever in charge not even bezos and what that means is that they get resentful because that's what having that's what being in a position of precarity produces is resentment like american precariousness is now universalized and that's why we're having a culture-wide nervous breakdown because every social strata every relationship to capitalism regardless of whether how much power they have is in a situation of precarity.


So when johnson tours the north he gets some good receptions. In some places. He gets some bad receptions in others and he gets booed and heckled uh and he just whined the whole time about how bad everyone was treating him. He said at one speech. I have been produced. I have been slandered. I have been maligned. I have been called judas iscariot who has been my christ that I have played the judas with thad stevens very unfair to me that bad fat. Stevens very unfair uh and this doesn't help his case uh. He's very horrifyingly racist and more than anything.

He just tells everybody hey you know that war. We just fought that all your sons and brothers died in it really didn't mean anything and voters were like you know what it actually did mean something and so when johnson tries to form a national union party uh where he would presumably use that to create a third way like a uh a a uh center of uh like dissident right-wing republicans to then later add on to uh the democratic nomination that he would then take to get reelected. Uh. It was so filled with copper heads and and uh confederate sympathizers from the north who had spent the war uh being a fifth column that it alienated basically every republican they could say look.

There is no good uh uh like there's no way that anybody who fought for the union could support this party. You're saying that everyone died for nothing sorry so he ran an explicitly racial campaign against black rights and he got his ass kicked. This is that election that brought the uh brought the radical republicans to power where they could override his vetoes uh and the fact that there was a bunch of violence in the in. The south was not helping things the fact that there were riots in memphis in new orleans uh and and violence against blacks that was left without with impunity. It did piss off northerners uh there was a desire to reorder southern society. There was a desire to make something meaningful out of the war uh and not to allow the planter  who had started the war to be put back in power if it might have been uh resentment but it was resentment with the good intentions so with the 14th amendment passing. This congress uh with johnson doing nothing can't stop it. Uh the uh republicanism is basically settling on using the moving towards having suffrage replace economic power.

We're not going to violate property rights and our understanding of property rights enough to reorder society by giving you the land that will allow you to sustain yourself. We will give you levers of political power but of course those are fake. There is no such thing as a level of political power uh. If there is a generalized social arrangement against you laws mean nothing cease quoting laws to men with swords as pompe magnus said and that uh reality sadly would have would assert itself over the course of reconstruction and prove that it was in my view the failure to redistribute land that was the single greatest catastrophe of the reconstruction era and the thing that made all the worst results of reconstruction possible. I don't think you get slavery salt.

I don't think you get racism solved magically by uh that happening. But I do think that racial rapprochement in the south is accelerated significantly. Uh you see much a much earlier emergence of a like potential multi-racial working class working uh collaboratively on the class lines and as I've said we've already talked about all the little roots and bran little roots and tendrils of redistribution that were working their way into the soil when  johnson came along and uprooted them and that if you don't have you have a different president abraham lincoln or a benjamin butler who maybe nurtures those roots instead of uproots them. Maybe the fact that inevitably the north was going to lose interest and lose desire to spend money on southern occupation would have still happened but in a context where the where black landed black uh. Uh friedman are able to create networks of political power that make it so that they can fend for themselves. That's that's that's the that's the good outcome that could have happened. It's not some magical pill the chicken and slavery. It is independent political power for blacks in the south that doesn't depend on the freedmen's bureau and the  seventh cavalry and the only way that would have happened is with immense is with land redistribution which thaddeus stevens god bless them understood even though the rest of them for reasons of uh ignorance and uh ill intention refuse to understand so chapter seven so this fourteenth amendment the civil rights act will lead to an explosion of political mobilization. Among the former slaves uh these were concentrated in this. Uh civic association called the union leagues which were uh that started in the north as uh uh a as a civil support structure for the war effort people behind the lines men and women are uh.


No. There were auxiliaries for the women but the union leagues were for for patriots to to do their part behind the lines. Like this is for the 100 men. This is for the guys who paid someone to take their place like grover cleveland. They could go to join the union union league to sort of assuage. Their guilt at not getting shot. But they ex-slaves took that structure and used it to organize their own political power. Now that they could vote and while most of these in the black belt were all black organizations in places with significant unionist sentiment rugged places like virginia. Like north carolina. They were integrated union leagues. This is 1868 here so these are people who are as racially uh uh uh culturated as any americans have been and there were cooperating in interracial union leagues so they're there to start organizing people to vote for um vote their interests and their start uh having conventions where they try to hash out exactly what their interests are uh. And while they're doing that uh some of the white elite decide okay. We're gonna cooperate with this. Uh and we're gonna get our former slaves basically to vote with us uh by uh just hoodwinking them because what do they know. Besides.

We were such nice masters of course. They're going to want to do what we say politically. One of them said uh. It's in the book a quote that I will. I could. I could buy uh. He could buy all of uh. His former slaves political allegiance with uh a jug of hooch and a banjo or something. But it turns out that pretty much everywhere uh. They tried this. The former slave said yeah. You and contra what psychos like. Johnson thought who thought that the blacks and their owners were like in some sort of weird cahoots. Uh it turns out no the the white people who uh friedman were least trustful of were what a shock white people who had owned black people until like two days ago the poor whites even if they had very vociferous racial views at least they had known anybody so the organizations that emerge the republican party basically that emerges out of this organization in the south. This this efflorescence of political activism is made up of obviously ex-slaves and freed white people are free black people but also two groups that you might have encountered from your high school history textbook carpetbaggers and scallywags. Oh don't we love to talk about carpet baggers and scallywags. History gets so precious here doesn't it oh. Papa would you tell me of the cappy baggers and the scallywags. I ever so much enjoy that one so carpetbaggers were northerners who would come to the south in order to make their fortune sometimes to make the world a better place but often to do both uh.

They tended to be educated middle class people who were looking to make jobs in politics to make jobs in land and agricultural speculation to work uh in the new industries that were emerging um and that some of them were committed to racial equality others didn't really care it was a mixed group. Scalawags were uh southern republic southern white republicans who were of course the most despised group among uh both whites in the south. Pro uh confederate whites of the south uh and the dunning school which dominated reconstruction historiography for about 60 70 years after it was promulgated um but in reality these guys they were not portraying anything uh pro-war uh white republicans in the south. Some of them were uh were modernizers who were basically just going with the hot hand they're like look. The north look slavery was always an inefficient economic structure. Let's modernize this. If we got to give the blacks some rights whatever let's just get that northern capital here uh and so you know they really were in a way kind of betraying things like james longstreet who had been uh one of the top confederate generals.

He's he's gonna become a republican uh but a lot of them. The ones who were less high up in the economic totem pole had spent the war either uh running around in the woods trying to escape uh deserter patrols because they'd run away from the confederate army uh or they had spent the war in union uniforms fighting for the union because they never recognized the confederacy as a legitimate government because nobody  asked them people forget how undemocratic the declarations of secession were wherever there was opposition to secession in the south. It was just ground over. There was no deliberation they were just it's like oh. Interesting. This entire area of the state says don't uh secede  election which is rigged because they had rigged uh suffrage so that the people who own slaves got more votes than people who didn't own slaves so guess what we have more people.

At every one of these conventions. There isn't even any  democracy to it. Their slaves are voting. For them and this is one of the reasons that a lot of whites thought that the slaves would vote for their masters in after reconstruction. But it was just because they'd structured uh suffrage in such a way to uh increase their power. It was deeply undemocratic so these guys were not  and so and they'd spent the war being persecuted. Many there had been executions there was imprisonment. Uh many of their homes and lands were confiscated by the confederate government. Local uh pro-slavery people would harass and attack them uh. They put up with a lot of  to stay loyal to the union and they wanted to get rewarded for it and you know what of course they did and and then of course you have uh free blacks from before the war. Most of whom are in urban areas relatively well off compared to uh the black population in general uh because they had some you know capital by definition or they wouldn't have been free uh and then you have of course. The ex-slaves and some combination of this group comes together into constitutional conventions throughout the south to build new uh political instruction manuals for these new states by the way west.

Virginia never constitutionally admitted to the union it. There's the they totally ignored the constitutional um the equal of north constitutional uh order to as has been established by practice to bring in west virginia of course. Though you know it's a war. That and then it was almost east tennessee. Too. Tennessee was almost headed east uh so these conventions are a conflict between the modernizers who are looking for capital investment and populists who want to see things like debt relief and land distribution and uh and the question of essentially the same question that the republicans are asking in washington.


What degree of social justice which degree of equality uh like true economic egalitarianism are we going to add to social or to uh uh the social are we going to add to uh emancipation. You know like. We're we're now at bear citizens. Now. What does the citizenship mean does it mean you're free. Off you now are enslaved by the market with no chance to have any sort of negotiating position or does. The state have an obligation to sustain a social matrix that allows people to express freedom meaningfully and this is the kind of thing that people like wendell phillips and benjamin wade and thad stevens understood and of course the ex-slaves almost universally understood without having read any of this. For the most part because it was obvious to them only if you had money in position could you fool yourself otherwise but there's a real question how do you redevelop the south.

What money you. This is a this is not a communist system. Communism is not on the agenda karl marx isn't walking through that door. How are you going to capitalize this new society and northern capital. Northern investment is the only thing that could do it and things like debt. Relief and land distribution were scary to investors and there and even though of course people who were making these arguments were doing so self-interestedly. There was a real tension there between the social goals of reconstruction and the need for it to be funded at some level through economic activity because remember the government's not going to do  uh. But so they ended up mostly uh adapting pro-business constitutions. But there's a lot. There's a huge expansion of the role of the government here for the first time. These states establish the abolition of imprisonment for debt creating the first public school systems. The first real government-invested infrastructure uh uh the first public asylums and orphanages that these states had ever seen. So this is a big expansion of what is understood to be the government's role now of course there's people who are going to be trying to keep it as limited as possible but then you're going to have the people pushing at the other side to make it bigger one group pushing to make it to the other side.

Bigger was a political organization made up of radical white populists uh and ex-slaves in virginia run by an editor named james hunnicutt who fled the state during the war because he was a unionist and came back to try to push uh the post. The reconstruction era of virginia into a populist. Uh racially integrated movement among ex-slaves smallholders and uh mechanics against the power of the tidewater aristocracy. This is in miniature the movement that could have taken real root in the south and the fat and we know it could have because it did and of course virginia is not south. Carolina virginia is not mississippi uh but uh the fact that this could find such ready ground for the exercise of real power that quickly because the hunting cut organization takes power in virginia uh. This alliance of radical whites smallhold uh unionist smallholders and uh ex-slaves. It had a potential to be operated other places uh and once again uh if if land redistribution had been persistent had persisted you could have seen that uh that movement uh um accelerated meanwhile stevens he's dying poor. I really wish he'd lived a little longer poor than stevens he is dying. But he is still trying to push some sort of confiscation plan for redistributing slave owners. Traders land to the ex-slaves and small whites remember that stevens understood the way to do this. The way to create a new social order in the south is to say hey uh yeah black people.

They're equal to white people now but guess what white people if you've been. Over by these hoity-toity aristocrats who denied uh you any access to development or public education guess. What now you get public schools now you get land. Now you get better terms for debt and financing and here here's some actual land that you can you can uh you can set you can develop. It's a uh. It really is the only he was a visionary because that stupid movie lincoln makes him look like an idiot right the scene where he says well. I would just. I would throw all the  slave owners in jail and redistribute their land and you're supposed to take it as self-evident. This is ridiculous like oh of course. He doesn't understand the need to compromise look at old lincoln doing all his slack tricks to get the 13th amendment and this idiot's over here saying we could have the moon part of it was redistributing it to white people too and getting a cross-racial yeoman alliance against the parasitic aristocracy. It could have worked but you need people at the top pushing along and not  destroying it because it's it's. It's.

It's protein like the things are moving in a direction but the momentum is determined by just so many flat break butterflies yeah. I just keep slathering at the thought of gold benny ben butler at the  aruba or something but of course the party is afraid to do confiscation because they don't want to scare away capital and this is the point where you have to say and point out and acknowledge that the phantom menace behind the scenes of this whole tragedy as much as it's of course the doing of the former confederate leadership or I mean. The former uh the slaveocracy who is now re-enthroned and johnson and reactionary poor whites too uh and uh feckless generals. It's also being pushed by northern finance. The fear of confiscation was that it would spread past the south because benjamin wade the president pro tem who would have become president if they impeached andrew.

Johnson was going around saying that the war between slavery and free labor was just the first phase in a contest that would between labor and capital that it reached its next step. Ben wade anticipated marx's concept or of the stage. I guess not anticipated. You got ben wade over here p repeating marx's concepts of staged revolutionary battle. The dam the man was a  uh dialetician of the first note and and this this got to this. The heart of a question is the war about slavery by itself. Slavery is some unique evil or is the war against slavery part of a broader war. A broader conflict between labor and capital. Then it reached its next stage ben wade and the radical populists had one idea ben ben butler. Those guys. They had one idea but the center of the party was in the other that no slavery was a unique evil and now it's gone and we can now make money again um so the real dagger in the heart of reconstruction. I would say and this is why the real like what if is if lincoln isn't assassinated or if butler takes over for johnson because you really have to get that red redistribution going in the early 18 or right after the war.


Because the question of the currency the question of the debt and species versus greenbacks was going to doom reconstruction from a fiscal perspective. It was going to doom it as a political project and it was going to do it as a as a viable uh military intervention uh but that happened in like the 1868 so the outcome very well would have been different if you see a different uh a different post-war environment. A different immediate intervention in the land uh but by 68 though the party the republican party was fully reactionary because it was at the base the party of northern capital and so northern capital asserted its authority in a peacetime situation. It was only the fluidity of war that allowed for other forces to take power. Now things are solidifying and the question becomes how are we going to repay the debt because the us government took out a tremendous amount of money in order to fight the war and did so by issuing not just a bunch of bonds but also greenbacks money backed by nothing but the will and authority one could say fiat of the federal government. Of course. This is exactly like money now basically with a few extra steps but back then this was considered a deep heresy for uh for economic conservatives who make up the leadership. I should add of both political parties democrats and republicans because they're both captured by their ruling classes and now that the southern elite have been brought. Low. Southern finance is replacing them so they put out a bunch of these greenbacks. They put out a bunch of these bonds that are going to come due and the question is how do we repay.

These bonds do we pay them even though they were bought. Many of them were bought with greenbacks which of course are worth less than their their actual face value gold because everybody can't go and get them at once or else. It collapses um so they have to circulate so they circulated at a higher volume than there is gold so they're worth less they're more. They're they fluctuate is what the thing is. They might be worth more for a while if you want to speculate on them. But they are they are uh um unstable whereas the price of gold is stable because it's determined by the supply of gold which is generated by mining and transfer trade not by numbers in the ledger which is these guys hate it. They hated it because if government takes over that role what do we need the  capitalists for can't have that can't have that um so there is a movement uh and george pendleton. A democrat proposes hey how about we repay those greenback bought uh bonds in greenbacks uh but of course. The uh financial elite that bought these bonds is like no no no you got to pay them back in gold. Even though we bought it with greenbacks which was essentially means we gambled on them. We got to get all of our  returns in gold. We need to have our bets guaranteed. We need to basically remove the the uh luck part uh with our control over the government and uh liberal republicans and conservatives all agree that uh that uh greenbacks are heresy uh in fact sumner puts it in religious terms that it's like it's actually. It's actually immoral not to pay back with gold because you're reneging on a promise.

It's absolute flummery. It's the most rank ideology um but so the republican party at its top doesn't want this and it's uh uh. The republican party at the top doesn't want this and the the platform that they set up for 68 for their election area. Iran isn't the candidate they recruit general grant who doesn't really have politics uh they're like vaguely conservative. Uh is adhered to a hard money platform uh but the base in the south. The southern yeoman are dying for greenbacks uh everybody's dying for more money in the system because if they have to repay the bonds in gold they have to take gold out of circulation which means less economic activity and it was through debt relief and loser money that these southern whites were going to stick around for the republican con coalition uh and even the and and the base of the democrats was for greenbacks too uh like the populist base who had lost like the jeffersonian fixation because they were  porn they couldn't afford it uh and so the democrats they put the pendleton plan in their platform but they nominated an arch conservative. The new york governor horatio seymour who basically never talked in the 1868 election about greenbacks. He talked about white supremacy because there's this danger of a actual multi-racial democracy emerging in the south and it must be destroyed and it could be destroyed by applying race uh as a flashpoint which should obviously galvanize whites in the south against uh reconstruction but also galvanized whites in the north who are very racist too uh and one of the things that helps them do that is that the republican uh platform is saying.

We're not going to give you guys. The debt relief the money or the land that you need so it becomes a referendum on um. It begins it becomes a referendum on um on reconstruction as a racial uh endeavor and you know what give them credit uh grant won but it was closer than it should have been uh but anyway. I've skipped the johnson impeachment because I got my papers mixed up but uh before that happened uh johnson got impeached for uh some. With the tenure of office act uh. It's all political uh chicanery. It doesn't really matter uh but the the the vote falls just short of impeachment in the senate probably because nobody wanted ben wade to be president because ben wade was a soft money radical and they much rather would have much rather had president grant the pliable man on a horseback who could just embody a political consensus without actually articulating any himself uh to uh then be moved around like a puppet. This is the third time we've done this in america or fourth time uh where we've recruited sort of a relatively apolitical military man to embody a uh otherwise unpopular political. Uh consensus you have george washington there to embody this reactionary uh federalist attempt to uh establish like financial rule uh of course.

It's economically progressive you know because it has to be. But it's still not popular. Nobody wanted that really very few people wanted it and washington was able to paper it over. Grant was the man on horseback who could embody a a agenda that was really only popular with bankers and a very slim sliver of speculators and merchants. Most people who worked in factories who uh worked the land had contrary interests but they were separated by geography by culture. Race in the south and race was used as a way to try to galvanize the election and break away any of these uh nascent political uh um coalitions and francis blair who was a republic. One of those right-wing republicans ends up being uh horatio seymour's uh vice presidential nominee and he just goes on an insane rant around the country doing john uh johnson-esque racial. Jeremiah ads about like the horrible like mongrel beast army who's going to come and destroy everything. If the if reconstruction continues and even in the racist era. People were horrified by the language he conveyed um and of course andrew johnson who wanted to get a second term as a democrat after basically giving them everything. He they possibly could have wanted in the white house for four years. No no nomination sorry. Buddy thanks for doing the job for us. But uh we'll take it from here and and as always happens. These resentful  end up getting owned by those more powerful than them because they're motivated at base by this paranoid selfish drive which means they're at the end of the day suckers and can be totally had and johnson was absolutely owned. They used him and then spit him out and his entire idiotic attempt to build a new constituency for his own power fails miserably good riddance to a drunken scumbag.

One of the great vile  of american history right on the on the on hell's mount rushmore with like john c calhoun so rest in piss andrew johnson. He didn't die right away though sadly though uh thaddeus stevens died just in time to see uh grant in power and so next week we'll talk about presidential radical reconstruction where we have radicals in charge of the senate and house and general grant uh in charge of a hard money uh pro finance regime trying to reduce the monetary supply uh at a time of massive economic collapse in the south while simultaneously trying to enforce actual equality at the bayonet point. So we'll see how that goes uh a spoiler alert not great all right. This is good. This was fun. We'll see you guys on wednesday for chapter eight bye.
