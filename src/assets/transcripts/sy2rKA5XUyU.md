Digging on a one-way ride ask me nothing let me be taking everything in my stride. Don't need reason. Don't need rhyme. There. Ain't nothing. I'd rather do going down party time. My friends are gonna be there too on the highway speed limit.

Nobody's gonna bless me around  thing now. I feel like a dang computer hacker learning how to unhost things. I'm on hosting things. I did it. I'm the unhost with the unmost excuse me just getting a little glorped up here. So today. I thought I'd do something as a little experiment.

So I'm going to be recording for tomorrow. An inebriated past haven't done one of those in a while. I think the last one was uh upton sinclair and the epic campaign of 1937. Uh four and I kind of don't really know what. I want to do it on yet and I figured it might be interesting to have a brainstorming session with some of you people and see if you can give me an idea because the problem I always have with inebriated past is. I never know what to pick and I kind of have to get sort of shot from a side angle to like be like hey. Something has to aha me and I thought it'd be interesting if we could do a a little experiment here and see if I could get something that I feel like ah yes if I prepared for that. I could by tomorrow do an episode the battle of blair mountain. That's an interesting one certainly a rip roaring story. That's for sure uh. I've thought about doing the battle of blair mountain before uh bleeding kansas would be interesting oh man.

Something says the spanish civil war to troll all left tendencies. I was actually thinking of doing that but then I decided to throw it out there a little bit. I don't know because because I kind of want to do the spanish civil war but at the same time it feels a little too big uh and it would be fun though to to troll all the tendencies because I do think you could tell that story in a way to piss off all of the sides historical advocates because you can tell that story in a way that makes the communists look like uh stooges handmaidens of capital and uh a new like the trotskyist nightmare of them. As like a bureaucratic state uh working in concert with capital to destroy uh revolution. You can also tell that story is about the anarchist is a bunch of uh undisciplined uh  who would and not have been able to organize them their way out of a paper bag. But of course. The real tragedy is that both of those things were true but also the best stories about both sides were true. The people who were in there making the up those uh sides they were for the most part fighting uh under reasonable assumptions. It's just that spanish society was so fractured at that point that there was no way for those fissures to be healed in the breach in the crisis. Moment paris commune that's interesting william jennings brian hmm. I mean people apparently some people listen to the thomas frank episode that might be interesting to go into more detail.

The thing about uh brian is that he is not like he is what we got instead of a socialist leader you know like we didn't get a real socialist like our our version of him would have been like a debs. Uh uh but brian was the figure who came out of the uh like the the rural side of american populism uh which was undermined by its parochialism and that's the problem with american populism. Uh is that it is it was parochial because we didn't have an articulated working class. We didn't have one of those made we had. This group of people spread across the country in different conditions of life divided by geography race ethnicity language religion that didn't cohere the way that working classes did anymore in european countries and the fact that you had this at that time massive number of small holding uh farmers. I mean you had what before the turn of the century something like 90 of american uh involved in some sort of agriculture. Uh that was just a it ensured that when we got a like a popular uh common party it did not have the in uh the internal coherence of a labour party like you saw in europe and the fact we already had these parties that were set up. We had the democratic and republican parties already extant because america democratized formally much earlier than europe because there was the land to give away there was the venting the venting steam. Uh valve of western expansion meant that you could have by the 1830s at a time when europe was completely gripped in the fist of reaction. Even the the the franchise in england is is is not uh terribly extended uh during that period. In america. The uh most states had like a real popular suffrage and that was because of the uh the existence of uh property as a uh arbitrator of social uh conflict. The european part the european uh polities the european. Uh monarchies couldn't be given money they couldn't give land away. There was no land to give away. The land was all spoken for by the  maybe.


I should just do benjamin butler like a whole like a like a whole episode about him the way I did about willach but maybe that's going back to the civil war uh well too many times so maybe there's too many canadians. In here we got people talking about tommy douglas and louis real get out of here. I haven't read butler's book yet. I think I kind of want to wait until I've read his whole biography autobiography uh um. So I might wait and do that one relatively recently. But I think. I want to do a different one today or to for tomorrow um.

Uh the german revolution that's an interesting one. That's another real uh. I don't know. I would I kind of think about maybe doing uh doing something that's like sort of broadly about uh that whole interwar period where where the russians try to do their revolution with the premise in mind that it would lead to a continent-wide revolution. That's why they did it ever. No one thought that uh russia could sustain itself in a socialist economy absent the intervention of western capital in the form of uh in the form of help. From these uh new. Uh european communist states that were going to emerge and then you saw this failure to ignite across europe and it's not just germany. There's a soviet that briefly takes power in hungary. Uh there's a battle between freikorps and bolsheviks across the uh. In the baltic.

There's a bloody civil war in finland uh which sees of the pro-bolshevik side interned and massacred and then there's uh strikes and uprisings in france and england and then after that initial and then of course. The russians tried to uh invade poland and then once that initial wave subsides you see the birth of fascism as like a political challenge to this new uh force on the continent and then you see uh in countries that are like at the periphery like spain where uh where industrialization has has been. The least employ uh implemented which is one of the big reasons that anarchism was such a defined tendency in the spanish civil war is because you were dealing with very close to uh to medieval conditions of peasantry in the countrysides places like catalonia and they were they were not interested in the sort of uh social um uh rationalization process of being turned into proletarians that uh that the more coherent working class of like madrid uh and like the railroad workers and stuff uh were were moving towards. But then you see this war as part of this battle for power between uh these regimes uh and it really is. It's it's a series of defeats.

It's a series of of defeats at every point uh even world war. Ii is essentially a defeat because the conditions that uh stalin accepts uh. At the end of that war are the conditions of the eventual defeat of the soviet union uh and I think that maybe people didn't know that at the time but I think that stalin even uh if he'd known that would have said would have taken the deal because uh the alternative would have been a conflict with the capitalist world that he was not. He didn't have the wherewithal or ability or will to carry out because then you have the the cold war which is really a resource war over access to the the colonial underbellies of the western powers which are now having to uh be turned over to native political formations and native political economies and where what what uh network what global system would they be uh connected into and the the system that that the the soviets uh signed off on with bretton woods and the u.n and everything uh. It essentially assumed it guaranteed that over time uh the capitalist west would would strangle uh the communist world which is exactly what happened. Uh the only thing that could have changed that dynamic was the the uh the challenge the battle for resources which was definitively won by the west and that's why we're living in a world where we're capital one where where we are uh having to to to grapple with that and if capital one and the common ruin is is the likely outcome.


Then what do we try to do with our lives. How do we how do we live with that reality without the fantasy of a uh of a deliverance you know and of course. That is not to say that we're doomed the human race or us as individuals. It means that we are going to have to focus. I think on building durable structures to resist uh the the decline that's coming I feel. Like this is a period of decadence and and inherent decline that can't be resolved from within capital one because no one in the socialist camp believed in the system by the 70s. That's correct and uh the reason for that is because the project that they built was not it required. It required a advanced revolution that never happened the project. The the bootstrap idea okay it failed. Europe did not kick off now what do we do the answer of well. We're going to compete with europe and we're going to do capitalist uh uh like capital accumulation. The way that capitalism does it in this underdeveloped  feudal backwater. It was viable in that it created a state and it created a state capacity but the state it created was unable to pro to successfully prosecute the global war against capitalism that was its raison debt. It couldn't do it. It could not fight it effectively and the fact of that the proof of that is the fail.

It's failure and it wasn't anybody's fault uh that I think every I think the bolsheviks were correct in their understanding of the situation. In 18 1917 that there had to be a war or that there had to be a uh a a seizure power or else. There would be the uh reactionary counter-evolution. They were correct about that and they were the only force capable at that moment of carrying off the uh seizure but that was because they thought doing that would spark a global revolution. That was the trot. That's the notion. The trotsky promulgated that allowed them to revise marxism the way that they did which is always funny when you hear people talk about revisionism with acid in their mouth. Uh bolshevism was revisionism because they were in russia and who wants to be told you got to sit on your thumbs and they were right that there was not enough uh middle class to stand up to take power in 1917. But then the question is well. Then why is a revolution worth pursuing in that condition if it means that it will create a situation of general general general war and they have good reason to believe that was going to happen but then it didn't I did not. I've not listened to the wtf with hunter biden that sounds fun.

Though he smoked parmesan cheese. I I didn't know parmesan looked like I've never done crack so. I don't know what crack looks like. I'd only seen it in new jack city. I shan't go on crap. No thank you apparently. It's popping off in belfast again.

Uh real 70s hours. We'll see what happens the taiping rebellion might be interesting. The taiping rebellion might be interesting because it is very under. It's something. That's very under uh known about considering how massive it it was. They estimated something like 30 million people died. It was in the middle of the but it happened the same time the us civil war was happening. So uh we all forget uh about it. It was happening during one of the opium wars which also is just not remembered at all. It is amazing that it's about a guy. The whole thing was a guy who failed his sats and went nutso a failed pmc basically who led a peasant revolt that uh organized itself around uh all the the uh discontent among the landless hakka peasantry who uh made up the sort of uh rural proletariat or proto-proletariat of china and then ended up being the the bulk of the army that made up the communist party when they took power favorite.

Pokemon is uh as geodude because of the tweet about geodude being real and being as strong and being obama's friend which I always thought was funny geodudes rock. Indeed we kind of did watergate on the uh on the g on the hw episode. I don't really think I have that much to add to it. It is a fascinating story though partially because of how quaint it all is is q dead that's an interesting question it's interesting. I think that we can say at least. I think it seems pretty clear that it looks like it's splintering uh.

It looks like you as as you'd imagine. It's it's going into factions. I don't. I don't think people are going back to normal because that's not an option anymore. But I think people are going to be finding their own. Their own sects their own discreet uh reality versions because we are getting to the point where our escape valve into cyberspace is losing its uh power on us as we have to keep cranking up our own emotional reaction in relation to it. We have to deepen the story that we're telling ourselves when we go online and that means we're going to have to start finding deeper and deeper. Uh parallel realities to create so like real real mind palace. Because you know obviously reality is always made up. Reality is is constructed by the the shared delusion of of the citizenry like the the delusions that we all uh uh perpetuate by virtue of uh their hegemony in our lives and they we operate from those principles without even thinking about it. Uh but that one big delusion we've been telling ourselves is breaking down and what's filling the space is these uh tailor-made. Uh just bespoke delusions that can be shared with much smaller groups of people than the larger hegemonic truths and or delusional truths we used to operate by so that means that people say what's happening with cults why aren't cults coming back. I mean we're all kind of living in cults. It's just.


They're soft virtual cults. I mean cults involve people living together cults involve sociality. They involve people buying homes and living in them together that's the opposite of the life style of the atomized uh mediated digital american. So now all the cults are. Uh are relationships of virtual reality that we sustain through engagement with the internet. See a media fandom has replaced cults are we occult. I mean I would say that uh that we've are in that middle area between occult and uh what in the past would have been one's relationship to the media. One consumes like we could people consume media now in a way that is more emotionally textured and and they they share a uh a imaginative communion with others who uh like similar media in a way that is between cults and the old way that people used to consume media.

I will say that but it's just that the word is less operative because everything is less social. Everything is less social. We have just less sociality in our existences and and we're filling that hole with virtual. Uh existence and virtual politics virtual identity and then we just spend our days doing the same stuff. Our actual actions are don't are not comporting to the mind realm. We're in like people want to talk about how we've never been more divided and  and how there's this partisan conflict it is yes. But it's amazing with that being true how relatively uh uncoordinated and uh ritualized. Political violence in this country is and that's because that's just the very end of a process. The vast majority of people are not that activated and even the ones who are that activated are mostly activated to simulate so uh uh political violence. The majority of us are happy to virtually engage in like a political uh um sorting and and ritualized you know uh disavowal uh and upholding. But in our day-to-day lives. We just do the same stuff we ever would have done.

We're just consuming we're just in rats and a maze man and what I mean by that is our. We can have these deeply felt political involvements and uh fandoms. But they do not move beyond that uh that retail consumer level and so terms like you know fascism and cults and all this. They still have a hold of our imaginations and we still see people carrying out acts using the the uh the the vocabulary and the the symbolism but all of that has been emptied of actual meaning actual. Uh consequent meaning like consequence to to the the way things are gonna. Go the way things are going to go is uh just continued techno-feudal declension. That's the only way they can go. There is no building up social conflict. There is only a continued uh abstraction away from people of their ability to reproduce themselves like americans have been disarmed in the sense that they cannot live except at the sufferance of a global supply chain that they have no power over. I went to somebody's asking if I ever went to a milwaukee admirals game. I went to one milwaukee admirals game in my life. I think it was with my cub scout troop.

That was I was very excited to go uh because I lived like an hour north of there in a smaller town and I was just absolutely fascinated by tall buildings. I went and just seeing the absolutely uh the towering skyscrapers of the of milwaukee. I was completely transfixed. Apparently. A new particle has dropped there's a new particle that is being acted on in ways that cannot be perceived. I'm very intrigued by these ideas lately about about you know the reality of quantum space. I don't want to get too into it because I don't know anything. But it does seem to me that there's there's a real open question about the degree to which uh consciousness is a like manifested force or can. Manifest force the world like the consciousness is an acting independent force on the world not of course in a dualistic sense just in the sense that uh. I don't know there's a lot of tiny little particles out. There you know your brain's made out of them. Your brain is made out of tiny little particles and every decision you make is. This is these transmission across time this. These these signals going and and and uh going into points of like subsonic space. I don't know this is all weed talk I don't know anything about this. I would always all I know about that stuff is that I know enough about it to know that there is uh no reason to believe that there uh that a mechanistic construction of the universe even if it could be done would actually explain anything.

I didn't watch the q a on documentary. I don't know if I will it's about six hours. I maybe would like to watch a compilation of the stuff about the watkins is because apparently they're really uh. They're a pair of real jokers just fascinating uh american grotesques. I mean part of it is. I don't really care who q is. I don't think it matters because it's pretty clear. The queue is a social phenomenon and at that point whatever created it is almost beside the point. It's. It's like you're constantly in an improv game and people are shouting out prompts and something. Lands and q is what landed whether it was uh a fourteenth pervert or a bunch of anonymous posters or uh.

Or it was the government which I know a lot of people believe that it was as a intelligence operation. It was a psyop the way it spread seemed to me to be pretty organic which is the important thing and what makes it organically. Transmittable. Is is the is how primed people are for it of how much people want something to do for their brain. They want something to make sense of the world around them and uh because our only options to exert any control of our lives involve going online. Uh.


That's where the more inquisitive us of of inquisitive of us the most restlessly minded of us. That's where we're gonna look for it and we're all gonna see. I mean we're only ever gonna. See our reflections. We're only ever gonna see because we are isolated. We're not under. We're not doing a class project of of realizing through action shared goals shared uh humanity uh shared interests. We are only operating through the individual filter of a consumer and so when we go online to find out what's going on uh. We're only we're only looking for a validation of what we already thought which is what q is q is the native uh american uh uh rejection of uh the world as it exists that cannot be articulated through any kind of leftist uh lens because america defeats that at every turn by the reality of life in this country by the the defeat of class uh awareness of of the way that america makes it impossible to live or even to know you could live as a worker as opposed to as an individual. I'm I'm working on a project right. Now that's dealing with the uh the anti-masons of the 1820s and 30s and that is a perfect exemplar of this phenomenon. You had in western new york.

The burned over district where the third great awakening is happening and people are coming to terms with how to be a christian in a fallen world of commerce where even uh yeomanry is sort of being cut off as an option or the the upper dreams of yeoman rear being foreclosed by the reality of land speculation and finance but where the the democ democratic explanation that is uh popular in the south and uh amongst the the working people in in the cities uh blaming it on banks is not an option because western new york. Only their entire economic engine is based on the erie canal which is the the first internal improvement. The defining internal improvement that uh that federalists and then uh national republicans and wigs would try to pursue uh in the face of democratic opposition for the entire uh antebellum period. So uh these people were not going to be democrats. They weren't going to be able to explain what was wrong by blaming the banks because they and and internal improvements because their livelihoods depended on those things.

So what's whose fault is it and the answer they got was the the  masons a group within a group a a secret favor seeking group and within power and of course you know the inciting incident that led to it was an actual murder of a former mason who was going to write a book about their uh secrets and whose death led to a bunch of masonic uh political figures and uh law enforcement types just going ah. It's not a big deal. Actually you know what he kind of had a comic and absent any way of like articulating a class critique. At that point uh. Those masons stood in for the reality which is that this system is not for your benefit. This system doesn't exist for you the deeper truth about uh about this democracy that these people lived in but which they were fully devoted to. It was the only way they could articulate their distaste and that's been how historically we have expressed our our de-politicized or rather declassified uh alienation with uh the fruits of american democracy which we punitively signed up for this is the country we built. This is the greatest country in the world. This is the country that has our institutions and has built our our liberties and is and we are invested in and yet act. And yet it is a country that I did not recognize how do you explain it. The answer is is that the people who appear to be on your side aren't and of course that's correct that is correct they are not on your side.

They are on the side of of yes of malach. They're on the side of mammoth. They're the side of the devil in the form of a algorithm of prophet extraction that does not care about any human feeling and these are a dark priesthood but because we don't have an articulation of class. It gets buried at the level of symbol any other ideas for the animated past. I'm still not sure which one. I'm going to do battle of blair mountain might be fun or I might just do benjamin butler. I don't know um but I think it's interesting that uh anna masonry has a uh through line in the figure of millard fillmore from animasonry which begins as a fusion of a grassroots that is alienated from power and uh wants an explanation for why they don't have it and a class of political entrepreneurs entrepreneurs hustlers who wanted a way to challenge jacksonian democracy uh in a way that would be appealing to regular people and used anti-masonry as a coverage for that uh and then once and masonry did its job. It was discarded for the creation of the wig party and then uh after the wigs broke up it became the base.

Uh millard fillmore who started off as a anti-mason became awake then after the war after the collapse of the whigs he ran uh for president as the know-nothing candidate the nativist candidate. Because once the wigs broke up once again there was a question how to get people to oppose democracy in the north without becoming sectional without challenging slavery and the answer was uh irish catholics and of course. The irony here is that the know-nothings are called that because they started as a secret society called the order of the star-spangled banner that you had and you had to pledge your secrecy to them and you had secret handshakes and  just like the masons. But there's another strain there because another figure who started off uh as a note as a anti-mason and then became a wig. Uh was thaddeus stevens who then moved to the republicans not to do the no-nothings who who decided that he wanted to be a sectional figure and a uh someone who confronted slavery uh at its heart and then he uh became the face of like a radical redistributivist republican party.

That's stuff where uh kamal harris is like we're going to be going to war for water. That's pretty funny just like I guess just letting everyone know. It's like hey hey y'all just so everyone has a heads up. We're going to be going to war for water. Why would you if you're a politician. Why would you say that it's just wild. It's like okay. Hey war boys get ready.


I'm gonna get shiny and chrome. She is uh. She is a fascinating figure in a way. I mean she's just such a blank. She's so uh yeah her capacity to just like laugh at all. The most inappropriate moments uh it's very interesting. It's weird like she's not a politician like obama you know who whose gift is keying in to what people want to hear and to present a facade of humanity and then you got biden whose whole deal is being like a bluff hearty fake irish uncle. Uh she just goes out in public with zero a human affect uh yeah like a more of a mitt romney figure. A figure who who who wears their inhumanity proudly and I guess you could say that that's that makes sense that she's the figure who will take power after biden is like as uh as the the masks fall from from capital and as our political figures lose the requirement to perform humanity in order to be uh to be able to claim power because our our influence in the process becomes less and less you get. These people take power who are barely able to contain their contempt for the obligations of the rituals of behaving like a human being real lizard hours. I remember that time when uh they after she became vp or after she endorsed biden and they asked her of course the classic gotcha. Uh what about all these horrible things you said about him at the debate including that he's like racist and that he personally is responsible for her uh being like otherized while being bussed as a young student in california and she just goes. It's a debate and just starts laughing now.

I get that's the correct answer. It's a debate. This doesn't matter but I don't know if I can think of anybody else who would have responded with that who would have just been that dismisses of even the pretense that they had to uh act like there was a consistency there and that's why she's not nobody likes her. But that's also why there is decay hive because she speaks to people who are similarly sick of pretending to be humans. I've seen some people like uh kamala in the real world. I've heard tell of real kamala fans uh.

I saw a sign on a fan very fat very big very uh expensive house that said uh congratulations vice president elect michelle obama uh michelle uh uh kamala harris didn't need to say biden. Harris said congratulations vice president-elect kamal harris and then uh after the inaugural they got rid of the elect and it just said uh congratulations president vice president kamala harris so there are people who love her and I think that they are wealthier people uh. I think people who work in uh some sort of supervisory capacity uh and who have a real identification with being a girl boss and also straining to hold back their frustration with their underlings. It'd be very funny though she never gets to be president because biden serves two terms he's in a  suit. He said he wears like a big mech suit but it's shaped like a 57 cadillac with like the  come on man. I do wonder about joe though. I wonder how joan's doing he seems like he's uh.

They're letting him out of the out of the kennel which is kind of interesting because it doesn't seem like he's doing too well. But I honestly feel like they feel. I feel more than anything that they are confident that the media is so in the bag for them so terrified by trump and so in so dedicated to like breaking. America's uh uh addiction to trump that we're uh that they're willing to overlook anything and they figure. If nobody talks about it except the right. It'll get yeah. It'll be it'll turn into actually. It's ableist racism to say that uh that trump's brain is melting or that biden's brain's melting somebody asked will. There be another two-term president that's actually an interesting question uh if there's sufficient I mean it really depends on. It depends on if we get any more real uh like recession depression situations again or if they just keep liquefying the economy until the whole thing falls apart like dissolves into into like constituent corporate entities but yeah if there's significant economic volatility in the near term. I could see it just being a revolving door just getting mad and then kicking off the guy and bringing in the next one oh man.

I have to say I have not been paying too much attention to england of course because it's a united hell realm but it is positively darkly satisfying to watch the kyrstermer labor party eat. Like the clumps in it all over the uh the vaccine or all over the uh the coronavirus response and it shows that they're always wrong doesn't it. I mean what the entire yeah the entire uh rest refrain during uh. Corbyn was a competent labor leader by which they met a guy who uh was going to force wear socialism would be up 20 points and now they got their guy. They got their their their face. Their neo blair right little boy their their the little  and is willing to uh accept the reality of austerity and the reality of of uh of capitalism and he's just eating.


It's wow and I'm sure that there uh there are plenty of reasons. These guys have pulled out of their ass that this doesn't totally refutiate their entire political project. But we all know the real reason which is that they don't care that he's found that much it never mattered if he won. It just mattered that corbin didn't win like they don't actually give a. They never cared. It didn't matter if they believed that he would that a more moderate labor would have been more competitive. They just didn't want bernie to win or corbin to win and they made it happen and now they get to churn around and explain this.

While they continue to eat. It would be funny if uh if the uk breaks up. Though that's the hope is. That is that you don't have a united kingdom in 10 years be funny if the uk breaks up. But uh australia does still refuses to get rid of the queen. They just love having a queen so much the queen of england in australia look. We love it we love having a queen. She's bloody great bloody queen. She's a pisser. I did get the vaccine. I got uh the johnson. Johnson one shot so we'll see if I if my brain explodes. We'll see if I start taking orders from the u.n yeah.

I'm gonna. I'm gonna look like uh bart simpson after he drank the low calorie soda pleasant taste some monsterism. I got. I'm sure. I got. I'm filled with. I'm filled with uh with ground up uh bill gates foreskin. I'm sure. I haven't really had any side effects. It kind of makes me wonder if I got a placebo feeling pretty normal. I think. I have webbed feet though that's one thing that's happened so that's pretty cool. No.

I will not be showing you. The english civil war is not is pretty interesting. It is really where like capitalism starts developing its own coherent uh like political manifestation like capitalism and puritanism are really linked crucially because uh they're both about dissolving uh royal authority over the spirit and over the uh economy and you have even though this is you know very early uh merchant capitalism and very little in the way of any kind of manufacturing you already have uh the forces emerged that are gonna end up competing for uh power as capitalism develops more uh uh coherently and you have guys like gerard winstanley who articulates. Marx's theory of social conflict 200 years before him. In a religious context he writes a book he writes a pamphlet where he says that the source of conflict the source of warfare between men the social source of social strife is class. It is cond it is of course they mean by that at that point you know lords and serfs and such but uh. It's it's the it's the premise of of the communist manifesto right there. And I think you really could say that 1688 the glorious revolution which sort of caps the whole period of conflict between uh parliament merchant capital uh and calvinist protestantism on the one hand and uh royal authority landed gentry uh anglicanism and more formal like hierarchical christianity on the other. Uh you know it erupts in the civil war. They cut the head of the king off uh. Cromwell tries to impose a a parliamentary order. I mean I think he really did uh and it uh failed because the uh social formations to uh uh to generate it didn't exist. They were insufficient yet and so he ended up having to just assume all power to himself in in a royal figure. The way that hobbs that predicted what happened and then uh it led to the bringing back of the stewarts but only on conditions uh of a liberalization of the economy and of religious uh oversight and which is why and I and a liberalization of uh of political rights. It's really a 50-year uh uh contest that ends with a uh a treaty. It's essentially like a westphalia style treaty for uh for english political economy. You we're going to keep a king but he's going to be a protestant and the parliament will have real authority even if final authority will be arrested in the king. I think I might be. I think now.
