Um making money spend all my money making time take it to the limit take it to the limit take it to the limit. One more time show me a sign take it to limit one more time okay. It's going good. I don't have my computer right now so I would go by faith that I'm broadcasting. I'm having mineral water right. Now. It's very good all right first of all thank you to everybody who has said log off to me when I posted today this week. But you can stop. I mean if you want to keep doing it as a bit. That's fine don't do it when I'm replying to someone because it's someone else's mentions and they don't need them clogged. I said that at the time because I needed to take like you know what I felt was radical action to to refocus myself. But I've spent enough time this week really applying that reasoning to the project to the point where if I post a couple times a day that's fine okay and I have not been posting more than like twice a day and I've been spending maybe an hour daily on twitter which is a huge difference from my genu.

My regular diet of online and since I have to do online to a degree for the show. I'm not gonna totally log off. So. It's about finding a balance I i no it's not a slippery slope. See that's the thing the slippery slope thing that's when you aren't self-motivated. That's when you're that's when you're like slapping nick Nicorette patches on to avoid smoking in fact like making extreme demands of yourself. Like that is a sign that you don't have a healthy relationship with the thing in question I i feel like I have a healthier relationship and therefore I'm fine so if you see me posting a ton that's not great. But I don't think that will happen so just basically so that like. I can reply to a friend of mine and not have to worry that 15 people are going to be in their mentions saying log off which is just going to annoy them. I want to be able to talk to people who I do have like actual relationships with even if they're digital if it contradicts what I said last time well.

I celebrate myself and I sing myself. I contain multitudes so but thank you for your concern progress. I assure you is being made and I'm very excited about it. But I'm not just writing the book all day that would be insane. I have other things to do. I have actually a number of projects now that are all erupting at once. So the progress is being made. So this is the first of what will now hopefully be a weekly friday vibe stream where I will interact with chat talk about stuff. I've talked to chris about maybe having guests if he can help me with that including him like talking to chris and I love talking to chris so that'll be try to do that every friday and now starting next wednesday will be another stream about a book.

I have said black reconstruction but I've thought about it. I really think like considering where I started with the the white book. I think really the most the thing that makes sense next in terms of like reducing. would be the phoner reconstruction book so eric foner's reconstruction. The unfinished american revolution. we're gonna. I'll talk about the first chapter since it's only it's friday and that'll be next wednesday already talk about the first chapter of phoner's boner not boner. I'm sure he got that a lot growing up eric bone bones reconstruction. So we'll do the I'm not gonna. I'll blew that I think we'll do black reconstruction. After this one. I am doing a racism. I'm doing an imperialism. But the thing about fonder's book is that it covers a longer period of time and it is more It's it's just got a broader sweep and like I feel like you go from white which is the whole gilded age from the end of the civil war until the election in mckinley. Then you do fauner which is the whole of like reconstruction from an academic perspective and then you do do du boises black reconstruction that feels like that makes sense to me as like a a vector for acquiring like the correct historical framework for for building out from there and then after that we'll see. Those are gonna be the next three or the next two starting with first chapter of phoner. On wednesday you don't have to have read it obviously. I'm not just gonna talk about what's in there. It'll be a jumping off point but that'll be that and then that's gonna be the two. That's it though.

We're not. I'm gonna try not to do any other ones if something really gets me. I'll write it down. I'm not gonna not. Gonna just come on here to yell about it. I will post after this. I'll post a tweet saying what next week's book club will be please. Don't respond log off to that. So what are you guys up to what's going on with you hep cats and kittens. Someone's asking have.

I seen babylon berlin. It's very much up my alley. I should watch it at some point. I haven't seen it yet though let me get because I mean if I'm mr counterfactual now. If I'm looking backward now in this period of stasis for me anyway you know politically you want to talk lincoln assassination. Another the other big one really that comes to mind immediately after that is the on the failed german revolution so that'll be. I should take a look at it oh man. I've not seen the stand remake it. I've seen some clips from some people who've watched it. I've noticed no one's talking about it. It looks absolutely terrible I mean and it's not like the 94 one's that good. But it makes the 94 one look like the kubrick shine. It basically makes this this stand makes the 94 that this stand is to the stephen weber um cable shining as the 94 stand is to kubrick shining yes.

Lex g is really where I've been finding out. Don't don't bother the poor man but that he's my favorite he will not he will not allow you to to to follow him anyway. He's locked but it looks absolutely terrible and it really does. It does make it hard not to feel like mass mark mass market entertainment is getting worse and I know that that is a thing that people resist saying because it makes you sound like an old man yelling at a cloud and there is always an emotional element to that that is reducible really to just you know. Things are better when you're younger than when you're older when it comes to culture and a bunch of other stuff but man just like everything about it. Just seems so inert and that's too bad because I love the stand. I mean that. I read I read when I was a kid. I read the like the thousand page version with all the stuff that got cut out of the original release that obviously probably should have been cut when like king was at. His most gacked when he was mr. Yayo and just writing 10 000 words a day but man the new one looks bad. I'm hearing that the trash can man played by ezra.

Miller is thermonuclearly terrible so why is toppo chico bad for you. It's mineral water. What are you talking about why what are you. What are you people trying to do for me. What are you trying to do to me. What's in. Here there's calcium is that bad so what's wrong with this. Kidney stones I'll be fine now. I'm trying to cut back on on booze in general.

 dr sleep was a very not a good book and a worse movie and it's it's very funny because it so clearly exists for spite because the whole reason that stephen king hated kubrick shining is because jack torrance was him and kubrick's version of jack torrance is not redeemable. He's not. He's not a man who had some weakness and slipped when and and you know gave into his worst instincts. He is he was a he was a vessel for evil and so it's not surprising at all. That king hated that because it was essentially a two-hour long a dissection of his darkest impulses and an essentialization of them and that's fine what that's it's. It's to be expected. But his his 30-year long attempt to essentially erase the kubrick movie from existence first by making that awful tnt version and then doing the terrible sequel which was then made into a somehow worse movie. Although I have to say it's very funny to me that he wrote the book to help expregate the movie from existence and reaffirm the privacy of the original novel and as a result dr sleep is a sequel to the book not the movie and so that means that dick halloran didn't die and also the overlook blew up and so at the end of the movie when they when the other the book doctor sleep. When they go to the overlook. It's just a big field. But the movie is a sequel to shining the movie and it when they go back to overlook. It's still there. That's That's very ironic did.

I not send a a a twit. A tweet a twit a tweet about the stream. I thought I did. I don't have my computer. I can't leave this. I thought I sent us. I'm sorry. I don't have my twit my my computer right now is down. I did okay good oh man the shining sequence in ready player.

One spielberg is a demon. I mean he's incredibly talented but he is a demon allegedly contrasting him with cameron. I think really shows you that like spielberg is is terrifyingly narcissistic and everything that he does comes from that. I kind of honestly sometimes think that his most autobiographical movie aren't any of the ones about divorce and the suburbs. It's temple of doom. When you can think about who he pals around with and in hollywood who else it makes up the dreamworks team. It makes you think that like that was actually the movie about his life. The the for the idea that women are to keep around as arm candy but they're not there to have any kind of emotional relationship with real. Real time is with the bros including the small the small friends and sometimes that fun involves maybe in temple underground where you do fun things and you chill out with your dudes and your bros and how the mark of sophistication is the willingness to eat things and perform rights for example that maybe normal people would find horrifying allegedly. I'm just saying silver gives me the creeps as a person. He's very talented and it's interesting contrasting him with cameron who probably is a bigger jerk to work with than spielberg but clearly is not part of the part of the demonic set in hollywood. I'm not against hanging out with the boys. But you know you need a you need an integrated self and I don't think you ever got one of those. I think spielberg is very talented. I spielberg is able to to create investment in characters visually which is very difficult. He's able to make you identify with the character and then create stakes for that character's actions that compel you to keep watching just just with depictions of them which is a tough thing to do oh yeah. The lincoln movie I loved the lincoln movie when I saw it.

I gave it like four and a half stars on letterbox if anyone wants to go back and look at it. The politics of it are genuinely terrible. I mean like all the spielberg's politics overt politics as opposed to the meta-politics that he's dealing with the The actual um overt politics of spielberg's movies and this is one of the things that makes you know that he is you know a hollow man is is this sort of the sort of soulless liberalism that it's horrifying to imagine somebody investing that much energy in depicting because it's so just the background radiation of life. Why would you feel the need to do that why would you feel the need to assert in this culture. The need that that like compromise is the most important thing. It's like what the especially since the context doesn't even make sense 

Abraham lincoln was not compromising with anybody. They were. They were burning and destroying half of the goddamn country in the middle of all those debates about the 13th amendment and you're supposed to side with lincoln over stevens when they're discussing plans for the south and stevens is talking about d just explorating the entire planter class and redistributing their Their land and lincoln's like oh you do fall as if what we got instead is so manifestly better than that would have been but honestly. I feel like the real slander if there is one is that I don't think lincoln. I think lincoln was would have pursued a course closer to what stevens was proposing than to what we got from johnson which is one of the reasons. I want to really explore the concept of a counterfactual non-assassinated lincoln reconstruction but the thing that makes that movie good is one. The actual storytelling visually is compelling like when when they're doing the vote on the 13th amendment and then the bells chime. It's it's I teared up and of course the performances are amazing and yeah. Daniel day-lewis is the definitive lincoln and those those elements are all great. But they're in the service of this soulless entity and that's the spiel.

That's the thing with spielberg is it. There is a hole there there is a big gaping hole and the more he the more he's able to hide it. The more he's able to alight it. The the more sort of purely pleasurable. His movies are like jaws but where he like reflects it like lincoln like like his more overtly political movies that he's done recently like the post and stuff you see that hole and it's like. It's a little creepy. Jaws isn't soulless of course. Jaws isn't soulless because he's not showing you his hole. He's not he's not putting a flashlight in his hole and you could thank carl gottlieb and and dreyfus. Like these are collaborative processes. It's not just the director wow like spiel et's jurassic park fantastic. I gotta re-watch close encounters. It's been a long time.

I don't think lincoln was gay. He probably did gay was pretty common among his class and time really because one thing to remember is that guys didn't get. Guys got guys in like the aspiring classes in the 19th century got married late. They did not get married in their early 20s. They got married often in their 30s what where the hell were they doing during the height of their their like essential drive. They were probably doing you know. Obviously there was a lot of prostitution but also there was some pro time. But I don't think that he was like. I think I think he he I think it was more fluid in general like talking about gayness before like the modern era is kind of a misapplication of terms anyway buchanan. I think was like exclusively for the dudes. Buchanan was a guy who you would because the got his the big reason for that the big reason. I think that is because of his close intimate friendship with another politician of the year. Another doe face named who was briefly vice president. Although he died before he could get sworn in of malaria. I believe in cuba william rufus devane king who was known in washington for his flamboyant attire and affect and I believe andrew. Jackson called the two of them aunt fanny and miss nancy or something like that.

I can't remember I gotta re-watch the abyss. That's the cameron movie I've probably least familiar with. I saw it as a kid and I don't think I've re-watched it in a long time pence got fired. Got pence got hired by the um. Someone says pence got hired by the um heritage foundation. He's also probably he's. I heard he was doing a podcast which is probably from the heritage foundation which is very funny because at first you think this guy is a charisma zero why would anyone listen to that. But he actually got his start after a failed political bid in talk radio which is kind of amazing and it really does tell you how indiana. It really is the blandest place on earth that mike pence was like the rush limbaugh of indiana but I i but he had to go to the heritage foundation because I can't think of a less popular politician right now in amer in america than mike pence.

Not necessarily like he's the most hated like emotion like there's a lot of emotional investment by it but clearly any of the real trump people don't like him. They feel like he did show himself to be a as trump told said to him and then he's still too creepy and and socially conservative like overtly socially conservative for to become a resistance. Hero like. I joked that he was like a leader for he's more likely to be the democratic nominee for president than a republican nominee for president and I mean obviously. I think at this point. Democrats like him more than republicans but they still don't really like him. He's still creepy he's still good so. I can't think of anybody with less of a political future which is kind of amazing because you'd assume that you know the vice president is is well positioned but I think we've seen the last of him. Obviously. There's no way of knowing but I think we might have seen the last of him in elected office. He's just going to shrivel into a little prune in his little heritage department sinicure.

The idea of trump at a think tank would be pretty funny as long as they gave him a twitter account. They might. I'm wondering if they're going to give him back. His twitter account at some point because he was just such a big draw but honestly the longer he's away the more relevant he feels doesn't it feel obviously. This is all subjective but doesn't it feel just like oh. We really did kind of conjure him into being and like we made him the over ruling like mind in the country because we needed him and then as soon as the tensions that he provoked became unsustainable. Shy of an actual military confrontation that none of us are ready for we've just collectively like popped him and sent him off like like witches of eastwick. We'll see though we'll see yeah. It's like he's a topo we created like on an acid trip and now it's like we're eating orange slices and he's just fading into the into nothing any movies.

I'm excited for this year. all the big ones. I I am interested somebody asked about that the fred hampton movie. I don't think it's going to be good or anything. But I am interested in seeing it. It'll be an interesting document of the time. I mean I think it'll be honestly very interesting even if it's terrible you know how how we're thinking about stuff like the black panthers in the current moment when you know like the black struggle movement has re-emerged as sort of the synoquinon with the left. But it's also at the same time being co-opted into like a justification for neoliberalism.

Like those three things are happening at the same time and that's that's why the argument about that is stupid because they're both happening. It depends on which end of the thing you're looking which side of the kaleidoscope you're looking through and apparently it's got squibs so. I will see it also. I'm a chump king kong versus godzilla. I'm sorry. I don't care. I don't even care that's gonna be on a small screen. They're fighting looks cool I liked. I'll admit that I liked the dower grimdark godzilla from 2014 that a lot of people hate just because they don't give you a lot of godzilla and I think that is rare in blockbuster filmmaking. Now and I like kong skull island. So we'll go and of course who of course number one with a bullet. Although we'll see if they delay it again if movie theaters are back by the fall ghostbusters afterlife so that I can in fact gaze into the abyss that is muncher. I must see the muncher with my own eyes.

I must look into the mirror myself and see that the the the joyless subject whose only desire is consumption but for whom consumption is misery dune. I gotta say I did not like the trailer. I've gotten over a villain to wave at this point and it's just why is everything got to be all. Why can't why isn't there any color anymore. It's like. I saw like a grandpa but like not everything where's the color. I will see that though. I saw buck boy. I did not like it.

I gotta say. I I got what it was going for. I think but it didn't really hit me yes I've heard about the the creation of new detroit in nevada how there's gonna be actual corporate company towns. I mean that's that's the trajectory we're on. It was going to happen at some point and now it's just happening. I mean that's really a lot so much of the anxiety of the moment is that that we all knew one way or another was coming and knew would be bad. When it got here is happening and we have no way. We can't imagine a way to stop it or change the trajectory of course. It's freaking us out and yeah. I mean this is just the next step of a process that's already happening in most of our big cities especially any of the ones that have a lot of tech money in them. I mean detroit itself literally already is new detroit. Downtown detroit has been a private fiefdom of dan gilbert's quicken loans. I think for years now they have they run their own. They run this the security they run the infrastructure no dan. Gilbert is cleveland. He's from cleveland and he owns the browns but but he also owns the middle of downtown detroit. I did not make that up it's not no. It's it's detroit. I love being incorrectly corrected.

It's adorable. I love how detroit is. The is the center of A pizza chains the hometown of little caesars and dominoes. I believe like the owners of both of those have swapped off ownership of the different sports teams over the years too. And I love the fact that monahan the guy who founded domino's is like a opus dei psycho catholic who founded his own catholic planned community and college in florida called ave maria and you'd be you'd think that there'd be more of awareness that detroit has its own pizza style especially since pizza hut ironically the one that's not from detroit has sort of as its baseline pizza one that's most reminiscent of a detroit style pizza. I will I don't know if I've said this on the stream before but when I was a kid in a small like a 30 000 person town in wisconsin like an hour away from milwaukee like not not a suburb like like a little like a a medium-sized town. pizza hut in like the 80s and 90s. That was the nicest restaurant.

 . I went to as a kid and not because we were poor. We were like you know decently middle class in income. It's because that's all that's that was there weren't nice restaurants in in in like large parts of this country back then so the things that I associated high fine dining with like low lighting at banquettes. the pebbled glass or pebbled plastic cups that kind of looked like they were glass and of course the buffet. Those were. All those were all from um from pizza hut. I think though that that I think that that type of fancy dining is no longer. I mean I think that kind of decor is not no longer what people think of when they think of like nice restaurant. I think now now it's lighter. It's like brighter that was like kind of a mid-century thing like you watched. Mad men. Everybody is you know smoking cigarettes and the other nice kind of nice place we had just because it was dark was we had a the closest thing to a restaurant. We had was a place called friar tux and I think there were like maybe one or two other locations in the area. But it might have been the only one and it was it looked outside. It looked like a fake little medieval building and it had very narrow sort of arrow slit windows and the waitresses all wore very very short. monk frocks with like a cord belts and they made real and they sold burgers and stuff.

People are talking about stop getting kicked off letterbox. I have to say i. I got on letterbox a while ago. I enjoyed it. I'm still on there. I you know I basically if I remember to if I remember to put one in. I will post one like I'm not like tracking obsessively. Every movie. I put in there anymore but it's been fascinating watching that place be get the neuroses of social media sites as people have like as essentially people are moving like locusts from one social media site to another and generating this cloud of neurotic energy about culture and politics. Mostly. In order to get frisian from their interaction with the internet and in a while it after a while it kind of like peters out and they lose the ability to get that hit and so they have to move on. They're like the aliens in independence day or otherwise known as like the human race and now they're on letterbox and so now letterbox is the new tumblr twitter where everybody can just oh. Now we can all have struggle sessions every day about these specific films no matter how old they are and the way people respond to them fun good stuff definite sign of a healthy culture. Oh god jimmy's grotto in waukesha the home of the panzerata which is like a gut bomb calzone. I only went there a few times it's too heavy but yeah the fact that stav got banned for doing some joke for objectifying people.

Film is objectification by definition and it. I do disagree though a lot of people are saying like that. These puritans who are going on there to conduct witch trials about problematic content and problematic ways to view films. They say don't. They get the film is for perverts. That film is about you know desire and and all that no. I think at some point they get it. It's just that's what turns them on what turns them on as much as you know. like brian de palma is turned on by voyeuristic the voyeuristic male gaze and as much as film is about the male gaze for these people who are on there now getting his getting very upset about that and and and essentially creating like lists of prescribed entertainments that's for them their perverted pleasure. That's their libidinal indulgence. So essentially there have like film is voyeurism and then there's this metaphorism where you're not necessarily even looking at the movie you're looking at who made the movie and who watched the movie and that's where you get off on judging them. So it's all it's still perverse. It's not like these people aren't perverts they're just as perverted as the real pervs. It's just that now they're in there too and just and that the problem though is that when that becomes the dynamic it it has to escalate the conflict until the the underlying terrain is destroyed.

People got mad at me for for not liking knives out. I don't get that I mean it's really not the politics. I just said that there's a weird thing people do where they say like you guys talk too much about movies. You only look at them through a political lens well. I don't but when I talk about it on my political comedy show. I'm probably going to talk about the politics. Why else would I be talking about a movie if I wasn't going to put it through a political lens. That's the whole that's the frame of reference for which why we talk about everything that doesn't mean. That's the only way to enjoy a movie the only thing about a movie to enjoy. It's one element that you pull out and talk about. It's not the only I mean one of the problems we have is. So many people think that politics is the only lens to look through things and also that the if you say one thing about a movie. If you express one opinion online. It is a consecrated totality of your beliefs about it. But I was put off by the politics of of knives out. But even if you cut out the alt-right kid thing there's there's nothing there that I enjoyed at all and so then but if we're talking on our politics podcast about why it's bad. I'll bring that up. But there's plenty of other things about it that. I did not like oh christopher plummer died.

R.i.p. To a real one. I actually people say what about culver's there wasn't a culver's in manner to walk when I was growing up there. I didn't have culver's until I moved to the milwaukee area there might be one. There now. But there was not when I was a kid what else didn't.

I like about knives out the structure of it I i mean I like those well for one thing. I don't really like those kind of movies. I'm not a big fan of the agatha. Christie contact the the the the sap the concept like the agatha christie whodunit thing. It's fine. But it's not something. I seek out so that it's already not going to grab me on that respect and then the way they did. It also clever. I guess but not engaging what would I talk to review bra about.

It is interesting though seeing regional you can really trace the pattern of um of retirement migration like internal retirement migration of american populations by the way that regional chains move around like there's a culver's in. I believe there's culver's in florida and there's culver's in arizona. Now because that's where wisconsinites move when they get old and they want their food. They want their familiar foodstuffs do people. I can't believe it either but people do actually no yes people refer to arizona and if I was going to do that. If I was one of those people. I would absolutely pick arizona over florida to me that is not a contest. I mean yes the ocean is nice but if I move into the water I would move to the pacific and also the humidity and the giant bugs and everything the desert is is is a transcendent place or can be and so. I can see. I can see the appeal of arizona but neither of them are like places. I would want to move. I mean people move there because you get to live the life of a retiree which is like this frictionless convenience festival and that's terrible for your brain.

It lobotomizes your spiritual sense. I didn't see jodorowsky's doom because I don't I've never been a dune guy. It's not really my deal and I saw the lynch dune a couple years ago and it was not good. I mean i. I don't think it was good at least but it was visually interesting which is more to say than you can say for the new one at least from what I saw in the trailers and I've seen some jodorowsky movies. But I bet that would have sucked too I bet that it actually made that movie it would not have been good. Squibs are not the only thing I care about in movies but the lack of them is just something that that saddens me because you're seeing as I've talked about just the hyper the hyper elimination of meaningful artistic elements within films. Like there are fewer and fewer places where people can make decisions in the interest of quality. They can only make it in the interest of the budget someone was saying that squibs aren't just like the the the death of squibs isn't just about money. It's about safety but if those two things were in conflict what do you think would win. I mean. It's only coincidentally safer and that still me doesn't mean that you should get rid of them completely. I think chris pointed this out you don't have to make every.

If you're making a movie with a bunch of shooting you don't have to have everything be a squib. You can have plenty of things where you guys just fall over with no blood whatsoever. But when you do show some blood show some real blood instead of okay. Everybody's gonna have a bullet hit but it's gonna be cgi. Like that's a perfect that's a perfect example Chris said like commando in the end of commando when he shoots everybody on that island. Most of them do not have squibs they just fall over but a few shots you get an in-cut you got an in-frame. You got a cut to a close-up and then there's some squibs in a modern version. If they did commando again. Every single person who got shot would get a big cgi blood splatter that's worse that's worse. I saw awakened fright. I just saw it a few months ago. It's a great. It's a hor. It's called a horror movie and the horror prince the horror question that is asked because you know all horror. Movies are premised on what if what if this really happened and how terrifying that that nightmare would be like what if freddie the the mike marinelli street movies what if you could be killed in your dreams you know texas chainsaw massacre. What if you picked up a hitchhiker who was part of a family of cannibals wake and fright. The question is what if you were forced to hang out with australian people for an entire day and that is a terrifying thought. I am looking for. I got to say. I'm still want to see tenant even though. I'm sure it's bad. I want to check it out.

I I think the interesting thing about nolan is that nolan is. It's very. He is really the director for our time because he is a figure where he is as he's like. He is someone without a soul like his films are fully soulless and what he replaces soul with is self manufactured puzzles like just what. I have no interest in people as such. But I do have interest in in challenging myself to get out of narrative and conceptual boxes and that very much is like that's what film is. That's what the internet is. Now. It is we've sort of cast off any we've cast off our bodies and we've decided that like while we wait for oblivion while we wait for individual death and for the death of our species. We're gonna basically do mental crossword puzzles and that's what that's what nolan movies are. That's what all of the arguments people decide to invest with emotion and meaning on online are yeah because like yeah like complexity instead of depth you know neither godzilla nor king kong will win as I said in the other stream. They never never never have one definitively win. I do like though that when they originally did king kong versus godzilla there was the american version king kong won in the japanese version godzilla one. They should do that again that'd be funny. Although honestly they would switch it now at least in america like they would want godzilla to win because like king kong winning would be too like imperialist or something. It's a myth oh never mind. I never saw it. I'm not a big. I'm not a huge godzilla guy. It's going to have a definitive winner interesting well. If it's not king kong. Then it's oh the godzilla king of the monsters. The one they did a few years ago is not good at all No godzilla come on. Godzilla beats king kong. I don't care if you make king kong bigger so that they can fight on even terms king. Kong gets his ass kicked somebody asked about a relatively obscure movie from a few years ago standoff at sparrow creek. That is a movie that a lot of people should watch people who are like freaking out about q anon and the proud boys. They should really watch that movie because it really does spell out how this actually works how much of how much of what we think are.

These like insurgent. reactionary militia movements are in fact being directed to some degree from the leadership positions by law enforcement. I mean we just had that confirmed with the the proud boy leader who was arrested the day before. the the capital breach with the just enough just just the the right amount of like I think weapons like magazines rifle magazines to get arrested so that he couldn't go but all of his supporters went. I mean if they're all if they're all informants. I think people really need to ask themselves well what are we actually getting out of all of this drama and like are we really are we really fighting evil or are we playing our part our necessary part in a public conflict that only serves to reinforce state power. At every at every point wow. The real right wing threat is esoteric fashion eco fash. I I don't I gotta tell you. I don't think that's true. I don't think fash is a threat to anything. I think all of these things are components of one big post-fascist regime. That is it is empire in its death throes it it. Its violence comes home to police those within its borders who can no longer be bought off but that's not a political. It's not a political contest. It is all of politics. It's not. The stakes aren't real because there is no alternative within the structure within the points of conflict. The the emergence of of an alternative is going to be I hate to say it orthogonal to everything else. There'll be a reconstruction board game okay that sounds interesting wow. We really are just waiting around in the. we are in hell's waiting room aren't we just like no alternative nothing. Nothing can be better so we're going to imagine ways that things could be better in the future and the way things could have been better in the past to make the future not what it's going to be and I'm part of that. I'm not blaming anybody for that but I think that you have to understand the current political moment and culture in those contexts and doing so. I think robs a lot of the drama out of it and robs a lot of the urgency out of things that really aren't that important because politics is dead but it will not stay dead because the things that have killed it the things that have narconized us to politics. The things that have made it so that we can't be effective. Political actors are going away are changing the conditions that paralyze us are shifting very quick and that is going to give us new avenues for for political action that can't be predicted or extrapolated out from the present and that's. I think that's the thing like that's the thing to remember when you feel overwhelmed by this stuff. But I would like to play the reconstruction board game certainly I I'm someone's asking sativa or indica. I'm not. I'm off weed right now. It's like I'm trying to recalibrate and and just start from scratch like knowing where my body is knowing what's real and what's been exacerbated by by chemicals. And I have used sativa because it gets me like on point. But I don't think I need that anymore I'd be interested in the future to maybe try something that like puts you in your body as opposed to makes you throw fall fly out of it gravitation reputation's going good. I've been meditating all week 20 minutes or so a day after having been off it. For a while. It feels good. I'm gonna try to keep doing that okay.

This is good the aoc thing. I don't like talking about afc because she is a she's a voodoo doll. Like she she's. She exists to to to pour your frustrations and anxiety into one way or the other. but the whole thing the whole trauma narrative that she's going with. I don't the argument about like whether you whether it's real or not absolutely baffling that these are conversations people are having but I'd have to say that she's essentially acting like an influencer like that's the way to understand all this stuff like her talking about her trauma and now they're gonna have like everyone talking about their trauma. She might think that this is like a political play that's going to help her side versus the republicans but that's only here that's only at the top of her reasoning the real reason she's doing. This is because she's she is a millennial and that's what you do. She's a celebrity. She is an influence what is a member of congress even a member of the squad which is a tiny fraction of a fully neo-liberal democratic party caucus. What can you really do especially since there's no popular movement that you can direct or coordinate with to put pressure anywhere. You you stream yourself. You stream yourself what am I doing I'm streaming myself. She's streaming herself you post. She's a poster. She's an influencer. That's what we all are people get mad at her for it and that's beside the point people want to defend it and say that it's like a politically effective. That is also not true. It is what you do instead of politics because politics is dead. I mean i. I'm not a fan of of this idea that that everything it that all trauma needs to be fetishized and wep and used and and that because it rests on this assumption that that other people are going to respond to your narrative the way you want them to and that's just not true which is why it ends up just being self-indulgence and and self-promotion. But again that's all it can be getting mad at any politician at this point is like getting mad at the weather.

I don't want to talk about that guys. I don't know. I'm done talking about housing boring topic. I never went to kings island when I lived in. Cincinnati never been a huge theme park guy because the lines never were never. Good hated that hated going hated waiting in line. Somebody says thoughts on the rise of incest porn. I was thinking the other day that because I just rewatched under the silver lake which is. I think a really great and underrated movie that is extremely relevant to the current moment in a way that is actually interesting and provocative as opposed to just being lazily. you know like. It's you watch a movie like that and then you watch movies that are like clearly going off of you know twitter topics and and trending talking points and and and are clear and are like written by and for people who are online all day. It's it's it's night and day like that. There's no pandering in that movie. But it very much speaks to the moment in a deeper like like basil level and I was just thinking about how the whole story of that movie is about a downwardly mobile middle-class white guy who literally cannot get a girl. I mean not just because he's a psycho. I mean he is a psychopath and that's all part of it like it's about misogyny in in many ways. But he can't get a girl because the girls are all with rich guys because everyone's just trying to survive and no no no none of the women his age The guys don't have any money and incest porn is sort of the same thing like the girls your age are with your dad so you have to have sex with your stepmom also for incels specifically who make up a big portion of pornography's base users. the another lure of step step pornography is that you know porn porn fantasies are they have to be to some degree plausible or attainable to really tantalize and so if you're talking about people who really don't go outside the home at all. Even even like the fantasy of workplace. Sex is a bridge too far so the only person you can realistically fantasize.

About is someone who you can without leaving your house okay. Somebody. I think to wrap it up. The last thing someone had a long thing in chat just now saying that we're a schizophrenic society because of the divide between our digital and real selves and I think that's true. But I think it even goes deeper than that because that is only a proxy for the greater the deeper divide in the modern self between the um between the chronologically grounded self i.e the body in space and the mental mind self. That is that is unbounded by space or time and the internet is more than anything a tool to allow us to spend time in our bodies that is not processed chronologically and therefore cannot accrue meaning because meaning must adhere to experience and there is no experience to online like it is a pseudo experience like you get mad and you get angry and you get horny and you get scared. But it's essentially your brain tricking you into feeling those feelings that is and so where you as what you assign. The cause of those feelings is also made up by your brain which is harder to do when the source of your emotional responses is a material interaction that occurs in a chronological space-time. I was pretty old when I really got into the internet and I think that's one of the reasons that one of the reasons that it wore off for me is because the the it was never as satisfying. I think as it is for younger people because the contrast between a life that I had had or I was imagined. I could have had instead of it was greater whereas I think for younger people. The internet is taken for granted but that doesn't mean that a crack up is not inevitable. I think that we're in the process of a full social breakdown but not that doesn't necessarily mean the apocalypse or the end of anything. It means people are getting to their end of their particular ropes. The the coping mechanisms we've met we've created. They have a fuse. They don't last forever. There's only so much dopamine you can get from a pseudo existence and it's different for people. Like some people. It's longer than others but everybody gets to a point and I think we're all getting there and I think one of the big reasons that we've had. This big explosion in political hysteria in the last year is because of capital breach occurring without a context where our coping mechanisms have been radically reduced. The things we have had historically in this country to allow us event to allow us to compensate for the lack within our lives. Our rem are sucked in and if that persists it's only going to get weirder. I think we're in for weird weird weird times but weird times are when when new things emerge by definition and that's something that it's obviously scary but to me. It's less scary than the narrative that a lot of people have internalized of total social. fixitness of the idea that these categories are un unchallengeable and people have said that I say that but I just mean that that looking through the current structures that is the conclusion to draw but that doesn't mean it's the correct conclusion. The last movie somebody says joker was the last movie they saw on theaters last movie. I saw in theater was uncut gems which we talked about a little bit on the last episode about trump movies but I'd like to just end here talking about how you could. I couldn't really pick a more perfect film because that movie is about the the death drive of american society. I mean I know it's specifically about you know judaism and stuff and like jewish experience. But as a it is part of a broader. a broader analysis of of a people americans who believe themselves to be eternal beings but who have physical bodies and who can't reconcile those two things other than by subconsciously seeking death on their preferred terms.

Like the beginning of the movie he's getting the rectal exam and it's actually kind of up in the air and I actually thought he was going to get a call halfway through that he had cancer and then he gets the the call oh. I don't have cancer yet oh. He doesn't have it now that doesn't mean in five years. He's not going to have it that doesn't mean in 10. He's not going to get it and he even talks about his family history. He's probably going to get it does he want that does he want to wait around to get chemo and and get sick. The thing that everybody watches their family. Members go through with horror or do you die on your own terms going out on top and that is why that movie has a happy ending. He got what he wanted but in real life you can't do that and one of the reasons we're cracking up is that it's a society of howie ratner is trying to dictate their end but you can't know you can't do it because you set it up and it doesn't come because you're not you're not. You don't want to die in your conscious mind and then it doesn't happen and then you have to keep doing it. You keep doing the same thing and it just it drives you into into his into madness and it's driving us all into madness and like it's especially funny seeing that movie right at the moment where like bernie looked like he might win you know before covet happened. It's like oh if you could pick a moment wouldn't that have been the moment but you don't get to pick the moment. You don't get to be howie ratner. He is. He is a classic hero in the sense that he he. He saw the moment even though he didn't know he was seeking it and he he got his end. He got an end on his own terms all right That's good. I felt nice. This is fun I like this. It's the stakes are lower. I can talk things out without feeling like. I have nowhere else to put things but so next wednesday. And I'll tweet this after I'm done We will talk about the first chapter of eric foner's reconstruction as I said if you don't read it. That's fine. We'll talk about it enough that you'll get the gist and if it sounds interesting pick it up bye.
