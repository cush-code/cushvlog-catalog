 hey there we go says we're streaming in the right area so hopefully we're going here. We have exited host mode better post this there it is hey hey sorry. I'm a little early but my schedule's such that I wanted to get one in today since I didn't do yesterday and this was the time I had so hopefully if you. If you're waiting for six. You can watch this puppy tomorrow or the next day. On the you did the youtube or on twitter if you'd like you can still see the questions if you watched on twitch oh so another so louis. Gohmert having coven is very funny. Louis gomer going to his staff in person to tell them that he had it in a building is even funnier but he'll be fine. He'll be fine. He's not going to give it to anybody like there's a picture of him or there's a video of him coming out of a very small unventilated room with bob barr. He's not going to get it. If he does he'll be fine. He will be fine. They'll all be fine.

The more evil you do the more you are protected from covet. It's like a it's like the the disease itself is acting out the will of all the most demonic demiurgical forces in culture because even as this thing has you know thrown. A huge monkey wrench into the social fabric and might very well have doomed the trump administration to electoral defeat. It has only strengthened the power of our dracula-like rulers yeah. Like if the more evil you do the more antibodies you form against coronavirus. But we can't tell people that because then they're all going to go to law school boom zing that was a good 90s.

Joke people hated lawyers in the 90s and you could make an argument that the whole anti-lawyer thing in the 90s lionel hudson down that was part of the propaganda operation against torts that was going on because by that point corporations had won most of the big battles about regulation but that left the courts as the way to for consumers to get recompense for recklessness and dangerous behavior by corporations was but to sue them and so lo and behold. We spent a decade talking about how awful lawyers are all the time because some woman pours hot coffee on herself. It sues mcdonald's I mean. I'm sure everybody knows at this point that that whole thing was a scam and that the top coffee that the famous coffee lady got from. Mcdonald's was scalding hot to the point that she had significant burns and required skin grafts which meant that they were incredibly negligent to hand that to her in a drive-through and her lawsuit was completely and totally justified but has anybody has anybody heard of any like knowingly actively evil people who died of covet apparently some guys on death. Row died of cobit but like those aren't the ones you want because they've already been punished. You know like if they're evil first of all they're evil even if they've killed. People is very much smaller than the evil that is being perpetrated by people at the top of our cannibalistic hierarchy and they were already in prison. I saw the dead spin thing 

I think the prescript the subscription model I mean as long as there's going to be media on the internet. It looks like the subscription model is going to be what wins it out. The pro the reason that a lot of people dismissed that for years and said no no who's going to who's going to pay for stuff. That's free the question. The answer to that is they will pay if they feel that they have some sort of buy-in or connection with the project. Like it there has to be something social that transcends a pure transaction to have that happen because it is just a pure transaction if the media is as alienated from us. As like movie studios are we're gonna pirate. We're gonna go around pay walls always the thing that's gonna stop us from doing that is if we have an investment if we feel like we're literally having an investment in the thing and I think our show is part of that. I think dead spin the new dead spin thing is going to be part of that and it boils down to sadly to say clout in a way it boils down to the ability to have an online profile that has buy-in from people and it's going to have to fill. It's going to fill the void of traditional media which is completely collapsing because there's no money in it. But they're all for-profit companies and that doesn't really work but yeah. I and they're all going to go away because as long as it's just some you know conglomerate some faceless entity. No one is going to want to pay for it if they can get it for free. People will pay for something they can hypothetically get for free if they feel like they're contributing to something and that's gonna that's gonna fill.

The gap and you could argue that that's a good sign because it indicates the that people are finding the limits of a totally marketized media space they're seeing oh. When there's no public interest in media it actually is terrible. It sucks and all the good stuff is removed because because the market stuff was always about efficiency of transmission and you know things like that it was never about the the quality if any it only inhibited the wall. Somebody says that conglomerate should stop paying for punditry and pay for journalism. There's two reasons they won't. One journalism is much much more expensive than punditry and the margins in media won't allow for that even if they wanted to but I think one of the one of the realities of post-70s. Crisis capitalism is that a lot of these choices are made not out of any a lot of these choices to streamline and and you know pivot all this stuff. It's not just to with people and it's not just to suppress good work.

It's to save those razor thin profit margins and that's true of a lot of industries so they're not going to pay for reporting. I mean obviously there's you know like there's the hey man they're going to. They don't want to find out stuff that they they don't want to. They don't want us to know this stuff. They're not going to pay to find it out and there's truth to that. But also it's just too expensive. It's going to have to be ad like the future of journalism like actual investigative journalism is going to be advocacy based around the crowdfunding model like hey. Why isn't anybody reporting on x y or z someone should and then money's people are gonna. People who want to see that reported on are gonna spend money to see it reported on and that's and that's what's gonna be and and I think people have been advocating that for a long time and a lot of a lot of early adopters to that model failed because we hadn't reached the point. We're at now of total and complete alienation from the absolute garbage. Hose of online media. Like now we realize that they're like oh. You can you cannot get media for free and expect it to have any quality in a capitalist system somebody's asking about the next unemployment site.

I mean we have the bids right the democrats. The republicans bid two and their democrats said whatever we're not married to six so that implies that they'll just end up at two. But I don't know things are really bad and I think a few people in washington seem to get at least some level of how bad things are like mnuchin which might go against the ideological sort of head in the ass. Detachedness of the rest of these idiots so we'll see. I will say though. I don't want to get smug about it but just when people were saying everything's going to run out at the end of sun of july and everything and then every ice no way. They're going to let it on enough july they're going to wait until the last minute so that it doesn't look like It's so that you don't get used to it so that it's always emergency funding and so that they can have an excuse to pare it down in negotiations. But no it was always gonna happen come on this is an interesting question.

This is an interesting point out that if did spin 2.0 is good enough it's going to get bought by a vc. Thing well. See that's where that's where like the question of trust comes in you know like the the the subscriptions are pouring in for this because people know these writers and they think they know what their values are and that they think that that militates against them selling out and there the question is like not just their beliefs but also their ability to thrive if they're successful enough. I don't know if there would be pressure for them to have to sell out especially. I don't know. I think overhead comes up to a lot of it because I think reading the stories of digital media companies that have gone under the question of overhead seems like a huge one. There's all these places in order to maintain in order to impress their vc. Donor their vc funders would have big multi-level manhattan real estate offices with sushi and all that and then like even if you get rid of the perks. You still have the real that you still have the the fixed overhead of the the infrastructure and that's like that's what if there's a potential for for some something like the dead spin relaunch to be viable. It's if they realize the the the lack of necessity for that we're not trying to impress vcs. So we don't have to have a office if they buy an office that'll be very annoying. I will say that don't buy offices for the love of god. At least not ones that aren't like anything more than than a fraction of a fraction of of of the amount of money you can't get but sure.

Spotify is making a play to try to own the podcasting genre. They got everything they got rogan. They got last house podcast on the left um. I bet that when the ukulele playing dumbass who owns patreon it up they're probably going to buy his His database and his you know subscription but then spotify will get bought by somebody. It'll all end up being owned by disney serious odds stitcher and the so stitcher's. The other one at some point stitcher and at some point stitcher and spotify are going to be it and then one of them is going to they're all going to get bought by disney spoiler alert. I I don't obviously laptop's cast on the left isn't equal to rogan. I was just shocked to see it go to spotify because like rogan is essentially a commercial radio show in a lot of ways he sits there and he talks for four hours. It's like imus. He has sponsors you know and he reads this up. It just feels like imus whereas last podcast like that was a patreon model for a while. I mean eventually they got ads and stuff but it just feels more indie and the fact that it got bought out like that. That's what really made me feel like damn spotify is making a move but yeah.

We're It's all going to get consolidated unless people can like create durable low overhead models force for for subscription and the problem with that is you have to get by like I'm saying first because you can't because if nobody knows you are to begin with they're not gonna. They're not gonna risk giving you money you have to have a like a built-in audience and that's where clout comes in. It really does come down to the clout war and the clout chase the clout grind because if you're not on there getting clout no one's gonna money to do so so more incentive more incentives for people to develop that takes the big public croc and I'm iris. I'm responsible for this. This model existing as anybody but the thing I console myself in is just knowing that this is not the this is not the doing of any discrete section of peop of society. This is this is part and parcel of the intensification of exploitation not necessarily intensity of like labor but but exploitation and alienation of the self like if there's no without the imperial core or without the industrial core and with a insufficient economic base service industry and stuff to to facilitate like productive work for large portions of the population. The option is to auto exploit your your personality to make living your job in some way by by by attracting people to your orbit tick-tock podcasts twitter whatever you know what I'm talking about and it's because it's an alternative to a a wildly bleak economic system outside of of those those social entrepreneur opportunities oh boy the honk pill man.

I won't say her name but the person who compared the grill pill to the honk pill today on twitter was very funny to me for those who don't know honk pill is some painful 4chan nerd. About like it's like ironic nazism that's not ironic whatever it's all the kind of really cool stuff that I don't know when when you start talking about the honk pill and then your next words are this is extremely dangerous that really is to me a sign you need to off. It's the honk pill and I know I know. I know fascism is often intentionally clownish and and and theatrical and bufoonish and that's part of what cloaks it. But in this case you're talking about a actual handful of people. All of whom have spent their entire adult lives to the extent that they're adults and most of them are kids on the internet and it's not even like they're the scary hacker guys going on like the dark web to assassinate their middle school principal. It's they're just posting cringe all day every day. But anyway these are like ironic nazis or something and one and this person says that the reason that they're the same is that they both say lol nothing matters and the thing that that indicates to me more than anyone. Anything is just how how built into people to the point where they don't even. I don't even think they realize it in their minds. The connection between politics and posting is like the number. It's it's amazing like it's been very clear.

The explicit argument has always been log off and do something real because you will get captured by a false anti-dialectical okay it's you're walking into plato's cave on purpose don't do that. But what he will hear is stop log off means stop posting that means stop sharing content that means stop arguing with people and that means stop caring because caring is posting and I understand I i really understand why people think that because there's so few alvern avenues for most people to effectively act. But that's why you got to log off because then you have to find one you have to and yeah some of these guys by the way some of these honk dudes they're probably going to do school shooting or like a they're going to kill people probably. But I mean it's weird. I think they have there was a common understanding among like educated people for a while that yes discreet political but also pop culture objects can be triggers for people to commit violence but that it's never the thing itself that leads to the violence. I think we had that like kind of assumed for a long time except for you know the crazy christian right but then because everyone started huddling in the cave they stop thinking that way and I can kind of understand the reasoning of like well if everyone's online more and putting more energy into online then that means that the the acts that they carry out are gonna be more. They're more likely or They can be more influenced by like violent content and by violent politics to do an act and the thing is that might be true but if it is it's not the discrete memes or politics. That's the problem it is the internetification of life like at every level the proximate triggers for for violence for for the proximate triggers for unorganized lone wolf political violence. Is the same as for school shooters and and general social misfits. It's and those those those urges are are generated by i. I'm sorry by a material economic base hate to sound like a broken record. And it's our inability to face that that makes us flee to social fixes because if we can ban x y or z then we can remove the the proximate triggers and it's like yes you can but you've done nothing to stop the alienation that's at the heart of it and then once again.

She's like yeah. But what can you do and it's like. I don't know either but I know for. You can't do it by engaging at the symbolic level. All. I know is. It won't be found there what it is. I don't know but it won't be found there. That means everyone is required to do something else and a lot of people. They don't want to not just they can't think of one. They wouldn't want to do something else if they could and to them. I say tough. But it's not nihilism jesus christ. It's just absurd nihilism isn't even real. There aren't any nihilists. Everybody has some sort of motivating like architecture for the world. Some value like personal hedonism is not nihilism. You believe in your own pleasure oh boy.

I gotta say when I saw the when I saw that the washington post was capitalizing white to acknowledge like the cultural. The unified cultural like experiences of whiteness and oh boy chill gotta chill running down the spine not good stuff. I mean I think it's probably an overstatement to say that that's going to contribute in any real way to intensifying racism and white nationalism. But I think that it's it's a troubling current of response to the black lives matter movement. I would say that and it's one that white frailty also echoes which is and white frailty says specifically white. People need to be racially aware of themselves as white and that is what the washington post wants. They want white people to be aware of themselves as white now. How much damage that does when the washington post says it to their bunch of liberal professional class readers all sitting in front of their their breakfasts or or clicking on it at their office. Jobs or you know white frailty to her pod of you know nervous warren voting suburbanites who like have maybe a black neighbor that makes them nervous and they don't know what to do about it. It probably doesn't matter what any of them think but in general as a response to to the acknowledgment of racial discrimination in society telling white people in a period of unprecedented for the modern era economic and social dislocation and dissolution that that's a recipe for oh that's the race war you got going on.

There you got that race wall going oh yeah no more than me oh cher you want that ghoul race ball you want that good race what will first first you go put in that that collapsing economy oh you won't put that in there you want everybody to be precarious. Oh you want. Everybody terrified. They either lost their job. They know somebody lost a job or they job no good yeah. You want that oh you want something else how about that social network how about that social network falling apart how about all bonds of community just dissolving like acid how about that of that you put that in there oh that's some good why about pandemic disease how about social dislocation how about urban how about some urban conflict how about total dissolution of faith in political systems how about the destruction of a shared reality how about we do that and then I'll talk about that oh that's good. But that's not gonna get you that deep goal race war.

You won't get that deep good race while you put in some of that white racial awareness. On top of that you tell why people in that environment in that environment that they should think more about being white and what that means because the assumption of the washington post people and of robin d'angelo is that everybody's like them everybody is a good college-educated etiquette acculturated liberal and that when you tell them hey you know you're white. It's going to make them consider their privilege you're right. I am white let me think about what it means to be white in terms of what a burden it is to be white of guilt of of generational trauma inflicted and how I have to rectify that and how I'd every day am contributing to this. That's what they would do. If they got reminded. They were white so that's what everybody should do well not everybody did you had a little. Paw to do nobody have no not everybody went to the crumpet and t circuit and learned that racism is impolite not that it's really bad that's not really what you learn you learn that's impolite. And so when they hear as their jobs are either covet or open opium addiction you know what what does it mean to be a discreet a unified culture within a polyglot.

 social institution that is falling the apart completely collapsing who are we to what's the new order as this dissolves as everyone loses faith that there is a a stable future in something called the united states of america. What will we pick up the pieces with what heuristics will we use to choose friend from foe as reorganizing in the rubble here's robin deangelo on the washington post with a nice ready-made one for you race who can you trust hubba hubba hubba who can you trust the answer for most people is going to be somebody who have a cultural affinity and and continuity with which you can't really afford all that multicultural stuff in the context of crisis and collapse. At least that's what people are going to be thinking. That's why right now the the the the like the social affirmative happening right. Now the collapse happening right now could be very good.

In fact it could save this planet if if it's if it happened early enough to to establish like new foundations that can push us away from capitalism and its destruction of the environment. But man do we not have the left institutions for it right. Now. That's the horrible thing. That's the thing that's so terrifying and things like this fill the void and that's why I fear if there is a if there is like a significant buckling and and the unified infrastructure and unified control and unified order and a monopoly on state violence are compromised that people are going to do anything other than clan up along the most obvious lines and a lot of what's considered to be on the left when we're talking about race is aiding that I don't think for a lot of people and on purpose. Not everybody's a cia co-intel pro agent.

I think because they they feel guilt they they feel personally as a white person. A beneficiary of racial of of racial inequality and perpetuated racial violence and the thing is they are they do of course. They do. But it's a question. What do you do about it and the answer for people. Especially. People who have had the pinky extending lessons in college is to say. I will renounce my privilege and I will I will. I will basically put myself prostrate before the people I have wronged and the that instinct is very bound by by. I would say social social at the level of social honestly. It's a lot of it is college. I've said it before people don't go to college not to feel guilty or to get brainwashed. They go to college to get a job but one of the things they learn is. If you want to boost wildlife you need a bourgeois job and this is what bourgeois values are. That's what college has always been for doing and and so people who have had that experience have are more likely to have that response to the horror. But what they end up doing is.

They end up unintentionally reifying racial difference as foundational saying like there's no way to really have like even relationships between the races because of the because of the buried trauma and mutual distrust. I mean maybe you could use that to work on something in a context where everybody has to get along because they're I don't know they work at the same company and it's a diversity training which is the model for a lot of this stuff or a college classroom. But if it's a bunch of people who don't who have you have no like persuasive authority over. I'm not talking about state authority. There's no state authority really. There's not really there's only only the echo of state authority at the work on the In most workplaces most office workplaces and in college campuses what is there in the person of the boss and the person of co-workers. Classmates and teachers is social authority that you are invested in you wouldn't be there. If you weren't you wouldn't be at that job. You wouldn't be at that college if you weren't investing.

We're just americans we just all dropped in here without any any agreement any and we never and most of us have not been acculturated through processes whereby we instinctively adhere to a social authority. In fact the way capitalism is hyper-accelerating all forms of social authority have been completely destroyed and and turned into discreet like clannish. Self-affirmation societies built along the the market model of the of the subgroup of the marketed subgroup and in that context. They there's no there's no especially somebody who who is suffering somebody whose life is bad and getting worse especially somebody who is seeing the infrastructure that maintains social life collapse. It's hard to tell them no no you have to feel bad for them. It's like well yeah in a theoretical way but I'm not bought into your.

I am not bought into the basic premises that you have you've not brought me along through the process and it's impossible to because there's no self motivation to begin with like somebody applying to go to the college somebody applying to go work at the job. Even if it's attenuated by hey. I have to go to college to get a good job. I have to go here to work and keep a roof over my head but like the discrete choice of in the the the illusion of choice within those things gives us a sense that we are picking something even if you can say. We're not we're picking a specific college. We're picking a specific employer and and that act of choosing within a small range of choices that have already been made for us gives us the illusion of autonomy. But it's a real sense of illusion to us and that means that we have bought in at a psychological level to the social pressures and mores of those areas.

There is no similar pressure getting people that you don't know to get along with your ideas on race. There's no way to do it and as social order collapses the only thing that's going to be left. The residue of all. This is going to be the one undeniable fact that because of the racial the way that race has shaped the literal geography of this country like the katana on the order of richard daly. Is it so social life as a result is wildly segregated and that means social trust is segregated and the only hope we have to either challenging the existing system or to philly or to successfully fill the gap created by a more generalized crisis and collapse is if we can overcome that the class consciousness oh my god yeah in the after afterscape can you imagine the clans like q anon will be the form foundation of a new religion. It will be and in fact.

I would argue that if you play this out like a fall of the roman empire post europe right where like you you up. They effloresced all these like microstates. There was the period of of conflict between like temporal and spiritual authority and then finally the solidification in early the early modern era of like relatively large centralized states state centralized monarchies or empires barring the holy roman of course if you had that in the united states like and you had like in the roof. Like like there was after the fall of the roman empire. A bunch of different types of religion mostly different varieties of christianity. You know you got your aryan arianists nuts gnostics all those guys mer what they call monophysis. If we have a similar thing like in a post cops america q anon I bet would be the one to win out it would be. It would be the it would be like a and if if they ended up having a you know social revival a couple thousand years from now or not. Not even that couple hundred christianity would be like had been finally finally fully americanized like like mormonism hyper like hyper normalized mormonism. So that's it's like yeah. I know not only did jesus come to america. He fought a war in america against the forces of darkness personified by george soros and hillary clinton who who ritually ate babies to give them strength in the name of satan and there was like a a battle and and jesus was like temporarily routed. Jesus and donald trump were temporarily routed from the field but they'll return like the occlude like trump will be the occluded mahdi in the future q anon pro christianity. So you can everyone can have fun with that imagine that that'll be fun. That's one of those things it's like god give me a time machine. I just want to see it. I want to see what q and it is in 100 years but somebody says yeah.

This would be the final americanization of christianity which reminds me about something about mormonism that I wanted to say we talked about me and felix talked about mormonism on the show on monday and I wanted to elaborate a little bit because I've been thinking just about how ingenious the mormons are because they basically solved protestant. American protest. The saud they've solved the problem of american protestantism and then because they had solved that later after it fully matured they were able to solve the problem of american capitalism and in so doing they have resisted a lot of the worst social decay of of the rest of us like like dropping life expectancies. Fertility rates drug addiction all this stuff and that's why I would felix always saying like mormons are who evangelicals think they are and that's so perfect. That's so perfect because they both have a religion where they have a fused prosperity material prosperity with spirituality and personified it in the country. They live in But the difference is is that the mormons maintain a social cohesion that allows capitalism to work for them whereas the the evangelical has been fully dissolved and atomized by the market and is a complete like yeah. He's like yes. I'm. I'm. I'm a business man. It's like yeah a mormon guy. He has like three card car washers that he owns. He's got a nice family. Five 16 kids his every weekend his wife and all the other wives go in the bake in the basement the finished basement and they all sell each other multi-level marketing products to keep the economy moving but yeah evangelical thinks that sam but no he's on his fourth divorce. Porn addicted guy with he's like gonna like burn down his skidoo dealership for the insurance money and it's because mormon solved both of the big problems.

How do you how do you how do you be christian in america. How do you how do you reconcile the social like the social aspect of religion with the depersonalizing experience of living in the material absurdity of america from the point of view of european settlers and their descendants and and even before that and how do you reconcile the inevitable like national fetishization that will occur which is what we have done. This is what american protestantism is working worshiping america. How do you reconcile that to a religious tradition protestant christianity that imagines its origins in a completely different place and time pre-capitalist pre-european how how can you be an american and worship americanly with that religion and even more deeply even more deep than that how do you solve the problem of the ego centered materialism of the of what american protestantism will have to become to accommodate the pursuit the ability to always pursue material access a material gain to offset spiritual loss. The crank the one-way crank that will inevitably lead to the total de-sacralization of the public space and the profanement of all. It's a one-way ratchet um and the thing that causes that is is is a ego based an ego fixated social order you because america is so prosperous it twists It gets the wires to cross within the mind where material pursuit where ego gratification and ego gratification at a material level because that's what's that's what's to be had is the same as the good and therefore is god. But that means your god right. Kinda you have to unless you can't be absorbed. Right. You can't be absorbed into an eternal thing and also be the sum total of of the universe. The sum total of the of the moral requirement of the universe to you is your advancement.

How the hell do you handle that the mormons solve that theological problem by saying oh. When you go to heaven you become god. You get your own planet and you get to do sims for eternity. That's how you that's how you solve that problem the other problem of course you saw by saying oh yeah. No jesus came to america. He ministered to the natives. Then they had a big war. It's true There's these golden plates the the the garden of eden is in missouri. You've you've replaced it. You've re-territorialized it and then by staying together by staying together by going to utah together being persecuted. Really. The persecution probably helped they were able to create a social order where rather than allowing capitalism to define the social space and dissolve them all away into particles. They use capitalism as like a capillary network to circulate money in their economy. Like I'm not kidding multi-level marketing works in in utah because the reason all those things fail.

The rest of the place is because eventually and for most cases very quickly you run out of people to sell to because who the hell does anyone know how many friends do people have how many relatives do people have how many close relatives people have breeders out. It's like in a perpetual motion machine in utah and not only that like that's that's the housewives they even like both. It's there's they've solved all this stuff. They've got two parents working because the husband has the business that towers everybody's roof or whatever and then he gets his you know pool cleaned by the other guy and it circulates the circulation of economy as they say and that's always sunny and the wives are giving each other lulu or like stretch pants and tupperware parties and so you got both both partners working but the the the wife's work is one that allows her to also be a domestic partner. The way that traditional patriarchal capitalist society was built upon and so as a result the corrosive acid of of capitalism unbound by by any kind of social cohesion which will be all capitalism in an opened social order that does not have like boundaries to it. Will lead to total total atomization anatomy and so you got all these guys all these all these evangelicals whose lives are miserable who are filled with genuine hate in a way that would make jesus's blood curl and and whose religion has been oriented subconsciously around sadism.

It's because all the that they think they believe is is directly wired to the opposite of that and they're not even aware of it. And that's why that's why the mormons won by being early adopters because they they were like the bleeding edge people they were. They were the most sent because you know cults and future religions are filled with both the same type of people. The raw nerve you know the the squeaky wheel the the the the the ex the more the sensitive. The socially fragile the person whose ability to absorb the reality is attenuated to a degree that makes their personality hypersensitive to certain inputs and therefore seeking of alternatives seeking of a different way to be. It will make life easier for them. Some of them end up you know going to go into guyana and being killed with poisoned flavor aid. Some of them go to utah and found a flourishing religious tradition that almost got a guy elected president. But it's the same type of people mormonism is of course associated most most closely with utah.

But it was founded in upstate new york by joseph smith. That's where the upstate new york is where he claims he found the tablets the gold. The golden tablets and upstate new york is also an area that at the time was called the burned over district because of its propensity to spark massive conflictory. Religious revivals of different types mostly protestants charismatic religious traditions and and joseph smith was one of those guys and there's actually I always like I've wondered about that like why why upstate new york. Why was that the burned over district that was also by the way they had the hotbed of anti-masonic politics. That's where the animatic party was born thurlow weed who became the political major domo for william. Seward got his start with the animasonic party and that was obscene new york. I think it might have something to do with the erie canal hear. Me out might have something to do with the area now does that make sense In fact there is a there's a passage in moby dick that I want to read because to me. It really evoked what it must have been like to live in upstate new york and it makes me feel like oh. I get why this is a place where religious passions were so deeply felt so here it is This is melville describing the lives of people who are who live in the canal zone where where they put in the area canal um canalers.

They call them freely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen. The canaler would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark anthony for days and days along his green turfed flowery nile. He indolently floats openly towing with his red-cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed. The bring dish guys. The canal are so proudly sports his slouched and gaily ribboned hat but toking the token. His grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats. His sword visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal. I have received good turns from one of these canalers. I thank him hardly would feign not be ungrateful but it is often one of the redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has a stiffened arm to back a poor stranger in a straight as to plunder a wealthy one in some gentlemen.

What the wildness to this canal life is is emphatically convinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our wailing captains. Nor does it all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line. The probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a christian cornfield and recklessly plowing the waters of the most barbaric seas. So that's part of it is that is that the canal zone was a was a um. It was a liminal zone and liminal zones are where social orders dissolve and are if turned ephemeral and that creates social anxiety. It creates a need to find dry land again because some people are going to say it and go off to the water. But others of less adventurous temperaments are going to try to find another explanation and and and blood and thunder religion is one. It's a way out of the thicket. It's a way out of the of the of the of the terrifying. Cutthroat dog eat dog savagery of an unrestrained market milieu which is what the the erie canal represented. Because remember this is 1840s. This is before we're talking about any like the industry is still very much in its infancy. The industrial revolution has barely begun in the united states.

This is the closest thing we've got really anywhere near a I mean other than of course cities and cities of others. I've always been godless dens but they're very. They're so godless that the the disorder they produce is very rarely cloaked in religious garb. That's for the countryside. That's where that's where the the the doe-eyed and the and the earnest first confront challenges to their world and the need to need to deal with those challenges the need to bring them down. There's another bit about the um. There's another bit about there's another bit in that definition or in that chapter which also has this great description of how people from the great lakes area are basically coastal and have like see water in their veins and I agree with that. But he has one more like paragraph. I think about about the religious beliefs in the in that area. Let's see if I can find it here. It is here it is. This is a description of the canal for 360 miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populist cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields.

Unrivaled far fertility on unrivaled for fertility by billiard room and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on roman arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts are broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties especially by rose snoke white chapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There's a true ashanti gentleman. There howl your pagans where you ever find them next door to you under the long long flung shadow and the snug patronizing lee of churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan free booters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in holiest vicinities. That was the that was the quote. I was looking for that's even better why did supple chairs exactly the the the the the inherent um daily hypocrisy that must be absorbed by all people who both live according to what they imagine to be a religiously prescribed life and the necessity of commerce. It creates instability and anxiety and it makes people do if they are sensitive enough.

If their antenna are pinged at the right frequency. It makes them do like follow a dude to illinois who claims that he's read secret god messages on golden tablets that you can't see. He they the angel came and took him away. I would love to show it to you but he came he. I was like this is amazing and then he and then he came that's the like it's amazing. It really does tell you.

That religion is really fully. A it had because it has to be an act of faith at the center of it right like you have to be able to like. I talked just. I talked the other day about the lacuna in your eye where the stalk is. You don't have the hole there because you literally hallucinate something in there because you know enough you see enough about what's around it that your brain just like fills in oh okay. This is what's there which is essentially what your brain does during any hallucination only at a more like a more intense level. It's like you're filling in the next step like your brain is imagining something and then it just puts it there because your perception is that intensified by the drug but so you're you always have to fill in you you're very even believing your eyes requires. A leap of faith believing in your eyes requires an act of faith and as such all attempts to make a metaphysical understanding of the universe require that and so attempting to like defeat religion on those kind of grounds seems foolish to me. You gotta you gotta challenge on the grounds of does.

This religion actually adhere to the values the universal values. I'm. I'm sorry. I'll say it there's a universal value unregarding all religious traditions of any size but of course that's not how they're lived because those are idealist concepts and idealism. Idealist concepts are to be molded by material reality are to be shattered upon the rocks of reality that we then have to pick up. We pick up the pieces and put it back together and we up and messed up and then we hand it off to the next generation they drop it. They got to do it again every time something gets lost. Something gets moved but every time the the the shape is caused by the collision between this idea and this reality and that's why like american even though christianity I think has at its heart like as as perfectly stated real like it's it work christianity could is is as true as buddhism is I could or close enough for government work at a certain like root base just in terms of understanding of like the good. God our place in the universe in relation to each other. But then we have a thing where people think that there's a disney guy with a beard and you get to go to splash mountain for eternity after you die that's not and what comes from that is this psychotic materialism and the only way to accommodate a real materialist.

My world is through competition ego gratification through competition and resource grabbing cooperation is antithetical even though cooperation is the sum total of human thriving let's see somebody says why is buddhism pretty good. I mean tell that to the rohingya you know it's like it's not like. There are buddhist like with the countries where there's like a buddhist super majority that have that are not part of the global exploitation machinery that do not have misery in the same proportion because all of these things have been shaped by the material and lost along the way. I think there's a perception food isn't better because in the united states if you're buddhist kind of by definition you have not accepted the the the ideological issued kit you know you're you've inherently said ah nah. This isn't for me because you probably grew up at least nominally christian that requires like an introspection to do that you didn't just pull it off the rack and so those people tend not to be reactionary or less reactionary. I should say and so there's association there with with with the left but that's just because just because of the selection bias of becoming a western buddhist one evening as the sun went down and the jungle buyers were burning down. The track came a hobo hiker. He said boys. I'm not yearning headed for a land that's far away sign. The crystal fountain so come with me go and see the big rock handy mountain.

How did feudalism last so long in japan I mean I be. I don't know that much about japan so I'm talking out of my ass people could correct me my my instinctive thought is lack of competition. Lack of it was a unified state for so long because what broke the feudal what broke the feudal stalemate in europe was the black death and then the emergence of capitalism out of the trade network that came along with the increased economic activity afterwards. Because of the increase of circulating surplus the surplus wasn't being hoarded. It was being circulated because laborers could demand more for their money for their labor because there were fewer of them and that created that that broke the the relationship it broke the leverage point between between the and the serfs and it started to just fatal it destabilized feudalism and also created much more circulating surplus which was then absorbed into a network of trade and of course trade brings. A competition or trade is funneled through competition between those medium-sized states. I was talking about the europa had which competed with each other and in competing did things like try to find new trade routes after the ottomans plugged up the old ones and and investing in new machinery and and and intensifying economic activity and the levels of abstraction within economic activity. Whereas japan was a unified state for the entire period there was nothing to There was nothing to this just to just disrupt the the essential dynamic between the two classes and then what was it that eventually broke it open the commodore perry and the black fleet. But that's just off the top of my ass. I mean the stuff about europe. I'm more cl. I'm more I'm pretty confident. I would defend that but I just. I would assume that that would apply to japan all right. I'm gonna wrap up in a minute here. If anyone's got any questions commodore matthew perry can you ima could I be any more of an imperial shell.

 somebody asked how long until baseball quits. I gotta say the fact that they didn't stop after the marlins thing happened makes me think they're just gonna say domesticated to push against it because who we got in the nba or the or the major league baseball. Now you've gotta. Like all the white guys basically are cu dumb asses who don't think the virus is real in the first place so they have no incentive. They don't really care so boom you've got like that whole. That's what a third of the players basically ideologically captured. You don't even have to work on their material interest because they don't even know they have any in that context. Younger. Players really have no say so that's another huge chunk. You know there's very and then everybody else is like if. I'm going to be the only one who says no then. I'm just going to lose out on money and maybe roster spot for the rest of my career.

All right. One more question oh god. This is actually fun. I can't answer it. I just want to think about it as I talk because it's so good what if trump loses what does his lame duck period look like part of me thinks he just pushed the button you know think about it. He loses really bad too bad to effectively pull the lever on a coup or whatever and all of his and all the top republicans realize. He's expendable and all the military guys realize biden's not enough of a threat to bother going in with trump. In since he's so unreliable and then it's like oh my god. I'm gonna lose I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a failed president who lost an election and there's nothing more pathetic that's why winning the presidency is so like so so destroying and why you have to be a sicko to want it because winning the presidency makes you one of the most one of the most consequential figures in world history by definition congratulations. Your ego has been put to a size that mortal men can't usually even dream of on. The flip side of that though is that there is no particularly disdained historical figure than the one term president. You are setting yourself up for a humiliation. The the the intensity of which only a handful of people have ever experienced. That's how I mean imagine how bad that must feel to know that you're always going to be remembered as the loser president like it's not nearly as bad for guys who run for president don't get it.

They usually get it's like It's like chips right so chips had two guys. It had erica eric estrada and it had larry wilcox. Now in the years since then eric estrada kind of stayed famous but as a punchline like oh eric estrada. The loser old guy can you imagine him. He's trying to be sexy oh that's funny oh look. He's on punk rock bands video in the 90s oh. This is hilarious larry wilcox off the radar just not even known. I think most people in in terms of show business unless the real sickos would rather be larry wilcox like that's what being a failed presidential candidate is but being a failed president that's being eric estrada and who want no one gets famous trying to be eric estrada so and and of course we know that trump has no moral imagination beyond himself. He's a fully isolate that's why he's miserable because he is a fully embodied american. He is the most american american. He embodies america blah blah. We know this he is he. He is the manifestation of one so of of all phenomenon condensed into one person as you will occasionally have.

He's the doctor manhattan of america that way so. It's not like he's gonna feel oh. No. I can't kill anybody. He doesn't think people are real. He thinks in a real way that when he dies the world will end so why not just make that happen and there's really nothing to stop him. You could argue that because it's a it's lame duck period. Maybe there'll be military people there like maybe they give a special instructions to the football guy to hey you know if there's nothing going on and he just tries to grab the football in the next two months just tase him I gotta figure. Those conversations have happened because it's not it's not being a lib to point out that he is.

He is fundamentally erratic in a way that no president has been really since nixon and nixon was like doing doing kind of a bit for a lot of it as a psyop. Even though he was totally bug height of the cold war with two of the most paranoid miserable freaks to ever be president. Both nixon and Lbj have recordings after their landslide victories because they both won back to back which is astounding to think or no eight years apart which is astounding to imagine that kind of shift from one party to the other but those are almost back to back two of the biggest blowouts in american history. But in both cases in nixon's case. More really they were disappointed in the congressional turnout and the the coattails and they just the day after the election. They're just kind of complaining about how it wasn't a big enough win and that's just it's evidence that these people are sick and they cannot be satisfied. They are hungry ghosts you have to stop them from being able to feed that's our only hope as a species see you guys.
