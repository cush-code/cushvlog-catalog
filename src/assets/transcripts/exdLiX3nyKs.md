This train rolling something right on the P strange he trained rolling something thinking about the world to come the Peace Train Peace Train Rollings. After right on the Peace Train oh the Peace Train. A piece train rolling softly right on the Peace Train ER I have somebody's train bye well new no please train rocking about the world to come. He's trained faced train fifth train be strange be strain Peace Train Peace Train Peace Train peace. Try Peace Train Peace Train forgot the words something something something about the Peace Train oh Peace Train peace strain peace strain peace strain be strain pea strain is that when you strain to pee that sounds terrible I'd hate to have to strain to pee I'm having funnier than being a regular British guy and having a near death experience and converting to Islam. Real left left turn stuff getting people where they don't expect you salute. Hey folks haven't didn't do it stream last week. So I wanted to get one in don't have a book or anything don't really know feel really like I am kind of at the end of the cycle. Here you know uh China who knows America who knows Earth planet. Human beings who knows a lot of a lot of question marks uh I sure as hell don't know what's going on.

That's all I know ah how is how are you guys he was from gree. He was Greek but he was British You're Gonna Act Like. This is somebody who's got a family from another place that they're not from there racists. He's British. He should name my. He's a British guy hello. He sounds like that. He's British so yeah. It's not just have a low-key uh hello episode just talk things out anyways any questions just talk through the chat. Nothing too intense with jazz man testifies indeed uh. I don't know I don't know what's going on.


I think that's uh the long and short of it. Peru good question. I don't know uh certainly seemed like Castillo. Uh was in over his head from the beginning had a very bad time even getting any kind of uh agenda off the boards so like that whole the whole like new pink wave that's hit Latin America has really problematic because there's it's so. It's got such uh shallow roots anywhere. Like you can go in an election but so what you know if you don't have horses or you don't have people who with your back if you don't have organization to press an agenda. Then eventually you're going to get neutralized uh and you know that's uh. That's this that's really the story of uh the left whatever you want to call that everywhere is that it really does mainly exist is this uh Chimera. This uh things people are sort of gesturing towards with their politics but which doesn't have any actual body to it doesn't have muscles. It doesn't have any kind of real arm articulation because the only thing that really does have articulation is capitalism that that's well articulated and everybody is operating within its constraints and as such the ability to press against any like load-bearing or structurally necessary.

Elements of capitalism becomes very difficult to consider uh and that's why I really think that you know there is hope with a capital H for Humanity. But I don't think for what everyone from Mark's onward hoped uh which was that civilization which had like created uh capitalism and then had created the Socialist challenge to capitalism would then be reformed from within because even Marx's revolutionary notion is not one of uh destruction of the liberal order built by capitalism. It is the Fulfillment of of the liberal like social ideal and there was a while there where there was a good reason to believe that it was possible. But I think at this late date we have to accept that that the uh whatever might in the future be called socialism. If it becomes hegemonic will be in very many fundamental ways unrecognizable socially to uh anything that we would want or imagine that doesn't uh the totally different value system and frame of reference because it will emerge not from not from this not as a continuation of whatever the hell this is.

But in its wreckage uh somebody asked about bukharan and what he got right I mean. Bokarin was wrong in his fundamental idea which is that uh that Russia could be modernized without mass misery uh that wasn't going to happen as we've seen nowhere that got modernized nowhere that had a pre-modern mode of production was brought into industrial society in the 20th century without massive bloodshed. But I think what he did recognize is that having that Bloodshed be carried out under the auspices of a Communist Regime and in fact the embodiment globally of the notion of socialism and communism. Uh would be devastating to the larger project of Global Revolution which is what the premise of the polisher uh takeover had been that it would spark that foreign because it was going to have to happen in the context of a globalized World system that had certain uh requirements of any government that sought to compete on those terms and maintain its power maintain its control and prevent itself from being overthrown. Uh I mean. Bukharan's course which was to try to buy off the peasantry would have left the Soviet Union incredibly weak and would have probably led to the the Communist Party being uh at some point overturned. The question is whether that in the Broad Run could have been for the better but you know that is one of those classic hindsight of uh 2020.

Is 2020 type of things foreign Capital stake over sure they do they take over but that doesn't mean that the Socialist challenge to capitalism goes away and I think that that assumption that undergirded a lot of Soviet thinking was essentially was wrong. It was it was I got an echo again wonderful great. It just kicked in like it was not doing it and then it did do it well how bad I don't understand that doesn't why would that happen does anyone know why that would happen. I plugged it in and plugged it out again whatever I'm probably not going to go along today especially since I got this. Echo I don't know I might not go again for a while if I can't figure this out because it does bother me to know that it sounds weird I have a fine microphone. This is an interesting someone says uh do you think Marx and socialism capitalism.


What Luther was to feudalism Christianity. Uh I guess yeah in a way because like I said like I said in a previous show. Luther is trying to save uh what he sees as is good in the feudal order from itself which is I think also what Marx is seeking to do save. What is Good from the Western civilizational project to save it from the exploitation machine that undermined and destroyed all those good things over time well. Then how do I turn off how do I turn off the inbuilt mic well why would it just kick on though that's what I don't understand all right turn. The computer volume off computer volume is off does that do anything and like the Marxist project is this attempt to save Western Civilization from itself which is what Luther was. Luther was trying to do with civilization as he understood it which was the feudal order and then Calvin comes along and he is the creature you know of the future. He's the one who recognizes the the necessity of an alienated religion to match an alienated social world and that does raise the question well then who's the Calvin of uh of socialism and uh I guess I guess.

It's Lenin problem is though is that that project failed as opposed to the the broader project of universalizing capitalism when is religion ever not alienated when you don't have a when it is not generated by and reinforcing of class Society I guess for people who think of maoism. As like the next like is it different. But it's all all those are attempts to to adapt to the reality that the World Revolution never came. It never happened which leaves us with this rotting corpse of capitalism that uh will end up annihilating everything about itself.

No history isn't over yet uh but I mean I don't know I kind of think it is I mean. Fugayama is right that there is no they're never that the challenge to capitalism failed from within it. It's if anything else is going to have to come from out. The problem is because capitalism is totalized. Now we cannot imagine anything outside of it. But capitalism at this point in history is retreating and what it is leaving is sort of post-historical landscapes and there's Google and the life in those post-historical Landscapes is still going on and processes are going on but we cannot examine them through the same lens that we use uh. We cannot narrativize them uh the way that we do life within its Contours and so being inside of it. Like we are now. Uh becomes incredibly challenging to try to uh articulate any understanding of a future but that doesn't mean there won't be one. It means that it's being made beneath our feet and around us. I don't know and yeah like Civilization as we know it. That's the important part will be destroyed the way that all previous class orders have that have been geographically limited.

This one is geographically unlimited for now but it will be a process of retreat and then uh Retreat into a course archipelagos of wealth that will then collapse from their own constellations leaving emptiness sterility but also growth and and life and ferment. I it it might still be history but it's not history again the phrase as we know it as we commonly understand it because that requires a legibility and a it's not part of it's. It's a it's a process at the other end of a rupture and the thing is I don't think Humanity will not end. I think that that's that desire for ending is a desire to have some sort of uh to square the difference between living you know in a sweep of of species existence as a finite limited individual. I don't know I mean I feel like I feel very stuck. Like literally I feel very at the at my Wit's End in many respects and I'm just asking myself like what do I do.


I don't know I don't know yeah well. That's all we got but like what do. I do how do I turn that into a you know project. I wish I knew how to do literally anything else. Honestly. Napoleon certainly would have been the goat if he defeated Britain but I mean he couldn't he couldn't do it. Europe cannot be could not be militarily sporned even into the 20th century that was proven yeah you can fantasize about you know uh angle capitalism being a sort of harnessed to the French social model but that's couldn't happen because the anglo-capitalism was in every respect able to pile on competencies and uh uh competitive advantages that left it unassailable.

Mike Flanagan I saw is saying he's going to adapt The Dark Tower series I will believe it when I see it because that's been said before I remember. When Ron Howard was going to do it. It was going to be a TV series where I think the Walking Dead Guy never happens probably won't happen. It's not unfilmable that is absolutely incorrect. You could totally do the Dark Tower especially as a show not as a movie but as a show the movie is terrible genuinely bad breathtaking and it's awfulness uh. But I think you could do you could do the series as as a bunch of shows. I mean uh the first book would probably not even be you you wouldn't want to spend too much time with that because it is sort of you know more psychedelic and and spare uh. But you could still you know use parts of it to establish mood and texture and all that before hitting uh the drawing of the three. Because like that that's ready made to be a show you could do a season of Television about about the triangle. Three no problem and then you go to Wasteland and you go into lud and all that it's it's. It's actually pretty. I think straightforward. But yeah I'll believe what I see it. I'm not a huge Flanagan head. I don't really get the hype. I don't got why people like it. I haven't watched the shows though uh watched like one episode of that House on Haunted Hill thing and it was very boring so again believe it when I see it. I think that I the way I would deal with blizzard of glass is I would not have it as like a separate series or spin-off or anything. I would have it interspersed through the show like as a parallel. Narrative I I also think that uh would work given like the themes of you know time and uh the way that like time and space are are like conceptual categories that you can kind of move through do.

I think dollar hegemony can be broken who has an interest in. Breaking. Dollar hegemony is the question if the Chinese want to break dollar hegemony they would have to liberalize their markets or their their Finance markets. They would have to get rid of their Capital controls and if they did that what would be the then why what they lose the point of of doing it like. If the point of getting rid of dollar hegemony is so that you know you could have control over your own National destiny. The cost of doing that is giving up your  control over your National Destiny and giving it over to globalized finance foreign. They cannot that they cannot consume the way Americans can which means that they cannot uh replace us as consumers of Last Resort I mean like nobody there's no this is where the end of History thesis comes in.

Like there is no alternative conception of what of how to wake. This stuff work because what it is at the end of the day is supply chain. It is a movement of goods from one place to another. It is a movement of resources from one place to another and energy inputs from one place to another that's it how how governments specifically carry out. Their domestic politics is secondary to that and that was the big thing that the uh that's the part of the the uh end of History thesis. This is wrong because there was the assumption that you have to have certain liberal Democratic structures in order to have a liberalized economy and we know now that's not true. That was just the thing you tell yourself do while you're busting open these people's economies and destroying their standards of living in Eastern Europe as well. It'll this will facilitate this awesome new liberal design oh nope. There it is gone so it says capitalist in Germany doesn't need the end of History any more than monarchist hegemony method of History.

We're talking about the first time ever that you have a fully totalized system that's the difference you can't compare it to any other time. Again. It is a supply chain and that supply chain is what keeps systems of power elite structures of power intact which is what all this is serving and there's no ins there. Nobody in any system at any level of power has an interest in undermining their own power. If they did. It would only be as an individual and then they would be neutralized and replaced the seats pick. The people sitting in them vice versa rather than vice versa. Now the thing that might make this whole thing break down faster than it would due to ecological conditions is if our Elites basically go insane from their inability to square their powerlessness. The echo went away Jesus Christ. That's not how this is not supposed to work. The internet technology is not supposed to work this way. It's not supposed to fix itself. This is AI is that how AI works foreign. We do have the these this.


Uh these Elites embedded within global capitalism who are going crazy who are insane due to their awareness of their their relative lack of actual agency. They get the res. They get the benefits. They they're still wealthy but not really because of anything that they do. It is all happening without their uh input and that is driving the mat. It's alienating them from the system that benefits them they're alienated from it. Just as much as people at the bottom are now. That's true of you know the the the tech. The finance people too the people in in the in unmoored capital. They might not have the same cultural adherence at what's being built by capitalism. But they do have a sense of guilt associated with it that they try to expiate and so alienation is increasing at every level not just at the bottom and in that middle strata of wealth and power is where you have the greatest concentration of alienation matched to the greatest theoretical ability to  things up to put a wrench uh in or put not a wrench.

In the gears you gotta wrench in the gears uh whatever let's stick in the spokes uh if ever if enough of them act at the same time along the same. Uh axis of uh resistance they could bring it down and I think that's the thesis behind you know the accelerationist. Embrace of uh of like. The reactionary current of capital is that they will bring it down maybe but the thing is uh. I really don't think that they can do that in a productive way all they can do is what the Nazis did which is tear off some portion of uh of of the global system and send it to war send it to annihilatory war with the rest. Uh nothing comes out of that better uh except for maybe if you're fighting in it you get to feel a purpose for life in in that moment. Before Destruction people keep talking about the multi-polar world and I still don't know what the hell that means if. It's all one supply chain. If it's all one global extraction system where the the the the type the type of political economies made by the building of capitalism are essentially unchangeable. I guess the idea is the thought is in a multi-polar world people would uh discrete.

States would be able to challenge their their ranking their their their placement within the hierarchy. They cannot do that us depends on China. Not the other way around what are you talking about everyone depends on everybody else. It's. All mutually reinforcing where the hell does China send their. They make who buys it. Uh. I think like guys like Elon I don't think they're trying to bring down anything intentionally. But they are having this disruptive impulse just because they're just one just individual  in a system who have no understanding of their greater role within it and are able to act independently in a way that previous generations of ruling class. Elites could never do on an individual basis and that is destabilizing but I think the Revolutionary or or like uh. Disruptive capacity of that is over rated by some because it underestimates the degree to which instability is a defining permanent feature of globalized capitalism. Foreign that's on thorium nuclear power and its potential of offering I have no idea what that is where if you I'm gonna guess you have to dig it up. Somewhere. Maybe the Chinese will crack cold fusion and then all this fretting is for nothing. I mean all the fretting for nothing anyway because you know. This is only one world among very many and I think we really do eternally exist.


Moving through them. I have to say uh somebody asked about food reviewing that is that is content that I relate to I have to say Tolkien or Martin. That is not a contest. I know it's unfair to prefer Martin since he's building on Tolkien and tolkien's like the originator. But I don't. He does not speak to me at all. I mean my my doctor as I said my uh. My. Uh Lord of the Rings is The Dark Tower books. I was like I'm an American what the  give me a gun. It's very interesting. Though there's the people shooting up the substations is certainly an escalation although why or who it is is I mean I think people are jumping to some pretty wild conclusions about what where that's coming from with basically zero uh understanding or evidence of it. Foreign uh people ask about the Battle of tourists and what would what if Martell had lost uh you know you you look at the the Muslims in uh in Andalusia and then you look at the uh the Ottomans in the Balkans Baltic or Balkans.

There there does seem to be just a a territorial limit uh to how much you can really take over Europe uh. It is it. It is a very odd uh Geographic duck. It is it's this rump of Eurasia that is resistant to Central Command and uh had been since the end of the Romans. The Romans only only were only able to do it because they were able to more effectively Marshal military resources than any other power because their original army was made up of. Yeoman. The original Yeoman fantasy was built in Rome. It was built among the small-holding Roman farmers who who served militarily essentially as uh as their contribution to the state foreign and then eventually other states caught up other political formations caught up and you know the latter fundus Latta fundias are created and there's the mass uh uh proletarian or the mass uh loss of of small holding prop farming replaced by giant slave plantations.

People move into the to Rome to live on the Dole to eat the bread and watch the circuses uh and once and that's an inevitable outcome of that kind of uh Colonial domination and that that's the end of that and then once that's over nothing can replace it. But the Roman that dream is persisted and the the actual Empire never ended and now it's everywhere now. The Roman Empire is. The whole is controls the whole world uh in that the Roman conception of the self. The Roman conception of freedom Roman values are our values and they are incompatible with the finite resources they're in because they refuse to recognize uh Humanity.

As such the real Civil War hinge point is. Uh order is as Harry turtledove pointed out is if uh if the federals don't get a hold of Lee's orders when he invaded Maryland. But there is also I guess you could say what if Long Street had been listened to and they tried to outflank uh Mead's Army and the third day of Gettysburg instead of the direct frontal assault uh but because vicksburg's happening at the same time that might have also just prolonged things you've got to say think though that like the longer the U.S the Civil War if the U.S Civil War lasted a little longer it would have been better like yeah like he doesn't necessarily win. But he has a chance if he if he goes to uh Maryland if he's able to successfully invade Maryland.

I don't know I mean to be honest. I always feel a little uncomfortable doing the hinge points of any kind because you sort of have to start out acknowledging that you're just doing nonsense you're just having a like a fun time you're basically uh. It's it's like sports radio and it's not. It doesn't really tell you anything about about history other than the fact that specifically I feel like uh this iteration of the human social animal has reached its uh attenuation when uh the the technological regime that has been used to facilitate class rule throughout most of human history has reached the point of intensity where it has overtaken uh human will and how increasingly our lives are not our own in a way that has never been true historically. But I will say it's fun. They're very fun like hey what Napoleon uh taking over Egypt that is amazing to think about leading a bunch of  around Lincolnshire or whatever that's just it's fun to think about and that's all we're having at this point is fun and we have to sort of come to terms with that I guess I do anyway I am going to read years of rice and salt. At some point I I almost bought a copy of a Goodwill one time and I idiotically didn't but I will read it. I mean we're already seeing the rise of privatized militias uh that is going to be a feature but like even that uh is going to involve strategic Retreats because obviously you can send mercenaries into places that capital is otherwise afraid to invest. But uh that perimeter is still going to have to be uh retrenched and retreated from robot.


Voice is back what the  what is going on check audio input mixer oh man oh boy that sounds scary. I don't think I will definitely not now because that's a recipe for disaster. I don't know I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do technical stuff. I never have ketchup catsup ketchup ketchup yep. That's me.

I apologize for honkler all day and every day that is my main uh daily chore is to apologize for honkler. I call people up at random and say look he didn't mean it okay. He's just trying to have a good time. He's trying to honk how do I talk to my normally friends about politics without being insufferable. Oh that's a tough one because politics are insufferable. It is it's essentially a fandom that unlike that is uniquely uh uh obnoxious because of its uh pretensions to gravity. Uh I would say one way is wait until somebody else breaks something up don't try to wedge it. In don't try don't wait for a gap in conversation and drop in politics.

I have a real microphone I've showed you multiple times. This is a microphone look at it. It's got all the stuff that a microphone's supposed to have. It's got a the pop cover or whatever you call it wait a minute. So it's not the microphone. The mic's not on it's plugged in desktop. Audio is muted what about that. How's that does that sound better is that better oh my god wow. It's going crazy all right. I clicked on a thing yeah. That's right I'm a genius. I think I'm doing this on I think this entire microphone setup is. I got one of these input dealies. It doesn't mean. Can't even it doesn't even you. It's not even on good. Lord right you're I'm but apparently it's not for your listening pleasure because none of it's actually working who was the 30 years guy who was obsessed with some cream queen.

That was uh that was uh Christian Brunswick. The mad hellber statter he was called he was totally sprung on uh princess Elizabeth the wife of the elector palentine Frederick V uh he was horned up to in the extreme for her uh it was actually kind of embarrassing for everyone involved and he was he he held on. After the uh. The the heidelbergians were driven out of Prague and he was spent years fighting almost by himself uh in their cause because of how horned up he was. It's pretty funny yeah. JB pritzker does not have that dog in him and it always depended like any fantasy about him doing anything required that dog to be in him and the dog is not in him. The dog has Departed the world. Nobody's got the dog in them anymore and that's what people are trying to reclaim uh but they're too dependent. Everyone is too dependent on the dog removing engine that they live uh enmeshed. Within the dog has moved on we're in a dogless world yeah. The only guy I can think of who's had that dog in him is the dude who shot Shinzo Abbott and that's gonna be it. Like the people who are gonna have the dog still in them are those who are willing to take the consequences of confrontation with authority. That's how I know I got no dog.

I gotta say one of the one of the it is interesting how people in America for a while there loved wanting to shoot political figures and then they just stopped stopped wanting to shoot political figures. They didn't want to stop shooting people uh they just didn't want to shoot political figures anymore weird weird how that happened and when the funniest failed assassination attempts of a historical figure was this guy who tried to kill Andrew Jackson Andrew Jackson was coming down the steps of the capitol. The dude walked up to him and he had two pistols in his hand and he leveled them right at Jackson's chest pulled both triggers and both guns uh misfired and then Jackson took his Cane and started beating the  out of the guy and his the guys with him actually had to pull the president off of his would-be assassin. So that's pretty funny apparently that the I mean I'm interested in the new JFK files. The the Jefferson Morley claims that they're going to show that that whole deal where he got busted uh pamphleting for the fair play for Cuba committee and then went on local television to talk about. It was a CIA op uh that he was doing that as as an agency uh asset which uh I gotta say credit to Oliver Stone. That's I remember seeing in JFK when they're talking about that and uh Lori Metcalf says like people said that it looked staged looks like that was uh yeah. New Orleans looks like that was in fact Sage. I mean we'll see if it's true well. There wasn't a CIA substation. The address on the pamphlets was to guy bannister's office and Guy Bannister. Former FBI agent had a lot of connections. He's a guy who you know if you look at the people he's surrounded with himself with uh was deep in like the uh the Castro. Uh the anti-castro resistance people who were all a lot of them on agency payrolls. They knocked down uh the office that that building the guy that guy Bannister uh had his office in uh like the next like a year later like it was already gone by Kennedy's assassination and it's now a uh federal building named after Hale Boggs who was a congressman from Louisiana who was on the Warren Commission and who died in a small plane accident. Yeah.


I think that's why I'm focusing more and more on History because every time I try to think about the current moment or or or where it's headed. I just kind of get depressed and confused and uh kind of angry and and annoyed with myself more than anything uh. But when I think backwards of the stuff that I have some sort of grasp of the Contours on it's just reassuring so I guess. That's why I do history because it is fun uh and it does help you place yourself in a context but increasingly convinced it doesn't really tell you much beyond that nobody can tell the future. But yet we are kind of expected to understand it. You know we're expected to be able to anticipate where it goes because of how rapidly things are changing without changing at all.

I think Gangs of New York is got a lot of problems as a movie whereas There Will Be Blood is pretty much like a like a perfect instrument. Although Daniel Day Lewis is performance in gangster York is is one of my favorites yeah they stopped throwing eggs at people. Not even forget shooting people people don't even get eggs thrown at them anymore. Somebody threw an egg at the king that was cool are there going to be any more movies. I think movies are on the on the way out that's one thing. I think I feel pretty confident about the economy. The economics of film just don't work anymore and that's you know to be expected. Like these things are all contingent on uh. Like art forms and stuff are all contingent on specific constellations of economics and technology and the the filmmaking experience and film. Uh uh exhibition business was premised on one specific constellation of technological and economic factors that are now changing fundamentally. I think the theatrical experience will maybe last for a while as the place to go to see massive tentpoles along intellectual property but even that is going to uh in the medium term. Not even long term.

Uh fade away and then content will just be at your fingertips on the smallest possible screens or the largest one you can fit in your house but that's it eventually I I I don't I don't know if the kids I mean I I don't know if they even want to watch films or even shows. Anymore. I I think we just kind of want to watch each other now that we can that's the thing it's nobody's making an aesthetic choice. It's it's that we are have access to certain technological forms that then train us to want them yeah. I know I know oh uh. Everyone says that of the kids today but the technology is changing the way people live. Like you have to acknowledge that and you have to acknowledge that there has been a technological revolution in the last 20 years that has reordered our relationships to each other. That is true whether or not it is also something that an old person says about things that are alienating to them.

Television did the same thing together cocoa melon what the hell is that that sounds that sounds. Insidious you could indeed say that Video Killed the dang Radio Star and then the tick tock killed the video star and uh bathing in like the the neural hyper. Sludge network will kill the tick tock star but what they saw what what you're seeing. In that trajectory is a steady inward Drive uh from from the mass experience of a bunch of people strangers sitting in a room watching one movie to a group of people a family sitting in their homes and watching television to an individual looking at their phone or their television screen or their computer screen. That's that is that you can trace that and that's that's an objective trajectory and it's it deepens the sense that we are not that no one else is real. I have been meditating a bit lately trying to do more. It's good get my brain tingly but yeah people are trying to recreate sociology by themselves and that that's that's a tall order and that means what they're going to end up. Doing is filling in the blanks filling in the gaps with stuff that they think is them. They think comes from them but as always is is being uh supplied to them walkable cities. When well you know walkable anything would be interaction. Third places would help a lot neom hilariously neom is it's the it's the uh walkable Urban dream which of course makes sense because there can be no other socially envisioned uh uh Horizon other than the one promised by socialism.

But the version of it sold by Elon Musk and the Saudis is an illusion. It's a it's a fraud that can never be fulfilled because the thing that builds that world is a social order that is fundamentally unalienated. The labor that goes into it is the willed labor of individuals working in concert like if you have a place like neom and even if they could build it. The fact that uh it would require slaves would destroy it and even if they think they can get to the level of automation that means the slaves don't have to be in there with them and that everybody in there is uh a equal. They're still the same people who made that world who made the the desert outside who made everything else Barren and they'll go wild they'll go crazy uh if anyone's seen zardas very good on the subject. But even these countries that have all the money in the world and are able to get almost infinite cheap labor to build them are not being able to succeed getting them done.

I mean even with neon they built a whole they built. They built a hole they're showing. People look at the hole and it's a fraction of the size of the one that they claim that they would need yes. Uh James Cameron of course could build Neil. He basically did build Neil in New Zealand well. We'll all find out how what is in the way of the water. Maybe we all come out of uh out of Avatar wave water next week and we're on Pandora and we didn't even know it no of course. Not. It's fun to think about though it's fun to think about and that's what we're all doing out here at the end of History having fun thinking about things all right. I'm gonna think of another book. Though I think another book project would be good. If anybody has any uh suggestions please. Let me know doesn't have to be about China. Uh any specific tangents varieties. We can talk about happy too but yeah in the lookout and now. Maybe I'll have one for next week to to put out there. Bye.
