 we interrupt critter vision to bring you. This important news president donald trump has out his due due ass. Early reports indicate that the due ass has been lost in the sewer system of the white house. As a result the president is now assless that's right president the flash coming from washington apparently official 5 pm eastern standard time. The president has lost his due to s ah so he's going home tonight so everything's fine. I don't know why everyone was freaking out thinking that he might be sick. He'll be fine. They just pumped him full of a They pumped him full of hunter s thompson's trunk load of experimental drugs. Over the course of like three. Days he's gacked out on mind bending steroids and they're. Gonna send him home because he's bored it's fine. I don't know why anyone is saying anything other than that you're pretty owned if you think that he's got any problems that he's in trouble at all he'll be fine.

We're on track now for the herman cain which would be the funniest possible outcome he runs he does not die before the election he runs. He loses to biden in a kind of an anticlimactic landslide and then he dies like a week later of comand that is officially. I've looked at it by any metric. That's by cosmic irony by just just desserts. I mean just removing the fact of joe biden being elected president while being completely unaware of his surroundings. That's funny regardless of who he's running against you put these things together and then him dying of the disease that he said didn't have exist for six months. It's too funny for words so that's why I'm thinking it might have to happen is because he is on the herman cain track because herman chain recovered he was doing good for a little bit there and then but I will say this trump might not die. He is already an abomination. He is a medical oddity that he's alive regardless of coronavirus. This human refrigerator of pig meat this guy who's hard as a canned ham being alive.

At this point is is absolutely defiant of all science and reason so he could survive kobe but I don't think his swag will ever come back. I don't think he will ever be the trump who haunts the nightmares of libs and jolts the groins of our nation's mega faithful or amuses the the coping and allegedly detached overproduced elites who listen to podcasts but like he's not gonna be able to golf never gonna be able to go like they said. Today they asked him does he have did he have lung damage and they said that's a hipaa violation. They said what his like his body is cashed who might live for another 20 years like just hovering around in one of those dune sensor belts. But he's he's never going to be the swaggering pimp. Rolling rolling through hooting crowds throwing out plague infested hats to him.

 he's absolutely leaving against a medical advice. There's I mean you not only was he leaving against the medical device. He also took a bunch of experimental high highly dangerous drugs for old people because they told him to because he told them to it's called vip syndrome or something like that where like if you have enough because doctors can only kind of like browbeat you into doing things using their authority over you as medical professionals and eventually for most people. Your confidence gives out in the face of medical certainty but trump not only is his confidence never going to give out in the face of anything. He is the president of the united states he's got the nuclear football three feet from it. At any time so he took all those crazy drugs with just because he wanted he wanted to get it over with. He wanted to fix it because this whole thing has always been finding a silver bullet to just fix it because he doesn't want to think about it anymore okay. He doesn't want to think about anything revolving around vulnerability or frailty because it's because death is is what stalks him because his consciousness is the only thing that's real in the universe. He can't even conceive of his own death which is why he acted the way he did after he got diagnosed which is amazing he went to a like going to ohio and throwing his hat into the crowd okay. Like those people he they're nothing.

They're they're they're pawn swan. He has no he has no respect or need for them but he went to a 250 000 a plate fundraiser in new jersey and coughed all over the buffet for a bunch of high level that republican donors like you either do that because you are some sort of like sneaker agent like there was a joke early in his term that he was actually some maoist third world is trying to bring the empire down from within or you just don't even think of it like the idea oh no they're gonna. I mean obviously you don't care if anybody else gets sick but there are certain people you probably wouldn't want to get sick because it makes it harder for you to do whatever you want to do. But that's still you can't like split the baby that way. There's nothing but delusion all the way down and that I think is why it's useful to talk about capitalism as only operating out of its own perceived self-interest because even though it is this algorithm you know the value form that dictates human decisions. You know at the There still has to be a human involvement in directing like the optimal you know flows and living that life of of you know maximal profits extraction or or the life of um being amongst people.

These people these these lizards these non-human entities who rule over us who's who have no human feelings like they do not have human feelings. The way that regular people do which was always was very useful about limited people as a metaphor because they are reptilian even if they aren't actual reptiles But what that means but you can't live that way. You can't live as a human being constrain. The way humans are like you're gonna die. Like this is all gonna end everything you've done everything you've piled up. It's just going to sit there and someone else is going to use it and you're. It's not going to be you and like dealing with that reality is what brings us to groundedness. It brings us to an awareness of our vulnerability and our and the value of others because others will be here after you're gone and if you truly value other people you will find sucker in their persistence after your death and it will make dying being aware of your death getting closer to it over time more bearable.

But they don't have that so they just have to believe they have to deny that it is going to happen like they are psychically fixed around an idea of their consciousness persisting eternally and like the ones who think they're smart channel that into life extension. And the dumber ones like trump just don't even think about it. They just pretend it won't happen and when they do have to think about it they get a little angsty and then they do something else and then the thing is. That's why they're miserable because at least like a peter teal guy can have some sort of some sort of at the you know right before night comes when you're getting ready to sleep and there's that that existential chill like he can think oh yeah. No. I'm gonna. Their technology isn't there yet. But I'll just take enough of this teenager blood serum to keep me younger so that I'll make it to 150 and then the robots will be there to take me into my deep nine billions.

But trump doesn't have that what he has is nothing and so he is miserable every moment of his life god that thing about him about him freaking out and going am I going to go out like stanchera am. I going to go out like stancham is dumb buddy from new york real estate and that's the thing it's like stancher was a friend of his. They hung out but now he's dead and does he matter at all does. Trump think about him at all. No the whole the thing he can't imagine is well that'll be me that'll be me someday that will be me sometime can't handle it and that makes that means that he not only what it does is yes obviously makes him a bad person one of the worst people we have but it also makes him dumb. It makes him bad at even accomplishing his goals because it requires him to delude himself and the thing is is that up until now that hasn't really hurt him because all he's really had to do at any given moment was have people pay attention to him like he didn't like we've I've talked about. It's not like his genius was never business related.

It was getting famous and being famous because that's what gave him a sense of validity. That's what kept death away was the idea that he was known if other people know that you exist and other people are talking about you. Then you will never die and and he was and he's been so singularly driven towards that goal and so good at it that it has led him to the presidency because he coincidentally happened to exist at this precise. Moment in american history is as things were sliding towards this you know total subsumption into spectacle the one person in the position to embody that spectacle was donald trump but now there's a thing covet that does not actually care about fame like. It actually is a leveler not in the sense that it affects everyone equally because obviously it affects the most vulnerable most but a thing that could hypothetically get you no matter what and of course he made it happen by treating it like a not a big deal because he had to treat it like a nautical deal like people say he's a germaphobe. I don't think that's really true.

I think he thinks people are disgusting and he doesn't want to touch them. I don't think he thinks he's going to get sick. He's afraid of getting sick in an abstract sense just like he's afraid. He's gonna die in an abstract sense. But I do not think that he thinks of it in concrete terms of like getting sick in a specific way you know like. He's not a hypochondriac around specific ailments because that's too real It's he's just repulsed by everyone and they just call it germaphobia but he because the real germaphobe would have taken precautions against getting the goddamn virus and he didn't do it and that wasn't just him like well. I denied it was real so. I have to live that truth no he denied it was real because that was true to him and now and he was making it true to everyone else and that meant that he was gonna treat it and he was gonna be cavalier and now even though he was a person probably best position in this country. Not to get it he hasn't and it's going to him up. There's no way it doesn't. You can only think a guy like that is immortal until he dies just like him and the reality of it is hitting him and like so he's he's suffering more than usual right. Now he is in pain even if he doesn't die. He's in real pain nothing's going to happen. I don't know what that means. I mean something happens every day of every every day something happens. What do you mean nothing. He's not gonna die well. Then something else is gonna happen if that doesn't happen nothing is gonna happen.

This can never be true oh man. I watched saturday night live last night. I mean it was a kind of reassuring to have it back but then you watch it and you just see the way that they try to take something like that debate that we watched which was a psychotic carnival of late imperial decadence like. But um they turned it into something relatively normal and then of course. They brought in kamala because like if you take that at face value those two old men going at it like that and neither one of them having anything in their head but but like the ghosts of ideas and and memories and slights and and and without any connection to a greater project without any ability to express or direct the flow of events running for president. It's genuinely like. I said it's freeing but also if you have any sense if you have any investment in the system. Terrifying and nothing has more investment in the system than something like snl snl's existence. Snl exists to normalize everything as it happens and turn it into just fodder and and strip it of any context and strip it of any implications so you watch if you're a regular lib. If you're an snl viewer or snl writer you watch that debate the thought is oh. It's okay because there's harris because there's a vp because there's a whole party who's gonna catch us. Even though if a guy like biden can get in that position and that's the position we vote for then clearly something is off. In this equation we have we've un. We have miscalibrated the power dynamics in a potentially fatal way but that's okay because there's a hair come on mommy. Kamala is going to come mommy. Kamala is going to come and she's going to rest our head in her bosoms and lull us.

Asleep was a nice a nice soft caribbean lullaby just fantasy just fantasy Jim carrey wasn't that good. I thought jason sudeikis honestly was pretty good when he was on the show and he did bite because he did it like a big dumb labrador retriever he wasn't senile enough but maybe they could have given him a little a little of that now because he mostly played him when you know during the 2016 and after that when he was still mostly known for just being a loud mouth and not and his brain hadn't really shut off now shut off completely. I don't really get what jim carrey brought to it or why he's doing it. It's very odd don't get it um. Somebody asked me about lovecraft country. I've spoken a number of times about lovecraft country. I I've stopped watching it. They went to korea and I'm like okay no We're not we're not intersecting with everybody on this. This is exactly what you don't want but I just i. I brought it up because this person reminds me that trevor from champaign sharks who was a good podcast in his good twitter account He had a thread about lovecraft country and I thought it really hit the nail on the head in terms of one of the deep things wrong with it beyond. Just the woke pandering.

It's that it's clearly written by yes I'm sure the writer's room was was was was diverse as hell and and majority black probably but clearly not working class clearly not anyone who's struggled in their life. Because the concerns of these characters who were black people in 1950s chicago the racism they experienced is very much filtered through the concerns of like the bourgeois like moving into a white neighborhood or you know dealing with white co-workers. Like these are all the stuff of modern racial microaggressions which you know um are part of the greater pr phenomenon of american racism but are the least grounded in material conditions. The most epiphenomenal to the system we have but the characters in this in the show. You know that they don't suffer they're not dealing with racism in a class intersection at all because the people making it have no context for that that's true of the people who make all this. Art which is why the representation argument is so hollow because at the end of the day it's just a representation of different strata of the bourgeois of relatively well-off people arguing about racism and and class and gender issues through their their least consequential lens not unconsequential not meaningless but farthest from the the center of gravity of these oppressions which is where people are economically vulnerable. I'm not talking like obviously. They have a lot of like intense stuff like they got shot in the diner and whatever. But but that's but that's like with the horror genre stuff as opposed to the characters concerns themselves Apparently they they showed the emmett till funeral playing the song cruel summer by bananarama. I don't see that to me doesn't really feel like anything other than than just a project that is unmoored to real pain. You know it just seems like. It's people play acting towards oppressions that they've only experienced an echo of so.

I'm done with it. I'm done with it. Everyone's excited about for telly tutti good old francis telling capitalism to back off. I mean it's a good sign. I'm certainly. I'd rather have francis than benedict right now but you know it's. It's a. It's a real question how any institution as borobun does. The catholic church can really participate from the top down anyway in any meaningful movement. But it's it's not terrible I have not seen. I didn't know. I thought the good lord bird was starting in november. I'm pleased to see. It started. I'll watch it tonight and I will report back on the next stream I am I'm.

I'm a little worried It feels a little. It felt like. I said it feels a little soy. It feels like john brown is a little epic. They're trying to make him relatable or whatever where they're trying to make the whole thing relatable which I think is the opposite of what you should do with that material. You should make it as forward and alien as possible to make you have to re-examine this like over the chasm of time as opposed to trying to make it make it realistic or like relatable to to people in our position. But I'm not sure yet. I have to see it.

I still wish. I sure sure wish. It was michael shannon. I mean ethan hawks okay. He was really good in really good in first or formed but the trailer didn't give me a lot of health. A little report back and then I think depending on how it is.

I might do an inebriated past chapo about john brown. I know that the dollop just did a three-parter but I would do it more as like john brown in the context of the civil war and like his role in leading us to a civil war like his what he what he means to like the broader anti-slavery politics of the time and then of course his memory and culture. After that what comes after trump for the gop. This is of. Course a question that's on everyone's mind now that the might be on death's door and I've been thinking about it. A lot lately and I think that you will see in the immediate demise of trump. Either. He loses in a humiliating way or I i the joke of like oh. He's gonna you know like come back and run in 2024. I think that I mean now especially with the kovid that's off the table. I don't think that's going to happen so that means trump is going to be gone soon and the question is how who's going to fill that role and I don't think any one person can.

I think that he was so sue generous. I mean he is susan. Harris in every respect like his body is how he is a defiance of science and god to be alive and he defies political reality. When he emerged on the scene. He had a combination of in a fame and the specific type of fame like he was.

He was famous for being rich but not in the way that like steve forbes was because steve forbes ran for president as like a rich guy who was going to run things like a business and got his ass kicked. Even though he had the flat tax as a gimmick one is because taxes aren't really what's going to move people you need something more flashy. If you're going to run a celebrity only campaign a celebrity first campaign and two he was a dork trump was famous for being famous but also he was famous for being or he was famous for being rich but he was also famous for being famous like he was. He had a tv show he was charismatic. People knew him in the same context that they knew other celebrities who they watched in performances and his performance was of a rich successful executive who made tough decisions like he was literally like the way almost identical to the way that the president of ukraine is a guy who played the president of ukraine on a tv show. It's that same level where where the spectacle has subsumed the real um and that's unique no one else is going to be in that position. No one else has that kind of fame or like maybe they have a shadow of it. But he's been alive for 30 years so that means that he's not like mark cuban younger people might know him but like great grandpa. I don't think grandparents know him people who vote don't know him.

Trump has been famous for being famous for 30 years. So he's known by everybody and that fame meant that he didn't even have to run put any money into his campaign. His campaign was treated as news in a way that other campaigns aren't campaigns of regular can regular politicians. They have to compete in the media for media attention. They have to do because they don't have a lot of money they're beginning. They have to pitch themselves in such a way that they can accumulate money. They can get backers and they can get donations and then they can buy er by by unearned media but the earned media. I mean he literally did earn that media but for being for being monomially fixated on being famous for the past 30 years 40 years or whatever he earned that media that's another thing that's totally individual to him He was able to run appealing to the core sensibilities of a huge percentage of democrat of republican-based voters by appealing to things like immigration above all else and having a specific big bro large-scale policy around the position of immigration. It wasn't just immigration. It was building the wall and he was able to do that while being totally independent of the party itself and having no being in a position to be totally unconstrained by that party's machinations like the party would never have let anybody go that ham on immigration. They had their white papers from the 2012 campaign that said romney lost in part because we alienated hispanics too much so we have we cannot be anti-immigrant in this country and so as our main focus and our main party platform if we want to scare these hispanics away. So they so anybody who had to be within the party and also the media like anybody. Other than trump had to was under the um discipline of both the media and the republican party because they require both the media and the republican party to even have a spot to get to a position of patronage by donors and then by the media in terms of attention and and bylines and and minutes on tv that he didn't need to pander to. There is no one in the aftermath of trump who meets those criteria.

Some people say tucker carlson but tucker carlson is not anywhere near as famous as donald trump is and while tucker carlson might have a similar effect in the um primaries of like galvanizing the largest chunk of former trump supporters. I do not think that his appeal translates the way that trumps did because trump's appeal was partially or significantly apolitical which trump carlson's is not and I think that you can wipe out any sitting officer. You can wipe off any um actual like political office holder off of being a comparison to trump cotton hawley. No one Desantis anyone who holds office if you hold office you are a regular politician which means you can you're not as famous as these guys as this guy and you can never be independent of the media or of the party the way that he could be and you're also a charisma vacuum because you're not famous. He is famous like. I joke about the my pillow guy but the micropolis guy's problem is that he isn't that famous either he's just like he's part. He's known by the same trump people who like tucker carlson um because we're not just talking about getting another nomination we're talking about competing for power and any of the guys who might plausibly gather in the trump base to a significant degree.

I don't think have the ability to transcend that base which is what made trump specific and a specifically meaningful political phenomenon and would make would make trumpism. An enduring political phenomenon is if it can compete for power and none of the people who are mentioned as potential successors to trump in my opinion fit that criterion. I would say though that one might emerge through the process of jockeying for position in the after aftermath of trump but who that is. I don't know the the times will tell that but one thing. I would say is. I think there will be a period of instability like the times of trouble in in russia after the death of of of good enough oh by the way. This I wanted to say this about trump and pence specifically before I forget so trump is was in the hospital for the weekend first president to be checked in the hospital. Since reagan got shot He was on a bunch of wild drugs including a very powerful steroids that are that have significant psychological side effects including mania and um hallucinations and at no point was anyone seriously talking about pence taking over no like him him. Holding power you know 25th amendment short term just and I think that speaks to the fact that trump is not not appointed a successor and certainly if he did pence is not it. The pets does not have what it takes to fill that spot and also that I don't think I mean. I think it more than anything it proves if trump has not been making executive decisions for a while like the joke would be well what if he gets on steroids and hits the hits the button that's a real possibility. If anyone in that room thought that they would let that happen you know what I mean. I think that at this point maybe there was at the beginning of his term. Maybe. There only has been recently but at some point the people in at the trigger points around trump have basically agreed either explicitly or implicitly amongst themselves that there are certain things that they don't tell him.

There are certain things that when he tells them they ignore like we know for a fact that he ordered the assassination of assad. This ordered it like wasn't just talking about it like told mattis to do it and mattis just said we're not gonna do it. We're not doing that so that means like he has not actually been the president in the way that we think of that job for a while if he ever was which is which which which makes the fixation on him as a person and our like. I was talking about after the debate our compulsion to scry through the entrails of his logaria to find meaning. All the funnier is that he's not even he's not even doing the job that you think he's supposed to be doing. He is just sitting there. He's watching tv the whole time like reagan and it's like. I think that's the thing people kind of get and maybe even walk around thinking in the back of their minds. But it doesn't prevent people from getting so round up I much prefer speculating on his physical health than like what his words mean that's if it's all going to be just This this senseless augury that at least augur around something funny and whether he's shooting his pants right now whether his brain is like cooked like. He's got a 110 degree fever and he's hallucinating that he's at studio 54 with with janice dickinson that's funny which of trump's children will seek the nomination. I honestly do believe that don jr is going to run for office because he is don. Jr was perfectly named because don gave him his exact personality problems but he has less of his dad's talents which is very much what happens with these families because they take the money more for granted. They have less to do with the actual business and they fill that with anxiety they fill that gap of effective leadership and control over their lives with with anxiety around specifically their him and his dad their dads because donald trump has been shaped his whole life by the absence of the love of his psychotic father as and the same thing is true of donald. Jr.

I mean apparently he after college went and was a ski bum in colorado and he wrote about it in his stupid book and he kind of talks of it wistfully and you could see that like there was a desire maybe for him to live his own life and he ended up going back to new york and working for his dad partially because he couldn't think of anything better to do and he was lazy and dumb and he wanted money without having to work for it and that was the easiest way to do that but honestly. I think more than anything it's because he thought if he did that he could get his dad to like it like like don. Don did like don became famous to make up for his father's lack of love. I know this is all very dime store psychiatry but like this is real you know like these kind of phenomenon like our our relationships with our parents and stuff. They are foundational and you can see with these famous people especially like the extravagant trauma that they're dealing with like their whole lives are expressions of us of course. Now donald is where's where his dad was his dad wouldn't quit his dad kept working well after he had alzheimer's and he and he would go into office and they would give him a phone that only went to his secretary and they would give him blank paper to write on which is of course. That's literally what they did with trump to have a photo op. They had him writing on blank paper and so now don. Jr has the same need and his dad is as disinterested in giving it to him.

As his dad was and now he's going to fill the gap he couldn't fill it with fame. The way his dad did because his dad was more charismatic than him and his dad was smarter at being famous. His dad was was a genius at being famous don. Jr isn't a genius. Don jr. Is a perfect mediocrity don. Jr is a perfect example of the absolute emptiness within our the the the most recent minting of our ruling class the copies of the copies of the copies. The failed sons fail sons and so he is going to go because he can't be famous. He could never get famous through his own talents. He's going to get famous the way that nerds and dorks and losers get famous and that is by politics. I mean he got famous basically as an accident because his dad did and now he's going to try to keep it going by running for something and I do think he's dumb enough to go straight for the presidency instead of even trying to build a base you know as a senator or something. But he or maybe somebody can talk him into running for senate and basically it basically will boil down to which political grifters get a hold of him and scam him somebody who's got a plan for him to run for a senator somewhere or governor or whatever or somebody who's just like yeah. No we're going to do a pump and dump on this jump pump and dump on the chump and just have him run for president and then skim all the donations for viral ads where him and nicholas sandman dab that wounded knee or something. But it's not going to be him. That's one thing. I can say his. He's not going to be the the the caliph. He's not gonna. He's not gonna be the he's not gonna follow m ammad. He's not gonna be alive. He just doesn't have any of it.

Ivanka people were very impressed by her speech I honestly just don't think her energy vibes with the gop. Now like what she does is very girl boss and it's very honestly. It's very democratic and the republicans. I think they want what their dad's putting out maybe it's different with women. I don't know but I could see her running for something. I just don't think she cares to do it. I don't think that she is seems terribly interested in doing it like you can see why don junior needs to do it. I don't think ivanka's in the same situation eric as stupid as he is is definitely smarter than the rest of them because he is appropriately arm's length.

This whole thing may be aware that it could definitely bite them all in the ass or some of them anyway and of course yes. The real answer to this is always baron. Baron is the god emperor. Baron is the quid sock harder rock baron will. It will imbibe the spice melange and fuse with the sand worm and rule over us eternally and declare interstellar jihad. We know this god. Kamala harris being president in six months is going to be such a primary contest just popping in there like hey. I'm the president now after having a president who's so fully who is such just the center of this storm of psychic energy to have somebody who barely anybody can muster a thought about. It's going to be very weird. That energy is going to have to go somewhere question is where does it go tulsi Tulsi could be the candidate who split who who leads q1 and someone said tulsi is a q a candidate. I mean if q see that's the real wild card is what happens with q not the trump base the smaller but distinct and growing section of that called cute the ones who have this religious fixation and have this this eschatological cosmology with trump at the center of I think. If trump dies they will think he's still alive.

They will he will become the occluded motty. There's no question of that the same way the jfk jay junior is going to come back. They're going to come back together at the right hand of jesus and they are going to really be looking for a messiah someone to herald the return of the king and who that is that will be interesting to see I guess don. Jr. Maybe could do that he could be the cue guy but among elected officials. Tulsi gabbard really stands out as the one to do that because her whole deal seems to be doing the trumpism stuff like like the whole trump vibe but without trump and the associated stuff of trump and if q anon gets like keeps accelerating and it's abstraction away from the original premise. Especially if trump dies it could become it could be. It could be adapted but we'll see we'll see they might love. They might love trump too much. They might they might get too fixated on the blood.

The blood is the life. The blood is the life. The blood is the life can we print money forever. I mean for the foreseeable future yes. I mean before the end if we're the end of the global supply chain. We're in as long as we're the global reserve currency. Now that might change people have talked about the chinese and the russians trying to move us away from the dollar but that carries a lot of other consequences with it that. I don't think any other that those other countries are really ready for yet. But I think it's inevitable honestly that we get off the dollar and it would be good to get off the dollar. It's just how we do it if it's part of like a trade war that'll be bad for everybody. I think but if it's part of like a mutual drawdown from global hegemony to like a true multi-polarity where we lose our position like we don't lose everything. But we lose our position as the the executive authority of global capitalism and we distribute that power more equitably so that would be good for us because it would require it would allow us to finally you know hopefully. It. All depends on like what the political like what the political background of it would be you know we're either gonna. We're either gonna build guns. We're either gonna be build bombs and planes and aircraft carriers to kill everyone until the wheels fall off or we will and then there's just no more dollar and then the whole thing collapses or we sort of spread that around lose our role as the global hegemon and most importantly military overlord and that allows us to recommit resources. We do have the real productive capacity we have we do have to.

I don't know building our own infrastructure creating a viable country instead of just a massive meth lab. But I mean if I if you had to ask me what's more likely it's going to be that we're just going to keep. Building building planes and bombs until but wall street isn't the only force. Someone says wall street is pushing for the loss of dollar hegemony. I'll tell you who else is pushing for the end of dollar hegemony. The trump administration and more broadly the american government in its overuse of sanctions like people take for granted that the us can just sanction another country and they don't really stop to think can anybody do that could you just sanction people. No you can't you can't control another country's economy unless you are the whole the one who prints the out of sanctions and as a result there's a growing resistance to them and the resistance to the dollar germany that underpins them but right now the response to trump died or trump dying but to trump getting sick.

I don't know this is obviously not really empirical irrational. I'm just talking from like my my individual perception and my visual emotional the the just the vibes. I'm picking up which of course they don't mean. But I after the convention after the debate I saw it. I kind of think people are just going to want to settle down like even though things are terrible and only going to get worse and it's like. We have an eviction crisis and 200 000 dead on its way to half a million and and you know the economy is is in a k-shaped recession a k-shaped recovery where although people who are worse off are going to suffer the most and for the most the most deeply it's terrible conditions but that rather than trump leading us to this confrontation point that I think a lot of people really thought was going to happen and I never did. But I could certainly see why people got to that point because he really was bringing us to a heightened point of of social paranoia that when you looked at it in connection with this you know incredibly bad economic and social condition in this country could make you connect one to the other and think this is happening. But I think what instead happened is that trump has proven to be sort of pre-figurative. Like he is he through a number of flukes popped up in advance of a like.

A true crisis of of political power and as a result that this election is ending up to be a big deflation of the politics bubble. Even though things are bad. I think because a lot of what we think of as like this political hot house is being stoked by people who have not really suffered. Those are the people who are the most politically engaged. During this period you can talk about how oh of course things could lead to confrontation and conflict look how bad everything is. It's like yes but people who are most directly affected by how bad everything is are generally the people who are least likely to be stoking this sense of political armageddon and I think we're gonna get. They see the horror of others and it stokes them further towards towards frenzy. But their frenzy is psychological in in origin not material and I think that that kind of thing can only be sustained for so long and I think that at the end of this election when he loses which I think he will and then certainly if he dies there's going to just be this popping this deflation of psychic energy. Not among his most deep supporters they're going to go into the cue hall and there will be stochastic political violence out of those people but I think even among a lot of republican voters. There's just going to be this exhale because the people who are most politically polarized. Right now are also the people least likely to want to risk. What comfort they do have you know to fight over resources that are still for them. Not scarce Somebody said will there be as much violence if trump dies as if biden wins. I honestly think if he dies there will be less violence because I think most people just the most fanatically fixated on it will just disbelieve it and like burrow deeper into a into a narrative which might which will put them farther from the snapping point. Like that's why that's why him losing an election definitely caused a number of people to snap because there's no way out of that one. There's somebody else on tv. That's there's the thing called the president and it's not him anymore that's a real thing and he's over there not being president anymore.

But like if if he's just gone he could be anywhere he could be anywhere he could be. He could be. He's occluded he's he's he's the the king in the mountain sleeping and awaiting his resurrection and that's not gonna work for all of them. But I think a lot of them who might otherwise have snapped are. Gonna are gonna retreat further into fantasy. But I think even some q people honestly might just wheel back and say okay that was weird you know like when they were really into amway or something kind of a vaguely embarrassing chapter of their life that they don't want to talk about you know.

I know that sounds like oh that's pollyanna that's like biden saying the fever will break. I don't think that's true I think by the time you know but by the time buying this campaign like presidency really gets in there whether it's him or harris you're going to see an explosion of political brinksmanship among republican governors like guys like desantis to set recession threats it's going to go wild. I'm just saying is that in the immediate aftermath there's just going to be a law. I don't know how long it'll last maybe it gets 100 days but then it's going to explode again. Baby apparently so many some number of people have insisted that these are blue jays congratulations to anybody who can tell that I that's I don't have that kind of birding knowledge as for governing. Nothing will get done biden's not going to accomplish and the way you'll know that is when they if the senate obviously if the republicans keep the senate nothing's going to happen period except for a grand bargain. But if they keep the senate or if they lose the senate and then the senate votes to keep the filibuster nothing but without trump there to stir the pot. It's going to be harder to get people emotionally invested in that you know what I mean you need that figure there just drawing all those eyeballs that entertainer in chief which I don't think biden or harris is going to be. I think at this point the democrats could definitely take the senate. Polling is looking very bad in a number of for a number of republicans who I kind of assumed were gonna do okay like jody ernst until a few months ago. I thought was pretty pretty much assumed to get reelected and now it looks like she's honest obvious. She's done for like she's down by over 10 points. She's hell. Alaska's seat is apparently tied lindsey. Graham is in genuine trouble so is tom tillis. I don't know how much the dorky sex scandal with his democratic opponent is going to matter. I don't. I mean does that stuff matter anymore at all. I honestly don't think it does susan. Collins is done cory gardner in colorado is finished. That's a lot. I mean.

I think that doug jones is going to lose but I think he'll be the only one they lose and if he's the only democrat who loses and they lose five something like that oh yeah. Marty. Mcsally's gonna lose in arizona hell. John ossoff might win in georgia. Like all you need is like. I say all you need is what four of those to go even if you don't hold on to even if you don't hold on to jones and yeah someone says doug. Jones is gonna win. I just saw a poll that had tuberville up by like 10 so. I don't know. It is alabama but I i honestly do hope I am rooting for the democrats to win the senate. I'm earnestly rooting not because I think it will unnecessarily lead to anything but just in terms of you know. If my job is in a in one sense to put it pretentiously political education. You can't get much more politically. Politically educating than watching Democrats take power and refuse to use it on principle of course for those democrats. They'll never ever ever realize what's happening. But it's not about all of them. It's not about the center mass. It's about the edges. It's about shaving off the edges. A new nbc poll has trump up 14. I'm assuming not nationally what state oh biden up 14. Okay. I thought something because that's what. I'd seen. I saw fighting up by turkey yeah. Like this is where we were on the trajectory towards happening in 2016 as people point out. But hillary is deeply deeply unpopular in a way that biden just isn't people like by in fact. Biden's favor abilities have gone up over the past four months. He was like net negative like 10 this summer. He is now plus two in favorability in the tracking goal people like it at least they don't in comparison to trump. He is more reassuring. His his brand of senility is less threatening. It's less ang it's less anxiety. I mean if you were going to be in the day room think of it.

This way if you were going to be stuck in the day room of a nursing home with trump or biden who would you rather hang out with who would you rather watch wheel of fortune with and there's gonna be no. I mean there's zero percent chance that there is a comey letter type situation. Like that's not going to happen. There will be no comey letter if anything there's gonna be more with trump and the coven hurting him because you're in the you are in the day room of the nursing home. You are also an old geezer you're. In this scenario. You are in the nursing home because you are all so old and about to die. Just like we are all in the nursing home that is the united states. We are all watching the tv in the day room at the nursing home waiting for the day when we don't wake up Biden is also in a situation where he doesn't have to debate again because he can rightfully say this guy's gonna. Give it to me. He's gonna give me a disease but I'm I don't know if trump's gonna be in a position to debate next week because I think we are. I think some people are really not taking seriously the possibility that he is really really physically because they gave him drugs that are only for use with very severe patients that have that have documented side effects specifically on elderly people. Also the the most dangerous period for the disease in terms of its likelihood to cause like a fatal. Heart or lung issue is like 10 days into symptoms which is next weekend hard time. Immediately. There's gonna be another debate I do. I do think it's funnier if he dies after the election than before which is why. I think that's what will happen but he honestly could die. I took log off to heart.

I dropped off out of grad school and moved on to a sailboat hell yes sailboat. That's where it's at you got a boat. You global warming. I've got every can every possible condition covered. I have considered the angles so smart move and don't we love beautiful boaters. Folks don't we love the beautiful boaters we love the people in the boats. But of course the beautiful motors don't have sailboats. They have big old outboards because sailing requires skill and ability and discipline and these people don't have any of that which is what makes them so disgusting to be our rulers because they are the don juniors. They are the the second sons of the second sons of empire and they have done nothing to attain the power that they have they wield it with absolute lack of of respect for it. Acknowledgement of its power terrible. It's it's a good example. Like you know the old wasp elite. They sailed you know because they were They were they were part of that ruling class that saw itself as distinct and that felt that it needed to have certain things to ratify that like george w h bush the last boss and now they've been replaced by people who never had that like the the the people who who succeeded the american dream by just acquiring that that's that's that that was the the the unifying like class destroying power of america is that it removes no bless oblige from power and you know in a respect that's good because it unmasks power. It removes its its its performance of virtue and its performance of um dessert you know but also it's just kind of gross. It's gross to watch and also there they don't have the freedom and independence of the old elite. Because everybody's in hawk now everyone everyone rich people are all in hock. I mean look at trump for christ's sake. The guy is basically function like people say he's not broke he's not broke. He has but what he does is. He doesn't have his own money. He has access to a endless bottomless pool of credit which is in effect the same but which psychologically is different. He has he doesn't have the independent of old money the independence of old money of the old elite of the landed elite.

Will we be live streaming the democratic debates yes and I think that will be very funny because of how important how much the the press is going to be trying to build it up build up the answers. There's going to be solomonic disputes about everything that everyone is saying they're going to get deep into policy. The the media response is going to be very policy heavy because that is going to be them trying to reassert that the position of presidency has meaning that these people have real responsibilities and they represent real political ideologies and policies. So it's gonna. They're really gonna haul. They're gonna really just go ham on it. It will and I'm trying to think of how I'm going to to add. I'm not going to fisk. I'm not going to give it. I'm mostly going to probably do a 5 checks just vibe checks.

I'm going to try to disengage completely from the content especially since pence has that really awful evangelical whininess which is very very annoying if you listen to it. Evangelicals are the whiniest people on earth they're so aggrieved and everybody's being mean to them all the time and oh my god just throw me in the lion's den already and it's from a position of total superiority and power. It's just awful and he is like one of the worst examples of that every time you ask a question of them. It's like it's kind of. It's in. It's an imposition that you're even asking which is why trump is so fun when he just doms those people. Just doesn't think that like panders them in an insulting way that intentionally lets them know that he has no respect for them and they just have to take it well. You know he's he's like cyrus. He's a he's a noble pagan and pence is the perfect embodiment of that just the piss.

The piss jug holder. I'm not going to get as drunk. As I did in the 2018 midterms that's never happening again good lord what what a bungle that was don't drink nearly enough to do that anymore yes. I would like to get virgil drunk though on a thimble full of of elf mead get him turnt neri at yahoo. Someone asks this will be my last thing. I say for the for the stream near. Netanyahu is so funny because he is like a don jr. Guy like he is. He is this fail son's bell son. He's the shitty like the concentrated like like it's in every way lesser than their their parents but also all basically. They are the worst traits of their parents condensed with none of the virtues at all. Now of course trump and netanyahu don't have virtues per se but they have certain abilities and talents and they don't and and both nier and don jr have none of those and only the defects only the rancid personality and what's so funny about nerey.

Anyahu is that because he's jewish but culturally he is an american He is a trump because that's what that's what israel becoming that's what the jews getting their own country did is. It took away the jewish part. It took away the thing that made jews like of a real chosen and special people was. There was their orthogonal position to the cultures. They were it that gave that made it harder for them to sort of be be seduced into the mindlessness of of a national of a false national consciousness and then they get the country and what happens. They are just as stupid and asshole-ish and and and authoritarian and corrupt as us. They lose any of the virtues and it's just all us all the worst con parts and and now and so but our rich dumbasses. They have to blame somebody for why things are bad and then it ends up having to be the jews because that's how it has to be because it always has to be at the end of the day. Some conspiracy if you don't acknowledge the reality of of capitalism as the driver of exploitation and alienation and misery in the world you will have to end up so if you're on the right at all you have to end up with some cabal and it's got to be. It's got to be the jews because they're the ones who historically have filled that position.

There's nobody else who's a plausible candidate narratively and yet nair is in the position of having the exact same dumb ass brain as don jr but who's he going to blame and so he ends up having to be anti-semitic to himself. It's amazing he posted a meme about like george soros being led by a by a scheming merchant being led by like a reptile person amazing that's why mayer is going to be like the only guy in the world who goes who ends up believing in lizard people but actually because that's the only ones who that's the only people who could be above the jews or the leptiles. Bosonero's sons are in the exact same boat. Oh god man can you oh can you imagine getting all those dudes together nair and dj. Tj and the bilson arrow boys going to like hunt and kill the world's last black rhino or something ugh yeah. Like the hussein boys just the worst the society. The worst our culture our world's social order could create all right guys. Talk to you guys soon bye you.
