I might not be able to post that one later because I don't know if it's gonna get saved. It just kicked me off. I don't know what happened damn. It. I gotta remember that somebody remember that somebody watch that the first one please remember that cuz now I'm gonna forget. We gotta figure out how to get on Twitch that makes so much more sense than this. Dammit just kick me off 37 minutes in like less than that oh god damn it. Oh that's a bummer. I'm very bummed. Now.

I'm just sad hopefully. I'll remember that again to talk about the future. But I thought I had something they're talking about a the futures before us the eliminationism or or I guess. I was trying to think about the singularity yeah that's right singularity and how that happens how like you turn humans into just like feedback like like little plug and play devices like pure appetite and an satiation like pure a be like stripped them of all of all identifying traits like the kind of things that you get from having a life that is yours a life that is the dream of communism instead like pure mechanistic life that replicates the market structure and the market transaction that works and that turns you just into a feeding machine feeding a producing machine and then like if you're needed to feed you feed if you need to work you work at the the hessed of this algorithm.

This totally alienated algorithm. I mean it might have people who serve it and are better off than you like there's so hierarchy and that's what keeps people in line but they're still like serving this thing that's alienated from humanity. That's a that's what the singularity is. The singularity is when they're brought together and they're and humans become part of the machine like they become part of the the binary code like human interactions are just part of the code. It's part of the  computer doing it. It's computations. It literally becomes the hardware. It literally becomes the hardware. It's like the matrix that's it and that's where we're gonna go if we let them do this to us or I mean I guess. It's more likely. It's just one more step down the road because you get this you've got climate apocalypse coming up there's gonna. It's gonna be a thing about winnowing down populations and keeping the people populations we do have require fully a God.

What's what's the Fuko term disciplined fully surveil. I don't know like fully dominated like just fully at every level surveilled and it's and and your actions curtail. So that's what they're trying to get us to have that's what they're hoping to get us with. They're hoping to get us in to become the  just mostly Oh what epoch what epoch what epoch because this arrow remind me.

Most of this is a good question well well. One thing I would have to have is a crisis of leadership I mean and I know that sounds idealistic and non-marxist. But I got to tell you man. There is something that is very end stage just like as an identifying marker. Not necessarily cause there's nothing that indicates an end stage power structure. Then it's control my actual incompetence that is where the flaws in this in that it like the flaws that are sort of written into the code of something like monarchism or democracy democracy or capitalism capitalist democracy or whatever or or soviet communism for example or Chinese communism or whatever. Like the end stages of them all have that in common that the leadership is genuinely decrepit it has been rendered so by either literal inbreeding like the old Monarchs of Europe or in our case.

They've a false meritocracy replicating itself where you have these you have this meritocratic class who engineer things so that just by coincidence their next generation of Merida crafts are what's this they're kids. What's the code what a coincidence so they replicate essentially a arista a literal blood aristocracy but through this market mechanism and this like this this justification. This is like justification that replaces like the divine right of the old aristocracy cuz. Nobody believes in God anymore so you can't say it's mine by right but God they say it's mine by right of Justice because we've been inculcated like Razi and justice is a social norm even though what they mean by justice because they have these things are technically obey. Allah and some people do rise up but they replicate their own privilege and their kids are like the children of the most elite powerful everywhere almost universally shitty scummy pieces of  who don't understand anything about the world who are psychotically self-obsessed who are basically sociopaths rendered so by their class position and like their their absolute distance from anything resembling like real human life and suffering and then they they take over and it's like it's a medicine run by product of capitalism specifically capitalism's Democratic loss how does how does capitalism deal with the fact that in order to maintain its legitimacy culturally it has to have a democratic race but also if democracy was real people could literally just vote themselves to communism which was the theory of revisionist Marxism and the like Bernstein and Kowski and it looked like it was working and then a bunch of things were invented by the very very capable and improvisational ISM one being fascism of course. A way to replicate mass politics on the right and also about circumscribing politics and one way to subscribe politics is to make it elite and you make an elite by putting barriers up that are related to social. Standing that is hypothetically neutral but in reality replicates a class privilege. It's just it's it's a secular sanitation of aristocracy. That's what the meritocracy is and so these people are just as much a clueless dollars as the court of Louis Couture or or the Mad King George or any of them.


Ah yes indeed so anyway that makes me think what's one of them. It's got to be about a declining Empire that's the first and most important like fundamental feature. It has to be an actual Empire. Now not. A regular state has to be a Empire either formal or informal that is collapsing that doesn't mean that the state will necessarily collapse after all the British Empire a hundred years ago. It was the most powerful force on earth to control something like a third of the world's population or and a huge chunk of its territory. That's where the Sun literally never set on it. Because there was part of it everywhere in the world. Their empire is gone but their state still exists.

They've latched on to us as little barnacles will we latch on to somebody. Else could we latch on to China and get a deal but like yeah we lower the standard of living but not all at once and an in contention with you know getting the ability to come to you come over there. I don't know or like piggyback down your ship. I don't know so that you could do more formal. You can do more you can lay off some of the like. We would lay off some of that military might like all that defense spending. We'd lay some off on China in exchange for gearing able to do more domestic spending which is what like the declining European powers did with us after what works out so anyway. So that's another thing so it doesn't necessarily mean the stable class. But the Empire is at a terminal point the economic collapse that's usually a part of the line of Empires. The  plague is what's kept Gillett tripping me up because like we literally have a plague that is a hell of a wild card. Obviously the the capitalism was very shaky right. They're going up and they like this Corona thing kind of gave him an alibi for her collapse. It was going to come but I don't think even even the most line go down. Hardcore believer will do agree that this is going to be worse than it would have been maybe you don't agree with that. But I really do think that this is going to make it much worse that it would have benefited then a sort of natural outgrowth of a cyclical downturn and not only got to plead off pleat it off on  Dorota.

What's another one maybe were Britain. Maybe were Britain in the interwar period and this is World War. Two we may be we are Britain. In the interwar period. I always talk about then in the war and the war like 9/11. In the war. On terror is like the interwar period and the win World War two and then this is a clap. This is like the climax. This is the blow up and then they never came back from it. But they also didn't go into you know turmoil. They didn't become big and got shattered. I honestly wonder if the thing that will save us is our complacency and laziness as a people like will be just movie. At the end of the day find it too much work to come to blows in the Civil War is that what will happen like at the end of the day. It'll just be like oh man really getting the get. My militia together like go into the state line and like doing expeditions to the nearby towns. Really it sounds like a lot of work well. You won't if you do it. That'd be cool. I support you.

I'll put the  pain in my ass. There were more than a hundred thousand truckers. We're gonna block every part every road going in and out of DC until bumbler crumb bow was deposed and executed on the White House lawn. How many people showed up. I think it was BJ in the Bear get that reference guys EJ and the bear BJ in the pear folks. The other thing I was saying on the other stream that I hope I don't forget was about the possibility.


We have to do real automation of plant like planning a lot economic planning the idea that we could plan economic transactions with with computing power to replace the price mechanism of capitals. I really think we have the ability. I think that their the strike the the the the strides forward. We've seen from what the Soviets did in. The 50s read plenty by by Francis. Beaufort is a great book about that I recommend anyone very fun to and very well read in addition to be very interesting and and enter and educational ah and to Chile and I end a I'm. How he tried to go against America's economic war that preceded the coup by creating a system for planning the economy which was destroyed by the  army when they did the coup.

So that was the 70s man and now we've got computers that has been pointed out a million times. We have the computing power at pockets to go to the moon I guarantee you that we have more. Pager probably has more computing power than all those banks of terminals that got machine gun by Pinochet's goons in 1973. What can we do with that and what are we already doing in terms of planning economies. Amazon which is this a state within a state within a state which has all the appearances of a state in terms of inputs and outputs and capital physical plants and that its internal decisions are not made by the market and price points. It's made by central planning and it works so if we could just strip the bark of capitalism off the  human needs in a time of crisis. Can you imagine that it's a thing no you can't imagine it because if we did it then at the end of this they would never we would never let them take it away that would be a red line for every human on earth that would be a thing that would never be allowed to happen so yeah.

I'm thinking I'm back. Hi guys how's everyone doing there's anyone drinking cheap Lambrusco and looking at the giancarlo hills. Overlooking rome does anyone loving that memory oh yeah that'll be funny. If this is on TV example of me going mad uh what was that questions what is the end game. I mean. It's I hate to be cliche but it is socialism or barbarism. Isn't it it is it is a cut.

It is a Commonwealth of mankind. It is that is that provides a stable basis for human flourishing that will not eventually destroy itself as all other systems will inevitably do or. We will do what classes have done since time immemorial mark says it in the manifesto. The hitter to the history of man is the history of class conflict and that conflict is between either slaves. Masters of peasants a few feudal lords or whatever and that when the read that the conflict is one by one which advances humanity or both are destroyed common ruin of the contending classes and that will be the outcome. The crisis of profit. The inability to provide for human needs will create a savage return to barbarism maybe a techni barbarism but one that is never allows human life to flourish again unless it fuses with the it fuses with technology unless the singularity happens. That's the alternative that's the real like if you really want to really put on your NIC land like pineal gland. Hat the choice really is yes a steady-state human flourishing of capitalism something that ends up like with the the Kim Stanley Robinson series like that kind of world or bored or the matrix. Basically or we become one with the algorithm of capitalism. We become the biological mechanisms of it. That's that's our options so we will be man or machine are we men or are. We. Devo people are asking like what's gonna happen in terms of will. There be food. Shortages will there be crud riots will there be fights those things require a knowledge of like the macro situation that I cannot I cannot claim I'm sorry. It's. It's beyond my my skill set or pay grade to be able to divide at the micro level. The transactions that are occurring at like this the biological and the ecological and the economic and the social to tell you so yeah. I don't know man. I don't know all.


I know is what what what what the long-term the wrongdoing will mean and I know where the crisis points will come. But I don't know which way. The wind is headed yet like there's a sick part of me that thinks the most likely outcome is that everything's kind of the same. But  Ian's like after this huge is this massive shift that like everything feels like the rails are crawling off everything is unprecedented we're in a nightmare tunnel. We're live a literal nightmare tunnel and we come out of the other end of it. And it's like oh yeah that's basically the same kind of shittier. You know more people don't have jobs. Uh you know standards of living are going down. A little bit more people have lived with more debt but things are basically the same only worse which is what Felix is been talking about for the entire show's history and I feel like he was right about Biden. We were all zipping and zapping and going up and down on the roller coaster with Bernie and Felix was we kind of almost tried to talk him out of it. But uh he was right the whole time and he's also been saying the same thing about this well. Even I mean maybe he would say differently now that we're in the middle of this but I gotta say if something feels right.

Something feels darkly awfully right about it'll be the same except slightly shittier because that big collapse the destruction it's like. Even if you die in it. It will still feel like judgement it will still feel like climax. It will still feel like something meant something like you you witnessed something you were part of something you are part of the end of something and you'll know that even as you die the worse is now. I don't know I'm not part of the end of anything I'm the part of the middle of sub-goal  that will go continuing on beyond my death into just this awful grace. Eddy state of steady decline into inhumanity. That's a bummer. That's a bummer so honestly yeah like the more dramatic more. Doomer scenarios are the ones that are actually more in a narrative sense happy endings more satisfying you know I mean cuz if you're gonna go down either way.

Whether in 30 years or look maybe you're gonna be the one trou knee and your own  fluids because you had to work at Kroger shift so they wouldn't repossess your Kia. You're still gonna be out would. You rather be out in a blaze of idiot glory like to live in a Bosch painting to live in a to see judgment to hear a voice from the  depths of the depths of the depths of uncaring space. A single voice a single voice of judgment to render meaning and shape to what has until now been a pointless futile painful confusing existence instead of just knowing that one of these days it's gonna be like this and one of these days is just not gonna wake up which would you rather have and I gotta say and that's what makes me think the reality is gonna. Be we get off the ride and it's Oh. Everything's just kind of shitty. Here I have less money I live in a worse place. I have worse health. More of my friends are dying of coronavirus until you're one of them. So you get claim to but slowly through entropy through just the examination of the spirit into complete enemy and ennui or go down with the bucket ship.

You go down with the  ship you get to go down into the depths of the ocean lash to the back of the great white whale himself to the last I grapple with thee from hell's heart I stab thee for a hates sake I Spit my last breath at thee you get to have that you get that little bit you know you all know that that was the happiest moment in Ahab's life right. That's I think that unassuming am I right if anyone else is i. It's been a while since I've read Moby Dick if there's any other like English majors here who could contradict me that's the happiest moment in Ahab's life right. This is the moment before he is sucked into the bottom of the ocean because he's there because he's on the whale as opposed to just dying of scurvy well. Around in the middle of the Spanish mane oh boy no thank you.

No thank you mister yeah. I think someone said that one of the reasons that everyone likes dr. Strangelove so much is that how could you not love a movie with such a happy ending because that's the genius of Strangelove is to render apocalypse ironically. Like the the nukes at the end are orgasms. The beginning of the movie is this is the intimus the beginning of the intercourse. There's the first shots of the movie are our footage of in of midair refueling of like the of the of the Missile Command like b-52s that like flew up perimeters of Russians all in nukes. So it starts with the set like literally the impregnation. Then it ends with. No we meet again everyone going in at once I've talked about this before in the show and I'll play the song again. I'll play the time layer song which is some other thing you want and it's the beauty of that of the nuke. One is. It was it promises basically painless death.

Like Oh will die but it'll be you know you're gonna be a  shadow on a wall probably or you'll be dead within a few months. It's not gonna be that bad but you'll know everyone else has gone too so you know you're the F you've you've rendered youyou. Life has been rendered meaningful even with a slower decline like if we come out of this in a real crisis like the u.s. breaks up. I'm sorry to know that you were that you were there for the reign of the last president that you know that whatever comes back is not going to be. What was your the last American you were. It's like being somebody. It's like. It's like think about thinking about people like think about somebody who is there for the SAP of. Rome you know or like when the  Crusaders took Jerusalem. I mean these are epochal moments so yes that's why I think like for your short term if you especially if you have young people in your life. If you have kids or you have vulnerable people in your life good the short-term good but also I think that's why it's most likely because it's the most most depressing the most spiritually deadening possibility. So that's why I think it's most likely to be true so good news good news on that but yeah it's like I could say that now he would be as horrible as anything I could imagine but you're gonna die. Anyway you know okay the fall of Constantinople that how about that oh yeah. One of those people who smashed the Berlin Wall with the  sledgehammer I mean there's a reason people still have those rocks hanging around but of course. That was one that didn't kill everybody thank you for saying you died for me.


I'm gonna need a few of you too because otherwise I'm absolutely gonna get out 100% getting owned in the after after Speer I mean and I Pro read our technology well. I think I could tell you that if I know that we're either the matrix or if we're uh communist. If we're communism cool. We technology got us there. If it's the matrix that I gotta have to say Monday Morning Quarterback comes out so I guess I'd have to say since right. Now I would argue in my gut. I feel like matrix is more likely then oh thank you oh right isn't it Anzac Day. This is the guy you guys how come is. It is it just like Australia's personality like inferiority complex. Vs IV Britain is that why they celebrate getting their asses kicked because I was talking am I doing it right about this and mighty points out that it's not like you can't really point to any other Australian successes that could try up so that you could remember I mean yeah. They didn't have a great record in World War two while still getting captured by the Japanese and going into Vietnam with us and going in Afghanistan with us. Those were big bundles. I mean what would you you know they're all bad. But like at the end of the world of the world war wide. It was Australians that helped punch through the final German lines and end the war you know instead. They want to commemorate getting like zipped up by a bunch of  Ottoman teenagers.

What just got a fresh lead greased Maxim done because because they get to like make the British feel guilty I guess like hey remember that insect right yeah. This was bloody. Churchill just say this into the. This would cheer just see the city the blimey Bunga shoot and it's the bloody Bunga shoot. Mike it's a it's a black eye. If you send us into the blade and bang Bashir might right yes. At Churchill. He put us in the bloody Bubba sheep you put us in the body boom boom boom badoom boom yeah. They also lost the war demos so way to go Australia all right that's a good question actually if we are going to be serfs in a Neos neo feudal order who should we feel swear our fealty to which of the great Lords which is the Great Houses would you want to work with I mean like if you think about Game of Thrones you know they're definitely worried. It was all futile ISM you were being exploited but there are definitely places you'd rather have been like you definitely if you were you know even a mere stable boy or or a or a groom or a milkmaid. You'd much rather swear fealty to House Stark then house Bolton. That's not a contest. I mean you sure as hell would rather than a serf to like I don't know like Elizabeth. Then we're now one of the one of the relatively confident English kings. I don't know then like Elizabeth. Bathra I was just. Gonna say so yeah who do you want.

These Oh seems like a absolute monster. Everything I've heard about him about his weight runs his company. His company's practices he seems to be a self-consciously evil person. She is a guy who I think even in his own mind is the bad guy and he relishes that fact he's sick he's twisted. He's Joe defied so I would definitely not want to pledge fealty to a house house. Bezos who else man Zuckerberg I would say I'm surface how Zuckerberg seems like it would be better but how Zuckerberg feels kind of like a blue burg situation where it's like hey. This is all fine and dandy but you know don't open this door because that's where you know you have 500,000 like permanently traumatized. People. Getting paid pennies an hour and like the Philippines to watch snuff videos and like gang rapes and the people that they have to filter off of Facebook. That's like the  room full of wipes heads so thank you for Facebook so now thank you. Mr. Zuckerberg house Zuckerberg how skates the guy is a foreskin heating ghoul. He's an Epstein guy. You want a Sears clearly Epstein people's waffle. I know that's hard. There are a lot of non Epstein powers I guess.

But I don't Disney obviously guy ah I'm an entertainer right I could do so. I face ok had the new viral movies out ah. I've seen all those pieces yet I'm like compelled to watch them. Uh so yes I won't swear by house Disney House Disney. I'll look I'll do it unboxing youtube series where I unbox  up Doctor Strange 3 which is on like on 10-minute episodes on kwibi ah well. House. Mask is like it's like a guy who like making his like a Egyptian pharaoh burying his servants with him. He's taking you to Mars to like live in the foundation of his giant necropolis. No thank you I don't think I get I get seems like a like a kind of a laid back dude I can do from a soy face. I'm gonna write pretend that this is a this is a pretend. This is a Martian Manhunter or now ain't it. That's DC dammit what's a really stupid Marvel superhero. There's a lot of them uh-oh all right. No I ant-man Blue Knight is good well that's good yes all right pretender. This is like a moon night action figure from like guardians of the galaxy six.

How's that that good I've been to Brazil. I asked if I've been in the Latin America I've been in Brazil once that's about it. It's pretty cool. This is before Boston arrow. This is till the end near the end of Dilma's rule. Every middle middle class person. We met was wildly hated Dilma and they were they were really like American tea cots like a guy told us about how yeah they had free health care in Brazil but it was bad because people were like getting AIDS on purpose or something so that they could go to the doctor or like because they didn't care about care of the doctor or something because they'd get it for free. But yeah one of our guys we knew was a he was he owned he was raising money with his boyfriend to start off CrossFit studio.

So I guarantee was they all loved balsam marrow but it's beautiful. It's beautiful. We shouldn't people shouldn't live there. Probably we should leave those wart rainforest alone. I have not been to Palestine I forget Asajj. I don't know what I'm I don't know.


If I do. I don't know what that means McConnell is comment. Gonna let the states go bankrupt. I think it depends on what it that means I mean out at all. I don't know if the conditions are gonna be I mean I think he would do whatever it took to stave off a complete collapse of the system to the point of like states no longer contributing to one another's you know infrastructure. Therefore breaking ties literal satirical force pushing America apart I think he would want that to avoid that I know he wants to preside over the the dissolution of the United States. But I don't know what the minimum action whatever the minimum action to prevent that will be is what he will do how about that I don't know if that's gonna be. It might be that they bail out the states. It might be that they figure out a way around doing that the way they like keeps creditors whole I know it makes things the same but worse if you want to be. I watched formal. It's very good. It's very good because it reminds you of the possibility of limited hangouts.

The idea that that people can like organizations like the CIA can admit to things that look very bad for them and that that that in the long term are things that they can handle running out that don't like destroy their foundation and that you serve the benefit to them of making them look forthright. It looked like you know what's going on there and so like it was supposed to be a scandal for years that the CIA dosed Frank Wilson without his knowledge and that he dreamt out that window so they were willing to admit that they dosed their own guide to see what happened because it's like well that's  up but happening a number of years ago. Most of those guys are dead you know it seems like kind of like a party prank gone wrong awesome which disguises the massive massive size of MKULTRA. The number of  prisons and colleges that got in couch' funding the number of places where the number of people hundreds and hundreds of students and prisoners like whitey bulger - Ted Kaczynski being exposed to massive amounts of LSD on a daily basis without their consent or knowledge what they were what was happening but they turn it into like basically an animal house fly the real thing is they murdered him cuz. He was gonna spill the beans about and the u.s. using  of biological weapons during the Korean War that's a spicy meatball that's closer to the bone and if you if you say the first thing you don't have to say the second thing cuz people stop looking. I think we have to think a lot about that in terms of what we think we know and how much stuff is limited in its in its hangout. But you can't go too far that way because that's how everyone becomes wildly. Paranoid I kind of gave up a better call.

Saul I found the hole as soon as they made it about Gus and M hey. This is how Hector does a stroke as I give a  I know how all this ends and I know if it was this interesting. It's all like let it be in your head. You don't need to know everything and the fact that it's been four seasons and he's still not. I mean honestly as good as better call Saul has been the talent in front of the high. The camera better utilize that they just said we're not doing prestige. We're gonna do an old-fashioned TV show.

We're gonna do like the Rockford Files with a sleazy lawyer with the with with  Odenkirk and those guys imagine that show Rockford Files with a crooked lawyer instead. It's like it's Breaking Bad. Jr. Where you can't move it forward not any of those stories because it happens before. So you're left with this. These dead-end things that aren't going to lead anywhere they get drawn out forever by the way anyway. Mini Breaking Bad Oh. The only parts of breaking a bit of a better call Saul I like black and white parts the very beginning when he is a Cinnabon manager. You know because I don't know it's gonna happen because it still has some frisian. There's still some tension was when he was waiting to get them to put his social security number in the Machine. Correctly you know what's gonna have. It pop better call Saul. There I guess because it's it's. It's creative.

Missteps are the result of following a template of prestige television that I've hated for years and we literally have seen a perfectly good project destroyed by it. I said it actually right. I think I'm gonna type up that hot take after this and see everyone get mad at me. But I'm gonna be correct correct. No this is a crap shake sir. So this is a correct take. Matt rules that is also a correct tape. I hope I rule Breaking Bad. There's an example of the tragic lameness of prestige elevator. Thank you good take 100% thank you adopt a cap to fellow cows or Oh televisual storytelling. I'm in a shed are you in some sort of hole.


It's not hole. It's a space underneath a deck. It's my backyard area. So this humble little postage stamp of land that gives me a little bit of air. And I like to smoke out here and and it's later so I put my light on. So I don't have any other appear lights. But I'm gonna get a grill. It's gonna be nice. Gonna get a grill I'm gonna get nicer chairs. I have pretty bad chairs out here chill out chill. Gonna get a shades with all of you guys. Then I can actually practice what I've been preaching about grill pillow I haven't been able to grill yet after. Since I said I want to drill out and been able drill thrush ready. I'm gonna start grilling guys hand to God on god.

I'll start grilling I swear by Allah Allah least evil US president is obviously Lincoln. There's no Comcast because if you look at evil and good as I look like a good play style point system. Lincoln got all the bad points off that all American presidents of the 19th century got mostly related to Native American dispossession and genocide. He did preside over the largest mass execution in American history of Sioux Indians in Minnesota. After an uprising there in the middle of the Civil War he also instituted the Homestead Act which was just a giant pet settler free for all just to come to get come to get it buffet on a Native American land. So but every other president in the 19th century had all those same points bought. Lincoln has ending slavery so that means even if he's still in the red even if he doesn't go to heaven. He is still relatively way higher up in the rankings of just like pure numbers I peer negative or positive numbers of you know sin points as any American president could ever come close to second. I would say John Quincy Adams but he is a distant second obviously oh and us grant. Those are the top three yeah that's it those are the three least evil I like I said I don't even know if they have positive or negative point numbers. But they have way fewer of negative points than any of the other ones. Grant was cool John Quincy Adams while he was there yeah. I mean he was a one-termer so they had less time to do bad stuff.

He was a guy who promoted he did want a non-confrontational Indian policy. I mean compared to a guy like Jackson or even Van Buren. He was a  pieced economic question. He presided over a slave state country but he was against slavery and he fought against it afterwards. As a congressman I mean he famously defended the Amistad Africans before the souls before the Supreme Court as depicted in the Dee Steven Spielberg film Amistad. So ya know I would say oh and he uh you know. He is well the visionaries of non-interventionist American foreign policy. There's a reason that those does like that coke funded think a foreign policy think-tank that just don't know just call the John Quincy Adams Institute because he's like the guiding light of those kind of guys like the guy who warned against even in. But it was still it's very early stages. What American imperialism expansion is it would mean in terms of morale. He was a clarion call. Like he knew it was gonna happen. He knew what expanding westward was gonna do. He was gonna just destroy the spirit in like the morality of any kind of project that was being done in America. I was gonna just fundamentally rupture the social fabric and destroy the legitimacy of the state from a moral perspective. So I give him a lot of credit on that and then grant. You know presided over Indian massacres and stuff. But also also did not want to do that I mean he did want to pursue a more more a less violent Indian policy but those around him were not interested doing it and he couldn't really ever assert control it that way. But he also effectively pursued reconstruction  part but like he flipped the food put his foot on the gas there and I give him respect for that.

So those are my top three of what your Wilson was a  maniac our only PhD president. Our only nerd president I mean yeah they're all nerds but this guy is a literal college professor. He was the President of Princeton. He has a PhD in political sucking theory or political science whatever they called it like that he wrote his thesis on like how Congress works actual nerd ass  well yeah. It was racist he was he wasn't. He was a wildly hypocritical anti-imperialist who loved using American intervention domestically and honestly his decision to go to war if you believe. Some of the more provocative thesis is about World War one that the US was essentially brought into the war by by JP Morgan but due to the amount of money he'd lent the Allies and his fear that it would go unrepaid if they lost theirs. There's it's not. It's not a totally boundless deep thesis there's something to it. I think so yeah and of course you know being hella racist pursuing segregation of federal office buildings.

You know invading Haiti invading Mexico I think invading Nicaragua and then of course. They're awful absolutely being useless as a  wife and his doctor running the country for the last year while they specking spoon-fed in strained carrots come on the upton. Sinclair book you mean the book about the campaign that I've been reading. It's called the campaign of the century. I'll talk about it. I'll definitely shout it out of the show because I'm getting a lot of really good details from it. He it's fascinating because he does it's not a conventional history of the campaign. It's a day-by-day recounting of everything that happened from the day Sinclair got the nomination in September of 1934 to November election just everyday and then filling in everything within the back. As he's talking so yeah. I've seen the attack as this the stuff that they put together against Sinclair is wild. It was like the entire media a riot a raid in one way and like even in the world even in the midst of the  Great Depression even with the New Deal like stalling people still saw that that that the entire array of capitalism song against the sky and instead of saying look what they're trying to do look.

Look look what they're scared of look what we could do like why are they doing this. Why would they do this if they weren't scared it could work because if it doesn't work you just take over in fact and then here they've been disqualified forever and then they're out of power. You never have to worry about it again a lot cheaper that way but yeah it's gonna be a good episode. I'm gonna record it for next week. I'll probably record it. Like Tuesday. You know they basically invented negative campaigning against sick Claire. They invented it basically every concept that wasn't really done before yeah but not like I mean like independent expenditures. You know Pat I basically have let. It's super PACs super PACs super PACs. Super PACs super PACs Stav would be a great president president Stavros.


Let's do it make it happen. Let's make it happen captain alright guys. I'm gonna head off feeling uh feeling my energy levels dropping I feel like I've uploaded my Oregon energy on to all of you. So if you don't want to suck some of that up all over through the interwebs and be recharged and reborn. I will see you on the flippity-flop. I don't know if it'll be back here in the in like in the bunker but uh it'll be somewhere.
