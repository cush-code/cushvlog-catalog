I live at gimble Gitmo rules hello hey guys. I'm apparently last the last stream I did with was the first with my set up here and some people said it was too soft. They couldn't really hear it. So. I'm putting the thing closer to my face which might be disturbing to some viewers. But it's necessary for you to hear everything trying to minimize seeing like transformer box over there which is not really very aesthetically pleasing. I honestly should maybe I should turn around thinking about it. The background to be much nicer. Is it low audio again or any gas lighting me am I being gas lit or can you hear me let me know. I asked the tracks that the tracksuit will be back tracksuit Leave Act when the conditions change is it quiet. I don't know how to turn it up more. I only have I keep turning the thing on but then it doesn't go all the way I'm an old man. I don't understand these things. Oh are you people giving me the business I'm trying. I'm trying to talk to you people and you're leaving me here oh now. I don't know I don't know anymore and here I was I was gonna talk about the Demiurge. We got to talk some more about the Demiurge but now I don't know if you guys can even hear me oh god damn it. Bad faith actors that's right. Why is the mic muffled. I don't understand here right all right. I move what does that mean you're just a little quiet. I don't even know what that means oh. No I don't know what to do. Now. I'm trapped is there like a volume control in thing here all I can do is mute the microphone all right.

Let's talk to my urge I reason a lot of talk about the different urges it was something I said yesterday or last time. We last dream about how people's religious convictions are losing their spiritual basis even without them knowing it over the years and how American Christians essentially worship material wealth. They they worship money and in the United States. But the United States is an avatar for material wealth. That's the thing that gets the man and you know that those are made those are choices but they're also not choices. If you know what I mean their responses to conditions that are omnipresent and difficult to deal with and that reminds me of the Demiurge and the bad energy was a notion of the early Gnostic Christians those sect of Christians who looked around the world they saw after hearing the teachings of Christ and having them accepting them in their heart. The idea Universal love brotherhood abolition of poverty strife through cooperation and and love. They looked around in the world that they lived in and lo and behold. It was not a world where they could live. Those values you can't live like a follower of Christ in the world that they found themselves in the world is filled with despair or err scarcity terror despair and other people who are hostile to you and your people and what is to be done. God says turn the other cheek but it's easy for God. Jesus says turn the other cheek sure as hell. It is easy for them to say for him to say he's the son of God he gets struck him down. It goes to heaven any knows it we aren't. We don't have that kind of luxury where our lives are fragile and our knowledge of what is in store for us is non-existent. So we have to. We have this instinctive value to our lives and we have an instinctive appreciation and value to the things we see around us that turns into greed that turns into lust that turns us away from thinking about.

God makes us in pockets a world incompatible with the beliefs that we hold it's impossible to be a Christian the way that the way the early Christians thought of it. It's impossible to be a Christian in the world that they found them says it and so the question arises why would God create a world where you couldn't live in accordance with as well and the answer that the Gnostics came up with is. God didn't. God created a spiritual in the universe in which we are in one. We are we are spiritual beings who will inevitably reunite with him in the in the through the frictionless realm of spirit and we will be commune with God than something intervened something called they called the Demiurge this evil demon. This malevolent God who trapped us in material forms trapped our godly spirits in material forms and the world. We think is real is an illusion created by the de marriage and that expect to them explain how we could live in a world so removed for a world that could be that would reflect God's desire for humans and God's love and all that and the thing about the haze is that it's essentially correct in that we do not live in the real world. At a real world. We live in a constructed realm material and ideological that is false that is imagined that is an illusion impressed upon reality but instead of being created by a demon. It's created by all of us. It's created by every human in live before us and every living every living human who in acts the systems that they find themselves in not through anyone's fault. But due to the fact that we are bound by our conditions.

But so we live in a demo original reality shaped by the deforming reality of drumroll please exploitation of now capitalism of hierarchy of some hoarding at the expense of others hoarding pleasure boarding material wealth hoarding power that flows from that and the thing is is that the Demiurge achill the the the Gnostics sought to break through right which is what all of us can seek individually. And I think what the what what what the Gnostics sought is the same thing that Buddhist seek is the same thing that rule that ecstatic and mystic Christians and Moslems seek that sense of oneness and community and communion with God which is another way of saying with the universe. It is a perception of one's unit of the unity. It's a perception of of communion with all other living in living beings and then the entire universe which is all you. This is all God is and that's all we imagine. All that's all God is right is everything and it is a sense of being part of everything as opposed to being separated. That's what all religious ecstasy seeks.

That's what all trans. That's all all of those moments are transcendence and there are different ways to try to cultivate that in the self. But the world around us intervenes. It makes it very difficult for us to achieve those moments because we spend ourselves our lives trying to survive and dealing and also dealing with our attachment to the world around us the desire and greed that come from navigating world of material reality and material pleasures and that but so there is an individual search for for communion and transcendence. But then there is this there is as the species comes into awareness of itself as a species which is the human progression. The dialectical progression where which were in the process of unless it's interrupted by systemic collapse due to an imbalance of the forces which could very well happen and it has happened before it will probably happen many more times in the future until one time it doesn't and we achieve a sustainable process by which the the pain and the exploitation of the world is through coordination and through the democratization of power as equally as possible spread evenly throughout the human population. The human speed of species and that gives every individual within the species the freedom to come to those sort of moments of transcendence and their understanding of themselves in the world as part of God and no longer feel isolated from it.

So we're all in a war everyone on the left is in this blind hacking war with the Demiurge to try to break the power of this. This evil god the the nightmare of the dead generations that Marx talked about that we're all trapped in so that's what I think of the demo yeah. My energy is capitalism but it's not just capitalism. It's every accumulated institution and institutional thought and cultural and religious and ethnic mental mechanism of sorting and separation. They're not evil. I mean that but the problem is is just to think of them that way you also have to remove you have to remove your the concept of agency for mothers to divorce the idea that you are fighting against like evil people and accept that people are essentially ensorcelled to one degree or another by this world and that you can only blame. Someone left or to a limited degree for the degree to which they've been insult ensorcelled because we all have the abilities to cope and abilities to process reality that are shaped by our individual conditions of births and and and happenstance throughout life. But that means that for yourself you have to fully embrace your your responsibility because the degree to which you are aware of things. This is a degree to which you are responsible for trying to change them to try to push through the demo ethical barrier. Like one thing that's really interesting is like.

We look at the way that the Trump administration and the various governor's bungled the kovat response which they absolutely did but if we think about it if we accept some of the data from like if we're not gonna go Alex Berenson and we accept some of the data from places like Hong Kong that have dense populations right. They're much closer to the initial outbreak of Cobra than us with six deaths so far and their claim is because everybody wears a mask already almost and so when they said everybody wear a mask everyone just did implying. If that's true we have to imply that we don't know for sure but if we imply that but that's true if we accept that that's true rather then that means that the most Mahut gist mistake there occurred was not something. Trump did it wasn't his idiot thing his baby brain no object permanence thing about oh well. If we don't count the numbers they won't go up and people won't get worried about it. It's that they told people and then wasn't Trump who said this not to wear a mask and the first couple of weeks and the reason. They said that because because our supply chains are so attenuated and so vulnerable to Chinese inter to problems in China disrupting them and of course. That was the epicenter that we didn't have enough mass for everybody are we afraid.

We wouldn't have them that mass for everybody and the thinking was in a moment when they were worried about a huge explosion in hospitalizations that the most important people to get the masks were first. Responders were medical personnel and therefore you couldn't have regular people just rushing out and getting them and so they said what's gonna be best is tell people not to wear masks. It's not gonna help anyway in fact you're taking it from someone so it would have helped well now we look back and it looks like that might have been about the worst thing they could have said especially since how the do you tell everyone now to wear a mask. When you said don't wear a mask before.

I mean all those rubes spazzing out and being filmed having conniption fits and and Trader Joe's as traders Joe across the country. They are of course change baby of human human babies like we make him here in America just giant soggy babies. But if they yell why was it open ahh. Why shouldn't we a war mask and now do we wear a mask. What do you say and the answer is because we didn't have the capacity. We didn't have the masks and we didn't have the social we couldn't even ensure that the social the universality of like social investment to have any confidence that if they had said wear a mask and we could have had them enough numbers.

People would have because who the hell you I don't what I'm saying is is that this stuff was not determined by individual discrete decisions as soon as Kovan hit and hit in a context where we have been socially atomized. Had all universal epistemology is demolished by accelerating culture and media and a decimated manufacturing base which literally would not allow us to manufacture something as simple as a piece of cloth on a string in sufficient numbers to ensure that you didn't have a have shortages and hospitals that was all those conditions existed when kovat arrived so anyone making a decision in the context of kovat is doing so with these limitations in place and that is what that's the Demiurge like even if you wanted to behave. Even if you wanted to do the best thing you could even if you wanted to listen to the better angel of your nature. You couldn't because it's not on the agenda and if you decide to make the the principle decision to like resign or something as an individual somebody also just do it instead that's why the only thing that can break that power is a simultaneous coordinated movement like in Finding Nemo not finding dory Finding Nemo when they're all pushing against the fish net that's the only thing they can overcome those natural restraints metier.

It like obviously the ones in here are head. The ideological blinders we have but also the decision like when we talk about the presidents we talk about the powers of the presidency. We talk about president in terms of discrete decisions that they make and that's the sum total of their presidency and their work. There's a president so that we can rank them on the lists but their choices are in real in reality confined right here. This is this is the actual relative to the possible in the position of being president United States. The realistic ones is in ones that this person in this time would do or could do is right here and that's the story though we tell is is this.

As though it were. It were a gigantic ideological and personal ethical clash when in reality the real story the story that we should all focus on to contextualize human behavior and institutions and the power of institutions and then need to take them on is here. I can't even do it. It's not I can't even just imagine. My hands are still going that's the story it's on. This is where they could act and this is where they're allowed to act. It's the winnowing and it's like nobody wants to think that way because assigning more moral choices to historical figures is part of the the pageant in the romance of history and the thing that makes us interested in it. It's a narrative about people and we get invested them as characters and if you are hyper aware while you're investing in a character that their decisions are attenuated and that their freedom of choice is limited. Then it robs them of that that character building heroic element. That is what gives us appreciation of narrative figures. I would not like to self-immolate quite yet. I'm still feeling like I've got some stuff to think it out before I do that thank you for the suggestion.

What's to be taken from Syed ketubah h well. I mean to a degree he was correct. I mean we kind of laugh at it when we when we hear the story of how he was freaked out by a sock hop in nineteen like fifty four something as an exchange student and came home and became a radical Wahhabist like chill out dude. But I mean it wasn't the sock hop. It was what the sock hop represented and if we look at America if we look at the American equivalent in 2020 of a sock hop pre Kovan. I think ketubah would probably be like I was correct.

Now we might say yeah but you were wrong to not think this is cool and it's like well okay. But there's a lot of people around the world who don't take that view on how culture changes and they have to be accommodated in some way and the thing is they can be. It happens. It's not. It's not impossible like look at Scandinavia. I mean obviously people thought hey talked about the Nordics. I'm not talking about them as like a model of perfection of just a model of phenomena in this instance that it's not like 19th century. Swedes were we're all you know like poly and Pan they were dour Lutheran's. Now they're like whatever there go along to get along there come as you are that's because the the mant the the the cultural shift was managed in a material way to minimize the stress of change to culture and that and if there isn't enough of that there isn't enough lubricant material lubricant of social change you get sparks and friction like crazy and that's where we've been for 40 years as sparks flying off the railing because we're hyper accelerating social progressiveness to make up for the increased. They increased a miseration and and the decreased aperture of possible ameliorative policies on the economic side. People are trying to correct me about agnostic to talk about how the platonic forms predate them but it's like yeah. But I'm talking about in terms of their conception of it related to the Christian God which don't rule doesn't really apply to Plato do. I have any thoughts about the UK Labour Party under Kier star mer for one thing how the name sounds like a 90s porn star pierced armor and what do I think of him and his party.

I'm just glad. I don't live. I'm not. I don't have to care about pedo Island. Anymore. I mean we might have blown our shot. We might have but England the UK absolutely did below there's done. They're finished to quote to quote the great DeNiro in Copley and holding half of a pastrami. Sandwich I never gave you enough napkins. At this place. You had a chance to be a cop and you blew it. You blew it. UK blew it. They have their chance and now I mean maybe we can maybe something will come along from outside of there to rescue them but who I would have a very hard time. I mean I know you still got to go on you know like like Vladimir and Estragon regardless of whether there's no more hope. But I guess. It's just like there might be hope but the time frame is so long that as an outside observer I kind of gave up the privilege of not having to care people actually live. There. They have to still care and they have to help move the thing along and accelerate the progress towards the next opportunity but from outside of it where I can't really help it's just a bummer.

I'd rather not. I mean it does amuse me how brutally and publicly star mer is able to purge his opponents within the party. He's doing night of the Long Knives. Over there that Corbett never even came close to trying and of course you know you can use that as a criticism of Corbett and I think Corbett clearly could have gone harder. But you have to remember that the media is there to cheer on star mer as he is doing this which means it's that much more easy to get away with it whereas if Corbin had really gone I mean they took the degree that they did like deselect. They the meet the media went crazy just cried bloody murder like it was the pedophile cream clawed upon Barnstormer. Off so if he'd gone harder they would have cried even harder and they probably wouldn't have been able to. But they could have they could have cut a lot more fat than they did so you. If you want to talk about what went wrong with them item I in my opinion that's does like foundational error and of course. It's impossible to know how far would have gone too far and would have caused more blowback than would have been worth it because there's always that inflection point.

I just I don't know but I suspect that it come nearly close enough. They could have come a lot closer to the line and if they had they could have gotten a lot of benefits from it because we know for a fact that they were sabotaging him from the inside. During those both candidate both campaigns. People at the top levels of the party were sabotaging whereas timer has nobody's had time to even do anything wow they were still disoriented. He just matzevot bath party congress. 1979 I have in my hand a list of traitors. That's one thing that bums me out most about burning out winning. The nomination is said if you'd won the nomination he probably would have been able to take over as the the hot top level of the bureaucracy of the party and just I believe he would have been a lot more ruthless than Corbin because I think that the I think that the the libs the the donut people are a hundred percent right and one thing they say about Bernie which is they say he hates the Democratic Party and wants to destroy it and the thing is that's why I like Bernie and that's the number one reason that I thought he was worth supporting above. All policy questions is that his orientation towards the Democratic Party was correct and that's the necessary precondition for any useful engagement with the electoral process is knowing where the Democrats are relative to you and what they represent. Now. Now he's with influence on what happens as we do because the shot was taken and it missed. I just think that if you've gotten in charge there that he would have clean house and also I think it's easier to clean house in the Democrats. Just because it's not a real party.

It doesn't have a mass membership. So it's it's much more house of cards and you could probably swap it pretty easily with just a minimum of like grassroots effort but you'd have to have control the top to do that because otherwise as we saw into in post elections with Bernie. They rigged the game to degree the thing get away with its wife. That's why once you if you can burst through that and get on top. Then you can make it easier for everybody. It's charging horse but it didn't happen que sera sera. You just win some and you lose most that really shouldn't be that should be the thing. It shouldn't it for people to really get a sense of what's life's like when something happens bad. You don't have when some lose most just making it even less. It's supposed to make you feel better right like que sera sera okay. Whatever something happens something doesn't happen just to remind yourself that this is the base line. The base line is failure so there shouldn't be some huge trauma to find yourself there. That's where you always are you were born in the dark nor did buy it first time.

I saw a candidate with a primary I was already to demand and by then it meant nothing to be hey what a bein smoked weed. H h h h imagine it would have been smoke weed. He used that thing to chew like the thing we're back to the back pack of mascot. I will I will smoke you up Batman. Then you have my permission to chew there you go oh well thank you so much said. I'm a hoot I love being a hoot. One of the best things you can call somebody in my opinion kimete sinner.

Gordon r AP come down several alright be I am interested to see what the former chapo trapa subreddit people do to call their new one because like everyone knows what happened with our subreddit. It started off as about our show but then as all the other left subreddits imploded out of infighting which is inevitable in all political subreddits because that's the nature of niche politics is that it implodes and they kept having these refugees and they ended up all pooling under the banner of our net of our show because it was the closest thing to just like an uncharged signifier that was left and then it became filled with like the whole dregs of the reddit left and it are showing barely any connection to it anymore and and we would get mad at it and people say hey don't. They realize it doesn't have anything to do with the podcast which is - my answer was yeah that's why we don't like it and the end and it was not even that we wanted them to stop. It was that I would have preferred among all options they just take our. And because this is the nature of the Internet and the nature of people who are political in this country because the person who is online doing posts about politics and reddit is likely to be relatively white college educated and therefore liberal like socially because acculturated to the manners of social nicety inculcated by college.

Let's say that and that means that they're going to find in the predatory me-first neoliberal marketplace. The entrepreneurial marketplace of online discourse. The markers of that are emotionally charged and and a capable of being utilized are the gender and identity. Once they're. There. They're their cheat codes essentially - emotional response which is what you're looking for when you're trying to craft takes and you're trying to build a identity online for people to appreciate to give you value to give you an identity in a sense that you're doing something by being online either for yourself or for the cause. But we're both bound up in you being perceived as being a good leftist and so that stuff is going to be what the arguments call us around and the incentive structure is going to be to create a cocoon of a cocoon of sort of groupthink. A totalized worldview around race and gender topics that then creates an inevitable antithesis in the form of the class. First Strasser right reductionist who will then battle with the consensus sharpening both into more powerful compact identity formations that give people even. More emotional connection and validation from being online and doing politics and that is a sterile doom cycle that will dominate any online space inevitably that created the Chapo trap house read it as being this weird.

This weird place of like hysterical. It was like an attempt to demand fidelity to like classical class first class only Marxism like Marxist class and material analysis but then on top of it insisting upon total adherence to every discrete identity argument and the thing is is that sometimes those things to come into conflict and you have to make priorities and it's a give-and-take but like I said the conditions of the internet mean it's only ever going to be give. That's only going to be the possible answer for every discrete one of these issues which means that it'll always defeat the primacy of the class material position every time and so that's what and then so that like chapo Chapas inevitably throws off stupid Paul as it's a antithesis right and you'll notice. It's like a negative dialectic which is what Adorno called culture because it throws things backwards. It takes what once unified and strips it in the process of applying the market to it like doing atoms of culture and like social order because you have chapo as the show which like a culture rate has totally absorbed social liberalism for the room and I think it should but then applied social liberalism to the greater question of of socialism and of a social liberation and I think the show has always struggled to be that but then if the creates an online culture and then it creates its own secondary being which is the flattening of that and because of the flattening influences of identity politics on internet spaces to them of course. It creates this thesis out of that I would have to say out of a synthesis. This thesis of hysterical identity and then boom creates an antithesis of stupid fall.

It literally is it splits things it splits social orders. It's negative Dulli dialectical which is the Prower that's why in that thing if everything I've described by the way is online. There's our show exists completely online and then both of those things being subreddits are obviously even more online more symbolic so if you're in that land if you're in that neoliberal order of the online digital identity. Political ideological matrix you will create that negative dialectic which is why you've got to grill for the love of Pete start grilling get busy grilling or get busy drying apply politics to the things closest and most understandable to you least abstract as as concrete as possible and I know there's obviously the oh you're doing this on an iPhone style irony of me giving this impassioned plea on an Internet twitch website which is just designed to turn your brain into a put your brain in a Cuisinart just like all this stuff fragment everything into into an unassailable mutant chunks that are no longer of the same thing even though they once were just shattering and and burning the ashes but I'm trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my. Life and I only know one way to think my way towards that right now given my situation and it's this so until that changes. This is a zhun abstract as I can get and no throws.

I throw some drilling in there to of course and also trying to write more reading a lot more oh God reading so much more and that's a big part reading. It's like your brain your spirit. Like it's the health bar you just dude dude. It's like being in a video game. If you're. If there was like a game that assimilated like all health you know health wasn't just physical. It was also spiritually and like remove the Cartesian duality there but gave you like food fuel for both and you're in a video game. You now you get like a turkey leg for your bodily health but a book that's your like mind sharpening it and it's still obviously that's still an abstract level. But it's a level of abstraction much closer to life and push closer to the speed of life than the digital realm right right.

Now I am reading I'm I'm halfway through a Walter Shai Dalls book escape from Rome which I cannot recommend enough if I had to recommend one book for people to start reading before they really wanted to get into historical materialism. I would I would recommend this book like if you'd read Marx the stuff and you wanted to start applying it to history. I even though shuttle I don't think as a Marxist this book. It is the most dialectically minded piece of like world historical literature I've ever read and I'm reading it very very slowly because just the having it still be a thing I read. It's like it's stimulating my thoughts about history and like he the overall thesis is. He is explaining why the West ie Europe had such technological explosive growth in the 19th century.

The divergence away from the mean of like global technological society and along the way he's describing it over the course of you know human history basically at least since the fall of Rome and at some times he makes arguments that are that demand a like a material explanation for a phenomenon. Like in this instance the the geela the geographic reality of like the where the step is is determinative. Everything else lies on top of that you can't get below that but in a different level at a different time in his narrative in the narrative of human social evolution like the question of why Europe was able to colonize the rest of the world and not vice versa or were anybody else conquering and exploring the new world. He says the determining factor here is institutional not geographical but that's because the question is never is it institutions or is it geography or whatever it's never.

Is it one or the other. It's which one is it now in this specific instance and that is the way that all history should be approached and so little of it is processed. I like when I think of the way that history is taught. It's like this. This series of discrete decisions that are made by people totally unmoor to the to Y just just this this absolutely sterile single causality well. I mean it makes it basically impossible if you don't really apply yourself to the study of history and why would you if it was that boring and sterile. It leaves you essentially unable to think about the past in any way that's illuminating of the presence you can't use it to make sense of the world because it does not comport to the complexity of the world. Around you. It leaves you with a thin brittle bronze Lance that'll just snap at the first contact with iron or steel or whatever Steel's I mean the very fact that we like talk about presidents even on the left like he's a good president. He's a bad president. Actually there are no good presidents or here's my top ten list of presidents. I do that all the time too and the thing is you can do that it is within the discreet apertures of choice that presidents have you can pick the ones who did a better and a worse job with the freedom they had absolutely but we think of it.

The way you would you were about ranking that with the same sort of drama that you think about ranking a best baseball players of all time. But it's much more like ranking the best umpires of all time you could do it. There are better or some Pires objectively but it's a very. It would be a very boring dull deterministic action because of how constrained their choices are whereas ranking the best baseball players you're talking about the entire wild-caught. Quaza causally open knee near randomised possibility of all opportunities. For every at-bat near-infinite. There's a near infinite the number of things that could happen when you. A hit hit get into the the number of ways that a at-bat can end are so varied. It's mind-blowing. It's my body but every choice by an umpire is strike or ball or fair foul.

But that's the reality of the of the options of the choices. The presidents have they're fully determined. I mean we're all fully determined by circumstances but they're more obviously through our ability to study the historical record that leads to decisions. We can see how constrained they are much more than individuals without power. Like we're all fully determined in why we why we why what we're gonna do. But it's such a it's such a it's such a the decisions are so personal that delving into the depths of the causality. Like the deep stuff you know things in the subconscious that happened years and years ago that nobody even were not knew at the time including the birth especially the person who's thinking about that means that determining the next determining their you know their choices are their degree of fixedness is very difficult for a president that that cut the monumental size of the choices. The president gets to make you could almost fully map why and you can like squeeze the amount of agency out of it. Like the percentage out of a hundred agency out of it and I guarantee you it's like in the single digits oh.

This is good. I think this has been a fun one. I hope I haven't been making sense I'm feeling like I'm getting a little more. This one's been a little bit more conceptual because I know I've been sort of grinding down closer to the pavement. Since the first couple batch of post-enlightenment streams. But now I feel like I'm I'm coming to popping up again like the top of the the front wheels popping off that pave it a little bit and just want to make sure gonna get some feedback here. If this is tracking for people all right good really good yeah. Now I'm feeling very on the beam. Right now have been last couple days after a little bit of a I've not been doing acid by the way this idea that I'm like constantly hi yes I smoke weed. But I've always I've been a tumor for a while and of course you know plenty of people are are relatively common weed smokers. I don't smoke as much weed as a lot of people I know will know but no I have not been like dosing myself.

I try to I try to not overuse this stuff because I want to be using it for a long time like therapeutically so I don't want to fry my circuits prematurely. But I'll probably do it again. Soon. It's been a while. Wow so I might do it again soon but like it's a cliche to say that oh man took a trip and like you know I know everything. It's like no one knows anything and that's what you learn you learn you don't know anything.

But if you can attach that to a greater a greater confidence in your understanding of the consequences of that reality of the profound ignorance that we all live in that's the real freedom I keep hearing people talk about this Alan Watts character and what I've looked at has been interesting. He seems to be a dude operating on a good wavelength. I'd like to I'd like to listen to him. Some more somebody asked your best 30 rock moments and I'm just gonna say not the best really. But I would just want to stick up for the live episodes one of which has now been removed from Netflix because of the half-assed blackface. They did it in in the scene with Jon Hamm which was very funny at the time because you could tell like the evolution of social order like in not in the in 90 in 1999 as people found out recently and freaked out about Jimmy Fallon did full blackface to play Chris Rock dark blackface now 30 rock and I think like 2010 what they did is. They did like Cork like a little bit of cork which I think there's like a vaudeville tradition there.

So that's like not totally half as a given but clearly they understood that they could not go all the way they couldn't do like an Al Jolson face and now ten years later they retro actively removing. So you can see how like the attitude changes over time and you could say that's good you know good good that we're not doing that and I'd say I think it probably is good but I do think that what you if you accept that if you accept that progression and you're happy about it it means you have to let it go. It means you can't keep dragging up the old stuff. There has to be a truth guerrilla conciliation committee. There has to be a Truth and Reconciliation committee because because if there's not if there's only blame and never ever forgiveness what is it gonna be the incentive for anyone to go along with your social order.

Why would anyone say I'm going to accept a new premise of like the wrongness of blackface or or you know the wrongness of these slurs or the need for inclusivity in the business or whatever when the thing I said before this moment years before is going to condemn me in the new reality. Why would I sign on you need people to sign on to the new social contract that you're grilling and you're essentially telling people that unless they are pure of heart and some Calvinistic freak show away which only these psychos even think they are and a lot of them are a lot of them get canceled themselves if somebody digs it up. But they're deluded themselves into thinking they're gonna be on the winning end of that end of that coin flip. So why would you ever do that so what you mean. This is like if we want to celebrate the fact that now no one wants to do blackface. You have to let it go you have to let it go. It means the old ones I have you need if you need to wipe the slate. We need a jubilee and if people will if anyone who says no to that deal and anyone says I will not trade my ability to be vindictive towards somebody for actual social progress well. Then they don't want social progress. They want to have the weapon they want to beat people with it. It's like why would I want to disarm why would I want to give up my guns. It's like the social sjw version of second amendment. Like you'll disarm me and then you will take me over you'll take my cancel culture when you pry it from my cold dead hand and like I said like this doesn't apply the stuff that happens now because you're building the new order right. Now you need to have enforceable social norms and society needs to be able to enforce them and people.

Complaining online is a pro as a form of that but it Mike it cannot be retro actively applied. There has to be an understanding that people can change without that you won't get nowhere and it's because you don't want to get anywhere. So ask yourself anybody. You resist what I'm saying any one of you here system gets mad ask yourself. Why do you think you need that and I think the most the best answer. The one that's like least incriminating and therefore the one I'm gonna choose to believe is the most most motivating or the most people because I do assume good faith in most people. Not everybody is an evil double agent. It's that I'm worried about losing out in the new order. I'm a little worried that at some point things are gonna go bad and then and it and there's gonna be a big setback and I'm not gonna have I'm not gonna be able to defend myself and I think to the degree that that's the concern it just speaks to a lack of lack of faith in the project. A lack of faith and your ability to win and to that I have to say that's a cure Guardian leap of faith that you have to take to truly in good faith engage with the movement and if you can't do that then you are not part of it and you know what if people can look inside themselves and answer that question I think it could be illuminating and I think a lot of people realize you know what I can lay down this burden and give myself over this cause cuz. It's worth it and I'm ready to take the risk. I think a lot of people would make that choice and if they made that conscious choice their approach to everything would change and they would realize I don't care if we. That's five years old or five months old. Even I think a lot of people would make that choice but they don't even know that they're there. They're choosing not to do that they don't even know.

They have the option because it's all happening below the level of consciousness. So I'd say we're all gonna like. If there's gonna be a coming together and I doubt there will be cuz. Everything's still online and online pushes us apart and polarizes us there's any hope that we overcome that it'll be people coming together around ideas that are mutually agreeable and and enforceable. And I would say that one of them is statute of limitations on cancellations. Six months. Maybe four months we could have to argue it could be a negotiation let. It be a negotiation so that people feel that they're contributing to the final decision and have investment in it and then agree problem is there's no one to make this deal because no one is representing anyone. It's just a bunch of individuals navigating this entrepreneurial neoliberal web space to create identities until there's a polarization around things like class to coordinate meta coordinate and make these kind of deals. There's no hope and that's why you have to hope for material intervention to break up the online anti dialectic and maybe that will happen I'm still holding out hope. But it's not happening now and that's why my big advice to people in the moment right.

Now I feel the thing that feels most true is log-off does it agree that you can but don't just sit around. Don't just game don't just jack off. Don't just get high apply yourself to something with your whole heart and intention and if you focus hard enough on the world around you you can find something it doesn't have to be political. The political comes later after you've satisfied the deeper urge that your political life is only a cover for. It's only a bullet hole and it's only a band-aid on a political wound. It's what you have you have a spiritual ache and you're trying to cover it with politics but that politics has to come out of spiritual understanding not cover for spiritual emptiness because then it will always lead you astray so fill that hole at the spiritual level by applying yourself to the world around you in a way that is satisfying to the stew and keeps you in the moment and makes you perceptive of your moment and then you will find a place to put your politics that will merge from that organically. Oh that's a good one. I feel like this is a good one I might recommend this one to people of course.

I could also have already cancelled myself. I don't even know I can't find I haven't look. I mean this is my phone. Nobody's texted me. So I think I'm all right. But I could someone could have already cancelled me for this. Stream I'm not sure a few times I felt like I was like riding on a higher frequency. It kind of might not have. I don't know gotten conceptually low enough to get to a point of good faith common understanding we'll see if I'm canceled then so be it shoot you coward you are only cancelling a man tweet you cowards you are only cancelling a man. There we go haha drama can't my friend who is clearly watching. The stream has just texted me to say the night I canceled that's a fun spoof. John thank you shout out to Java time. That's this thing there is.

No you couldn't make that deal because there's no one to make a deal because no one's coordinating any of this which is why the arguments about the efficacy or lief ethics of cancer. Medium posts or podcasts you could listen to to get everybody to change their minds about it because every one of those articles feeds the cycle people read that but they don't read it in a vacuum. They read it through the lens of their existing ideology and their existing underlying interests self interests or perceived self interests and that means that it will only generate its own antithesis everything every article like every every own on a subreddit every podcast that speaks the truth every like trolling article and provocation against the PC police as satisfying as they are and as useful to build morale on your side. As they are. They only speed the cycle because it's the other side needs things like that to wheat their stone and identity against they have to have the Chum to be themselves. So of course. They they serve a purpose. They're part of the ecosystem and and and nothing can stop that and so no no speeches. No posts are going to change this situation it cannot happen.

It's an anti dialect. It's it's it's locked. It has to be broken out of so every because like every argument about whether this is good or bad what every arguing about what council culture is or whether it's good or bad is just part of the fishtank of eddie's and swirls that creates counterculture culture cancel culture. Its constituent 'iv of it every argument of bow council culture is constitutive of cancel culture. There is no out it is all one thing because it is that argument that creates the sides and defines the sides and that's what makes cancelling inevitable and spontaneous which means no one can stop it or start it which means arguing about whether it's good or bad is meaningless. It's like asking. If a storm is good or bad. It might have good or bad effects but the thing itself has no moral. It has no moral dimension. It might do a good or pain like a that that storm blew out that forest fire that's a good storm. Hey that storm destroyed our own town that's a bad storm. It was the effects that are good or bad. The thing itself has no moral dimension but that's what we're all doing. We're ascribing a moral dimension to something that is effectively a wind pattern. So there we go that was fun. I might have to watch this later to go through some stuff to make sure I didn't make a make some sort of confusion that I'd have to explain and follow up on but for now feeling pretty good about it. Maybe I'll take a question or two you before I log off I'm vibing right now yeah. I don't want to go off on a rant here.

Oh the name of the book I'm recommending escape from Rome by Walter shadle. He has another book that I'm gonna read after this one now because I'm a huge fan where he talks about the history of wealth inequality and he argues pretty persuasively because I've read his argument in other forms of being quoted and like interpreted that the things that ever have successfully really brought down the wealth. Just huge wealth disparities in a culture are Wars and massive plagues massive population loss through either warfare and capital instruction through warfare or or viruses and plagues and of course civil collapse. So the attempt the quit great leveller. That's it yeah and that's another one where it's hard to argue and I think the real question isn't whether that's going to happen again. It's how what the conditions of that that collapse are because you know it doesn't have to be population declining and dying it can be capital being destroyed but capital can be destroyed productively like there could be like a distribution of capital can like destroy concentrated capital well like creating a more efficient social system or a economic engine out of the remainders ah yeah oh man yeah. The David Harvey thing is pretty annoying because he when he says we can't just let it really does show the how people really haven't thought through anything beyond like the romantic.

The romantic personal attachment to revolution there's very very little. It's kind of a nauseating and a small amount of of thought put into what you actually would do to seize power or do with it. And I understand you don't to put the cart before the horse but being so instinctively repulsed towards the idea of managing a move away from capitalism that doesn't destroy the lives of millions of people that isn't massively deadly and awful like maybe maybe be easier to build a humane society through the existing humane. Institutions that are interwoven within contradictorily within liberal capitalism instead of starting from scratch in the Hobbesian war of all against all do you not understand how that is one is more preferable to the other just a pure moral perspective but also in terms of expediting the process of communism criminy like everything every every level of capitalist development you destroying a collapse that has to get built back up. You know right you need a certain amount of concentrated capital to create the technological inputs to alleviate enough need for human inputs to allow for socialism.

Thursday isn't there is a but it is specifically I don't think has been ever devised. But there is a tipping point of technological development that is necessary to socialize production non hierarchically so if you destroy capitalism and it just collapses and it collapses that capacity and destroys that capacity it has to be rebuilt and it was only ever built through. Capitalism that attempts to do it through. Communism have been were less effective. It was because they were in competition with capitalism but they also had access to the capital which they wouldn't in this Constituent situation oh. It's raining again guys well. This is a good one. I'll talk to you guys soon see you on the flippity-flop.
