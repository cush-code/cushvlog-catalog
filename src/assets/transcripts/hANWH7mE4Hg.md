Mama pajama rolled out of bed and she went to the police station. Papa pound out he began to shout and started the investigation. It was against the law. It was against the law what your mama saw it was against the law. Mama looked down and spit on the ground every time a name gets mentioned. Papa said oh if I got that boy. I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention but I know no way.

I don't know where I'm going and I'm on my way. I'm taking my time. But I don't know where goodbye rosie the queen of corona seeing me and julia down by the schoolyard. See me and julia down by the schoolyard. Okay finally got it to work didn't work at first. Hello folks the queen of corona indeed how have they not renamed that park corona park just sitting there in the middle of queens and they never renamed the beer either another thing. I can't kind of get my head around but it both seemed like that would have been no brainers. I guess you just don't want to admit what's really happening corona heights in san francisco. There we go.

I gotta say someone says the new snyder movie very excited for the new zach snyder zombie movie because dawn of the dead is probably his best film and that opening sequence is really the best. It is the best zom. It's the closest. Any zombie movie has gotten to what I have always wanted in a zombie movie and never got which is the actual moment. The the the the dramatization of the moment when the zombie crisis hits normality and disrupts it and and there isn't a They tried it in world of the book world. War. Z does a great job of that but the movie has just one stupid terrible scene where a bunch of guys are running around in philadelphia. Otherwise very lame but that opening sequence when it's the suburban waukesha county cul-de-sac just going to hell it's tasty of course. It couldn't sustain it because the rules of the game and also what's cheap to film don't really allow for that kind of thing. But I'm looking forward to it.

The fact that they digitally replaced chris delia with tygnataro. Like a year after the movie was made is pretty funny so that'll be funny to see and also I'm interested to see how they get the incredibly stupid premise of bank heist during a zombie apocalypse because a lot of people say what are you gonna do with the money. My presumption is is that it's a contained zombie situation. The zombies like took over las vegas but there's also now like a return civilization but you gotta figure post zombie apocalypse that they would have at least they would at least revalue the dinar. You know put out some new sort of currency bitcoin. Maybe okay so one bit of business before.

I start what I want to talk about today and that is that for next week going to read the first three chapters of corbs weimar republic. I'm not sure we might just read that and be done with it because it's from what I understand one of the best his best like capsule treatments of the german revolution. So we'll read that and that'll we'll go from there. I kind of have an idea that I want to read a kim stanley. Robinson book because a lot of what I'm going to be talking about and what I've been focusing on in my mind. Lately is is confronting the reality of living trying to live and trying to articulate a political subjectivity at a time of full despair. And I do think that there is a way that despair can be grappled with and transcended and I'm trying to help. I'm trying to do it for myself and I'm finding like by the day I am able to do it you know and that's all it is. It's a it's it's never a it is a project. All life is that day-to-day project that minute by minute project. It's not something that can be just turned on and off like a light. It's a it's a daily struggle but you can struggle easily or more difficultly. You know you could be confronting the real thing or you can be dealing with some epiphenomenon of it that you then engage with instead and which will never allow you to get anything where because you're never you're not actually confronting anything and so I wanted to maybe read something that because you know the despair is why I was looking backward. The despair is why I'm looking at you know the civil war and the german revolution and thinking like what could have gone differently where where is another. Where is that other world that we could be living in but also and but that's not the only thing. I want to do with it because you know. I still have we all have to live now so cameron stanley.

Robinson has been doing a very interesting job in trying to do non-doom-based non-capitalist fantasy science futurist fiction which is very difficult because as we'll talk about the future now only belongs to the rich. The future has been privatized. The future are the only people who the rich are the only people who get to imagine a future. Yes. Ministry of the future is the one that I want to read so we'll see about that after the weimar thing so if you're rich you can imagine a future for your children. You can imagine giving them a world better than yours because you can convince yourself. the same way the mid-century modernists convince themselves about a middle-class future. They can imagine a boutique rich person future and all the stuff that's gonna happen everybody else will be very unfortunate but also unavoidable inevitable and not my problem. At the end of the day. Nobody else gets to imagine a future when we think of what's coming next.

It's just a black hole. It's terror and so that is one of the things that depoliticizes the mass of people because if you have no future that you can move towards realistically Then. What's the point of engaging anything why not as we talked about last week just trying to solve in the shortest term possible my own selfish desires. it's the only smart move in a futureless world. So confronting. Despair is about reclaiming the future in a lot of ways and ex and and accepting despair. But accepting with it that you still exist and that you still have a beating heart and that something is driving it and to find what that is and move towards it. And we can all do that But it means disengaging from a lot of the things that we have become addicted to that have allowed us to to cope without actually directly addressing and so I think reading something that is unabashed in its willingness to imagine a human future. even though that is cringe because my god how could anyone take it seriously how can anybody take it seriously. We all know. It's we're doomed. We all know that there's no technology look who look who look what kind of social cohesion. We have or or class consciousness that's terrific. It's a terrifying prospect. The math doesn't hold up but so everybody has to risk cringing. Everybody has to risk stepping off into the abyss and saying I'm going to believe that we can do this and so after we do this stuff with weimar. I want to read the ministry of the future by kim stanley robinson. So that's we'll be doing that one um so to get to what I wanted to talk about today though and dealing with despair. is the in my mind uncanny resonance between the current moment.

I wouldn't say decade because I think we're beyond the point where discrete decades at least maybe We're beyond decades or maybe they can only be understood in further retrospect than we have now whatever you want to call it this period. I would say post 2008 whatever you want to call that it's now what it's now 12 years 13 years. It's a long decade. Let's say is essentially the 1970s being recapitulated in that it is an era of mass disillusionment from a an understood system. The 1970s was the decade when america throughout in every walk of life not just the hippies who got disillusioned by the failure of their movement everybody from suburban reactionary homeowners to haiti ashbury burnouts. Everybody got the ned baby speech. Everybody got the the conversation with the man in the back of the room to tell them how things really were. Everybody got to eat a naked lunch in the 1970s because all of our illusions were no longer sustainable our economy. The the keynesian welfare state that we built was no longer sustainable the the social models we created were collapsing our expectation of advancement of a future better than our present that that the carrot on the stick of in america's exceptionalism has been extinguished. We all of our institutions were proven to be. criminal jokes the media politicians you had watergate.

You had the church committee. You had a you had the hangover vietnam everyone understood and then when you combined that with just bread and butter stuff like the the real beginning of de-industrialization and the massive strike wave that's like the very tail end of american labor militancy sort of burned off. Like the last excess energy. The labor movement have burned off in a bunch of wildcat strikes in the 70s sort of a mirror of the burst of strike activity in the late 1940s that sort of set the stage. For the it was the birth of the modern business-oriented collaborationist post-war labor movement and it's and it began with a bunch of wildcat strikes in the late 40s. 1948 and it ended with a bunch of wildcat strikes in the 1970s and they mostly failed so the labor movement failed. It was awash in corruption and it it's it's was not unable to meet the needs of its members. The institutions that deployed people were already moving jobs away in inflation and and unemployment coming together in a way that no economist thought was possible and then the church that the church committee and the revelation that yeah your government was spying on you and assassinating leaders and maybe killed the president. There was a house committee on assassinations in the 70s that found probable cause that kennedy was killed as a part of a conspiracy. They put it at the foot of the mob but nobody really believed that and of course watergate the president presidency. The this institution that had a genuine investment in the notion of the presidency people believed in the president in a fundamental way. Now of course vietnam certainly started creating that crisis of credibility. But what and that but then nixon's entire behavior and then finally of course in office and then of course watergate just destroyed it and so the systems failed. it couldn't it was spiritually dead. It was corrupt and crooked and it didn't even function anymore at providing material gains and you had jimmy carter trying to to quit put out a liberal sort of pious pie.

 pious gloss on it and a need for america to regain spiritual. um. He demanded that americans refine their non-materialist spirit at the very same moment that the credit card was being introduced in mass numbers for the first time. The very first time that americans were asked to consumer economy that we're replacing manufacturing with so everything's broken down carter represents the very tail end of the liberal consensus when all of its bread and butter promises are gone and all that's left is. Its piety is its smug morality and of course that's not sufficient to the moment. But what is and I think I mean this should sound familiar like we are in that era the iraq the war on terror the the economic collapse the presidency of trump in every direct like if you're a liberal or or reactionary. The the elections of just the the presidential elections have essentially destroyed any lingering faith you had in the system but what this moment of disillusionment is from. It's not. It's obviously not from the thing that was destroyed in the 70s because what happened in the 70s and this is the distinction between the 70s and now this is what make this is the significant fundamental difference is that we were trapped in this. this mire despair in the 70s all of our systems don't work. We don't even trust ourselves anymore because we don't even know who we are and then into this morass into this moment where everybody has taken the red pill and pulled themselves out of the matrix and found out that they live in a mud puddle with no sun and they're tasked now to remake the world with no tools ronald reagan shows up and this is and presents to people on a chance to get back into the matrix. The reagan reagan response was hey guys you know all this horrible stuff. We know let's all forget about it. Let's all pretend.

This didn't happen and we're gonna be able to give you your your your consumer spending back your confidence back your your sense of destiny and your sense of um your sense of self possession back because you're gonna gonna cut your taxes. We're gonna this whole government model. This whole keynesian model we're throwing that out and we're gonna. We're gonna bet on you and given the options. That's what people chose. That's it was right there of course oh my god. What are we to try this instead what if we say it's every man for himself and if that's the case I'm going to get ahead.

We're going to get rid of the whole notion that there's any sort of social compact and that will allow us to forget everything because all that stuff that was the old that was all the bad accumulated gunk of of post-war liberalism. We can blow the dirt off and start fresh and then we have what's right about america the good stuff and so we built a new consumer-based economy based on that But the thing is is that it wasn't just reagan offering this reagan offered it to this the the the the mass audience of like suburbanites who make up the center of gravity of american politics that was the his pitch. That was the pitch they got was from reagan and it sounded great but everybody got a pitch like I've been reading recently about some of the early 70s like psychonaut guys like like robert anton wilson and terence mckenna all those like psychedelic dudes who hit the hard edge of the failure of the 60s and their faith in the ability of like the individuated consciousness of people to come together to overthrow evil because remember the american like counter culture was broadly libertarian because it was middle class. It rebelled against the status quo because it restrained the individual that's one of the big reasons it was unable to be politically effective. So the 70s saw this crisis along every axis not just at middle america but among the most advanced progressive elements who did not have any connection to a class project or a class consciousness.

They had a desire to transcend. They wanted to skip over class because it's too hard. It's too tough in america and because we're too isolated from it and because it threatens our autonomy and we really do we really do value our autonomy america throughout even our left throughout. America has been wildly suffused with our basic ideological understanding of freedom. I mean how could it not be where else is it coming from it's generated by our culture and our and even our even at its most powerful. Our our working class. Political consciousness was enmeshed with it as well so the dream. After the failure of the people to organize in the 60s became well. We will get over the bump of organizing by literally just expanding consciousness like john lily and timothy leary.

All of these dudes were like we're just gonna use our brains to like fix. The sequin get a frequency that overwhelms everything all of our structural impediments. Of course. This is very non-dialectical and it's very non-marxist but that's because this is what they had and this is what they had. Their brains were by then and even they got a deal in this. In the 80s even they got an opening that allowed them to move forward out of despair and it was networking cybernetics and the internet the california ideology. The california ideology was the was the defeated counterculture on the west coast trying to get around the question of politics by creating a technological infrastructure of communication that would lead to a raising of consciousness that would literally allow us to evolve beyond the needs for these institutions that are imprisoning us and those guys. All a lot of them ended up working with early internet pioneers and early computer research and there was a huge overlap in in in computer science and that like psychedelic ideology and here we are now after having the internet around for 40 years.

Here we are now where no one can promise what reagan promised. We can only blame others for the doom that part he was good at but he was also good at sketching an alternative. No one can believe in that because the neo-liberal state that reagan built and that that people invested belief in and that they reconstructed and reinvested their belief in institutions like media and government. Around has now failed the same way that the post war keynesian consensus failed in the 70s. It has now failed as a as comprehensively and even more dramatically because the 70s really was this weird like frog in a pot thing. This was a collapse and then a real making of the economy in the aftermath of the collapse that destroyed the last lingering public investment in america in america's like economy home ownership and so now you can't believe in any political alternative that's going to wipe. The slate clean like reagan promised to and give us a new thing to believe in and gives us a chance to forget.

We can't forget and then even at the margins you cannot hope for some sort of technological spiritual transformation because we know what that leads to the california. Ideology had led to the creation of the single most effective communicator of of a demiurgical superstructural mind prison you could imagine this without even having to use the little nanobots. They they essentially put a panopticon in our own minds forgetting what what any kind of actual surveillance technology we now are subject to which is comprehensive. We have what we have the panopticon in our mind. Now so we can't even believe in that so we have to believe in something else and it can't be the self because all these things are premised on the self and our crisis now is that we can no longer reconcile ourself as we understand it with the world we're living in and that means we have to change our perceptions of the self and that is the hope we must fixate on and the hope that exists and cannot be denied is that that despair is premised on an understanding of ourselves that is that assumes as inviable this. this transactional relationship we have with our each other and the very fabric of reality. This this isolated this isolation that we operate from the premise of because it's in that context that all that disillusionment of the 70s only led to reaction because we were disillusioned but we were not re-illusioned. We're not we're not re-illusioned around the necessity for our collaborative action. We were in fact only reaffirmed in the futility of collaborative action but now there's no there's no ra.

There's no vent. There is no promise that can be made plausibly and that means we're going to have to just out of sheer survival instinct. Gonna have to change because even our most selfish instinctive desires are now in conflict with our ability to sustain ourselves in this time and so without any more without any dream of of sor of transcendence without any fantasy of of reorientation of the economy coming from the structures we have we will all on our own timelines be forced with a a final confrontation with the box with no. The the the windowless room we're gonna find ourselves with no escape and then we're gonna have to make one instead of taking the one that's offered us instead of going where they where they heard us. We're going to have to holes in where we see fit. I do not understand cybernetics excuse me sir. I don't know anything about computers I am saying one thing. I there's one thing. I know about computers and is that the promise of computers in the 70s. has led to a reality that is the diametrical opposite of everything that the people who put them together claimed.

I think even to themselves they were doing somebody asked what disco demolition night is and I gotta say surprise that I mean I guess. I shouldn't be you. Guys are all kids. I don't remember this but it's one of those historical curios. I really like so in. I believe it was what night what year was it what year was it. I don't the specific year it was 1979. It was july 12 1979.

 there was a doubleheader at Kaminsky park in chicago and as a promotion to get people in. They had a local radio dj from the north suburbs who was making a name for himself as a fervent hater of disco. He would talk about how much disco sucked. He would he would make fun of it all the time on the show and he was holding the standard for rock and of course people talk about how that is you know that's all a reactionary like white supremacist. instinct. It's a revulsion at like the queer blackness of disco and it's like an expression of that probably do it agree. I don't know but so they one way or another. They decided that they could get people into the stadium by having this dude run a promotion where if you you could get in either discounted or for free. If you brought a disco record with you to the to the first game and then at the moment between the games they were going to take all those 

 albums that have been collected put them in a big pile in the middle of the outfield and run them over with a um like a bulldozer. I think. Like blow them up. They used explosives and they did it and it was not a good idea. It was it was a mistake because for the first of all everybody who came was essentially insane like they were all shit-faced before they got. There they were all wild as hell and then once the and you had this explosion of of of just libidinal energy. You just you you could just see how how if you get people together and you simmer the crock pot the right way it could just pop off and so they ended up having to cancel the second game and the white sox forfeited because they couldn't take control of the stadium nickel. 10 cent beer knight was in cleveland. That's another good one that one everyone got so shit-faced that they had to the indians had to forfeit the second game in the doubleheader because fans jumped on the field and tried to fight the royals outfielders or the rangers outfielders oh man.

Someone wants me to talk about the loco focos. The locofocos great name one of the best names for a political faction in the american history. The 19th century really did have all the best political faction names. You had the locofocos you had the hunkers and the barn burners you had the mug wumps. You had the half breeds and the stalwarts all very good So the locofocos were a faction of the new york city democratic party that was a self-consciously working-class arrangement. They were they had been. They were named that because there had been a meeting of of democrats in new york and there'd been a dispute between the the the workies. As they were called the labor. The laborers who made up the part of the party and the regular democrats and the the workies went into their own hall to have a meeting and the lights were turned off. Like the the candles were blown out by a by the regulars and then to light the room. The workers pulled out these self-lighting cigars that were popular at the time you'd like pull them out of the tube and there'd be an internal match and it would light the thing and so they pulled out their loco focos and they held them up to get the light going and that's what they were called and they were the first real self working class formation within the democratic party.

But the thing is is that they didn't really have any significant effect on or influence of the party because they were so it was so protein and the issues that there was still such a a unformed conception of like what working-class interests were at that time because there were relatively few of urban laborers in the country at that point and it is one of the one of the things that contributed to america's relative reactionary. politics relatively reactionary politics and failure for any labor party to sustain itself is that america because of its ability to to trade land for discontent was able to create mass democracy earlier than europe was so that by the time you saw mass working-class politics emerged. In late 1800s it ended up being funneled into the democratic party. Whereas in europe there had been no mass politics before that point which meant that the parties that were emerged were self-consciously oriented around and dominated by the workers whereas even at the height of their influence within the democratic party like the working class. As such was always one element of a coalition and was never the director of a party and the loco focos were the first little burst of of working class energy around um the democratic party. The loco focos and one of the big locofoco demands was at this time which was dominated by banking as the main domestic issue.

As the main political terrain of argument It was banking and there was a question of whether you're going to have where you're going gonna have a national bank like the whigs wanted or you're. Gonna have a system of pet regional banks or then later an independent treasury like the democrats wanted all the way to in one way or another keep the reality of the state's role in creating currency away from politics which people thought even at the even regular americans thought was freedom. They thought that an independent treasury was somehow possible and would protect their liberty and sure didn't end up happening but there were a bunch of questions. One about how are we going to charter banks. How many banks are going to be allowed to operate who is going to decide who who allows a bank to be chartered because one of the big complaints about the early 19th century banking system is that banks were banks needed to be chartered by states and those charters were often given to friends of politically influential people as you would imagine there's a reason that the jacksonian network banks were called pet banks because they were all parts of the patriot networks around the democratic party where the banks existed and those banks were the sole distributor of paper currency in the country because there was no national currency.

At this point we had gold as the standard but there was no national gold-backed currency. Banks would have a certain reserve of gold that they could then lend paper currency out on essentially and that is what created the amount the amount of currency that that facilitated economic activity and that so the battle over the banks really was this battle over where who would decide what where money is and how and and and how much money there would be But the problem is from the point of view of working-class politics. the actual answer of the state determines it. We should do it collectively and we should do it democratically was not conceivable the the the the working men of america. The laborers believed that the greatest freedom was in the greatest abstraction away from politics of the money supply which is mystification.

But the closest thing that existed in which the locofocos insisted upon was an idea for free banking and that meant anybody could charter a bank regardless of their relationship with the state. They didn't need to get a charter. They could enough people could get together and then they could declare a bank to exist and this was very popular at the high end of the democratic party in its elites because if a lot of powerful people could then get more bank access to to credit to create banks because they could access this new system without having to go through the The checks having to make the right negotiation the right deals and having to deal with the like the quotas on banks that were allowed to be chartered and so the locofocos thought that the best thing for the working man was to allow everybody to have a bank and that was like a primitive attempt to articulate a social economy but just too early favorite elroy novel character.

I will always love american tabloid because it's the first one I read and it blew my mind and obviously all of his characters are archetypes so you're really just asking when you're saying which favorite character which is your favorite expression of which is one of your favorite elroy archetypes because you've got the the violent but secretly sensitive bruiser your bud white your pete bonder on you've got your your smooth operator who's slowly coming acro coming apart at the seams like jack van sense and kemper boyd and then you've got your cowardly nerd who is addicted to his own self-righteousness but is too weak to pursue his own values like ward little or ed axley and I've said before that. If you had the buzzfeed. If there was a buzzfeed quiz are you camper pete or ward from american tabloid. everybody who is on twitter would including myself would get ward so although I think pete bondurant is a huge just absolute pimp and I think he's cool so just from that perspective. My favorite character of his in cool points is pete boundary. The one that I relate to the most is of course ward little. I love the idea that he made him just a canuck that he made him a quebecois no need and a seven foot tall canuck snapping people's necks yeah definitely.

American taboo is a great place to start because it's the first book in a trilogy. There's no other stuff that you need to know beforehand but if you do read them all and then you want to read. The la quartet don't do what I did. I very because I didn't really know enough about him. I just went to the library and started reading after I read all his other stuff. is that I read white jazz before I read any of the other la quartet and that was a mistake because it really is a cool culmination of a bunch of stuff in la confidential that didn't hit the way that it would have if I had read at least teleconfidential first so for the love of god read lay confidential before white jazz. There's a somebody says they only read american tabloid. My god yes the cold 6000 and bloods are over a lot of people don't like blood's a rover because it is very different than his other stuff. It's more contemplative and romantic but I think that as the culmination of that project it's really fitting especially since the cold 6000 is so brutally alienating the cold 6000 in part because it's so big and it has so much plot in it. I mean it's got the like american tablet is about to lead up to the kennedy assassination. gold 6000 features the rfk and kennedy assassinations in it and has a whole bunch more characters and stuff.

So in order to accommodate that he essentially just brushed that thing down to every sentence just object verb as few as words as possible and so it's very. It's almost. It's it's avant-garde and it's tears-ness. So. It's a. It's a very. It's a whiplash. But it's very It's fun.

We might get a snag flashing again who knows I mean. I didn't want to get into this too much because I don't want to get all like. I don't speculate. I try not to speculate anymore because that's what really got me wound up in the lead-up to the election and then all the stuff after that is having to have an argument a take that I could really feel like I understood and felt confidence in about the future that's why I've been sticking with history. But we have reached the point now after 2008 where all of the illusions that used to shroud our system. Our our political economy are now gone.

One of the big reasons that the 2008 collapse happened was that after there were the first few buckling within the institutions of wall street. the first instinct of the powers that be was to not intervene with government money and that's where that's why bear stearns collapse. That's what started the whole thing to go the dominoes to fall. And I think we're now at a point where and I think we saw this with the care act last year which was just this massive liquidity dump that was on par with what happened in 2008 without any kind of oversight or discussion. About. It is that we'll never get another situation where there is any hesitation to just flood the chamber with money because the date I think the reason that there was any kind of um fiscal discipline was the worry that well.

If this happens what if the the good money flows somewhere else what if what if the the the circulation is is interrupted and I feel like this current moment right now where you're seeing these insane escalations of bubbles in every segment of the economy. The creation of new fake simulated things to have bubbles about like nfts and crypto is proof that everyone at every level of control of this structure knows that there is nowhere else for the money to go that that the the american dollar and and its surrounding investment pools. The american state basically is the only place to for the money to go. It's it's the hole. At the end of the of the It's the hole at the end of the gutter. It's all getting sucked down so they'll just keep inflating everything just has to keep inflating what's going to pop it. What pops every other bubble was when the money stops coming in right in the 19th century. What would happen is that you'd have a big speculative bubble around land like in the 1830s or about railroads in the 1870s and then the europeans would decide to bring back some of their species or invest somewhere else and then boom you'd have a giant collapse. There's nowhere else for the money to go where else is the money supposed to go. People talk about the end of america's reserve currency status and that would be game over if that happened.

But there's nowhere else currently up to the task. So how the does this thing sustain itself. It seems like it shouldn't but also it keeps doing it and there isn't any alternative and no one at the top seems that worried about it. But that's the thing if you're at the top of this system even if you knew for a fact that all these books are cooked and the end is gonna and this economic structure is going to break down. The supply chain itself is gonna break down in the near future. You wouldn't behave any differently than they would than they are right now because why the hell would you want to spook the horses especially when you have already made it so that you know if that does happen you'll be fine.

Internet advertising thank you the data is worth nothing this is a perfect example so that's a bubble that should pop at some point right. The data dollar in the silicon valley because we know now pretty definitively that none of that data is worth anything. None of those clicks are worth anything including in terms of adding value to the companies that pay for them. But it doesn't matter if everybody knows that if every single person involved in all of these translation transactions is aware of that. Their incentive is still to do it because it's what keeps the the the tech economy going. It's the only dynamic sector so we're in a situation where it will continue to go until it collapses because all the incentives of everyone in a position of power are to keep it going because they don't have to actually risk anything because you could say oh no wouldn't that hurt their their investments and stuff well yeah. But they would not be like. It would put them in actual danger of losing their position. I mean if we're not yeah oh they might move their. They might lose their their money but they won't lose their position. They will have created their own technological bubbles that will allow them to sustain themselves in any eventuality. And if that's the case if you've got that backstop.

Then why wouldn't you just keep going through the motions until it bucks up. The only question is when is it when does it pop and the thing that keeps with me is how is it going to pop where will the interruption and flow go have. We created a a global system that is now self. It's like fluid karma from southland tales and it's just it. The the very motion itself pulls it forward. It's wild and yeah. It's like obviously eventually climate change will pop it just in terms of interrupting the resource flow and then that's the end that's that that's the wheels will come right off. But that is not going to be a that is not going to be. A dramatic. Thing is the thing climate change. Effects for the foreseeable future are going to be They're going to be metabolized by the system like disasters cost money but they also provide speculative investment opportunities. Disaster capitalism always has its It's creative destructive potential in every failing in or in every in every emergent crisis. As long as there is a a a a some sort of equilibrium that can be maintained. It will be what will happen is that the edges will continue to be eaten away. The edges of what is considered the market what is considered the political sphere will be eaten away.

There's a story horrifying story about that. I read about how people in northern california whose homes were burned down during the big camp fire. There. Last year. are still homeless and are now being rousted out of the places that they have set up camp by the police. So these are people who until a year ago were solid citizens taxpayers who are on the inside of the citizenship bubble people who deserved people who who were part of us who deserve some sort of some sort of basic human dignity and access to redress their house gets burned down by a fire they can't get enough. They can't just build another one they're out of the club. They're now out there homo saucer.

A bunch of people in southern louisiana are been that way since that last big hurricane and I think that the dream of the of the big collapse is the dream where collapse comes fast and hard and with it at least a glimpse of freedom at least a glimpse of the ability to a chance to remake your relationship to your world because all of the restrictions and restraints and demands of life have changed you get to get closer to the vitality and you get to fight for yourself and others because the alternative is one where you just go from being totally under the command of the system but also within a pocket of rights and and expectations of of of rights to being outside of that but still under the control of systemic power. The thing stays there. It's just the wall moves and you're on the other side of the wall now but you're still in the sight line of the like in a drone hovering over your head telling you to move on. So. This is why I said why. I want to read something that confronts this this moment and imagines a way out because we all have to imagine a way out for ourselves if not for the world and I don't mean transcending the problems. I mean transcending our soul sickness at the scale of the problems transcending our paralysis. In the face of the problems.

The numbers are up here weird checklist all right. I'm going to wrap up here in a minute. Maybe answer a couple questions. Yes we need marianne. Williamson now marion williamson and jesse ventura. That's what we need no that's. I think we're past politics honestly man like it feels like everything is really simmering though like israel. That's that's a lot of that's a lot of that's intense and then colombia. I mean. It's. It's been just one rolling a crisis everywhere. Even obviously here last summer but it still hap but it still has this this horrible stasis to it. It's the it's it.

I think the thing that is so alienating and terrifying and and bewildering about the moment is that everything feels fully liquefied but also totally over determined and I feel like that's the 70s too like oh my god. Nothing is working every every structure. is leading us towards oblivion and yet none of them seem to actually be losing their power over us and so that really gives you the sensation of being locked in a car in an airplane where the pilot is jumped out and you're on course to hit a mountain and then you just have to spend your time trying to come to terms with what's going to come unless you figure out a way to get in the goddamn cockpit and get a goddamn one of the things and call someone that at air traffic control and talk your way out of it yeah. I saw the ned lamont god what a name a blast from the past the guy who was like the netflix the netflix the net roots candidate who is gonna who beat joe lieberman for the senate seat in connecticut and then was beaten by joe lieberman. When joe lieberman ran on a third party like independent joe lieberman party ticket with mo the support of I think a majority of dem republicans in connecticut ended up voting for him which is how he got back in and then ned lamont ended up running for governor. what a year or two ago and now he's grover clevelanding it throwing out the national guard to to stop a nursing home strike. It is interesting.

There's a lot of people who have theories about the care economy. The care economy being the next real main front of the labor of the the The labor movement and and and workers struggle. I mean we'll see. This is a good if it gets stamped out by this m16s and stealing people's medicine just getting robo tripping in the in the In the infirmary. I don't actually know what robo tripping is is that about taking robitussin. I don't know holding your breath. It would be really funny if biden just cured cancer though in the middle of all this like biting just comes out those guys cancer's done. If it was a what was it what if it was a vaccine though what if there what if there was a cancer cure all cancer is cured obviously this is impossible. I'm saying whatever cancer is cured. But it's a vaccine. I kind of think a lot of anti-vaxxers would would cave just because how scary cancer is. Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine but once again. It's for like specific types like there is no overall cancer cure. Although I don't know.

I gotta think that there has to be some genetic thing you could do some switch. You could turn off yeah what if you just injected yourself with like shark shark sperm or something those guys don't get cancer I if I learned anything from deep blue sea. It's that sharks don't get cancer or alzheimer's should you re-watch deep blue sea always. It's classic for a reason. Okay folks talk to you probably on friday and then next wednesday. We'll talk about the first three chapters of the cool book just be wrapping up about the the many bungles of the of the sdp and and frederick ebert who we all got to give two big thumbs down to all right bye.
