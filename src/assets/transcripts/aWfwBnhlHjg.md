Yeah. I am the one exterminating son half of africa in the world through the ditches and to the riches and drive in the back. You love burn through the and pile through the wizards and slap. In the back of the dragula yeah is is yeah baby yeah baby love oh man a computer being very annoying right. Now. It's been quite irritating glitch dot oh boy. I should do it right there. We go send tweet send dracula tweet. I've sent the tweet to dragula come on get down with the sickness. You get up come on get down with the sickness open up your head and let it flow into me sickness remember that richard cheese does anyone remember richard cheese. I don't remember when the funniest thing you could do was a lounge cover of a wrap or a new metal or old metal type song. It was a great time yo melinda hit my line melinda hit my line hell bill hit my line that's a lot of money. I mean. I know what I would want to do with it. Mostly incredible pranks just like next level pranks like put the dome from under the dome or the simpsons movie over a small town and then you film what happens. That's what you could do with bill or.

Melinda gates money so I'm kind of getting back a little bit to talking a little broad theory stuff here because I'm trying to work things out for projects and for you know my own understanding and I really do feel like the best format. I have found for kind of getting things clear to myself as a first pass is by coming on here and talking so. I realized that a lot of what I might say coming up here is just kind of tautological like it doesn't really actually explain anything it's not. It's not necessarily meaningful that it's kind of just a a descriptive paradigm and if that's the case that's fine. But it's a useful paradigm. I think for me in contextualizing you know the big questions which any kind of theory is supposed to deal with which is you know how do. I respond to the world around me. Like that's really. The point is you're supposed to know how am. I supposed to respond to the world around me and I feel like this. This is sort of a framework that hell should seems like it might be able to help me with that and I don't know. I wanted to run it by so.

I want to talk today about the role that belief faith has not not on the left not in socialism but in capitalism and in fact under all systems of of hierarchy and civilization that we've ever had so what compels people to participate in an exploitative social arrangement is not mere force right. It is social coercion through hegemonic concepts and what that means is belief. What that means is that you choose to do things because you believe certain things about the world. You what I mean. I mean by belief is you are acting on faith on the assumption that a fictive thing will persist that a fictive notion will persist and throughout human history.

What that fictive notion man included a whole bunch of things that were all socially related to one another. The individual is one of them and that's important to note that the individual is the first fiction. It's the first fake thing we believe in is the idea that there is a a persistent coherent individual identity traveling through time and space that we are that is the first fiction now how much we believe in that and how we relate to that concept is determined by our social around surroundings and the social the nature of our social. The social life we find ourselves embedded in and so that means that for most of human history the self was only one of was one of many things that we all believed in god as a as a personalized concept is something a lot of us believe for a long time the the idea that there is a supernatural transcendent element to the world that can't be perceived not rationally but emotionally is something that makes people go along with machineries of of oppression but also production. Also you know all the good things that we get out of society. All the stuff that allows us to thrive a lot. All the stuff that allows our individuality and the people around us that we have emotional relationships to to thrive and so one of the things we believe in is that the structures around us serve that purpose and our willingness to go along is determined by our degree of belief.

Now a lot of that belief if we're at the top end of the distribution of resources and pain like the least amount of pain. The most amount of resources believing in it is very easy because it gives us all benefit if we're on the end of the stick believing it is harder and when you're in the middle of course you're in the perilous precarious zone where we're believing it is a daily struggle. But that material part is only only part of it. There is a a mental structure. A notion of the world in your head that validates the system that you live under and the the history of the collapse of social systems is partially the story of belief collapsing belief in the the legitimacy of these systems because the legitimacy of the systems comes in contact with our other. The other fictions that we believe in like the self like our religious concepts whatever cosmology that we've we've created to determine right from wrong to determine to to to rank experiences from preferable to to avoidable and when those come in conflict conflict our belief in that leaves a hole which causes our willingness to invest in the system to reduce and a vicious cycle that ends up seeing energy directed outward. Seeing the system collapse and seeing new new ideas and new structures emerge with new validations and new fictions that everybody can agree on or at least can over time be sort of colonized into believing it and that's that's throughout history.

But then when you get to capitalism and the individual then when you get to the modern era you have for over time. What has happened is that those other things that are in there in the social world in the social fiction alongside the self. The individual they go away and the process of capitalism is the process of those things going away. Faster and faster as market relationships overall the the social and as that and as our lives become more and more isolated thanks to technology of separation and and capital flow and so while the beginning in the beginning of capitalism is of course with the primacy of the individual and by now we've reached a critical point where the only thing we have left to believe in is the self and that the crisis of liberal capitalism or liberal capitalism in america you know. It's it's unequal in a combined development. I'm talking about where I'm from what I'm used to this this end stage system that we're finding ourselves in this decadent western hegemony that seems to be losing its stamina and reason for being and the reason for that is that once the once the when the individual and capitalism emerge as the primary notions they're intertwined because if the individual is the only thing that you can believe in then the only way that the individual can thrive is in a system defined by market transactions between strangers because it's the only thing that doesn't require some sort of trust some sort of bond beyond recognition of like someone in a similar right category of human humanity or whatever or citizenship and absent that feeling of connection it has to be a transaction.

That's the only relationship that can be registered as not dangerous because it's supported by the state because it's it's validated by force that's transcended from any of the individuals within it and so that that reality creates a belief in capitalism. But here's the important distinction we start believing in capitalism once it emerges from an individual perspective not as the validator of a system. But as the deliverer of a result we believe in capitalism for the utilitarian observation that it allows for the individual to be to be actualized and so belief in capitalism which exists and which undergirds. The entire system from a social point of view is dependent upon a belief in the result in if I agree with this framework. If I agree with this this political economic arrangement then I will be able to thrive and the reason that america was sort of able to conquer the world is because it was able to take capitalism and apply it to a massive swath of despoilable and alienatable resources that could be distributed to a greater and greater circle of people within the the definition of citizenship and therefore bolster faith belief in the system because it gets results. It's a cargo called it gets results why how no one really knows but it gets results and it's the only thing compatible with individualism and I think our current crisis is the totalization of disenchantment nobody at any point get of participation in american capitalism believes in it anymore.

They don't believe that the system can give them. Consistent results now that doesn't mean that they don't believe in an abstract notion of the market. No because many of them identify their individuality with that market what they disbelieve in is the notion of of the of the democrat. The liberal democratic model liberal smart small l liberal democratic model of participatory democracy delivering capitalist. Outcomes now of course. That's not the case but they don't. They reject that they have a false understanding of that that's part of their fictional belief system. But every strata of american society is being confronted with the fact that they can't get what they have been promised from capitalism.

Now at the poor end what that leads to is a disengagement from trying people in the people in school reform love to talk about grit. They love to talk about the difference between a kid who succeeds in a bad school with a with a a dominantly mobile social milieu and one who doesn't is grit and what that they mean by that is a willingness to to stick with things and I think that what you see at the bottom end of the distribution of resources in in twilight. America is a recognition that there's no reason to try because there is no reason to believe that there will be an outcome that values that effort so why try and so that leads to paralysis stagnation deaths of despair drugs not all those things in the middle strata. It leads to people losing their commitment to the political framework of liberal democracy. One way or the other a willingness to try to accommodate a broad political milieu because they think that's the thing that's caught that's making it not work there. There's no reason to believe in the system because it cannot provide the political outcomes that they expect and so that's how you get politics dividing broadly into your feelings rejection of of the commons on the on the right and then kill the hicks neo um eugenics on the on the liberal left because they've both given up on the project and then in the at the top in the political class and then in the like. The real ruling class of finance and and and silicon valley.

You have a disenchantment because at the top of capitalism as capitalism accelerates and as the secular stagnation persists and as the decree of the the rate of profit continues to decline there's less and less given the system for discretion by managers both in the political and in the business sphere. What power is defined as is discretion the ability to choose to do one thing and not another thing and that really is a luxury of the human pilots of capitalism to get to imagine themselves exercising power by making choices and those choices have effects and they go down through the system and they shape its direction but in a narrow band and over time as capitalism maintain continues its its totalizing force. Eventually that that range of discretion of rule of power is shrunk until you don't get to make choices anymore and so there's no reason to invest in the game of power except for the most very narrow personal. Reasons like you can't even believe this. I truly believe that our political elites until very recently believed a lot of the horseshit about america. They believed it at a visceral level because they were part of a system that rewarded their effort that rewarded their power and discretion by changing and moving at their at their command.

Now they are feeling more and more as though they are instruments of something beyond themselves and so that makes them less invested in in caring about anything other than the most narrow. Because this is the real kick to the dick of the whole thing is that in previous societies and social orders this decline of belief in the ruling elite ruling ideology and the ruling structures might well lead to people trying to find something else. Some other forms of power emerging and of course you know they're going to have their own hierarchy but they're going to move things along dialectically. We are now at a point where people have for stopped believing in the system as such and they're blaming somebody for it. You know if it's q anon if it's online communists. If it's woke people freaking out about white supremacy. If it's liberals worrying about russia.

Everyone believes that the experiment is failing and that they don't and they believe that effort will be rewarded with anything so that cheating and and disengagement are the only rational things because this of the totalizing nature of capitalism that disenchantment is only going is only recuperated by itself by the self. We used to believe in a system as a delivery mechanism for the self so that we could plan a life around engagement with the system. Now all we have left is ourselves and so we are thinking becomes incredibly short term because we know we don't know that tomorrow any of the systems that we have today are going to give us anything. But we do know what we want. We think we know what we want in the moment and we know we think we know how we might go about getting it and so we engage with the world to get that narrow quick soothing boost of that that dopamine hit that serotonin bump whatever it is that gets us through the day and capitalism because at this point so much of its mechanisms are now technological and don't even require us to engage with them or believe in them because they operate independently are still churning and producing pleasures and producing distractions for us to engage with and to gain the system to get act to get gain access to and so there is no next step. There there is no counter form there's no there's no antithesis. Developing to this. We are only turning into self into self self.

 pleasure seeking machines which is exactly what the machinery of technol of capitalism wants if we're only self-seeking. If we're only seeking closest pleasure to ourselves. We have no belief in any social fiction beyond our the reality of our ego. Then the technological mechanisms of capitalism can lead us around by that oh. We know what you like. We have the algorithm we know what's pleasure for you. We know what's pain. We can threaten you with one and offer you the other and even though we never have to really give you anything we can keep you moving and so and so instead of us getting any kind of class consciousness or species being awareness. What's coming to self-awareness is the algorithm we are becoming unaware more and more unaware and that's why the only antidote to this the real antithesis that will develop will have to be have to begin with a revolution in belief. A breaking of the solipsistic cycle where our disenchantment with the the horrible brutality and unfairness of the system that we live in leads us only to further reify our own egos and try to protect them a a transcendence of that cycle where we are connecting ourselves. Emotionally. We are believing in as in stuff that we can't know we are believing in a solidarity with other people and finding that our actions in accordance with solidarity feel both selfish. They feel like they're for our own good but not in the destructive selfish way that our individual pursuits are we still do it not because we want to be good not because we have the the puritan american superego slapping us in the ass saying no you have to be a good person which is currently what drives a lot of people to be on the left right. Now it will be a actual felt emotional commonality of interest with somebody else so like I said. I don't know if that's actually like means anything you know.

But I do think that it does if you use think of it. That way it helps you understand. Exactly what the stakes are with a lot of these questions the political questions we we deal with we think we're looking at a political contest but we're really a meaningful political contest but we're really looking at a cultural ritual of self-affirmation. Today. The other the other day there was the cia woke recruitment video and of course. It caused a huge torrent of discussion about what does this say about the left and liberalism and all this stuff and people say this proves that the left is culturally hegemonic and and what does that mean and are they not and I would say and then people argue at the point. Of is it cultural hegemony and I would say that I don't think you can look at the vocabularies used by power. The vocabulary is used in media and say that that in the constant cultural like dialogue between acceptable and unacceptable principles between virtuous and and and villainous ideas that broadly the left is the center of the terms in culture but that doesn't mean what people want it to mean or what they think it means when they talk about power because while this is political it is political in the sense that all culture is political. All politics is culture and neither one of them are connected to power anymore. That is the thing all of this left right conflict is happening detached from power power is being executed by the algorithm behind the scenes.

The constant whirring buzzing crunching machine sound you hear is the conveyor belt moving without anyone holding the gears anyone tending to any of it. What we're all doing instead is arguing about a political space and with political terms around a political spectacle that is at every level detached because while we might argue about this stuff the only real decisions of merit of matter that matter are being made by algorithms within vast lee powerful and intricate institutions of literal economic planning. That's what capitalism is and it does not need us. It needs us to consume right here anyway. In america. It needs us to consume and to create an infrastructure to facilitate consumption and so as part of that we have to walk around thinking that we're participating in a system we have to believe in it and so we are spending our last few wasps of belief participating in this increasingly tribalized politics. Meanwhile the thing happens behind the scenes because people say because people want to say.

Like this means the left is succeeded or it's or one or something. This is what it wanted. The left is not a coherent system a coherence movement with power with an orientation to power. It is individuals with des self definitions as customers now what in that pursuit they might do some left. They might start a union at their workplace. They might join an org that does a campaign they might help elect somebody to office. They might change the tenor of discussion of issues. They might even get. Some things done in terms of laws and and getting union contracts and whatnot. But they're not doing. It as part of a project they're doing it as a bunch of people expressing their preferences in the marketplace and the antithesis that could challenge capitalism will have to be. Something else will have to be lashed together through bonds that transcend self-interest. So I don't know that might have just been like just totally a self-suck. But I do think it's useful because people get stuck. I know I do on questions of basic superstructure and of how how things move like the the machinery doesn't just go on its own. Like we we move it with our actions every day because we choose to participate in it and that participation creates changing and evolving understandings of the world that change our relationship to it and change our actions even though we're within these structures and the way I think of it is you've got this you know this line.

This. This this cable and then you've got the current running through it and that is all of us living within the iron armature of the system and of course. At that point. I once again stall out what do you do with that information. I aha keep your nose to the grindstone once again keep your eyes on the prize which is not online. It's every day. There's a chance that it could be the day that your life changes and that's It's certainly a cop-out. But I think it's less dishonest than than maintaining a k-fade of of consequence I would love to do self to power for china.

It really does look like woke. Cold war is on the offing which is pretty great did you see that a there's a uyghur like wing of al-qaeda that the was involved. That's been involved in afghanistan since the since 9 11 before 9 11 and which the us military waged a offensive specifically against in 2018 in afghanistan has now been taken off of the sp state spot. The terrorist watch list. It's no and it's no longer a terrorist group I mean. I don't really think there's going to be a war but you certainly see how the momentum in both parties.

This is where it's very important. Is towards some sort of confrontation of china and it really is interesting like There was this spurious case. That trump was like an anti-interventionist remember that trump counted as as as the peace candidate and there are a bunch of people who say that's still true because they're convinced that hillary. Clinton would have like gone to war in syria if she'd been in charge and I mean you know who knows but on the big question that's on the horizon of china the one that really matters on that one bush and biden are on the same page and there is a totally coherent broad right-wing q-pilled argument for why we got to go to war with china. Just as there is a a woke pink-washed one and I mean look at the way that that look at ben garrison to understand how if you get another right-wing government in there that it's they're not gonna cool down the the rhetoric about china. It's only gonna continue ratcheting up is that he always has g like as a is a demonic eminence gris behind biden and stuff and and that's it's dumb. But it's coherent.

You know look at this communist country that wants to undermine america. They have all this money and look there our democrats have been selling them our debt and all this and you know you just pull out yellow apparel stuff and then you've got biden talking about how we need to win the competition for the 21st century which is insane and that's why no politics that's fixated on on tracking like momentum and influence within the two-party system is is is worth anyone's time as anything other than a just as a entertainment like like keeping up with the ball scores because at the real points of the the real consequential issues and like the conflict with china that is like at the very tip top because not only is that that's the that's more than anything the framework for the continued continued justification for our military structure It's also a genuine live resource contest like we had during the first cold war and it's ideologically charged too now there's not going to be a war. I don't think but there's going to be a continued ratcheting of of hostility to create like this conditions of a war minus the actual catastrophic conflict and that is that's going to be the interest of both parties.

It's all a minimal to both sides it really is frustrating because like the best the best interest of the world would be some sort of. Just just make a to somebody make an offer just let me buy somebody else out like do a merger and then maybe we can act cooperatively to prevent the absolute worst catastrophic effects of of climate change but that's not going to happen for a bunch of reasons. It is amazing it's. It's very cheap cheesy to think about but in a real sense because we have so many so much so much systemic technological infrastructural capitalist development. There's so much that we could we could reprogram like obviously you need to change a lot of things structurally. But there's a lot of stuff that could be done just like with a software upgrade. But we would need to we would need to want to do that and we don't want to do it because we have given up on the the idea of anything else and that's understandable yeah. We need a socialism damn mother fishing upgrade waiting for a messiah well.

I mean the thing is we will all we're all the messiah as dumb as that sounds like the second coming isn't going to be jesus coming back. It's going to be that moment that feeling of jesus coming back not just obviously jesus you know in in that in the cultural context that feeling what people think they're talking about when they talk about it. But it's not reserved for christians. The real messiah was in fact the friends we made along the way and heaven is a place on earth. I really do believe that like it is it's amazing what are we doing to the earth. We are turning the earth into a place that is incredibly infernally hot right.

That's what our collective sin our failure to recognize each other as humans and cooperate and instead compete against each other and exploit is literally turning the earth into an inferno. A fiery hot place without any of the pleasures of life to be found perhaps a a geographical or geological hell of some kind and what does what would a what would a true. Post-scarcity society look like a world where where we have equitably distributed the alienations of life maximized people's social react maximized saturated people's lives with social meaning and intimacy not at anyone else's expense but for a mutual for fully mutual reinforcing benefit what would that world look like you imagine it. What is it what is what other sort of mythological concept comes to mind being in a place like that with access to all kinds of technologies that can be used at your whim where everyone is your friend. Everyone is your intimate where you never feel disharmony or fear of violence to yourself where death isn't real because you have by by virtue of living in this. In this bosom you have transcended your fiction of ego to the point where you're no longer terrified of losing this life that you understand as ephemeral that you that where death is a lightening up rather than a turning down of light where death is like going through a door a golden door to a a reunion with a cosmic oneness. After living this time. This seemingly endless time of spiritual and intellectual engagement and love with nothing else. What does that sound like so these things heaven and hell we're making them every day on earth. We're making parts of heaven hell and parts have parts of earth hell parts of it heaven. The heavens for some is the hell for others so yeah like the second coming that there's one. These are all essentially secular concepts and that they are happening in the material world and it's a battle that's being fought in the material world. But those ideas have in hell right and wrong love and hate and fear and all that those ideas are how we imagine them as they're happening how we tell a story to ourselves that moves us through the world that we find ourselves in which we have to do you cannot rely on pure sensory perception of the world you have to tell a story to yourself. You have to tell a story that is a fiction by definition to get one foot in front of the other now. Some fictions correspond to other people's fictions enough to create a system that can cooperate between people and the more people have the same understanding and the more pragmatically functional. It is at distributing pleasure and minimizing pain.

The more effective it is at operating there will always be social sociopaths sure of course but do you really think it's a it's a it's a do you think one that sociopaths is a stable number of the population and two that sociopathy can be defined. Can be like corralled into one group of people who like test positive for it. No it's a spectrum of It's a spectrum of behavior based on a spectrum of individual delusion of isolation and it's distributed through the society as the society reinforces it. I mean yes we have a system now where sociopathy is not even encouraged system-wide. It is brought to the top like. I was just talking about even you don't even have you have a smaller and smaller number. At the top of even like well-intentioned monsters. There used to be well-intentioned monsters at the top of our society like I would say lyndon johnson is a good example of a well-intentioned monster.

Those people are gone. There are just pure unalloyed reptilians because no one who could believe in this. Any as has access to power anymore living the life of wealth and elite and elite proximity to power strips you of the experience of humanity and so and and proximity. The power strips you of your illusion of um of your illusion of agency remember because you're up there near power you're up there with money but you can't really choose anything. The choice has been made for you lyndon. Johnson thought that he had the levers of the world at his. The ones who have purely are worshiping at like a demonic temple of the south. I mean the closest thing you have to belief at the top of our social order right now is the elon musk jeff bezos stellar capitalism thing which is literally about detaching from the mass of mud-blooded neurotypical humanity and recreating a a new human order among the meritocrats without any epsilon semi-morons running around to ruin the fun california ideology.

Exactly that's the only remaining belief anything. Bunny can have in the system because there are enough charlatans and frauds around who can sound smart who can trick these guys who are dumber than them but who have more money than them into believing it. When they tell them yeah yeah. We can make you live on forever on mars absolutely 100. None of these people these people all have convinced themselves that they're geniuses and that they see they see as peter. Thiel said that death is an ideology and the reason that they see that is because they've had their get lucky with a payment facilitating software like him and teal did and certainly can outsmart these dumbasses into thinking oh yeah.

I have found a ticket out of the human condition so yeah that's the only thing we've got. That's the only thing that anybody believes in at the top is that and at the bottom everyone just knows that this system cannot. There's no reason to believe that if you put a quarter in the machine you're gonna get your snickers bar. You know like you've gone back by too many times and gotten ripped off and so you're gonna stop putting coins in the coins of like emotional investment. The coins of of self-motivated action that aren't just about what's in it for you in the near in the near term in the in the in the very moment and about like postponing pleasure in the now to build something in the future well. Why would you bother doing that when there's no reason to believe that any of the things you're investing your time and energy into will pay you back or will even exist and of course.

The funny thing is that the real person the real force driving these maniacs the buzz the musks and the bezos is the grimal worm tongue of the algorithm itself. It's the computers it's that it's. It's the logic approximate maximization speaking to them across the barrier of the of the computer screen and so when these guys are floating in space after their algorithm will be the pile of of concentrated capital that will at that point have some rudimentary sort of consciousness very much looking forward to musk on snl by the way that's going to be. Tight do you think that jeff bezos has ever enjoyed himself. I think that musk probably has like the time that he did the egyptian in front of a bunch of people. I think he has moments because he wants to be liked because he has that that kind of dorky kid insecurity and so when he he gets to go on joe rogan. I think he's probably happy and yeah. He's got like a weird zoomer nihilist girlfriend who probably gives him chinese research chemicals but bezos it seems like just he is a machine. He really does seem like just skynet in a human body fake. People say that about zuckerberg but zuckerberg. I think is so blank and inert that it feels sort of. It's its own. Personality like oh he's so weird that that makes him more human whereas bezos is just there's nothing there and he but he went we went through the trouble of having an affair which cost him half this money absolutely baffling what were his He had sex that got leaked because he got catfished by prince salman or something and they were all incredibly. I'm going to see if I could find them the zuckerberg. Oh no not zuckerberg bezos. Bezos texts oh right.

I love you alive girl that's it as opposed to my other girlfriends. Jesus christ what a freak you're alive. You're very alive that that is not a thing that you say to people. If you're normal. You don't comment on the fact that they're not dead you sort of take that for granted unless you are yourself so reptilian that any sort of vivacity reads to you as as oh my god. You're like count dracula walking by planet fitness and seeing everybody getting all red in the face and just starts slathering like a cartoon dog. I want to smell you. I want to breathe you in. I want to hold you tight. I want to kiss your lips. I love you. I am in love with you. Wow you know what I want. I want to get a little drunk with you tonight not falling down just a little drunk. I want to talk to you and plan with you listen and laugh. I want to plan with you oh baby. Can we sit down in front of a couple of date. Books can we get some can we throw together. Some splash boards and a pitch deck good god her energy and ideas and competence and spirit turn me on competence. This is just like a very horny performance review.

This is like getting sexually harassed by your human resources officer. He keeps talking about wanting to smell her and touch her. They're not even together anymore right. I don't think so see tiger woods. Texts are kind of they're human and relatable because he's just such a dork wasn't it. All like him trying to be kind of nasty like. I'm gonna bite you or something like girl. I'm gonna slap your ass and make you do what I want or something just like oh you're adorable little tiger woods. Guy who spent his entire childhood practicing chip shots doesn't really know how to talk to girls army.

Hammer said he wanted to eat somebody but that's different is charlie did harmy. Hammer actually eat somebody because the thing about him is he's not just an actor. He is the actual scion of the armenhammer. I think petroleum fortune so if anybody on earth has the ability to eat somebody if they really wanted to. It's him because you've got to figure that there's some adventurous eaters club for rich people where they eat human flesh right just because we know the stuff that they do do why wouldn't they do that would. I eat a person in an ethical situation which is a huge huge a hugely unlikely. Occurrence I would probably chew on a person. A little bit just curiosity but it would have to be. It would have to be humanely procured and not just like If somebody asked me to eat them maybe and I and I thought they were very earnest about it. No no. No there's no way. I can imagine that human flesh could be procured maybe. I'd be a lab-grown human. We do eat raw hamburger wisconsin cannibal sandwiches baby. I would. I would consider being eaten upon my death. Maybe here's an ethical situation what if I put in my will that I would be turned into like a hawaiian luau and be the centerpiece of my own funeral like I get tested make sure. I don't have any prions. We don't want to spread kreutzville's jakub but you know put me put me in a under hot coals in the beach for like six hours with a apple in my mouth and then just get some of that crackling no. I would absolutely not eat chip meat. No no no not human apes at all. I think I'd taste okay.

Americans probably don't taste great because of all the chemicals because that really does contribute to the flavor. I mean that's the difference really down to that's the real difference between like kobe beef and like america downer cows. They make mcdoubles out of it's yeah sure there's lineages but the real thing is diet and we eat a bunch of garbage. It probably tastes like yeah. We place like plastic and and corn syrup.
