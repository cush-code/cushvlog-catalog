I can take this chance because I'm gonna be putting this on youtube tomorrow to say hey if you're watching this subscribe to the youtube. We're like three point. Five subscribers on the youtube come on. We're like 3.5 thousand uh subscribers away from a hundred thousand. We can definitely hit it by the end of the year uh so how to do it.

So you can uh so everybody can see it excellent um all right.

We're waiting for everybody to get into the chat room um. We'll give it another few minutes um. What's up with you matt how are you doing. I'm good. I'm uh chilling. I'm chilling yeah. Uh. I know that yeah you've been off the kush vlogs for a little bit. I just want to reassure everybody that they will come back. We're just working off some new technical difficulties as matt has gotten a new computer. Uh you know we want to um. Get everything set up. It's been uh a bit of a struggle. I'm not technically adept so that makes it sort of difficult and now that we are on other sides of the coast. I can't just pop over to his house and uh set everything up yeah um so uh. Let's let's start off with something that you know let's kick this off right. Now that people are starting to come in uh.

I'm just gonna play out our theme song uh to get everybody in the emotion for this. So uh here is nick diamond's excellent. Uh hell of president's theme thank you to nick diamonds for that uh. I told him. I wanted some fire. I had that had something like um. You know a drum and fife feel with a spaghetti western element to it and uh I think he totally yeah. I think he did completely nailed that so thank us all thank you as always to nick diamonds for the theme. All right here we are the hell of presidents wrap up stream. Uh. I had a few questions prepared some kind of general chat topics to begin with and then uh you know in maybe 20 30 minutes. We'll take some questions and do some overall thoughts on the show. So matt you ready for my first question hit me all right so behind us. We have the new fire from john mcdotten his magnificent seven of us presidents uh I guess my main question. About this is at what point we're going to washington dc to take back the white house uh.

I gotta turn off the uh the sound um why what point did john f kennedy get completely engulfed into conservative presidential canon. Uh it's been a bit now uh and I think you saw people calling themselves like kennedy republicans. So I think probably like during the bush years and I think it it really does and it really accelerated. I think after uh. 2008 because as  started to go downhill dramatically people started looking back and saying where was the real. Uh breach and a lot of republicans came to the same conclusion that like oliver stone and a lot of the liberal boomers had come to a while ago which is the kennedy assassination and the fact that kennedy was a cold warrior who cut taxes uh and who obviously because you know this is the he was the president right before the culture wars exploded. He didn't really have any record on culture war stuff so you were able to sort of uh imagine him as the as uh like the just the way that stone saw him as like our our last legitimate sovereign uh and now with the q anon. He's literally become a magical figure and his son is basically. I mean. They have they have recreated sunni islam or shia islam now and uh and jfk.


Junior is their uh included mahdi. Yes. It's pretty amazing are those guys still hanging out in dallas. They were last time. I checked uh. It's a pretty amazing dedication to it. You don't see that much uh true believer. Uh in u.s politics and for that alone you have to hand it to those guys well. You gotta hand it to them. They've forged a a real like a theological conception of politics that uh has transcended uh sort of the powerlessness of of being like the rest of us just hostage to the spectacle because you know they're participating in magical rights and  to to bring back. Jfk's uh kid who's gonna lead us to the promised land all right so my real question on this is if you were assembling your team of presidential operators to do some kind of mission who would be your magnificent. Seven let me just say by the way uh that this one the one that uh the one that mcnaughton has put together. I would not uh have these guys. I would not give them the green light to do a  raid on a puppy mill. This is a terrible collection of operators. I wouldn't give any of these guys guns thomas. Jefferson weedy nerd never picked up a gun and anger in his life. Ronald.

Reagan literally senile his entire presidency uh okay washington. I'll give you obviously yes uh but like trump has not driven a car look gone in his entire life. Absolutely uh abe lincoln okay. Another one. I'll give you a rangy former wrestler uh and backwards. Tr was like a chad when he was uh you know in the rough riders. But by the time he was president he was basically shaped like a barrel uh and then jfk famously racked with illnesses and diseases needing doctor feel good injections every day to stay alive. Addison's disease bad back all kinds of. So this is a this is a trash group if I'm do if. I'm getting my operator presence together uh. I'm fixing the base and one thing that he forgets here uh. Naughton does not know his us military combat doctrine because with any group of uh soldiers this big uh or or uh like a squad sized group like he's got here where the  is the heavy gunner. A heavy gunner is is a required uh somebody with like a squad automatic weapon or something something to lay down suppressive fire with something belt.

Fed and fdr is basically a technical so just strap a  gatling gun to him and you you have a perfect firebase that you can then move around so start with fdr as technical. I would keep. I would keep nick. I would keep lincoln because lincoln was relatively young for a president. Uh relatively fit uh then. I gotta go grant uh who was a skilled horseman. Uh an athlete his entire life uh and who uh famously was ticketed for speeding in a carriage in dc when he was president uh uh gerald ford. The jock yes he's on my list as well. He's he's your big dumb guy yeah. You just give him like a shotgun set him out there. Uh. I'll. I'll I'll keep washington. In there he he's he is. He was another absolute jock. Uh no andrew jackson because once again. By the time he was president he was being hollowed out by dropsy. See jackson is on my list for his wild card status. You gotta have a guest room.

You gotta have a uh an absolute wild man on the team you know that is true and uh you also need uh somebody who might uh go crazy and kill your guys too telly savalas in uh dirty dirty dance like dirty dozen style and that's where nixon comes in for me oh yeah. I was thinking about that all right. I've got washington the leader uh teddy special ops uh fdr heavy gunner. I think that works uh. But you know also get a little bit of uh brains and you can even slot them in in a kind of gentleman spy role if you need that uh lincoln the heart the conscience. He's your your brooklyn. On the on the team you know the the kid uh lbj interrogations. Uh you get you get him alone in a room and he's gonna. He's gonna get inside your head. He's gonna make you uh you know give give up your own mother within 20 minutes uh jackson. As I said the wild card and of course uh fred ford president football dumb muscle. Uh front lines. That's my that's my uh magnificent seven. That's that's all solid just don't put two senile boxes of suit on your teeth. That's all I can say um all right so that's that's a mcnaughton. Uh photo that if that's the uh presidential magnificent seven um polk. I see somebody saying in the chat as I said in our final episode someone. I'm. I'm also fascinated with their chat status.

He might be the jackson that can do it. You know the jackson who's still uh who's still hickory yeah yeah. Although once again his last he died almost immediately after he left office from the poop water yeah well. I mean you g give them water filtration system. You know and then you've cured his still suit yeah. Exactly. You've give polk a still suit and you've cured his major weakness yeah all right moving on to my next uh topic of discussion. This is something I pulled from the uh the acid marxism subreddit uh shout out to those guys. Uh the the simple plaintiff question is the candidate who appears like they could lay the best pipe destined to win every election and I think there are many ways you can uh phrase this question the way I always uh thought of it. In my mind is the um the president who looks most who looks like they would be most comfortable eating a mcdonald's cheeseburger yeah. I mean it's all part of the same general nexus which is the coolest yes exactly the coolest candidate wins and and I think that's generally true. I think the there are certain the ways the times that it's not true.

It is more that it's just been a race to the bottom of nerdery like the time where you're gonna have a tough time uh calling it is like hw versus dukakis right well. See there you give it to hw just on height. Dukakis was like five five or five six something and and uh george hw but he was six two one of her college president so yeah that's not a cut like height is 90 of coolness. Anyway. I mean sorry short kings. I'm sorry you guys are you guys are trying to push a boulder up a hill socially we all know this so that one yes uh hw for the height and also. I don't know if he was any good at. But he certainly did it a lot. Uh when he was at skull and bones he was nicknamed. Mammon and mammon was the nickname reserved for the horniest member of that uh that uh crew season whatever the  you call them of a bonesman um.


How about then how would you resolve like ford versus carter. Another another two uh a relatively swagless election that's very swagless and you could say boy. Ford's got uh you know ford's got the football thing what carter had that made him a little more swaggy. Uh one. He told playboy that he had lust in his heart which which I mean if he's horny presumably that's more than you can say for ford that is about the lamest way that you could say that you're horny especially in. Like the mid 70s you know it's true uh but I would say that what carter gets carter over the line there is that he had all the cool young hollywood people on his side hmm. He had like uh you know your warren beatties and your and uh also like willie. Nelson's you had like uh the post watergate like the that is really when like the first time you have like a counter cultural mainstream yeah right uh yeah and and they were behind carter so he got that he got the win there. But yeah personally a total  dork uh they were and they were both you know of similar generations and you know both world war ii guys but you know while even in in their expression of their generation. I mean like ford ford's world war. Ii experience was like teaching marines football and carter was like learning how to operate nuclear submarines you know no. It was all. It was a whole classroom. He was like a little futurist though you know no. They were both nerdlingers um. It's actually interesting we have no world war ii combat veterans. There are no world war two combat veterans uh who became president because uh kennedy was a boat guy who got his boat cut in half uh nixon. Uh hung around in a rear echelon base playing cards. At a little hamburger stand. He built called knicks where he won the poker money to buy his first suit to run for congress with uh. I mean the level of strive for nixon is just off the charts you have to. It's amazing and of course lbj. Hilariously. Uh just went on a recon mission as a sitting congressman and then strong-armed the army into giving him a  did. Uh uh he made uh movies for the army yeah. He was like it was a captain in a military unit that was based in hollywood uh and then of course yeah ford and carter a couple of  poindexters and then george.

Hw fighter a bomber pilot. Uh who almost got eaten you know which is pretty intense. But but the only uh world war ii. Uh combat veteran who I believe is he even ran was bob dole who got his arms shot to. At monte casino. There's actually a pretty hilarious in retrospect story that kind of helps explain why he became such a bitter freak of him taking a train home to kansas. Uh after the war in a full cast with like his arm out you know like a looney tunes. Cast yes exactly like a cartoon and he's in the he's like they can't there's no seat for him. So he's like in the in the uh lounge and people would be put. They put his their cigarettes out on his cast. They put it out in the in the in the in his uh the corner of his of his arm and he is still alive amazing yeah outlived uh norm hilariously uh all right. I'm trying to remember the last combat veteran president at all um. Somebody puts out eisenhower in the chat. Uh truman was an artilleryman during world war one so that's probably it uh yes yeah and I mean. I don't think eisenhower was. I don't think eisenhower ever fought. He was always in yeah. He was the perfect age to ever have avoided an actual uh military conflict. So I think it was yeah. I think it's truman being an artilleryman in the in the western front um well that so okay so those are my two uh fun dumb stuff uh I would say to just finish answering that question uh whoever you could say objectively has the most swag or is the coolest.

I think that that's gonna be get you like 80 percent there. I think you can bet like like it's so much for the world four out of five on um on on who's the coolest even the the the trump biden. The thing is that think that trump is way cooler than he is and he's an off-putting weirdo to everybody else exactly and the thing is when you're running against hillary clinton. It doesn't matter because she's even more off-putting yeah but the thing about biden is is that he might be. I mean he's obviously an avatar of everything wrong with politics. In the last 40 years uh he is genuinely senile and unfit for the office. But he's also he's got a minimal swag. That trump could never approximate like the other day when he was uh at the uh the ford factory yeah and he  floored that ev that that like electric hummer they never let trump actually drive any of the trucks they put in the front yard of the white house. Yes yeah he's got uh. Biden has yeah bare minimum normie swag. He wears the aviators he can still look decent in like a short sleeve polo shirt at age 79 or whatever he is. And when you got uh going just mile a minute like whining like a uh like a like norma desmond at a debate and then you have biden going you shut up man that's cooler yeah. He has the even just like the certain steadied calmness has that that minimum coolness that gets you there so but we'll we'll see. But then it comes and goes because if trump comes back he's gonna be coming back as like the sea. I told you so guy. He's gonna have four years old and presumably trump. I mean and physically at that point biden will be like uh commander pike on star trek and communicating with like a beeping box or I'll be facing harris in which case the swag the swag gap is catastrophic yes the thing. I'm imagining though is like say trump doesn't get the nomination. For some reason. His head explodes whatever and like it ends up being somebody like josh josh hallway or uh or tom cotton versus. Harris you might see the first zero swag election yes as as felix has been saying in his uh 30 000 uh vote election uh prediction uh somebody who says uh love love that biden loser hero the love the biden loser energy yes every time. I think about biden now.

I think about the song deacon blues by steely dan. Uh he the the perfect anthem for the loser hero amazing how he's absorbed. He's just. He's. He's there now with like what well in the 30s uh uh approval and is he whining about. It is he doing the trump thing he's just absorbing it. It's like this is what I was born to do yes all right well. This is actually a good segue now into the uh first serious uh more serious question that I had for this stream which is uh we kind of purposely cut off the uh narrative part of our series. At biden's inauguration um we felt we were a little too early in it to give it the kind of historical consideration that we were trying to do with the rest of the series uh but you know now. We're you know one year out from the election um we have at least a few events and a few indications of um. You know uh the leadership style or even what is possible from a president in the biden administration. So I know this is pretty broad but uh matt do you have any uh thoughts on the first you know year or so of the biden administration and how he is uh fitting into the presidential narrative first off. I just want to say someone asked in the chat is biden yacht rock absolutely yes. He is yeah just you can imagine him on a boat plane of saxophone in the background. He's back in the high life again folks yes after 30 years of crawling for the white house. He's there even though he doesn't know it which is of course part of the just amazing tragedy of his life. I think that his his presidency so far and largely uh along the lines that I imagined it going which is he is here as our uh sin eater and as our psychopomp leading us to the underworld. Uh he is the president of he's the end of the line. He is the guy who. Is putting a cap on an experience who's who is narrating uh our our drive towards extinguishment uh in an attempt to uh get us to terms with it as opposed to trump who tried to rage against it. Uh and that's why it's very likely that trump will become president again because nobody wants to hear uh that they're that they're being put to sleep uh and like the even the afghanistan uh drawdown which is such a relative. I think a shock to a lot of people and which clearly went against the uh the five mind preference and the you know material interests of the military-industrial political media pharmaceutical entertainment complex uh even that's in the same genre because out of afghanistan.

Eventually uh it was at that point merely a a money pump. It's just a way to transfer money from one ziploc code in northern virginia to another uh. But its strategic purpose had been exhausted and with the need to redirect towards china more. Uh important than ever uh someone was gonna have to cut bait there and it really was biden because he could do it. He could take it as they said about the dark knight he could deal with everyone calling him a coward and a loser and a fuck-up and a betrayer of america for three weeks for three weeks. No other president could have handled that obama literally was given the option and blinked at the prospect so did trump that he wanted to pull out uh in. I believe march of 2000 or february march 2020. They told him this is going to happen and he was too afraid of looking like a loser brian doesn't care and he doesn't care about shepherding through you know dog. Bare minimum keep the lights on infrastructure spending through a broken system. Uh doesn't care about the fact that his party is basically going to be legislated out of uh the ability to form a majority in the near future uh because he's he's the caretaker. He's here to to put it all uh to keep it on the rails. Uh until just the viability of the entire center is exhausted and that's going to be the the that's all that he can be which is why the republic democrats are so. Because that's that only works if you are the last president you know that only looks it works if you are actually like transitioning over to a new political reality of course. We can't do that when you look at long-running horror movie series and like it's like episode or uh blank six the final chapter and then they're like four more movies. After that right. It's like this narrative ends with him but it can't because we're stuck because we're paralyzed because we have been de-politicized to the degree that we can't respond to changing conditions with anything other than performance spectacle and uh sort of almost erotic paralysis. So that means we're going to keep electing presidents. Even though we have the guy now who should be like honestly. He should be uh negotiating a leveraged buyout by the chinese that that's what reasonably logically should be happening right. Now the america is extinguished as a project. There's still some vitality and energy and most importantly political subjectivity in china. I know that's funny to say like lol oh. They're you know one party dictatorship but the chinese communist party is able to intervene in its uh economy. It is able to as a group of people outside of capitalism impose their will on like the engines of uh the economy in a way that nobody in the american was capable of doing and so that means that there's actually some uh viability and legitimacy in that uh regime that we don't have so he should be. He should be signing the papers on our surrender. Uh we should get to go on to missouri again just for just for a nice tiny historical wrap-up. But we can't do that so that means we're going to keep electing presidents and the democrats have nothing after closing time other than an attempt to bring back. The obama. Politics which was predicated on hope is predicated on a a a vision of progress that can no longer be sustained like we're in terminal crisis conditions everyone's aware of it. Every like democrats are terrified of republicans and all the democrats are going to have in the form of kamala harris or in the form of mayor. Pete is a identity-based validation argument that right this system with new leadership that is more diverse and reflective of our demographics will govern more uh effectively more justly uh.

But the legitimacy of the machine is so undermined that uh. I don't think even a lot of loyal democrats believe that uh it can be redeemed with anything other than confrontation that the democratic party is incapable of so they really are uh absolutely  that really seems to be the case doesn't it. Uh the uh just point after point being like what is it. What even is the project here as far as the uh democrats are concerned and even you know throughout the entire. The entirety of the 2020 election. At least you had trump to organize the things in opposition to uh but immediately upon getting in power.


You're like uh okay. So now. Where is the road map here and there isn't one uh so uh. I mean you know in light of our conversations talking about how the breakdown of party systems is. It tends to be the moment that these new formations occur that give moments of opportunity. Uh you know the breakdown of our current party system. You know seems like it might be a moment of opportunity but the way things are shaking out it. Uh it's certainly hard to get the hopes up for that but you know who knows well. We are at this terminal crisis for both parties like they're in trump's election was the result of the republican party essentially breaking down as a political machine which is also happening to the democratic party uh and really in both cases. The crisis in the one party is masked by the crisis in the other right. Like you don't have this a full asymmetry where both are breaking apart simultaneously and everyone recognizes that instead the failures of the one party the crisis within the one party. Uh allows the other party. Some uh vision of how they can win like so. Republicans have their idea of uh of you know gerrymandering and culture war canceling elections yeah. The democrats have their idea of uh intersectional representation as their uh raise on debt like abandoning everything other than the idea that they will prevent white men from being in charge. Uh that's um and both of those are uh in a context where the parties are at the whim of whoever's funding. Uh the candidates and whoever's the media decides to pay attention to uh and so they can't impose any centralized will. All they can do is play the game of uh of shaping the media narrative and the republicans though have a more uh effective political project because everything is aligned in the same direction. Broadly. The grassroots is aligned with their voting base which is aligned with their funder base right and the democrats you have a fundamental conflict between the the voters and would-be voters for the democrats and then their core electorate and then even between that the core electorate and the uh funding base. There's uh discontinuity. So they they cannot function with the same efficiency that the dem republicans can add to that their built-in advantage uh created by the constitutional system uh and the sorting mechanism of democrats moving to blue enclaves and therefore diluting their electoral power so they have that built-in advantage uh and so they're going to be in a position where they might just be able to hold on to national power. But the thing is all. They can do is stoke culture war. All they can do is stoke resentment. They cannot address any of the material causes of all this anxiety and anger uh and uh and destabilizing social dysfunction. They can't address it so it's only going to get worse right uh and that is going to create a political. Uh resistance a political uh uh face to opposition to this republican party and I don't think at this point it can be the democrats but that doesn't mean that it can't persist you know yeah so the hope is the hope is that this crisis has to resolve in some new formation emerging because of the insufficiency of the democrats to address the moment but you know the cost of that is going to be some horrifying.

And uh but and people say that's accelerationism. But it's really just a recognition of the reality that the democrats have ceased to be anything but a roadblock towards uh uncontested republican control of the federal government in most states yeah. I don't know it uh. I guess it kind of like reminds me of uh. You know the period in the 1920s uh where you had to have. I mean basically like a total collapse of a party for it to be reborn and you there needs to be like an elite. The total control eventually leads to delegitimization I'm talking about the republicans here if we're just imagining this. Uh the continuation of this two-party system one could imagine that even with all of these uh institutional uh measures that they were putting in places the gerrymanders um you know the the voting blocks uh or you know the blocks to voter registration and the box of voting rights and stuff like that uh that it could lead to a near-term like total domination for a period of I don't know decade a decade more than a decade. Uh you know during which the current formulation of democrats will you know scream. It will yell about authoritarianism and fascism which you know may or may not be true to certain degrees but at a certain point. Things then you might rig in total control of the country at such a level that at a certain point there is no one left to blame but you you and then there might be another vessel. Another formulation of the democratic party that operates unde under different principles say like say fdr taking control of the party in 1932 that allows a different kind. A different form of the democrats to ascend after the republican domination and all this is like based on a million contingencies and a totally you know fantasized reading of the future but you know it happened a hundred years ago um yeah and so why not I agree completely. I think though that the conditions have changed in key respects that when that formulation emerges which it will it is not going to be a national political party democrat or otherwise.

I feel like we will by that point have reached uh a a critical uh crisis in the system of federalism and that if there is a resurgent anti-republican uh effective anti-political republican political movement that is able to take power through elections because we're assuming the continuation of this system uh. It's going to be at the state level because we're seeing every when every president gets in. We're seeing conflict between federal and state authority. Uh where the other party is in power get worse and worse and if you see republican domination of the federal government. I don't think states like california and new york are just going to go along with it because they won't have to because they will be able to assert a lot of authority as states and yes like lead towards brinksmanship with the federal government. I think that's on the table no matter what the continued slide of uh background economic conditions and accelerated social atomization caused by the terminal crisis of capitalism right which I is my underlying assumption that that goes along with that is the framework for all of my analysis of uh. America's history is that what's driving these conflicts is the the condition of the uh economic momentum where on the chart. Basically the economy isn't we're at a point now after this the 70s and then specifically after 2008 when the uh the material basis for the american economy has become fully unmoored uh from the actual. Uh like finance economy that we all live in like we are 2008 was was uh the end finally of the last bubble based on uh you know real uh uh material. The real estate like it is now fully financialized right uh and it's been kept alive purely by massive liquidity pumped in at the top of the economy by the fed outside of government. Uh any kind of democrat real democratic uh oversight uh and that means things can only really get worse like we can have upswings in the economy uh but in terms of people's not more than even their conditions their sense of their condition right. Their sense of uh procurement can only get worse uh and if that's the case the pressure on this federal system which is already uh. Loosening is only going to get more intense uh well with that grim reading of the future you know. I saw somebody in the chat saying like this all sounds like hope. I think when we were talking about you know a reformation of the party system.

We're. Uh yeah we would the I think the operative word in that is we who are we because the idea is that a future a future collection of powers will be a different group of we you know so precisely yeah so we might be  in the long run. But in the future we will be part of a different. We is the idea. That's that is the thing that people forget. Most is that people in the past are in a fundamental way. Different than we were than we are and people in the future will be fundamentally different. The things that go into their life experience are going to be different the way that they define words yes is going to be different. The way that they act from symbols is going to be different so their their value system is going to be different uh and that means that we can predict what the what the contours generally of our you know what what declining conditions and accelerating ecological catastrophe mean for our social institutions as we understand them. Now right. We can't know how people are going to respond to them in the future well. Most of all I hope that the people of the future bring uh perfidy back all right. Let's uh let's uh go to the chat uh if anybody has any questions uh about the series about how we put it together about uh presidents in general uh about the future about the past um anything relating to the series um. We would be happy to answer um and I'll keep my eyes on the chat um. Let's see let's see okay. Yes uh just somebody says why skip chester arthur. We spent a total of about uh 30 seconds less than a minute on chester arthur. Uh do you have any other chester arthur facts you would like to do just to give him his uh his time uh chester arthur. Uh although I feel like we covered him more in the in the final yeah we talked about him a little bit in the last episode because we had missed him yeah so we kind of he is actually uh he oh. I'm too short of  uh in addition to be facial hair god.

He was the uh first president to have a uh a birth certificate scandal because he was born in vermont and he was accused for most of his life of having actually been born in canada um and he's a collector of customs yeah. No not. He's just anybody who got in there uh in the 19th century because somebody died just not much going on uh hopefully a matt's uh system result. Uh resolves itself for a second. We were having a little connection problems earlier. If uh the worse that will happen he'll have to log back on uh or log off and log back on matt. If you can hear me. Maybe you want to do that uh. I will answer one real quick why why the name hell of presidents uh that name was actually uh suggested uh oh matt's back. Uh. I was just moving on to why name it held presence. I just did want to talk about this that name was actually suggested by branson reese when I uh asked him to do a drawing for the series of like a hall of presidents type thing and he was like well. You could just put hell in there and I was like you know what that's good enough because uh matt and I tried to  stuck yeah. It was brutal. What were some of the ones we had uh failed or the chief yes um god. I can't even remember it was so sorry if anybody has a better name for what the series should have been please please. Let me know. I like telepresence when I heard it. I was like thank god. We don't have to think of one now anymore um yeah. Oh god there was one that I was really set on and then somebody had uh. Somebody had already named it um uh matt christman's dead presidents. I think there already is oh yeah we called to that for a while uh. I think there already is a uh dead president's podcast hosted by like some school teacher. I didn't want to like steal their um steal their their steal. Their valor.

Now uh. I it ended up working out. I mean my god. Our other show is called chapeau trap house. We're lucky. We're not we're not hitting hitting yeah um let's see where else have all u.s.


Elections been corrupt. We kind of we were going to go into this more in the elections episode but you kind of had to do your entire history of the us. In one go uh yeah do you want to talk more about how corrupt u.s elections have been over time. I mean it raises it makes you wonder how what do you mean by corrupt because like if you're talking about non-democratic. They all have been you know like they've all failed crucial tests of access that would allow you to call them fair elections uh. But if you want to talk about like intervening in the uh races like against the rules uh pretty much always yeah as soon as people started. Regular people started voting uh in u.s presidential elections uh there were plenty of ways uh to ensure some sort of influence over the results uh so for most of uh the 19th century uh elections were not secret. There was no secret ballot. You did not drop your uh card into a uh a box the way that you imagined it in an old cartoon. They were often public assemblies where you had to give your uh verbally give your vote uh and of course you know local political machines could game that system and influence people. That way it was a way to guarantee that if you bribed somebody that they voted for you uh and it was a way to intimidate people who might vote for somebody else so that that persisted for most of the 19th century. In addition to you know all the jugging and and vote vote buying that happened in the cities uh and then of course. You have the mass disenfranchisement of black voters in the south beginning in the uh reconstruction era that basically invalidates every election until 1968 or 72 from even consideration of not being corrupt because you know that is that was done extra legally well before it was codified in law. It was done through like violent suppression all through that era because as we said these were legal voters according to the constitution who were prevented by local statute and local power from uh carrying out their election and then you had things like the rotten burrows in uh the rio grande valley that uh lyndon johnson used to assure his uh president his uh senatorial election in uh. 1948 so in texas uh it was understood that there were certain counties that were completely up for sale in any election. Local uh judges uh were essentially able to uh if. You paid them enough collect a guaranteed number of votes because the people who lived there in these counties were mostly uh uh very poor mex working class uh mexicans with very little political representation and they were bribed and corralled into voting on mass and the key to winning an election wasn't even buying uh the votes.

It was making sure that uh you announced them at the right moment. So in 1944 linda johnson runs for president for this for the senate in texas for the first time challenging uh pappy o'daniel who was a real guy uh and a real governor and senator from texas. Uh passed the biscuits papio daniel uh and both had bought votes in rural counties and towards the end of the primary night. Lbj has a relatively comfortable lead and he tells his operatives to release their counts and so that gave o'daniel time to have his counties announce the number of votes they needed. So every election is basically a game of chicken to see who would announce their results first uh and in 48 when he defeated coke stevenson uh he did it by wholesale vote buying in the rio grande valley uh and just vote fabrication. They were just putting numbers in randomly. They were picking up rolls of registered voters and just putting their names and mass uh uh fraud like they were just all uh counterfeiting signatures in mass and then they announced just enough it was under 50 votes that's why they called them landslide lin uh but of course. The funny thing is though is that in that election which was decided basically because the state texas democratic party chose to acknowledge johnson's victory. The the right thing was done because this was 1948. This is right after uh world war ii. This is the beginning of the post-war fight that had been put on uh sort of hiatus during the course of the war between democrats and republicans for power and coke stevenson. Johnson's opponent was a old-line southern small government reactionary and of course. He was also a democrat because texas was a one-party state at that point and johnson had been a good new dealer and the new deal uh veterans in the democratic party of texas were like. We want the new dealer in washington not this. Uh so the these practices were common well into the middle of the 20th century. Right famously. Jfk won with the aid of illegal ballots in chicago. Although one thing people forget to point out is that you could wonder well. If there were all this vote buying and vote rigging in chicago. They're getting all the dead people in in uh clark county to vote for democrats. Why didn't the republicans challenge that in the court it's because in southern illinois which was republican held. They were also stealing votes and rigging ballots and they didn't want that to be revealed by a challenge.

So everybody at that point is still able to significantly uh influence elections illegally. I would say and then you know post 72. The elections. I think do get more transparent and I think the elections do get less uh crooked in its classic sense because you have the advent of modern campaign financing which means what's you don't need to rig anything. You don't need to get into the machines. You don't need to uh to get a butt to get the uh phone book and just start writing votes down you're in charge of the process yes throughout the whole thing you've bought it fully and certainly so why the hell do you need to rig anything yeah. It certainly gets more like standardized. Uh you know as the um primary and caucus system gets into place but you know even then you know as we saw in iowa. Last year there's lots of room for a party chicanery uh around you know actually the functioning of these because it's again you're you are the party running an election to select your own leader. So you know it's since it's all within one structure. You know there's always uh places for for manipulation. What's amazing though is that I would say that right now uh in in relative terms. We have the cleanest elections we've ever had right like. I said that's because they're all bought and paid for up front legally so they don't need to do criminal  for the most part. But I'd say we have the most transparent election system we've ever had and it is the least legitimate. It has ever been in the public mind like nobody really thinks that elections are fair anymore at all. Everybody assumes the other side is cheating now republicans.

It is now a a fundamental uh article of faith that defines being a republican and that is very worrying. It is going to give these guys in their own mind permission to do anything right because they think they've already live in a lawless world where elections don't aren't real so it doesn't matter. Uh they will be getting the right results which is the correct political position because the republican party is still a political project which the democratic party isn't so. The republican party can actually seek power in individually like people will be motivated to seek. Power. Democrats largely are not motivated to seek power because they're really there to just show up and to provide the system with legitimacy as part of a ritualized politics. So that is why that is the party that has decided that these elections are rigged even though democrats can only ever get their  together to keep the left out of primaries and is essentially incapable otherwise of doing anything that requires that level of sophistication and coordination because they're going to act so they they need to give themselves a narrative justification for it but even liberals. I think like broadly don't think the elections are uh fair. They really do think that russia made trump win and of course the russians have fully delegitimized the electoral system even if they participate in it. So you have complete uh disbelief in the like basic legitimacy of the electoral system at a time when it's as transparent as it ever has been which is what's worrying about it because that means there can be no uh remedy for it. It's like when people were pissed off about graft.

In the late 1800s there were things that could be done that would actually change the amount of graft. There was you know like like getting rid of the uh bounty system and then the the uh fee system for civil servants and instituting uh uh a meritocratic uh testing system for appointment that's actual stuff that actually moves the needle. This is a fantasy concern which means it can never be remedy other than by the destroying of the system well. I think then to actually remedy it or address. Uh address it that uh the democrats need to go um. You know think two steps ahead and actually pass laws to make uh the elections less transparent uh go back to ward. Healers go back to uh. You know the rough coopings and stuff like that uh to so that the elections then conform to the level of suspiciousness. That everybody has in their heads that they actually are and then you can just start buying the votes again or stuffing ballots or whatever uh let's move on from this question uh taiwan just about uh making the series a little bit. Uh.

I saw a few of uh questions a while ago. Uh do you have a favorite episode matt or what was your favorite one to work on uh. I I specifically have an answer for this uh but you know. I think it's. I think it's for me. It's the uh. I think it's the. I can't remember the name of it. But it's the one about uh the the 60s to the 80s. The invisible bridge invisible bridge yeah. I think that's my favorite one um there.


I will say as we recorded this. We recorded them mostly. In order we recorded the first version of the first episode on biden's elec inauguration day. Uh last january. We weren't quite satisfied with it. So we went back in and did a second recording of that episode um and so we recorded them as I like finished writing the outlines and then brought the mat. We got one basically every three or four weeks uh up through the entire process uh but my favorite ones to record and put together uh and do um where I went out to la in the middle of the summer and I saved up the progressives epi episode the 20's episode. The the roaring 20's episode and the um fdr episode and we recorded them all in one day live together in person in matt's house and I think that those are a lot of fun. I think the 20s one is one that that I really enjoy just because. I think that that time is very you know uh. It's lighter than the times that go around it uh and so it can be like it's a little uh. It's it's this little fun bubble where everybody is by charging things on credit and doing the charleston yeah uh and I find those those presidents uh goofy so um we that was like one nine hour recording session and I uh uh thought that that was a fun day. I also like the invisible bridge episode generally towards the end. I was getting a little worried that the whole thing was gonna come off the rails as we got towards uh more towards modern time. But I actually think that um you know not to pat themselves on the back that I i was I was kind of surprised by how well the last three or so episodes of the series um came off because there just becomes gets to be so much stuff there uh that you can go into that you know. Obviously the episode lengths got longer but um i. I I ended up coming out of those feeling more confident than I thought I was going to be uh going in yes well also of course like the little magician oh yes because I do feel like uh that one has a really good uh kind of a unique structure where we're going back and forth on the uh the bios yeah uh dueling banjos on on jackson versus van buren yes you have the uh the face and the brain yeah um but they were all good. It was an interesting project because basically every episode we were we had an outline going in where we had basically broken them up by chunks. We had a lot of ways that we were going to do it at first. Uh one of our first ideas was it was going to be just like 10 or so highlight presidents and we were going to pick all the uh loser weird ones to be the names of the episode you know.

The idea is like instead of lincoln. You do johnson that's the episode yeah jackson you do van buren instead of you know um whatever instead of teddy roosevelt you do uh taft and the idea is that we were trying to think of it as a um you know they're they're. The the presidents are usually the highlights the great the great men or whatever but you gotta look at how their terms and actions resolve to really see where the history goes and that's usually the uh the lesser men after or before them. Uh but you know we've eventually figured out our format to this um yeah. We I just couldn't figure out a way to uh contextualize things because if you just talk about like the one guy you got to talk about what happened before that them and and how do you do that without like talking about that specific president. So we ended up just saying  it doing all of them. But I think that considering it in that first way really helped us format it because when we were dividing them into chunks and obviously there are like different eras to this. I did think that it helped kind of thinking about like you're building to something each episode. It's like a string of guys who build to a climax and then a resolution in in their specific era so that helps me um kind and that way you're not just doing them. Chronologically. It's like these three guys. Then these three guys and that's why you know the first episode is just washington and then we run through like the first 30 years or so of the president's um during the second one because what you really want to get to is the breakdown of that first party system in john quincy adams and then you just do two guys at once because you want to see the rise of the democracy and then its first falter with van buren so stuff like that um all right.

Uh. Let's let's see here's an interesting one matt a kind of counterfactual if you could make the other guy win in any election which one would it be. That's a good one that's good and I actually haven't thought of this. All right let me think so yeah like flip okay all right because we've done a lot. I mean okay go. I honestly just is like a way to test things because there seems to be such a wide variety of counter factuals and because that presidency ended up being like the fulcrum of our entire lives as adults got to be bush gore right oh yeah. I mean yeah that's like that's because you know does 911 happen uh. If it does is the result the same I mean there's a lot of questions getting to just if getting to teleport into the universe uh where bush gore was resolved the other way for like 30 seconds and just doing the quick google for 9 11. Yeah just something let me see what happened man yeah yeah um and also though there's other ones uh because you further go you back further back. You go the more things get loose uh william jennings brian over mckinley in 96. Uh do you see like populism like develop as the response to robert baron capitalism instead of you know middle class lead progressivism which is what we ended up getting under roosevelt. Uh uh maybe a bryan presidency. Uh changes the contours of that uh that political reshaping yeah uh and then you know possibly leads to 20 25 years later. A democratic party that's maybe more amenable to the european style like socialist parties you know yeah who knows who knows how how does how does it sharpen the cop. Basically the question for anything really coming between the civil war and the early 30s is how what could be different that could have sharpened the conflict between labor and capital. Once the crisis occurs in the late 20s early 30s see I saw that that's oh yeah oh but in the late 20s early 30s because you think that yeah. That's that's the moment yeah so you're so like if you have a populism as opposed to pro progressivism that's that that just ends up being assimilated into this. This uh republican hegemony in the 20s uh maybe you get something uh more more radically based less less grounded in the middle class that is than what we got so yeah.

I'd say brian over mckinley in uh also uh and this was a close one which sadly the mckinley bryan election wasn't so this one is tantalizing because it was a close one uh uh henry clay over uh james k polk in 1844 uh an election that came down to a few thousand votes in new york uh and I think we might have discussed this but uh yeah ended up turning on a bunch of abolitionists voting for the liberty party in protest. Uh instead of the whigs who were if not anti-slavery more resisted to slave uh uh interests than the democrats uh but they wanted to keep themselves pure so the first bert. The bernie bros were the first spoilers uh in a presidential election in that respect because if you don't have polk. I don't know if you have the mexican war. Do you think you know do you. Think texas comes into the union under clay or at all like or is it like is. It just deleted or does texas because these are significant questions that we don't know the answer to uh because astoundingly when the whigs are finally given a popular mandate and actual control over government. Uh the guy dies and is replaced by a dude who was not a wig in any sense. Yes a guy who had no identification or buy-in with the wig program and was in fact the unalloyed sort of id of the democratic party. He was he was mad at jackson because jackson wasn't uh psychotically enough devoted to southern slave interests. That's why he didn't like jackson astounding that he was on the ticket yes. Uh wait a minute no that's yeah uh yes so. I'm sorry. So we didn't get that so we didn't get. That was the possibility maybe he takes over for polk uh and stops the slide towards uh regional conflict who knows I mean. He was the great compromiser uh but it is interesting so in the world. We did get the closest thing we had to a clay.

Presidency wasn't really that it was uh. It was the harrison uh uh van buren election right in 1840 uh because uh he was offered the vice presidency and he turned it down uh and that's what set the stage so we never got like wig united governments. But I think it's interesting that the only time they had the chance is when democratic uh governance collapse and that has been the whig motto ever since because I think you can kind of think see the modern democrats as sort of the clo. The analogy to the whigs of that era right like if we're in a pre-civil war era broadly speaking and as we're and the democrats and republicans are the whigs and democrats all over again. Then clearly the democrats are the whigs and the republicans are the democrats right uh and they in this context. As in that era they could only claim power when the the main the hegemonic party that uh is uh based in like the populist the the center of like the white male population. Basically the white male electorate the center. The part the party that gravitates towards that center of gravity which was the democrats and is the republicans. Uh is got a natural uh built-in advantage at the in at the electoral level therefore is going to rule most of the time it can only be defeated when it destroys itself. It can never there's there could be no like there was during the new deal era coherent popular party that can win by promising things because the wings could only really promise you know internal improvements which struck a lot of people as special interests you know like you're just helping manufacturers. It's a bipartisan infrastructure bill you know yeah yeah like the the base of the whigs was in the west where everyone no matter what they cared. About.

Slavery wanted more infrastructure to facilitate development because that's what was going to make them all rich because they were all  speculating on the land that only had value if the government gave it value through public investment uh. I haven't checked the bipartisan infrastructure bill yet uh. I don't know if there are any uh budget for canals in there um. But I certainly hope that we get at least a few new miles of canal building uh out of the uh fingers crossed yes uh maybe we can do one more but I don't want to go you know super long on this um maybe throw some more questions in there. Let me go to my list right here because the last thing that I want to do on this stream. Uh is uh talk about what we're gonna do next. Uh after this yes um so if there are any last minute uh questions in here throw them in here's one.


That's incredibly silly. But I think is funny to imagine. Like the contours of this we have to set up a lot of like what ifs here uh but what if uh trump was president during lincoln's term yeah. So I'm I'm just imagining. I'm just imagining like um somebody with his exact personality. It's so hard to guess what this would mean. I guess what would happen is like you you forget all the previous things trump has just won the election and it's 1860 and the uh the southern states are success are seceding. It's just funny to imagine because he would consider those his people but they're seceding and that makes him look like a loser. So how would you uh how would you go about navigating this you could argue that that was jackson's buying during the nullification crisis. Jackson who is of course you know trump's idol because he is the the farcical version of jackson's tragedy right right. He had his people get mad at tariffs that were the product of the democratic process that was represented the pretty much united interests of eastern capital which is significant so it could not be. It could not be uh ignored uh and they resisted but jackson from the position of the center and as being a nationalist and as identifying himself with a nation was like. You. I will. I will hang my own vice president from a goddamn lamppost uh and it was out that was by the way that was the incident that led john tyler to become an anti-jacksonian because he wasn't assiduous enough to southern regional interests um and you imagine that makes me think in a similar situation. Trump would do the same thing but like in 1860 when they're already succeeding. He's such a  yes that I think he just would have let him go uh and then hope they were nice to him or maybe asked to be uh in charge of them. Then it's like here's the thing like they're out. The election of lincoln is what led to the secession. I know the question doesn't make any sense.

It's just funny to imagine him dealing with a a uh a a crisis of that magnitude you know he would not he would not have held up to it like what about cuban missile crisis how about that. Oh. That's now that's what's your. Put your mind around that one. I get. I think cuba apocalypse situation. I god that's really tough i. I think he lets cuba have them and then just tries to talk it out in the press. Let's the soviet union uh set up. The thing is though is that he is so a bullshitter yeah and he is so erratic that you can't assure you can't assume that something he says doesn't like spook the soviets. I know the soviets would never launch a first strike but I could see trump doing just trying to do something like tactical to scare them or something and then triggering a full full exchange because remember the options in front of kennedy. After the revelation of the uh missiles were it were the the boycott or I'm sorry. The uh the  what do you call it the the blockade the blockade the blockade wasn't even on the agenda. It was it was basically what kind of invasion do we want to do do. We want to do a full invasion or just we just want to bomb them and it was kennedy who sort of pushed against that and said what if we did this third option that they all thought was munich. That's what lemay thought. He said this is munich. Uh the quarantine is also what they call it uh. And I don't think you get those options in front of trump he he thinks embargo. I don't think that he gets to that level of abstraction to even have that thought and since there's nobody in the room giving him that as an option he's gonna bomb something because he's not created yes you know with this stuff. He does he did for his entire presidency what was presented to him as an option right and whenever he went against that it was just out of personal ego based peak having to do with him. Not having to do with policy policy.

He was totally frozen that guy miley basically uh punked him out into killing suleimani. He said uh you're going to go down and so you're going to get a bunch of people. Killed people are going to think you're a loser if you don't kill soleimani and so he's like I'll show you and so he pressed the button if you got. Curtis lemay in the room telling him that you're getting a  uh at least invade with a ground force cuba. You got vietnam at the least you got vietnam five years early in the caribbean here which by the way I also think you would have gotten if nixon had won in 60 which was a very close possibility um imagining lemay as one of the trump guys. I think the easy impulse to say would be that that lemay would just be running the show because he's a big tough general and uh you know trump would be like he's a big guy. He's a tough guy. I like him but but I think lemay is too strong of a personality and would have been one of the guys who was in there for like nine months and then crossed trump on some something well. That's for sure no it's only a question of whether he would have been able to get him in the room but eventually anybody who is alpha he has to get rid of yeah because he's insecure um all right.

Let's do one more quick uh what if well it's not going to be probably not gonna be quick. But we'll do one more what if and then we'll talk about the next project and then we're gonna get out of here um which elected potus would have been the most interesting to see die or resign and have their vp take over for the full term ooh well. I mean obviously right off the dome henry wallace in in like if if uh if fdr died a few seconds earlier before during the third year yes. Uh before you get into this. I do have to thank uh big bargaining unit energy for pointing out that 9.5 billion uh for inland waterways uh in the buy structure in linville so canals folks we're bringing them back folks. We're bringing back the connections to uh biden as a neo wig yeah. He's basically a neo wig wiggle wiggle what uh all right so most so yes so uh fdr dying in his third term yeah absolutely. Uh that's a fascinating one um. We talked about this on chapel but uh hw taking over for reagan is fascinating just because so much of reagan's uh ability to assimilate people to the reality of you know a a a new economic order and a new uh destruction of the uh entitlements of american citizenship was personality based and narrative based and the sort of the un alloyed exoskeleton of george. H.w bush carrying that stuff out is maybe a little less amenable to people who knows yeah uh let me think of another one. I mean again. I think an interesting reversal of this is if mckinley doesn't get plugged in uh and teddy doesn't uh ascend at that young age uh from that position because again like you know. I was just.

Gonna say because again he was put put in the vice presidency to uh to derail his political career. You know so um yeah. You know it would probably just be more republican business as usual. It's funny to imagine cheney taking over for bush after 9 11. Yeah and once again a thing where like a lizard face carrying out this thing instead of a bluff hardy. Uh dimwit that everybody feels like they can have a beer with um yeah would it have been more difficult to sell the uh if bush had died in 9 11 like if they if he had been in the wrong place and you know uh they actually like struck the white house or something um you know and cheney got in. There would he have been able to sell the iraq war as as well as bush could have you know a real a real what if and and the one that is uh the basis for I believe is the basis for the alternative nazis win world war ii chronology in dick's man in the high castle is if giuseppe zangara kills fdr in uh miami instead of uh killing the mayor of chicago anton cermak and because then the new deal would have been presided over by cactus jack garner. The uh former speaker of the house from texas who was a uh fully uh patched in leader of the bourbon democrats. He was one of the reactionary uh right wingers within the democratic coalition uh and he spent the entire his entire two turns screaming about the new deal and he uh only served that long because he assumed that he'd be able to run for the office himself and be president in. Uh after two terms and fdr broke tradition in part because they didn't want to give the thing over to this guy because he would have basically sabotaged the new deal consciously and unconsciously and there was nobody else who could really be trusted to hold up the banner for the the project itself against its vice president. So uh they he had to run for a third term but having garner respond to the new deal or respond to the great depression. Uh you could have a much deeper great depression. You could have a more politically fractious one a more violent one in all ways and then a completely different response to the emergence of world war ii. And that's why uh for dick it led to the nazis winning because we would just not be able to get our  together yeah well. I think that's enough um president's questions uh for now uh. I would just say because you know this will be the last time that matt and I will be talking about the presidents for a while.

Although I'm sure it will come up in uh other things uh you know thanks thanks again for everybody who listen thank you thank you for listening really glad everyone liked it. I was very very worried about it and I think it turned out pretty good. That's mostly though I must say due to chris. It would have been up to me. It would have been a complete disaster well I absolutely for sure absolutely could not have done it without mad yeah. I think we were both very nervous about uh getting this out there and if it would uh make sense or be legible or be entertaining or engaging to everyone. So everyone who listened everybody who said nice things about it to us uh of all the projects that we've done shabbat related. This is the one that we're hearing nice things uh from the fans that was the most uh encouraging because it let us know that we were on the right track and that you know because we were still producing the series even after like the beginning of it started coming out still recording episodes so um yes that was very encouraging yeah towards the end and I you know. I think it it gave us the uh the boost and the in the confidence too as I was saying earlier. Those those last few episodes the latter half of the 20th 21st century uh you know when it was the whole thing was getting pretty unwieldy. You know hearing that what we were doing was working for people you know. I think helped us at least me keep going and and pushing through and and like staying on track to get the show done. So thank you everybody for listening um and then we'll use that to segue into that we want to do another one of these uh.


Obviously it will not be hell of presidents or hell of anything because that pun is specific to u.s. Presidents. But it will be me and matt doing some kind of limited series that uh covers a specific chunk of time in a discreet way and you know I'm hesitant to talk about things because I tend in the past to be like the more. I talk about something publicly the less likely it will be to happen but I think having done this once and uh saying this here now publicly is more of a promise to you guys than uh bragging about something that hasn't happened yet. So we want to confirm now that we want to do something sometime next year's uh on the 30 years war. Yes the uh the 30 years war and the the 17th century transition uh towards capitalism that sees and the the real end of the story is is how do you get.

The real point of the story is to explain precisely how you get basically from the black death to the glorious revolution. The uh the hanoverian uh takeover of uh the uk that leads to uh anglo capitalism to run roughshod over the  planet yeah. This we want to kind of pitch it as the story of uh the the exo. The the t-1000 of capitalism emerging from the uh the rotting dead corpse of feudal europe uh through precisely a century of violence uh through this century of uh empires forming and falling uh and most important through the through this century or this 30-year conflict of uh german guys waving hobbits at each other. It's very important and the whole time this is happening you're seeing a cultural revolution emerge simultaneously in order to absorb this change. Yes like these new conditions are going to require a new uh spiritual cultural understanding to uh metabolize them and this the thing that's emerging at the same time separate from the capitalist development but uh on a parallel track is the reformation right. The emergence of protestantism and all that's gonna so we're gonna go together and then you have a century of conflict that the centerpiece of which is this horrifying 30-year period when central europe was completely desolated uh a greater the greatest trauma in german history uh even according to germans uh greater than world war ii in their own memory anyway because you know it's persisted longer yes uh and we get to talk about yeah so we get to talk about like the the political uh formulations of central europe at the time which is very fascinating and funny. I mean the the holy roman empire as a historical concept is  hilarious. It is basically uh the political economic equivalent of one of those uh carnival calliopes with like five million pipes and like a bunch of yeah. There's like a drone into it and the whistle yeah like the thing that I think you should leave that. I think you should leave the thing that fred willard plays like that is the that is what the holy roman empire was uh to the person who suggested peace of west failure believe me.

I've already thought about that for a name oh yeah. No that's on the list for sure um so yeah. It's definitely going to be. It's going to be a little more difficult than this because as we said in the final episode when we were doing the rankings. The thing about the presidents is you get 46 of these guys and it's a discrete number and you can kind of go through and you can chunk them out and and it's a manageable thing. I think the task here is going to be one of ordering things especially because as matt says we're probably going to try to start um. You know start with martin luther and and william of orange uh.

So we're really looking at like a 200-year span of things with a focus on the uh. The um a real focus in on the conflict. But we got to go back far and we got to go forward far um yeah. And it's like that's the climactic thing of it yeah because it's the it's. It's the end of the 30 years war and the treaty of westphalia that uh establish the incapacity of any one power to rule europe and the it establishes the nation state. As like the competitive. Uh uh the competitive state structure that is going to dominate the continent and then set this and then set that conflict into motion uh and so you essentially get uh a competition for resources specifically imperial resources uh that leads to the uh adaption in the boggy. Hole of europe on the british isles and low countries of a new form of uh social relations that facilitates uh uh economic growth facilitates therefore military and uh state power right and then is able to force on the rest of the world on on good or bad terms depending on the ruling classes that exist there. This new system uh and then I will also get to reshare my uh photo um of actually visiting the room where the guys get defenestrated from uh that where the defense tradition of prague happened uh we love it.

We love to demonstrate don't we folks out uh windows um my favorite thing about that is that it wasn't the first one yes. It's more. It's the one everyone remembers but you know they didn't do it. We'll talk about the first one too because that's part of the the story of uh reformation yeah um so yeah. That's the uh that's the new project. It's going to be a while because we started like outlining hell of presidents in like july of 2020. Uh so it took us a long time to get from outline to um to starting to record um. But we've now already done this once. I think we're feeling a little better about it. I mean I've got. I've got the reading right behind me so yeah we're moving straight into it um. I don't know q three q four. Uh twenty that's a good estimate yeah yeah um and you know uh keep. It keep us honest keep on uh messaging me periodically. Hey when's uh when's the thirty years away. We'll keep you. Uh. We'll keep you posted on progress um but yeah. So that's the that's series two of this and that will uh um that will be on patreon that will be a uh like we're doing with hinge points which the new hinge points should have just dropped about 23 minutes ago um that one is going back to the civil war. New hinge points on um you know the pretty well well-tried territory for matt heads. The uh the the johnson uh benjamin butler uh wouldn't have to do it but yeah it's too important um so like hinge points. Uh the next series will be um on patreon. I can also tease right now that um hell why not uh february 4th I believe is locked in. For the next season of this is sus coming back on uh on patreon as well. We're going to be putting these series up throughout the year. Um hopefully there'll be a few of these um so yeah uh good teases all around uh anything else that you want to say matt. I'm not not much uh thank you really for everybody who enjoyed it. It was really cool and I'm I'm looking forward to more uh nerdery.

It's just. It's good to know that there are people who uh care at all about this  which makes me feel like I've less like. I wasted all of my life uh same um to to get a little savvy for a second. Uh you know. I spent a long time in the content mines for uh places where nobody watched or listened to anything that I produced uh at the media companies. I worked at so um making things for people who actually uh like and listen to and enjoy it and get something out of it is uh you know it's been. It's been the greatest uh honor and privilege of my life. So uh thank you all listeners for this project. Thank you we'll be back soon uh with more cool. Uh and until then um. I don't know uh. Let's do the show again. I was gonna try to come up with a president's pun. But uh I got nothing um yeah either all right. The presidents we love them folks uh never again uh instantly deleting all the knowledge of the presidents in my mind.
