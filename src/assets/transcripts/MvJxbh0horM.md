So ah I heard why people invented existential angst well. They were out of other problems because the thing about those problems was typically more money would solve them hello. I'm back like joey's world tour. I'm a little sweaty right. Now so the hair is looking positively gordon gekko in right now trying to get the thing here all right. I didn't want to talk about this but now. I feel like since it's the very first thing I got in the chat. I have to the goddamn thing in dc. You can point out the fact the obvious fact that such a trivial encounter should not be something that anybody knows about and that only the reality of our fast twitch muscle social media diet would even make it possible for something that insignificant to become something you would know know about let alone something that you would form very strong opinions around related to your larger like political goals and ideologies that's kind of absurd and of course other stuff's happening. Kenosha's on fire there's a guy who was walking from milwaukee to dc got shot by some psycho. But it's all over there and the thing about it. That makes me want to talk about.

It is the same thing is related to what I said yesterday about ops. Someone says was it libs or an op. I thought that's great that's a perfect. This is as insignificant an episode of it. As it is. We can use it to try to suss out some broader questions and I talked yesterday about how the compulsion to turn everything into an op eventually leaves the point where you can no longer distinguish the mechanisms of propaganda and you know state control and intelligence from just the mechanisms of capitalism creating a cultural superstructure out of material relationships.

But there's another big part that I actually forgot to mention that direct ties directly to this and that is that another big driver another. Another big problem with the the instinctive desire the instinctive belief to see something like that and think up for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about. There was a video today of some people who attacked some brunchers or I didn't attack them but they a bunch of mostly white Black lives matter protesters just getting in the faces of people who were not giving them the power fist in response and just screaming at this woman for not doing the fist and a lot of people are going ooh. Ah that's is that really helpful and a lot of people are saying like we heard from the first person is this enough and I understand that desire because who wants to take credit for that even like as just at the abstract level of I agree broadly with the sentiment that they're trying to protest on behalf of But the instinct to call it. An op is the instinct to soothe your cognitive dissonance. It's to say oh this thing this movement that I i support that sometimes I even feel that I may be a part of if I participate in protests or something is doing something. I don't agree with ah. The it's the authorities they're doing this.

No one who is really true of heart like me would yell at some random person that's crazy that must be the work of of the dastardly deep state and absent any evidence and all of this happens immediately when nobody has any context at all let alone evidence. I think that comes more than anything not from like a recognition of the role of intelligence and propaganda or reality. It comes from a desire to soothe cognitive dissonance and soothing cognitive dissonance through the creation of narratives of conspiracy is literally how we got q anon and I don't think that's necessarily going to happen on the left because you know the the centers are different. The social structure of the people involved is different or the social like context of the people involved is different but what is not different is that it is a soothing balm that leads you away from confronting reality and if you're on the left confronting reality is very very important because you don't have the luxury of capital to be buff to buffer your your failures of analysis and your failures of of of strategy. You are out there. We're all out here on our on our own. We don't we aren't we aren't able to to be like q anon might come true because eventually the reactionary forces in this country might just come to believe it to justify the actions.

They were going to do anyway that's not because they organized that's not because their delusions were correct. It's because that was the flow of history and they're going with the flow. They're salmon or no. They're not sam and they're the other ones. The left is salmon you're swimming upstream. You don't have the benefit of being able to just soothe yourself with this notion that oh you know we're an incredibly collapsed timeline here and everyone who is politically active really has to be thinking in terms of what they could do in the here and now to push things in a positive direction to go oh.

Everything that's bad that happens is part of any left project is the is the is the police is an op one that's just you soothing yourself and making you fail and allowing you to ignore the real problems that this thing creates which I'll talk about a second but secondly even if it's true so what oh it's an op all right so what can you prove. It's an opera. You're gonna go bust the guy who did it and have him confess no. It's just a way what when you tell others someone else. It's an op you just want them to read it and then not worry anymore so your strategy for defeating the deep state is just telling people. There's a deep state.

[07:10](https://youtu.be/MvJxbh0horM?t=07m10s)

I mean once again not effective soothing coping and I understand why people want to cope. I don't blaming anybody for this because my god why wouldn't people want to cope when they're so little on the horizon that looks like there's any hope but but compensating for that by indulging in in personally personal personally soothing and pleasing and exciting exercises at the expense of efficacy is actually counterproductive. It's a waste of time and resources that can't be wasted. There's no time and when something like this pops up you can say it's. People are talking about this correct are they still talking about it. Oh. No they are.

It's an op okay. It's an op now what the same people who believed it was the exact people who thought it was an app at the beginning still think that no one else does because they don't have your epistemic window that makes it look like an op before anything else. Now what the fact is even if it wasn't up there would be no way to isolate it because there's no movement. There's no organized movement that can either like endorse or ratify the actions of any particular outcropping of this. This leaderless kind of passionate outbursting that we're seeing which is totally predictable and understandable given the horrible conditions and be given things like monstrous horrifying police executions that everybody gets to watch on television but that desire to cleanse oneself of the feeling of guilt and the feeling of rage cannot overcome our greater commitment and duty to stopping it and seeing something like that and not making you making it use and not having it make you stop and say okay what are we doing here instead to just have an ex an excuse a complaint and then to move on you're not going to get anywhere you're not wrong in some sort of ideal sense. But that's not the point the point as someone once said is not to describe the world but to change it. And if your big piece of evidence that it's an op is.

I don't think people would do that people I believe in. No it has to be like dastardly libs or police officers. People. I agree with would never do that you're telling me that in a country of 300 million adult infants who have been indulged their entire lives along the the notion that that the sum total of human freedom is their personal happiness whatever that means oh. Here's what it means. We're going to tell you. What happiness is you're telling me that even that if people in that context find themselves horrified by a genuine outrage this genuine social wrong that in the absence of the mechanisms of a organized movement that can take everyone's passions and organize them along effective tranches of behavior absent that that we're going to go to what feels good and what could feel better than screaming in someone's face and making them hold up their hand for you that that isn't a power trip yeah.

I I just I find that a plausible motivation. I think that's something people could do absent the government telling them to or absent it being a A total false flag the people I encounter in this world. In this country. They're the kind of people who would do that oh. I get to scream in someone's face and be the good guy and so you have that and then there's the greater and then there's the other problem that it's not like everybody is saying that this is a terrible thing. Some people are saying that this is a good. This is good or that them. It's like what's the big you know. It's like oh crap boo hoo yeah. Of course. It's nothing who cares in terms of like broad but as a as a strategy like if these things are supposed to be examples of actions to create difference. There are people who see this and they think that it's a good thing to do and I got a I got a tweet here from someone. I know yeah blah blah. You shouldn't go on twitter. But this is a person with not no followers and somebody who seems to be somewhere in here. And I just I'm going to read this because it seems to be to be exemplary of the mindset of someone who would see that and think it was a good idea. The thing about protesting that's not supposed to cause a crisis of leaders is that it's supposed to cause a crisis of leadership if someone doesn't want to be screamed at by blm protesters. While eating they should call their local pauls and demand. They reign in the cops. Now.

I would agree with that the reason I quoted that is not because like look at all. These people who think that but because I think that's actually the thought process. I think that is the correct thought process if you were to like split open the brains of the people doing this in good faith. I think you would find this is the basic idea that you you get everybody on your side through either persuasion and if that fails through coercion of social pressure in medieval germany. They used to call it cat music if somebody in the in like a village or a hamlet was a real prick because there was no real law enforcement people would gather in front of their house and they'd bang pots and pans and they wouldn't let them sleep and it would tell them to shape up and a lot of people actually see that as a model for restorative justice absent the carceral state which I mean once again if you want to have if you're talking if you're assuming a feudal level of social relationship. A futile level of social connectedness and interwovenness maybe we can start talking but if you don't have that that's not going to be a good idea but but so then everybody does that now of course.

That's not the only response you can have from someone doing this the other. The next tweet from this person is or they can go sign up on racist subreddit because now they want to race war. It's their choice. The protest forced them to make one and I think that gets it another thing. That's essential here is that that kind of action is not designed to change things so much as it is designed to separate the good people from the bad people by doing it by banging it yelling at somebody by demanding. They move their hand in public by bullying someone by the way they're not hitting cops anymore at least in dc and it's like. I get that why would you want to risk that why would you want to get your split hats get your head split open without any hope. It's going to lead to anything. I wouldn't want to fight with the cops either with a la any kind of lack of plan behind it. I could yell at somebody with no plan behind it because what's that what's the downside for me and I get to feel like a big big big person. I get to feel like I'm bossing somebody around which everybody wants. Everybody wants to be karen. But karen people want to be cared not just that they can dominate others but because it is a model for getting things done in a consumer context yelling at the man yelling at an employee until he brings a manager. Then yelling at the manager is a way to get the discount because you have basically badgered the company into doing doing it to make you go away. That's what they're talking about. They're saying yell at people attack people until they feel they do what you want to make them go away and what that assumes always is that the people in charge are will always be. There there will always be a separate class of political and economic elite and that your only way of changing their behavior. The changing the conditions of your life is by getting them to change their actions even though things like having like our police state ex are not optional to capitalism as it currently exists.

[14:46](https://youtu.be/MvJxbh0horM?t=14m46s)

These things are not just fun gigas. This is the core functions of the state. All the stuff that was superfluous has already gone. They sold it off the stuff. That's left is the real steel. It's the exoskeleton of the state. They're not going to give it up no matter what if you complain too much if it really becomes a problem. They will make you stop complaining and this and so the only way to stop that horrible police state we have is to organize to defeat it replace. It replace the political system and replace the economic system that's your only way around that you're not going to get them to change something that is a crucial piece of the architecture of like capitalism a load-bearing structure they're not going to kick it away because you said so because you asked because you dabbed on.

Some people who were eating eggs benedict. But they don't even know that what they're talking about is carrinism because they're because that's the only thing they've ever known. Complaining to the manager is all people know in this country because we've never had the disciplinary experiential behavior of having a social A social element added to our personal pleasure. Seeking id through collective action through working through working together something like. I don't know a labor union we're coming together as individuals. We're marching together in a big group but nobody knows each other and then that be in that environment there's gonna be no there's gonna be no strategy. There's only going to be letting out your frustration your anger your your sense of guilt. If you're white and a lot of the people yelling were white your sense of complicity. You want to yell it out and then you can convince yourself oh. If I yell enough. They're going to do what I want them to do well.

I mean if the thing is is is optional if it's if it's something up in the up in the cultural element of culture like what tv shows are on or you know whether there's interracial couples in television ads or you know. If there's a black spider-man that's negotiable the police are not negotiable but nobody has ever had any effect on their lives on the lab oh boy effective activism that wasn't just asking it wasn't just demanding to make other people do something. Someone is else. Someone in charge is going to do it but that's not going to work. We have to change it because at this point the things we're pissed at are not optional unless you really care about stuff like you know having lbgtq marvel characters. If you care about things like the liability of the planet and the fact that like a democracy is just turning into even even the even the kabuki of democracy is being replaced by just sheer authoritarian exertion.

I mean we're on the verge of electing a president without who didn't even win the popular vote twice in a row who is going to bring upon himself unprecedented power. But any president would do that and that's why fascism is such a bad thing to be banging on about right now because if there's going to be camps in the near future for people. If we're going to get rounded up. Biden would do it too. It'll just be a different b maybe. It'll be a different group of people getting rounded up. Maybe. It'll be a more racially inclusive group of people rather than just minorities that get rounded up. But it will be a rounding up and it will have a neoliberal smiley face gloss on it. But it will be the same thing because it will be necessitated by the conditions by the crisis. I'm not saying that will happen but I'm saying. It's not like trump's going to snap his fingers and make it happen from a position of carrying out a a a fascist coup. It's going to be a seeding to a crisis that cannot be otherwise contained and that crisis would exist under biden there's going to be some some rain. I think there's some fat boys coming some fat fat rain boys coming but yeah. I mean at the end of the day.

Nobody wants to confront the fact that a lot of a lot of what we think of as an uprising is really just people getting their jollies in one way or another including the people online cheering them on or talking about them or even us talking about the me talking about them all just getting a little bit of pleasure rather than doing effective action and that who wants to confront that reality that sucks and it's and it is terrible. But I do think that until you confront it you can't really break the cycle oh boy oh yeah. I might not make it an hour out here guys. We'll see. I might have to start running soon but the reality is is that you you can argue all you want about whether it's good to burn a building. You can't press a bit button and stop them from doing it or press a button to make people do it. You can't vote on it. You can't make it happen or not happen. You can't make or not make a group of people yell at some brunchers in dc. It's everyone's just operating out of out of I hate to lean on a clutch lean on a verbal crutch but it's very crucial. In this case a libidinal political instinct.

A desire to what I mean by that more than anything is a individualized id based political instinct that is not to achieve a better world but is to gain the pleasures associated with feeling that you are on the right side of history and the thing about that is that's got to motivate everybody to an extent. But it has to connect also to a greater project which will the exercising of which will bleed your need for the libidinal because you're getting results or even if you're not getting results. You're feeling comradeship. You're feeling effective in a narrow sense in a way that you never will by going out and hollering at people but that means that that drive is only going to become more more fixating because over time you need to compensate more and more for the lack of effectiveness. Lacan's good wakanda's correct on a lot of stuff come on especially since this central is just buddhism. It's just buddhism with continental gloss. It's buddhism with a baguette up.

[22:24](https://youtu.be/MvJxbh0horM?t=22m24s)

Its ass okay holy mackerel. I got. I got the I got the black cherry all right guys. Maybe we can get in and still record but I gotta get out of here. It is gonna come down guys haven't been inside for a while. I've been not since my neighbor scared me back in by telling me to stop hooting and hollering out there. I'm back to hooting and hollering all right. How's everybody doing. We're back in the house. We're back in the new york groove indoors bad as I want to be 

Someone wants to know what authoritarian neoliberalism is. Gonna look like and I would say china. It's a good example brazil letting all the letting boat people drown in the mediterranean. I mean it's all happening you know the apocalypse already has happened. It's just not evenly distributed. Singapore is a very good example yes but mostly it's going to be about pairing around the edges. It's about. It's going to be about creating new borders and liminal spaces that can be negotiated violently because for the you know for the for the length of american history.

America was able to export its most like dysfunctional social pathologies onto its border regions and I was always pushing out that way and able to push them out that way and that's why they never had to confront them. That's why we never had a real like socialist movement in this country or one of the big reasons. But now that we've hit all borders now that we've hit the edge of space. We are now having to reinscribe borders to find a new liminal space for maximal violence where people where citizens are allowed to carry out the maximum amount of violence. And the people subject to their violence are not part of the conceived of group of right-bearing citizens. It's a gambin stuff. You know what I'm talking about the homo saucer and we have those at the border now and those borders will just be increased. They will become other places. They will probably become distributed within the united states around cities probably specific areas of like where where where the cataclysm is hitting most directly places attacked by global warming flooding like consistent wildfires desertification urban areas that are like where where there were not where the there's the cycle of like police violence and response is is made permanent like right. Now. It's sort of it's it waxes away. It's like we had it's not getting compressed like the the time from like think of the time it took to get from you know so like you got mike brown to to baltimore and now we've got from george floyd three months later. Like the violence is gonna go up which means the cycle is gonna speed up which means the intervals are gonna get shorter and eventually it just becomes a permanent condition and that's a new border.

That's a new internal border that where you get to exercise maximal violence and the reason that this isn't fascism is because there is still that social continuum within that air with with out I'm sorry. The places beyond those borders that's still the same atomized social slurry of consumers basically being free to consume that we have now it will be functionally identical. There will not be marching jack boots in the streets. There's not going to be a new flag with like a weird symbol a weird rune on it. You know there's not going to be jack boots. There's not going to be theater. There's not going to be this frisian of of apocalypse of of revelation of of the truth of the whole condition and for the leftists the validation of their world view. I have always said that america was fascist and now. I have been proven correct that moment which is I think undergirding a lot of the fantasy projection of american fascism that won't happen I highly highly doubt it. What you will have is. You will have the border regions within and at the edge where violence is maximally. Applied and then you will have america where we're doing tick tocks or whatever progress goes after tick tock and we're arguing over the problematic content of aquaman versus bernie goetz. No gilead what are you talking about oh my god. No. It's just like this only more people are dying and there are fewer people who are still living our absurdly inflated consumer standard of living at the very end of the global supply. Chain do you understand the distinction.

[29:10](https://youtu.be/MvJxbh0horM?t=29m10s)

I think that the the I i guess the what I find most reasonable about the fascist framing is that it seems to me to be at a certain level a a a fantasy something that deeply at a level. I mean not in terms of their morals. You know they are. They are horrified by fascism and want to defeat it and in fact the fantasy of fascism is what gives their actions romance and and and power to them and it allows them to expend orgone along the axis of politics. It's it's the horribleness of that possibility and then if you talk about it a lot and say it's coming. Its occurrence is a validation and I feel like that that means that you're not looking at reality that means that you are abstracting and I just have to like as a general rule as a rubric. I could look at somebody who's fixated on fascism and say this person is. They're nice. Their eye isn't on the ball they're and so they're gonna be more likely and haven't you noticed by the way that people. The most fixated on fascism and calling what were in fascism are also the most committed to things like theatrical demonstrative non-organized political action to replace real either electoral or labor activism and organization like spectacular demonstrations of anti-fascist sentiment and that's because they think we're at a level of social development that we are not we need to organize way more people getting people needs to be the only question sorting people has to come later. These people want to sort remember that tweet. I wrote you about the tweet that said hey they'll either tell they'll either call up the mayor and tell him to get rid of racism which wow it's so nice that we they can do that or they'll go and become a storm front editor and get a gun and become a militia member and that's not good you don't want that to happen to somebody who's like not engaged you want to minimize that.

But no if your goal is sorting people into good and bad then you're you want that to happen. I'm saying we cannot be sorting. We need to be organizing everybody who has any genuine access of alienation that is aware of capitalism that was aware of their their misery being connected to the system of the economy. The I th that they have not been captured by fantasies of like racism being the cause of all evil or cue people thinking that it's hollywood hollywood pedophiles or jews or whatever right-wing fantasy you need to to square the reality of living under somebody else's design in a free country. If you identify under if you're aware at all that there is a class component to your immigration. Then you have to be engaged with and of course that's going to make people uncomfortable but that discomfort gets edged out through actual behavior together.

But it will never get etched out in the phantom realm of online where all disagreement has now been defined as or can be defined as abuse. How many people think being disagreed with is abusing someone now if you really thought that in your day-to-day behavior you wouldn't be able to function you don't really think that online your fantasy life can sustain that belief and you can use it to batter down everyone you're interacting with to do what you want them to do now if you were acting politically in the real world over time your ability to do that would be blunted against everyone else's desire to get something done and you would have to accommodate it. Also. I must say there are also people who are genuinely like very racist and committed to racism or deeply misogynistic and hostile to women or wildly wildly reactionary about some group of people they and that they can't get rid of that well. They can maintain that all they want online is they duel with the sjws and in fact the more they believe those things the more they trigger people. They hate so they can believe in them more if they really wanted to alleviate their misery and they can understood it as a result.

As that class action was the only thing that would do it. They wouldn't up and even if they still thought it it wouldn't matter because they would have to accommodate to organizing into the group and that would mean that either it would go or they would alienate everybody else and they'd get kicked out. They would have to choose between actually trying to fix things and holding on to this. Just like people would have to choose between actually trying to fix things and holding on to the all disagreement is a is abuse. All experiences should be totally frictionless. No one should ever have any conflict at all and that I'm going to use that belief to badger everyone else into basically never disagreeing with me. None of those neither of those are sustainable beliefs in a genuinely effective left-wing organization. At this point everyone now like people like to say oh look at the uaw look at the sea look at all. The racists and the old crafts unions history has moved forward I'm afraid and a lot of those problems that shattered the labor movement in the 60s. A lot of them not all of them for the love of god not all of them but of course. Not all of them have been resolved. We are dealing with a fundamentally less instinctively racist population than we had to deal with in the 60s and that means that the people who even are racist can be dealt with as long as they think they can make their lives better through class collaboration so all this desire to separate the sheep from the goats and the fascists from the anti-fascist.

All of it does is to serve to guarantee that the fewest people are going to make the step from online to the real world. The fewest people are going to want to talk to other people in the real world about politics and try to figure out how to fix things and the more of them are going to sink all of their. They get to hold on to their greasy little center of of perverted pleasure. Whether it's a racial fixation sexual inadequacy brought on by being a gross unfuckable incel or the trauma associated with with you know being a minority that that manifests itself in such a way that you cannot countenance. You are so distrustful of non-whites or women or men if you're a woman that you cannot ever trust their motives in any situation and have to constantly prove to yourself that they're on your side because you fundamentally do not trust them and I'm not saying that you don't have a good reason not to trust men if you're a woman or white people if you're black. But I am saying that if you cannot let go of that make a say it with me folks leap of faith sufficient to meet someone that way a man or a a white person halfway.

Then you will leave and that's fine. That's the kind of person who should not be part of an organization but guess what the bet of marxism the bet of socialism. The bet of the human race is that major the majority of people if they properly understand that moment and that choice will choose to cooperate and will choose to put the greater good above their own. But they have to see evidence that there's a reason to do it or else. It all comes back to the self and the disgusting little jack off session in your pants. Oh dear. I'm afraid. I went off again oh boy. I afraid. I am afraid that I have gone down again. I have gone I've gone off sirs and madames that you may be watching but that's fine that's fine. I am sipping not the tea but the cells. I'm I hope the thing isn't shaking too much. But I don't really have anywhere to put my phone. I have the thing out there. I'm not even sure if it's raining.

[37:43](https://youtu.be/MvJxbh0horM?t=37m43s)

It just felt like it was going to kierkegaard baby. Give me some kierkegaard. He's in the stew when I think of who's in the gumbo who's in my mental gumbo. He's in there spinoza kierkegaard for sure wittgenstein. I think nietzsche definitely and of course plato because forms are crucial. Someone wants me to talk about the batavian republic. There are other listeners to the age of napoleon podcast out there because today I in fact also just listened to his episode about the end of the the peace that followed the war of the second coalition. Batavian republic just makes me think of it just makes me think of pretzels. I don't know why but I just think of a pretzel big hot a hot pretzel with mustard when I hear batavian. It's it's deeply. It's pavlovia. I don't know where it came from and now. I really want a big oh god. I want a big oh big soft pretzel with mustard not hot nacho sauce mustard for sure oh big bavarian and I know it's.

I know. It's the batavian republic not the bavarian republic but maybe they're close enough that they make me think of it god damn you guys just make me want a pretzel. But I don't really know much about switzerland. It's very interesting. I mean when you consider how how sweet suicinaris it is in europe to this day in terms of a country like it broke off from the holy roman emperor very early and then I guess you know because of its defensible. Physical position was able to establish independence from all of the reigning houses. You know of of the middle ages in the early modern era and an institute what what harry lyme and the third man called the 500 years of democracy and peace. What did it bring us the cuckoo clock and that's the funny thing about switzerland. They cut themselves off. They like basically signed off and said we're done with this and you didn't really ever hear from him again. They just sat there collecting money. They made the smart move. It's like. Mussolini was half right when he said blood alone moves the wheel of history. It's like well blood first but then gold and the swiss knew why fight these wars when you can make money. They were the first really effective mercenaries in the in the medieval era where the your lens connects and now they get to just sit there in their mountain castle in the hall of the mountain king counting their duckets.

It's It's it's sinister oh. That was the helvetica republic. You're right batavian republic were the dutch yeah the dutch one. I like that they ate a guy dutch rebels one time ate a dude. They ate a governor they were mad at that's amazing goddammit. I knew lance. Next were german. I thought they were supposed to. They ate a dude when I like the fact that they've got a 90 years war which people don't normally know about or 80 years war or rather the 80. They got an 80 years war but yeah all those sister republics were failures as as I think everett does a good job of talking about on the episode today because they were not organic you know they did not. They did not adhere to the social soil because they were imposed from without contradictions have to be worked from within worked out from within a social order which is why honestly a lot of the soviet fantasies of like of of revolutionary war like the guys like bukhari who wanted to continue the war under the flag of the you know of class revolution stuff imposed from without even if it's like even if you are representing. Like the correct force of history or the progressive side of history. You still have to contend with local conditions and that's why the idea that you can like invade and impose betterness.

I mean it never worked. It didn't work for the french and it didn't work really for any of the any of the marxist or you know wood so-called marxist states of the 20th century. It. It's sort of a macro version of how you can't scream at someone's face to raise their fist and expect that to work like who are you you're just some. Like they don't they they haven't bought your you. They haven't gotten your assumptions. They aren't sharing a lot of your assumptions to so that they're gonna there's gonna be a lot of cultural and and symbolic screens between your understanding of the reality. In theirs all you can do is stoke the fires for for internal resolution of of contradiction which is why the trotskyists are wrong as they want world revolution so much that they think we can make it happen because it has to happen soon if we're going to get world socialism or any kind of socialism like we're going to have to they believe we're going to the real thing of trotskyism is they believe you can't get rid of capitalism with until you have a world system and they might actually have a point with that.

I don't know I haven't thought about it that much honestly but like the reasoning is when you look at what happened with the soviet union. If you're in a world market system you will suborn yourself to it. That's why they became deformed. Marks deformed workers. States like they called them and they talked about the rise of the bureaucratic class that had to manage the state capitalism. That's because they were part of this global system and they were in competition and that need for competition made them capitalists and you know that that's. I think that's an accurate description of like the structure of the soviet economy. But what do you do about it is the question and and I don't think that trotskyism resolves that question trotskyism offloads the question by saying well you export it. You revolt everybody else and then you can have a system where that state capitalism turns into real communism. It has to emerge independ.

It has to emerge from the ground up everywhere and that doesn't mean we can't cooperate. We have to co-op like things like solidarity strikes and like that historically has been the kind of thing we're talking about. I mean if in world war one when all the countries had declared war on each other if class consciousness had been developed enough in the advanced countries for all of their work all of their labor cl. All of their socialist parties and all of their labor unions to just declare us general strikes that would have really created world revolution right there or could have or would have been the start of I think an unstoppable tide or at least a highly highly effective. The best chance we could have had basically and there's an argument to be made that world war. One was basically a false flag to get the working classes of europe to kill each other instead of unite. But the thing is once you're in that state sector and that's another country's flag coming over the the wall with guns and in a different vocabulary then conflict will arise. They will not accept it robespierre who warned against the the republic declaring war and that's one of those things you can use if you want to defend. Robespierre is that the conditions that led to the the great terror were exacerbated wildly by the early years of the war with the first with the austrians and how badly it went and how terrified everybody was that the king was going to come or that the king was going to come back to power and everybody killed. But that war was that war was opposed by the jacobins. That war was opposed by the mountain because robespierre said the only thing people hate that mission more than missionaries are armed missionaries and what happened was is that that frenzied war condition is what led to people fleeing to the you know the safety of the jacobins to like carry them through the conflict and all the sister republics that were left in the wake of french. Revolutionary success were never able to take root even with national organic political movements think about the the italian peasantry who rose up against the french. Because the local priests told them to your your peasantry has to get alienated against the priests themselves. You cannot alienate a peasantry from their own priesthood from outside because why the hell would they listen to you over their priest because I mean maybe maybe the crown heads of europe looked around and said oh in a few years. These guys at any doubt at any moment forget having to stop a war at any moment can just put down their tools and we're done what if we fight each other and these guys all writing letters to each other because they were all literally related kaiser wilhelm writing during the war to nicholas and calling him dearest nicki. He was. He was he was I believe. Wilhelm was also queen victoria's grandson and king ed king king. George v looked exactly like nicholas ii exactly you know you look think of it and the thing is is that. I don't think that that's the thing that they thought to do they weren't like hey. Let's do a big false flag war to kill off the working class.

I think that one of the drivers of the military mobilization around late imperialism was the effective agitation of the working class it drove. It exacerbated the the the perceived need for militaristic an imperial advancement among the leadership of the of the countries and also militated against de-escalation because from the perspective of a country dealing with a rising and more effective working class. The idea of conscripting millions of them into the military is a contributing variable towards making the decision to go to war well. I hope I hope I made sense today. I kind of went off there time stopped moving cuba's more base than vietnam because vietnam is basically china junior and that they let in western capital. They've managed it relatively well. I mean their covered response shows that they have not sacrificed social cohesion and like social welfare completely which I think wouldn't have happened if they hadn't won the war like if you're vietnamese. I think if you're if you're if you're a guy who fought in that war.

I think you can look back at all that sacrifice and I don't think you can look at the mcdonald's across the street and go you know what it was all for nothing because if the south had won certainly if they had been able to you know take over the whole country or sir. But if they had been able to like dominate lower the lower half of that peninsula they would have become a bangladeshi like a place of hyperexploitation of labor whereas they have capitalism now. But it's one that still has a degree of control but at the same time you look at that compared to cuba holding out against the world market for 70 years surviving the fall of the soviet union and then surviving the death of castro which nobody really thought was gonna happen. It's astounding it really does bring a tear to the eye. I don't want to choose solidarity with both of them.

I do wonder if like the people who are really pro china like the campus deng people. If they know how little the vietnamese communists like china or the maoists in india for that exam. For that matter yeah. Striking is illegal in vietnam. That's so funny yeah. I mean the person you really have to ask if it was worth. Vietnam was us for us it was like not worth it for any kind of perspective because we got in there anyway on terms that even if they weren't ideal were better than nothing and have been wildly helpful to facilitating global capital flows.

Which of course is all of this matters the flow. If there's one word when you think about the economy all this. Just think of the word flow they're not discrete economies. In this world. It is one holistic system of systems and it is described. Its actions are described as a flow in my mind it is a circulation. It is a circular system and they're in the flow.

I think that they are at a better position as a country than they would have been if they hadn't fought and hadn't kicked us out but certainly when you consider what the stakes were for america and how psychically damaging that war was for us and how it deformed our politics for the rest of its existence. It's kind of breathtaking but of course an example had to be made like it was in indonesia like it was in iran like it was in guatemala like it was in chile argentina brazil greece italy france ireland. If you count all the the aid to the the sas against the anti-imperial movements. It's It was a global war like you could say you could call it the third world war. I think they said that on q and on and I are true true or not sorry. I think I think mike judge said that on true and on that it's that the third world war already happened and it was the battle between capitalism and the whole world like not just the soviet union but like arrayed differently like all of the world and like you could consider the soviets and like the chinese as big factions within a broader uncoordinated coalition against one massive enemy which is global capitalism and that the battlefields were not in russia or the united states but in korea vietnam the drc south africa namibia mozambique algeria iraq iran turkey all all the for all the europe itself through the gladio program algeria the entire the entire western hemisphere the entire american sphere of influence and I'm not talking about and in all those cases I'm talking about real violence. Actual battlefields deaths in the millions and the end of which has left a rampant and un and unchallenged global capitalism with a global capital flow and so I would say that from the point of view of like american policy makers and american american stakeholders specifically american political stakeholders. Vietnam was a mistake even if it did prevent an example from forging but I think as stepped away as like one. One chess move in a global chess game in the in the in the in the interest of the creation of those flow networks like if you don't have vietnam what like it's a reverse domino theory. If you don't go in in vietnam where else don't you go in and what battles maybe do you lose and then how much does that change the conditions hussites. Bad timing you gotta wait man. You gotta wait for that printing press.

I will leave on this thank you for reminding him of that. I tried to play twilight struggle once and it seems to me to be a very very complicated game but that's exactly the kind of game that chris could walk me through. So a lot. I would love to do twilight struggle. That's a great idea we'll do that and I hope. I hope the stream is going to start in september fingers crossed. I think we're going to do it and like. I said there'll still be an hour. Whenever we do it. There will be an hour of me doing this that's not going anywhere. Maybe chris will help with fielding the questions so I'm not staring into the screen so much. But I will basically be doing this. Then we'll do games and other stuff. But this is not going anywhere. It's being added to benghazi ain't going away. All right guys good night.
