Very how I'm out. We're here we're starting there. It is hello. Folks find a Donald Pavan ladies and gentlemen about me miss you how you guys doing beautiful day. Today it was very kind of overcast earlier. But it's nice now so having a good. How are you good time. How's everyone doing there was something I think happened on Saturday. I think it was a tweet by it was a it was a interview with Joe Biden. I think he talked to Trevor Noah and it was so just striking to me when it when it happened and what he said that I felt I need to talk about this. But I also needed to grill so I ended up grilling instead. But I feel like. It's two days later and I feel like I still need to talk about it. So what's his nuts Joe Biden was on Oh Trevor Noah right. He was on The Daily Show and he's now doing his whole police reform stick right. Hey guys I'm as left-wing as you are now.

I want to do any of the stuff you say. But I want to say I want to do it in a way that will get you to stop yelling and vote for me and stop scaring suburban white people and so mr. Crime bill having to reinvent himself says we need less prison. We need less jail time and more mandatory rehab mandatory rehab. We need to stop building prisons and start building rehab centers. Now I hope that's pretty obvious what the problem is there right you've essentially just taken the same building with the same functions and the same staff and just change the name of it. I mean the parity of liberalism right just hey would you like a less. A less oppressive net would you like a less of a bummer of name. For this would you like a more soothing more euphemized name for this thing. That is gonna be exactly the same because obviously the question is why the hell these people need to go to rehab why can't like it. Why do we have to treat this as a it is a place where the state intercedes with with the ability to like put people behind bars imprison people. It doesn't matter if you're there to dry out or if you're there to be punished at the end of the day you're being held by the state and there's a reason that prisons were originally called penitentiaries. Because the premise was you were supposed to spend your time your mandatory time in prison being penitent thinking about your sins and and I'm just trying to get absolution from them. Through repentance penitence. The penitent man shall pass now rehabilitation centers. It's the exact same model.

It's just desacralized and modernized and liberalized because we don't believe it's sin anymore but we shares how believe in disease and addiction. But it's a it plays the same social role. Sin and addiction are personalized. X excuses for behavior that is on aggregate the result of the exploitative and alienating motor production and political economy that they're living under that's what it is you have a social phenomenon that you treat as an individual failing. What believe in God it was it was sin. It was inherent commands inherent tendency to fall towards sin now that we don't believe in sin. We just believe in optimal and set awful outcomes. It's an addiction. It's it's an illness that we can treat but how do we treat it. The exact same way getting people off the streets getting people behind bars dominating them in the whole endeavor in the cliched Foucault Ian sense of dominating their bio power and that really shows how in the current mode of crisis capitalism. There is no room for Less prisons. There's no room for less police. They're not going to do it because the system is only going to create more and more social dislocation more and more alienation more and more discontent as the wheels come off of this. Thing which means the need to control that through brutal Authority is going to become it more and more important so they're gonna be just throwing everybody in jail for mandatory rehab.

If that's what it takes but the same fundamental reality is the exact same is is a society trying to defend itself against the implications of its own exploitative economic structures by personalizing and pathologizing social phenomena under whatever name they want to call it. But both of them are efforts to deal with the fact that the system will not allow itself to not have this at its disposal because a violent crime is one of those things that is an inexorable and inevitable byproduct of social alienation under capitalism can't go away so it has to be dealt with and you can't cede the state's authority over violence because that's what allows a functioning market system to operate its security. As the first principle. I'm not gonna people aren't give a trade stuff unless they can be sure. They're going to be able to keep the proceeds and I can get ripped off. That's that's the basis so that's the kind of stuff when they say that it tells you that this is that there there is no reforming it and that is that's both sides of the observation that you know abolishing. The police of abolishing prisons are you know worth pursuing because they're radical and they're now radical in the sense that they're not compatible with capitalism. It's just a question of whether using that as the fulcrum is what's going to get you capitalism's defeat.

I don't think so but it's certainly an undigested ball demand and it'll be. It's. It's instructive to see what the what the offer what the counteroffer is caused by. De is essentially his role there essentially as a middleman between this big group of people who are disabled were alienated and pissed off about the status quo and capital. He is the middleman he says I'll talk to these people and then they come to an agreement. So whatever heard his terms are going to be the minimal terms at least of capital.

So I think that's why people are worried all of us about the the protests because because there are some things that are easier to accommodate that others by capitalism it's easier to do something like switch. The police from public to private or you know change prisons to rehab centers do something subtle that has the appearance of change that will only further reinforce capital's authoritarian control and the thing is the thing with that though is yeah of course that's a danger. There's always a danger you still have to pursue every avenue that is in front of you and those are the avenues in front of us right now. But that is the fear you know it's not totally. It's not totally bad faith. It's not totally justice attempt to to invalidate the the protests or to give oneself an excuse to not participate that is a real fear that's a real danger because you know there is an open question how much pressure is going to be applied before it starts to gutter out and how sophisticated the the attempt to co-opt and and recuperate the the the issue of police brutality and over policing at militarized policing increases too but yes. It's very funny hearing hearing pied and be like mandatory rehab okay so you gotta go. What is that they mean that means there's a guy with a gun comes to your house. He puts on handcuffs so you can't go away and then he makes you go into a building where you have to stay until you're done being rehabilitated. There's bars on the windows you can't go home like the prospect of hey how about people just do drugs and if they need help there you make it very very easy for them to get it like free and highly available and you allow people every point of contact possible with social services that could ameliorate their their addiction. How about that is that an idea sure but it's an idea that would require this massive public investment that the thin margins and the terminal crisis of capitalism aren't allowing. It.

People are asking about Matt Taibbi and I'm this is not a Bajoran. You can claim it as if you want but part of the grill pill for me is I mean I'm obviously on Twitter less than I used to be. I post less than I used to. I spent less time on my timeline that I've ever done and part of that is that I there I I refuse to follow certain stories. If I know I have to like make sure what's going on in a broad sense that I could talk about it on the show and hear. But there's stuff that I just on principle refuse to pursue and anything involving media like meta arguments. I don't care for not interesting to me irrelevant to me deck chair rearranging on the first order. You're talking about Canaries in the coal mine. But they're in their death throes banging their heads against the cage walls and each other accusing each other of being the reason that they're suffocating. But it's too late for them. So I can only claim that you know I think Matt's a pretty damn good reporter and a couple thing and the premise that there is a hysterical self-reinforcing ideology. Among the media class is unimpeachably true and anybody who's trying to pick a nitpick it without confronting the actual charge. I think is giving away the game. It's just that the thing is is that they would admit it. You put them under truth the truth truth eliezer. Most of these media people admit yeah of course. There is but the next phrase is. It's a good hide line.

It's a good consensus I love Big Brother. So I don't care that there is a very stifling hyped by consensus that is enforced on social media by members of the actual media people who can get fired basically the people who are have decided to make that place their break room and it's true. It exists but they don't want to even give that away because they haven't because they haven't proven to their interlocutors or the I'm looker that their priors are correct so they can't just say yeah but it's good. But that's what they mean and a lot of they are yelling at ie bein trying to nitpick specific points. It seems to me to be about avoiding that question like just say you you just say it's good don't act like it doesn't exist. Don't act like everybody in this media class whenever any issue comes up especially along very tense. Racial gender lines that you don't know instinctively what would get you in trouble if you said it and therefore even if you think it you wouldn't put it down. See they can't say that because in their the fiction the fiction of their their world nobody ever who is good has those thoughts no but they don't even think wrong thoughts.

It's not a question of enforcement they've fully assimilated it and of course they have because they're all insisting it to each other. They're all out the Mexican standoff. None of them can admit that they're not it because if they admit that the hey maybe sometimes I don't think this stuff and maybe I don't say this because of that they're out they broke the circle. They're done for that's obviously true. That's like but the thing is you can't talk about it because obviously nobody inside will say it because they're outside if they do and they can't. They don't listen to anybody outside because they can point to X Y or Z surrounding and distracting facts or bad associations to nullify the criticism. That's why it's an anti D electrical nightmare space and where you can't learn anything there because all anyone is doing is preserving their place within a hierarchy and it's the most fraught and it's the most hysterical and it's the most absurd of the media because they're literally have their jobs on the line. It's not just personal clout or like it is for a lot of us so of course. It's like. It's frenzy. I mean like David Graeber in debt talks about what other things that made the country stand or so cruel. So notably cruel in colonization and conquest of Latin America is that they were all basically debt peons of the crown or some debt and that's the same way with these media people.

They're more vicious and ferocious because their lives depend on it the lives they want anyway if they think they want and this is what I mean by a Shibboleth like they have to believe that everyone truly believes everything they say because the only way you can judge. Anyone is what they say because there's total bad faith. Assume do you assume everyone is out to get you or a Nazi or whatever unless they say the right words that means the words have to mean something that means you can't just say the words that not meaning them because that breaks the whole thing apart. It destroys the fantasy. It destroys the the like the ideological justification for its reinforcement psychic psychologically and so when someone says that well the good news is. They would only say it if they don't if they're not fully in the group right they would only say it if they've already been exorcised a little bit because then they don't have that to fear which means of course. They'd say that and so every response is just some version to get a load of this guy and you wonder well. Why would you even just say lol or this sucks. Why would you do that so that other people can say yeah to and you can remind them that you're on the right side and they can all remind each other in the comments that they're on the right side. Like that's why everybody brings up these people. They hate so that they can reinforce to the group that they're not that as wide as poisonous and absolutely enervating place to talk to anyone and you shouldn't do it. You should hang out with your friends. Twitter is for hanging out with your buddies and your friends I understand that Klout is the difference between life and death for many people. Now you know I understand that the difference between your GoFundMe succeeding and you getting chemotherapy and you're not getting it and you. Dying on the job is whether or not you have enough clout to get a GoFundMe. So it's life and death even for people who don't work in media but for people who work in media. It's even more immediate immediate.

So I've yet to seen anybody arguing like Nathan Robinson who it's like it's actually good. I mean he came the closest I guess to any of these people to have to just say it's actually good to have a stifling conformity of thought like that even though you're not enforcing it power that's the thing they think it's good because like any you know and it's true that like a communist or socialist state would have a reinforcing hegemonic cultural like standard that would be enforced through informal and formal channels and through manners and things. Like that of course it would exist but we don't live in that is just pounding into a base of pure hyper exploitation that's only getting worse that's that's that's that's the that's the firmament that your culture is banging on - so you're not prying at the bricks you're reinforcing them you're stamping them in even tighter - use a bunch of awful metaphors or other. Like all you're doing is alienating people from the idea that there could be an objective truth like you don't think people notice this. The way the Trump gets like treated by the meat you think there's nothing that the media has responsible for the reason that nobody like nobody who voted for Trump believes that kovat is even a real thing. Even though it's killed a hundred thousand people I mean obviously these are things that you're not always contributing to and they're gonna exist anyway but you make them worse. They've made them worse on purpose because they needed to signal it to each other that they were good people because of the the crisis. The American I'm a great American identity crisis provoked by Trump winning but yeah because but the thing is because the people who hate the media and say it's.

Media is one of the most easily analyzed categories of the cultural matrix when it comes to like Marxism like like that's what we need. People talk about the pace in the superstructure. Like the media is one of the absolute prime movers of creating a hegemonic ideology that means a capitalist ideology that means that the media is capitalist that there is no objective center that they're operating out of and so that there's this weird defensiveness towards the press that comes when it's attacked by the right and it's like I get that to an extent you know because they are are attacking them for saying things that are true you know or sometimes. But a lot of it is like they're mad at things that are true. Where's the Pope you should be mad at them for all the things that are false. But I think you end up in the long run doing more damage to the cause of breaking through these ideological blinders and then you know spreading socialism by a lying with the awful media against everybody. Say no the media sucks. It try to like reframe how it sucks because you can't get there. From here you can't go down and get get us we mean if the Sanders campaign didn't help prove that I don't know what would. But because we're in the media we have some media. People also are literally in like their jobs are abstracted to the plain of pure representation like their job is to represent what happened so. It's very easy for them to see the world as representation. But it's not experience that way. For most people who don't have that lifestyle you who actually work or even people who don't work but just don't spend all their time online and you have to get to those people. Some way I still don't know what way it is. But the share shift doesn't involve taking the side of the. Media when if the media is right you're wrong you know that like the way they frame things if the media is really an arbiter of reality with any kind of trustable guidelines. That way. Then you are wrong because the world that they tell is not the world where you see but no they're not they're lying.

I'm having the mint chocolate Soylent but had it like a head start. Like three times it's not good. I'm always trying sometimes. I'll try a new one just to see if it's different. But I'll have the same kind of yeah. There's an aftertaste. It's no bueno not for me. But hey dad. We don't have to have dinner maybe. I like a hard-boiled egg rather a soft-boiled egg. I do you like those more you got to get a little bit of gum. Somebody said the stock market is detached from the economy. I don't know maybe. It's replaced the economy. In some way you know the entire economy is is is on borrowed money. Like in every sense. I do hope that this Supreme Court decision today doesn't do what I think it's designed to do honestly which is reassure. Colicky liberals that the Supreme Court is a salvageable institution and I think that's John Roberts's job and I think every relatively liberal decision that Roberts issues is part of a strategic give-and-take where they give a little bit and almost always on social issues. If you'll notice very rarely on shape things like voting rights or corporate governance of regulation at all. So all the stuff that protects like the vital organs of capitalism and and the maintaining political power of capitalism through the Voting Rights stuff.

They're willing to give up anything else really within reason because they don't want to become so politicized that even the center of gravity on the Left moves so far that even regular Democrats have to essentially promise to pack the court or abolish it or something because they are vulnerable to that you know it would not be difficult to render the Supreme Court. Obsolete. Expanding the court does only requires two-thirds of I believe two-thirds of the Senate and you might say oh that they'll never get that but hey if things get bad enough and they get their together as a party. They could you know it's not impossible and they want to make sure it never happens. They want to be sure that when they're a lever a liberal government gets back in and starts doing things like trying to do Medicare for all they cut it off. They stop that that invasion of state oversight and state management into the economy and that only happens because they tampered people. They tempered people's frustration with the court as an institution with the strategic handoff of certain things because it's not really the skin off of the ass of any corporate power that that they've extended title the Civil Rights Act that way and as everybody has pointed out as long as you have at will employment.

Every state allows you to fire people for being gay. You just have to be not a bunch of enough of an idiot to leave a paper trail or evidence that you that that's why you did it so that could be indicated in court because otherwise there's no case. If you just say you're fired. They can't do anything but now you how many how many articles are we. Gonna get about Wow Roberts and Korsak surprised again. What are we seeing a moderation on the court which gives more leeway to every liberal who wants to say no no. The Supreme Court is a vital part of our institutional framework of checks and balances and remember Earl Warren. He was cool I say make the Supreme Court the size of major league baseball and instead of deciding things. They just play baseball games and then like they can assign winners and losers to the cases based on who won the game it doesn't matter. It's not connected to anything what are you even why are you here how did you get here. Marshall you. In the Constitution presumes a nonpartisan nature that democratic governance is basically incapable of ever producing because you never have totally unified class interests in a country that styles itself a democracy even within the capital class. It's absurd because there are different industries with different desires.

There's a city in the country the gentry and the Indian and the early merchants they're always there I mean my god. These guys came from England England. I already had a civil war which even if they might have remembered at this being above. Religion was really driven by the growing economic conflict between the urban centers. The merchants trade based urban centers of England dominated by the Puritans and the landed gentry of like post feudal land holders who were the Tories the Cavaliers because Protestantism corresponds with degree of economic complexity in Europe and then in the United States because your Protestant isn't needed to be able to fit into your pocketbook. It had to be small enough to fit in the pocketbook and that means it had to be like based on very few simple concepts and that made it hostile to things like icons. Things like cathedrals. Things like pure ecclesiastical bureaucracy. You needed to be sit around a table with your stupid bowl cut because the rest of your body and mind were devoted to making money the Langer and the can the godly presence of all the religions of the medieval religion a medieval Christianity.

There's no place you have you're moving too fast. You've got too much to do. You've got too much energy to devote to the material world and reproducing wealth. So you your religion has to fit into a little lobe in your brain. One book one chair one outfit. Yes.

It was also started due to the colonization of Ireland as it was a classic over at crisis of overextension. The same way the French Revolution was because remember so the fret of the English Civil War started. When the King needed money to fight Ireland. After the I'll or Irish revolt France had to call the Estates General because of all the money he'd spent fighting England and in the American Revolution. In both cases it was an attempt to extend or maintain imperial expansion producing a crisis between the two classes of actual like tax like sources of Taxation the land and and trade. What is this I was saying something I've forget what I was saying about ramp gate. I mean for me. The ramp is never the thing with Trump. The ramp is very funny but the thing to me the Trump to give away from me to Trump which he also did. During that speech is this when he has to. He asked to use two hands to drink because you should never need two hands to drink. It's really easy looking and it is a sign of neurological degeneration because the gears are starting to slip and it takes too much like neural dexterity like hand-eye coordination and microtransactions to guide a liquid in your mouth without fearing like a failure and you need it hand you need a hand so something's wrong something's wrong with Trump II. But that's been true for a while.

I just don't think you might have mad cow disease. Honestly. The guy eats a lot of beef and it's not like. He stopped in the late 90s when there was the Parkins. There were that Parkinson's when there was the mad cow outbreak and he loves going to Scotland which is basically just a giant island made out of prions tertiary. Syphilis is funny. I love the idea that his doctor knew he had syphilis but he knew he didn't like hearing. Bad things about himself so he never got around to telling him just cuz. Oh God cuz or he told him. He didn't believe him no no way. There's no way. I have the best blood. There's no way I've got some lists. It's gross. It's disgusting. I would have syphilis yeah. I can't believe that too because how many times can you tell it but it'll just eventually you just got to give up especially since he probably didn't pay you. It's like have his brain turn into a melting snow cone.

Syriana is a great movie one of the better iraq war era movies. I would put up there at the top really good. Actually. I mean it gets I know it got criticized for being too kind of 70s hard on a sleeve lefty and that it's too simplifying but and yeah. Like the story of you know the good westernizing Sheik who gets blown up by a drone because he wants to sell oil to China or something. It's a little too just so but it gets at the reality of America's role in the region. Much better than anything I can imagine. It's it. It starts in the right place and that it function it's like Washington is the is the fulcrum here everything moves along that axis because it has become the strategic and like tactical battle space as they like to talk of it where you know because America's economy is promised on petrol dollars therefore control strategically and tactically of little significant oil production places is essentially it is national security when they say that they're not lying at least the state as it exists. Now. So the oil is still cheap Iselle cheaper than milk. I think get yourself some oil get yourself a nice frosty mug of oil down at the old citko - two bits two bits a gander what happened to a palma game. You just you watch.

Obama gate ain't going away folks. That's a promise. No people are fighting about the Marquis de Lafayette. In my men. She's gosh the men. She's I can't handle. All know Obama gate was just. It was just spy gate. That was the same thing it was the idea that Obama had spied on Trump Watergate style by having the FBI look into I think Michael Floyd and Paul Manafort. That's the premise and the thing is if it's true. They did a really shitty job well. You could say it's like Watergate but the real difference is forget all that other was on tape saying let's obstruct Young Justice and not in a I'm. Gonna make a quid pro quo over the airway in a I'm going to give these guys a suitcase of a million dollars and illegally raised slush fund campaign money and you got to do wonder what had happened if you just. It's kind of adorable when you look back at Watergate and you look back the way it was portrayed and media and the way it was talked about. It was pretty wild.

There were people who supported Nixon all the way though Ronald Reagan was primed among them. He was one of the most prominent Republicans who never turned on because famously the thing that made Nixon decide finally to resign was Barry Goldwater coming to the White House and saying it's over sir but Reagan never. Lost lost faith God Hillary Dorson eliot engel is so good she's just she can't not be the worst. She can't not do the worst and be the worst did every moment of her life. It's I don't know if she's trolling at this point if she knows what she's doing it's kind of impressive. She's.

She's an a have like figure and we are at this point the Whale and she's trying to destroy us that's actually brings me to something I wanted to do so. I finish Moby Dick again and it is great. It's better than its reputation. It is not a classic. It is a vibrant brilliant piece of work one of the most deal like spiritually of theological II interesting and I think evocative books I've ever read and I do want to read blood meridian next just to feel that it's like the BLT the cold side of the hot side the desert side of the and the water side. But I wanted to read here the last my favorite chapter of the book which is the last chapter before they spot Moby Dick and you decide in the go for the chasing and it's Starbuck is talking to a hab and he almost convinces him to give up the chase the symphony it was a clear steel blue day.

The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable and that in that all-pervading Azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a woman's look and the robust and man-like sea heave with long strong lingering swells as Samson's chest in his sleep hither and thither on high glided the snow-white wings of small unspecial birds. These were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro and the deeps far down in the bottomless. Blue rushed mighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinking's of the masculine sea but though thus constrast II was in the contrast was only in shades and shadows without those two seemed one. It was only the sex as it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar and King the Sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon. A soft and tremulous ant motion more seen here at the equator denoted the fond throbbing thrust. The loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away we'll horny.

I think we can all agree tied up and twisted oh dear gnarled and nodded with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glowed in the ashes of ruin. Unn tottering Ahab stood forth the clearness of the moon lifting his splintered helmet of a brow. The fair girls forehead of heaven Oh a mortal infancy and an infancy of the azure. An innocence II have put up sorry Oh a mortal infancy and innocency of the observe invisible wing of creatures at frolic all round a sweet childhood of hair and sky how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's clothes coiled. Colima clothes coiled whoa but some of I seen little. Myrrh Miriam and Martha laughing I D elves heedlessly gamble around their old sire sporting with the circle of singing locks which grew on the Marge Marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle. They have leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the salt in the water sank and sank to his gaze and more and more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did. It last seemed to dispel for a moment the cantankerous thing as soul that glad happy air that winsome. Sky did it last stroke and caress him. The stepmother world so long cool forbidding now through affectionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save at the bless from beneath his slouched hat. A have dropped a tear to the ski into the sea.

Nor did all of the Pacific contain such wealth is that one we drop. Starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear his own true heart. The measureless sobbing that stole out of the center of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him. He yet drew near to him and stood there. Mayhaps turned Starbuck sir Oh Starbuck. It is a mild mild wind at a mild looking sky on such a day very much such a sweetness. As this I struck my first whale a boy harpooner eighteen forty forty forty years ago ago forty years of continual whaling 40 years of privation and peril and storm time forty years on the piddle to see for forty years as a hab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep I in yes Starbucks. Out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore. What I think of this life I have led the desolation of solitude. It has been the mist masoned walled town of a captain's exclusiveness which admits but small entrance to any sympathy for the green country without a weariness heaviness Guinea coast slavery of solitary command. When I think of all this only half suspected that's so keenly known to me before and how for 40 years I have fed upon dry salted fair fit emblem of the dried nourishment of my soul when the poorest Landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand and broken the world's fresh bread to my moldy crusts away whole oceans for that young woman-girl wife. I went in past fifty and sailed for Cape Horn the next day leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow wife wife rather a widow with her husband alive.

I widowed that poor girl when I married or Starbuck and then the this madness the frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously foaming Li chased his prey more a demon than a man. I I what 40 years fool fool o fool. His old a have been by this strife of the chase why wherein palsy the arms of the or and the iron of the Lance how the richer or better as they have now behold old Starbuck. It is not hard that with this weary load I pair one poor leg should have been snatched out from under me. Here brush this old hair aside binds me. It blinds me that I seem to weep locks oh great never grow but from one out of ashes. But do I look very old so very very old. Starbuck I feel deathly fate bowed and humped and so I were Adam staggering beneath the piled century. Since paradise God God God cracked my heart stave my brain mockery mockery bitter biting mockery. Gray hairs have I lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel the sand tolerably. Old clothes stand close to me. Starbuck let me look into a human eye. It is better than to gaze into sea or sky better than to gaze upon God by the green land by the brights hearthstone. This is the magic glass man I see my wife and my child in night.

I know no. Stay on board and on board no or not what I do when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick that hazard shall not be 9. No no not with their away home. I see in that I owe my captain my captain noble soul grant bold heart after all why should anyone give chase to that hated fish away with me. Let us fly. These deadly waters let us home wife and child to our Starbucks wife. A child of his brotherly sisterly play fellow youth even as nine Sarah. The wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let us away. This instant let us alter the course how cheerily how hilariously oh my captain would be blow. Wow on our way to see all that non tucking again. I think sirrah they have such smiled blue days even as this in man tuck it. They have they have I have seen them some summer days of the morning. About this time. Yes it is his new nap. Now the boy vivaciously wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of cannibal old man. How I bored how I abhorred upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again which is my Mary my Mary herself. She promised that my boy every morning should be carried to the hill to carry the first glimpse of his father sail. Yes yes no more. It is done. We head for Nantucket come my captain's studying out the course and led us away. See see the police face from the window. The police hand on the hill but I have glanced was averted like a blighted fruit tree.

He shook and cast his lasts endured Apple to the soil. What is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and the cruel remorseless. Emperor commands me that against all natural Lovings and longings I so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself and all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart I Durst not so much as there is a hab a hab is it I God or who that lifts this arm but if the great Sun moved not of himself but it is an errand boy in heaven. Nor one single star can resolve that by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat. This one small brain think thoughts unless God does that beating does that thinking does that living in that I by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world. Like Yanis went like wandering endless by heaven man. We are turned round and round in this world. Like yonder wind.

Less and fate is the hand spike and all the time lo that smiling sky that was unsounded seed. Look see on albacore who puts him in who puts it into him - who was to do when that judge himself is dragged to the bar. I'm sorry look see on albacore who put it into him to chase and Fang that flying fish where do murderers go man whose to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar. But it is a mild mild wind in a mild looking sky. The air smells now as if blue from a far-off meadow. They have been awake making hay somewhere under the slope of the Andes Starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the new moon pay sleeping I toil. We must me way we all sleep at last in the field sleep I and rust a bits cut. Green green grass as last year sighs flung down and left in the Hat. Cuffs swaths Starbuck but Blanche to a corpses hue with despair. The mate had stolen away a hub cross the deck to gaze over on the other side but stared at to reflected fixed eyes in the water there.

Fidella was motionless Lee leaning over the same rail a hab needed to grill at the end of the day a hab needed to chill and to grill that was what he needed. He needed to turn that whale bone leg into some sort of snap open grilling contraption and have himself a good time on the deck of the Pequod have himself a hoot and a half with a jug. Maybe that's what I do I already kind of have the Ahab situation that I have a leg that is completely numb so it feels the way that a ABS like would feel like it's. It's it's tingling because of my spinal injury. So I have the phantom pain. But it's just there's a leg there which is better. I must say because I can use it but yeah. I have that I never decided to go kill a giant majestic whale over it weirdo. But I can't say it definitely affected my life in a lot of ways kind of limited me for a long time and traumatized me in ways. I wasn't able to recognize at the time but that's what life is for to work that out because everybody's got something I want to do yoga but like I said I'm kind of disabled. I mean like a disabled yoga I might start doing that something you can do from a chair or something I guess yeah. What would mean what my white whale be I guess the Democratic Party maybe from hell's heart. I stab at thee for hates sake I Spit my last breath at thee. I mean I'm trying to get rid of vengeance as a as a motivator.

But they are certainly an institution that needs to be destroyed. Democrat Oda Linda s no question. I mean yes capitalism but you know it's like bin. Laden talks about with the near and the far enemy. The Democrats that are actually within striking distance. In some way. Capitalism is a bit far off of course that might not stay the same I mean we honestly could be in a freefall in which case party politics is. Gonna take a backseat to anything else pretty quickly.

But some people I don't know like I've I have no idea. We really are in a you know in a in a wonderland of black swans. Black swans are an out everywhere. We're definitely in the cool zone. There's no question about that like one of the big things that's gonna. That's the big I honestly think the biggest x-factor that nobody's really talking about because it's too terrifying is how bad is uncontrolled kovat gonna be because it's hitting. We're gonna be hitting uncontrolled levels because nobody's gonna be able to get everybody back indoors again and does that cause so. Much sickness does that overburden the medical system so much that critical infrastructure can't be maintained. That's the question that I think is absolutely open and we're not gonna know that for a couple months and that is why August is going to probably be the most important month maybe in American history because that's what all the money that has been going out goes away all the federal cash. That's also when I think fictions go back into effect and it will be when the the first wave of fully developed nation wide almost freely transmitted Corona is going to be hitting the economy that's going to be a spicy spicy meatball and I have no idea what the answer is. Because those variables are still two up in the air. I don't know enough about the epidemiology for one thing but it's pretty scary.

I am fairly confident though that one the money side anyway that they will end up extending unemployment insurance and like that because I mean the fact that minuchin said they're not going to do it. They're not gonna say it they're gonna say they're not gonna do it until the moment they do it. They're gonna say we're not gonna do it until a minute before they put in into the Senate because they want it to never be seen as something people can take for granted. They never wanted to be seen as a new entitlement so it has to be an emergency outlay and the only way to emphasize the emergency nature and the fact that you're doing it on your own terms and not being demanded of it. You're not giving in to Anam and you're doing it because you've decided to do it because look it was gonna pass you didn't you didn't make us do this. We did it on our terms because it was necessary that means it's not gonna be there again if we don't think that's necessary. It's ah we so. I think that's still going to happen because if it doesn't that's more hassle than it's worth I mean at that point you have to really do believe George Soros is trying to bring about an actual collapse of the America America for some weird protocols reason if there is anything like a capitalist class with a self-interest that it can execute it will it would not want that to happen and it would have the means most importantly to prevent it in the form of big cash payments.

But the X Factor then like I said is what if everybody's too sick to spend the money or work in the jobs. That's the question see the cruelty and the point thing to me. I think that that can be a misleading catchphrase. I think it has certain applicability to Republican policy and rhetoric because that has the benefit of appealing to their base in the political realm but the cruelty is not the point of capitalism. Profit is the motive pride of capitalist cruelty is the inevitable main byproduct of profit but it is not what it is seeking. It's the effect not the cause. It's the fumes not the oil and of course that makes capitalist crueler and crueler and crueler because you have to be cruel to execute that kind of monstrosity. But you're just you're serving the logic of the system because capitalism. Inevitably the the capitalist singularity is which is the one in which all humanity is subverted to machine logic. All humans reduced to machine organisms of GI geo of stimulus response with no species being left and you got to say though if humans were that then there wouldn't no be there would be no more cruelty at all. The end state would have no cruelty because machines aren't. I mean our machines can you be cruel to a machine. You can't so the very final end state of techno capitalism. If it ever were to comment before the system collapse it would be cruelty free. It would be like a cage free farm fresh egg or a free-range chicken because you can't be cruel to machinery. That's what we'd be at the final end state of capitalism. No more capable of being being hurt than a transistor radio.

Yeah. I think that's Nick land and I think that's a classic example of deluding yourself to try to cope like you see the trajectory and you say actually it's good. Instead of this has to not be what we end up with and we have to do anything. We can to stop it no matter how cringe it is or how dissatisfied it makes us. As we watch reality. We turn into hyper reality in front of our faces. I really don't think it's I don't I think I think saying that it's cruel on purpose is reversing the order of operation. All the ideological formation is around the things that are required of the system. Its justifying a system that you're maintaining so yeah capitalism hurts poor people warm. It hurts people of color more. It hurts vulnerable communities more here's some digitus communities more that's because those are the people who are because of their position in the economy that is their role to play and a carrot is aligned. It's reproduced by culture but like the sum total of misery and exploitation is is the byproduct of the machinery and that means that people operate the machinery over time grow cruel grow and are selected to be people who find those people disgusting and under them so that they're happy carrying this stuff out instead of sad but it's got to get carried out either way see what yes like capitalism. The allure of it is all the psychic benefit oh you get to push around little guys and you get to do all this stuff.

But that's just about how it that's how it recruits people to do its bidding. It's it's. It's a pheromone mist for sociopaths the way that like there's that parasite that gets into the brain of the mouse to make it not afraid of the cat. This machine is the thing moving the machine is doing it. It just needs people to actually carry it out and those people then have certain values that make what they do okay to themselves and then that creates cultural super structures that justify it to everybody else. So what you're describing that pleasure that cruelty that is a big part of capitalist practice that is the end result of a system that selects for it. And so that's when you have to ask things like will they bail us out before the entire economy collapses in all the mutton. All the fantasy numbers on the boards all those fake numbers and those servers that is the sum total of wealth on this country. Mean nothing like somebody tripped over a cord and the power went out and all that went away. Do you think they want that they're not that liquid yet. I think they're in the process of trying to get to fully quiddity honestly and you can argue like my whole conspiracy. About this account. This whole koba thing and then the the short the George Floyd protest is a like. It controlled opted to short sell the economy and get liquid. So you'd be able to have long term investment in a like a post-crisis world. But they're not that liquid yet the money's still all made up.

It's still still on Ledger's. It's gotta get turned into real infrastructure and they haven't done it yet to my knowledge unless there's like unless there's way more space colonization than they say or. There's a Hollow Earth or something I don't think they're there yet so they're gonna want to keep the numbers meaning something even though it'll make fewer people suffer that's not the point the point is keeping the numbers to mean something well. Hollow Earth is least acknowledges that the world is round so it has that over Flat Earth Oh Thurlow weed is awesome. There no Thurlow weed as a base. It's sort of like a Karl Rove type figure.

He was a roving political operative. One of those guys in early America who looked around the village said I don't want to stand behind a donkey my whole life. I'm gonna make it to the big city and see what I could make it myself you know because basically anybody who could read one book that wasn't. The Bible would be able to get a job and if it was the Bible you could get a job as a preacher like Abraham Lincoln read a book became a lawyer. They're loyal through a little weed ran out and said hey everyone here is an insane fanatic in upstate New York which was true the burned-over district they called it. It was the heart of the Second Great Awakening and the house of the home of the Mormon where Joseph Smith found the plates homo Mormonism and he found it in the fertile soil. It was ferment of like anxiety with the shifting economy of the the new merchants I'll State and that's why he helped found the anti-masonic party and helped run it to Congress. They actually had a bunch of congressmen which is pretty impressive. I'm just a just a platform of not liking Masons but then they got folded into the Whigs first to know nothingness and then that wakes and Thurlow weed ended up becoming like the chief adviser to William Seward.

Mormonism is fascinating I would like to talk more vulgar isms. I appreciate it because it's one of the it's the obviously. It's the one religion that acknowledged the need to Americanize Christianity and it was the first to do that. But then it was that happened to the second. In the 20th century. With like evangelicalism. I created a new that Americanized Christianity - that's a two-step process but of course because the Mormons broke off earlier they're better. That's why I Felix is very very correct that Mormons are who heave Angelico's think they are. They think we're a good Christian. We're a good Christian family with good values. It's reflecting and we're blessed by God. It's like you have a house with like 15 mortgages on it. A a online porn addiction that has seen you go to the hospital of dick abrasions like three children all addicted to different drugs. They steal out of your cupboard and a job you know selling used jet skis - like military officers whereas the Mormons are all living in five million square foot homes with 15 children and jobs. The guy has a job is a like a marketing guy like the company that takes the swear words out of movies and all the wives all have multi-level marketing schemes where they get together.

Their child finished basements and sell each other. That's that's the dream. That's what the evangelists think they are and they're just a bunch of dumb. Hicks Scientology ISM is like a 20th century attempt to take that same need for an American religion and to adapt it to the time and the time their being. The the the post-nuclear moment where God really did die like God God obviously was on the table for a while but I think it was World War two to really put the bullet his head especially in the United States and and that nuclear era created this like whole does god-sized hole that he could fill and it would have needed. I mean it's called Scientology for a reason because that was an era where faith was being directed at supersonic speed almost from from God and from the spiritual realm to the technological where where all the faith now rested in science.

So another world class hustler. Another another true pimp of the spiritual hustle. My man Elrond all right guys. I'm gonna go gonna try to do more. This week maybe once a week or not try to do another one tomorrow anyway. Bye bye.
