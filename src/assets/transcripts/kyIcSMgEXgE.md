It's finally doing it by the way. I saw someone in the chat. I was on a roll so I forgot to mention at the time but it just occurred to me I saw somebody was saying that like the quality of these streams is very poor audio visually and that that's chris's fault. I would like to say definitively and for all of time that chris has nothing to do with this production. This is a one-man show when I'm out here and I hope you will notice that the audio and video presentation are much much better when we're in the office with them. This is my show wade. This is my deal here so that means if it's if it looks like. That's part of my ramshackle approach to everything I'm doing here.

I mean if I was serious about like trying to communicate an idea to people. I would sorry. I just got text to distract me. I'm on my damn phone here but yeah. I I if I was being serious about communicating ideas to people. I would write them down or something. I'd give them some thought instead of. Just say them off the top of my head and I would also if. I was going to you know talk to you. I'd like prepare it ahead of time and get a studio or something where it looks nice. And it's presentable and like some degree of You know thought has been put into it. I think like this whole deal with the bad audio and me talking to my phone. I think it it is part of like honesty. Honestly. It is a part of me presenting like an entire picture of what I'm doing out here so that you don't get the wrong idea you know although I do hope to write in the future. I have plans to do so in the early stages of doing planning for writing something down something a little more. Fully fleshed out so and that will be something that I'll be very nervous to put out there because one of the benefits of doing this is that you you risk that you don't risk that like that fear of dissection that comes when you have something written down. I know that that has in the past made me hesitant about writing but I feel now like. I'm much more confident in what I'm saying than I ever have been so as a result. I feel. I can put it down and people will get mad hopefully. People will be disagreeing but people say I'm an idiot and wrong hopefully if they don't then I up. But I will be confident that I at least got across what I was trying to man did anybody.

See trump. Today. You just went on tv for five minutes to say we're gonna get a vaccine folks. It's coming the next scene's coming. We're gonna get it and we wantedly love it. We love the vaccine. It's the best. It's the greatest everyone's going to be cured and our elderly. We love the elderly we love our emily. They're going to get it first because we care about them and we want to give them the best of the golden years. The years the gold they love them so yeah whatever. I don't know april. He's maybe we'll see. I mean nothing about the process until now has inspired any confidence in any element of the entire. Response and not just trump specifically but the entire western world the entire atlantic sphere comprehensive. Everything that everything that was actually that was built by us in the aftermath of world war ii our like score is single-minded profit-seeking idiots of the pharmaceutical industry yeah. How are we going to distribute the vaccine what you honestly they should give it to. Country have them give us the send. A goddamn vaccine out the speedy method as the mcdonald brothers coined it by the way that reminds me. The master with michael keaton is a low-key really good movie and his performance is really fun in it but what really is interesting and a reason to watch. It is the way that it very clearly shows the the way that capitalism accelerates outside of any other considerations like that nothing that like I've seen very few movies that are better at exemplifying the marxist. The marx quote from the manifesto that describes capitalism's destabilizing relationship to settle to social orders. Everything that is solid melts into air and you watch that movie and that's what you get because the mcdonald brothers did this. They had this like innovation that was a quantum leap in efficiency in terms of food service. This is gonna like you know that's that changes the the entire equation of the profit. The potential profit in food service but they did that in their small town new england way you know like a couple of flinty yankee republicans coming up with an idea but they were doing that at a time when capitalism was accelerating the post-war era where where we're where all that capital was looking for investment that we were we were building out a new infrastructure of like consumer demand and their their commitment to things like we're not we're only gonna use real ice cream and you know well. We're gonna you know. We're gonna keep up a quality control over certain elements of this thing. We're going to maintain certain like non-market based values and they did well with their little thing but as soon as ray kroc showed up a guy who because he was a failure basically because he'd been chasing success.

His entire life had been ground into this like purely miserable instrument of regret and resentment. He came along and he just wanted to fill that hole as fast as he could because he was an old guy when it happens he he'd been like he was a he was in his 50s and he had never been a success. Even though he tried his goddamn ass off to be one and so he wanted to fill that hole the only way he could you know of course. This is just the This is a dramatic you know personalized version of like the greater material. You know necessity. That's gonna make that happen one way or another like. Mcdonald's gets bought and gets turned into mcdonald's no matter what but the fact that it was ray kroc who did it comes down to you know who ray kroc was but someone was gonna do it and then his wife gave that that money to npr. Perfect he was a funny dude though in other ways one thing they don't have in the movie because it stops like after he rests the name away from the mcdonald brothers.

Spoiler alert is that he owned the san diego padres in the 70s and 80s and at one time he was watching a game in the owner's box and they were get getting their asses kicked so bad that he went on the pa system in the stadium and apologized to the fans for how bad they were doing padres. He lived in san diego. He would also go to mcdonald's like just on inspection tours and start sweeping up and yell at people for not doing enough not doing enough cleaning. But someone got mad at us today chapo's for for again for not taking the coup seriously. I'm sorry but if you saw if you saw trump today. I don't think you can seriously say anything about that anymore he looked gassed and he didn't say anything about this election that he had that he thinks was stolen from him and that he says he's fighting and you know. I was very unfair with what cuomo said he said. I was a coveted cuckoo. It may be sad it's a covered koopa. It's a covent cuckoo folks and we love it. He said the next administration oh right. I forgot. He's cooked.

He's done. He's finished you know like the the he only really had four years in him honestly. I think one way or the other because he didn't like any moment of it and he and what he had to do to enjoy. Any of it was so strenuous and and required such a escalation of tension that you know his heart couldn't take that much of it biden impression ah come on man ah you know yeah. Felix is the guy who does bite he has biden down look look look look fat look god what a man what a king he did that and then he said that he said go vote for trump to somebody. He said go vote to You guys go suck an egg to basically anybody who asked him to have any position that was you know more that didn't have the like the 1996 dlc stamp of approval on it and he would say off suck.

[11:00](https://youtu.be/kyIcSMgEXgE?t=11m00s)

My dog threatened to punch some guy who talked to him about guns in. Michigan just didn't matter just didn't matter and what that tells me more than anything is that you know there's this spectacle of politics happening and then there's the actual thing of people voting. And I think that I mean I've been saying there's not. I don't think that there's anything like a one-to-one like this is not in any way a reflection. This is a distortion so severe that it is genuinely maddening in the sense that it takes your mind away from a consensus reality between people in a lived environment as opposed to within the individual frictionless silo of your cyber life which is what allows you to imagine that because you never come into contact with any real thing you can just argue all day and that's why you're there anyway you can never have like a presumption defeated by the internet. You can never have your your automatic response to something that is counterproductive corrected. That's what real life is for so. This thing is just completely off the rails and so I'm not sure that any of the stuff that we ever thought mattered really did.

I think we're talking about like tectonic relationships between like big demographic slabs of people and the reason. I say that the future of the republican party if this continues like you know in its trajectory like trump boosted. This was happening since 2000 but it really got accelerated by trump being that showing up and being the nominee and winning and shaping the culture in response to obama like obama was like the thesis basically of like what the party system would be in the 21st century. Now that we were reforming society's economy again because if we talk about the 1970s as the moment when the relationship between the working class and the democratic party suffered the the crash was the severance of the democratic party from humanity like the full and complete abnegation of responsibility to citizenry and I know that that's all you know flummery and culture. But it's like stuff that the people in these positions actually believe exists. It was the 70s. It started in the 60s but the the weak correction of the economy. The breaking of the back of inflation didn't happen until the 70s. What are you talking about that's that's just incorrect. I mean don't try to limb people throwing bones under my feet good lord. It was carter man. Carter did it like it was all obviously. It was a crescendo and it involved actions by every administration leading up to it. But the one who had the decision to make was carter and the one who had the decision to make in a similar environment was obama and because there was no working class to be at the table to just speak for the people.

At all. They did a further re bipartisan re affirmation of the economy and a further removing from the political of any economic question again just like they did in the 70s the bailout the bipartisan bailout which republicans pretended to be against which helped create the shadow tea party. This like fake opposition to the bailouts which had no extension into any real depths of the party leadership or honestly it's voters if they understood the questions beyond just as as shibboleths and then they got turned into culture war. Like the tea party war. Cry was rick santelli on cnbc saying that they didn't want to pay for losers to get bailed out of their. Mortgages now there's a world where that happens no matter what right like where as a response to this like action by the government of letting people stay in their homes and voiding their debt and like making making the haircut come from finance rather than the citizen right Then you would have had like this fake fake populist response to it. This like jeffersonian jacksonian cloaked horseshit like that there's a reason they talked. They called themselves the tea party. Like this. This is a violation of american liberty and the thing is yeah. It is because american liberty exists to prevent this kind of thing from happening.

It's like an ideological and political structure meant to harness like the citizenry and any understanding of the concept and prevent them from getting rid of the thing around their neck and there are enough people who have like bought into the you know last 200 years of like phony populism that's at the heart of that jeffersonian project and so they would buy into it and there you would have had a real meaningful conflict and I guarantee you that this election if that had happened would not be about antifa or any of that. We'd be talking about industrial policy maybe but of course like I said this is a world where obama doesn't do that. But that was not the world we lived in because the working class wasn't at the table. Obama was never going to do that couldn't have happened he was evil for doing it but someone was going to do it because the forces arrayed could have no other outcome. But I'm saying if we lived in a world where that had a different outcome for some reason. Otherwise we have the same and I know this is why these are you know tedious because you have to do so many what ifs that you eventually the comparison doesn't hold. I'm just saying that that what we ended up getting instead was this fake populist uprising against the the death of american liberty. But then they didn't actually bail out anybody from their mortgages. The thing that got the tea party going bailing out losers didn't end up even happening it got turned. It got evidenced immediately into a culture war.

The thing that romney talked about the makers and the takers because taxes became the only thing that the government could do about anything what about the keynesian stimulus. I mean it was the bare minimum necessary to to put a floor on the american economy which had to happen like a demand floor had to be opposed for the good of the market and that was what they did but on the stingiest possible terms and that was because obama bid low on purpose because they thought well. Olympia snowden has this aversion to anything over a trillion dollars there's no reason a rationality behind that that is pure just pig-headed political idiocy. They could have been at four and then what's she gonna say nothing over two like. It's just arbitrary relative to the bid and the bid was low on purpose and it was almost all found in the form of tax cuts and rebates now. I don't think it's that this response the well. The thing is with the senate the way it is. It's honestly hard to say we really could end up with something as bad as the 09 stimulus because that was because I think the the scale of the problem is in this case deeper but and and but also the answer is easier like you really could solve a lot of this just by helicopter. Dumping money on people like it could have a hugely positive effect and we know that money is free at this point like everybody knows it and of course. The republicans are going to talk about the deficit more now than they did under trump which was not never at all because that's their ideological like you know puppet to distract from the fact that what they really want to do at any moment is prevent spending from being directed downward so like. I said I'm not predicting anything anymore. But it's not going to be great because the working there's nobody at that table but lizards man absolute demons people who have shed every human skin.

They've ever had and replaced it with a diamond hard scaly plate I haven't stared at the chat for a while. I don't think I got new glasses. I'm just I'm still getting used to them. I don't know they stay. I'm still not used to the look so I kind of like see myself and I think whoa what oh thank you.

[20:29](https://youtu.be/kyIcSMgEXgE?t=20m29s)

But the thing is like you cannot overestimate how demonic this is going to be. A friend of mine has been asked by the state of pennsylvania to give them back 12 000 dollars in unemployment that they say he fraudulently claimed when in fact he had literally like mis filled out a form that he then fixed because apparently there's a company that like 40 states paid millions of dollars to to carry out their emergency unemployment system because of course the state. The state mechanisms are intentionally deprived of funds so that they are rickety and impossible of abra springing into action so that gaining relief is difficult. You want to make as many hoops as possible for people to jump through so that you make them have to have skin in the game oh that's disgusting like skin like skinner mindset that pervades among the liberal bureaucratic. You know policy set and now the state because there's no there has been no step in stimulus. There has not been a big federal relief of state budgets because states can't borrow the way that the federal government can so you're going to see massive massive budget funds because basically the complete skeletonization of the whole state apparatus at a time of national pandemic emergency so they're trying to claw money back and apparently they're doing it.

Just me. They're sending checks to millions of people and a lot of it is on false false. False claims in the first place and the horror of it is is that I honestly think they don't even care if they have specious reasoning or not. They think a lot of people are going to get that freak out and then just give them back some money and if they get any x number of them to do that well. That's that's that much more money you can put on the ledger and then they probably end up charging them more money than they're getting back to do the job monstrous and it must be stated. This is a government with that's a state with a democratic governor.

This is this is just the way it is now like pain for everybody and then you get to choose whose pain you get to feel good about when you get in the voting booth and then watch politics is the sport that it is you get to root for a team of people to inflict pain. On another team of people. The pain is taken for granted and the real horror is even the people getting it are going to get it either way everyone's getting it. It's really just a matter of who you in the observation of their pain get to feel superior to get to feel luckier than that's it. That's politics. That's the politics at the end of history and that's why I think the parties are going to end up being college and no college not going there but embracing the set of values because the whole thing is it's symmetrical sadisms. Like there is a sadism at the heart of like the the liberal project. I'm sorry there is a sadism at the heart even if you can say it's for better reasons and it's more justified for for like the the punitiveness of liberalism as it's understood by the people who vote for political parties who either accept or reject its idea and so the future of politics is choosing who you want to cease punished who you want to feel good about being punished anyway and the ski and that like 

It's quite it's quite sobering to think about because there's very little leeway for for humanity there like everyone's worst instincts are the only ones being fed because the parties will basically become incapable of addressing class issues and for anybody who is actually making this idiot track towards the republican party just so that they can feel good about an election. Like the people who are like going well. The democrats are too woke. Working-class people are voting republican. Now that's where working-class aspirations can be found. No what's happening is you are totally invested in the spectacle of politics it is sports for you.

The pain of your enemy is your supper but now thanks to your your in your mind defeat in the civil war. Within the democratic side. You now have to find a new place where you can feel good about somebody else's pain and so you can go root for the republicans and that means if they win and the democrats lose you get to feel better whereas if you're on the democrat side and you've been beaten for like internal. You know for your sense of identification like you can't even identify as a democrat anymore because or as a liberal or a leftist whatever word you're using to cover this identity you can't imagine. You can't call yourself that anymore because the people that other people who do have ruined it. So then you can't just watch the spectacle and not have an invent an investment because then it would be robbed of a center of its ability to keep you enthralled and you'd have to do something else and you don't want to do anything else.

So what do you do you switch teams. They switch teams can't beat them join them and then you get to feel good again. You get to watch. The democrats get owned and feel good about it. Like you used to do it for republicans or internally what like for a while you can do it with democrats but after let's essentially you spend four years watching the trump people have too much fun and now you want some fun. If none of it matters and that's true then you might as well have some fun and I would say well okay but even better to not get fun there at all because it's sick place to get fun what are you doing what the are you doing literally do anything else with your time.

[27:27](https://youtu.be/kyIcSMgEXgE?t=27m27s)

So if anybody is yeah so for me. The answer to all these seemingly intractable questions will always boil down to if not log off decenter because it's a lot easier to see the force for the trees. How many people who are loves screenshotting naive leftists who stan aoc and go look at you. Idiots look at you idiots falling for this how many of them smugly retweeted marco rubio saying the republican party is going to be the working-class party. We have to change our message marco rubio okay yeah. You have to basically just drill a hole in your head and forget.

Everything you learned about your process of being disillusioned by the democratic party so that you can go on to get disillusioned by the republican party. It's like the end of dark tower. He gets at the end of the thing and he opens the door and he's back to where he started because he has to keep doing it. So you go through this process of coming into identification with the democratic project or the left project. The liberal project wherever you are on this spectrum and then being driven over time through this process of disillusionment with it as a vessel for your ambitions which are material but also identity based and then you get kicked out of the process and instead of recognizing oh.

This was. This was what happens when you do that to a political party in the united states of america. You go. This was the problem with this specific party within the united states of america at which point you're back at the beginning chasing the man in black across the desert and you can't blame someone for this necessarily. You can only blame them in a broad sense you know just more in pity than anything that they can't recognize the cycle they're in and break out of it. So that's sad but you can't blame them because within that within their inability to break out of it. They have not yet been disillusioned by the republican party. It could be a place where they could get fun and enjoyment and a sense of political identity and own the libs again so let's find out.

 somebody asked about the ideological like motivation or structure of like the whole college thing. Like the whole suite of ideas you get it's very not. It's not really about like specific. Like culture critical theory critical race theory or white privilege any specific strain of academic jargon that's just like its expression you know within like a social matrix like people talking about like these ideas float around the important ones float around and then they get. Expressed in like sub concepts which by the way mostly start in and around college issues. But it's more about a broad suite of of of values like liberal western values in the broad sense but then like there's an intensity of it depending on like where you are within it.

You know like you've got the broad idea like western democracy broadly understood shared by everybody in all departments and every class you're going to take you're going to get but then you've got over time you know because of the cultural turn and everything you've got now all these other places where people talk about other things and they have more specific takes and they take the logic of the liberalism. That's broadly accrued throughout college experience and and lived and then they sh bring it further down into a a point of more specific reference to to like a theory. An issue like they're doing academia you wouldn't call it science but it's science-esque and they're doing it at everything and some places within that like the humanities you're going to develop like a more consistent sub genre of the greater liberal ideology and then people will gravitate towards or against that but they encounter it one way broadly or or specifically depending on their specific academic career who they encounter and then they get come out the other end and they accept some percentage of that the very base one being even if you don't believe any of this.

Buck in your entire life they know that much and that is shared by basically everyone who goes because they wouldn't have gone especially at this point in time really for any other reason. At base that doing this stuff. Listening believing these things will get you a job and not just any job a job that is in some way personally rewarding that is not drudgery that is not mere alienation. That's that's the base thing everyone comes up with but built on that is depends on your experience both before you went into college which is going to choose where you get your first classes and which ones you start with and then what experiences you have in college and your personality and all those things and that shoots you out the other end and you end up a political subject. You either vote or you don't vote to prove that you don't that you think they're phony and if you vote you're probably going to vote for one of the two parties more often than anything else. You're going to vote for one of the two parties and it's going to come down to what percentage of that suite of stuff you accepted or rejected the degree to which as is always the case. People make fun of me for saying that all the time but it's the only way to really talk about these kind of concepts because understanding them as binaries makes it almost impossible to conceive in your head of what this how the structures work because they're they're three-dimensional. It's almost as though we are shaped by our material conditions. Michael scott gift thank you and that because people who make culture tend to be people who went through the college process and specifically went through the humanities version of the college process. They will most likely make culture for from that point of view and because there's enough like there's enough generational wealth left at the end of like the rainbow with you know the the last the last bit of equity from the boomers and and some of gen gen x but not that much certainly no millennials were able to cling to if not like an actual working class an actual like um like job job the idea in their head that they could get one yes.

[35:07](https://youtu.be/kyIcSMgEXgE?t=35m07s)

I'm doing this. But I'm really this yes. I'm doing this. But maybe this yes. This is my day job. Like this. I have a greater aspiration and that greater aspiration is inculcated by this deal that college offers you and that you accept and that you have to pursue because you can't just say sunk cost because the sunk cost is six figures in debt. It's literally impossible to change direction at this point so that provides like the social motivation to maintain. Like these. These values these public procession of professional values and like to participate in this culture. But this is the last generation is going to have that experience that broad middle class experience of college. It's because of the combination of it becoming prohibitively expensive and that at some point people are going to stop going it might already be started now with corona because the rewards are less and less tangible. They're less and less even conceivable and even if it doesn't the experience of being disillusioned by college is going to become a hell of a lot more completely disillusioned by college is going to become a hell of a lot more prevalent than the one of this like let down by the college experience and it's in its offer of stable employment in a non totally alienating labor but the prospect of said from some grind hustle.

Some personal commitment to you know a professional career path or the arts and media or social media and that means that the electoral future of the democratic party is very grim when you combine the majority and built-in structure of the republican system that we have the constitutional order which already rewards people who are going to be more likely either to just be rich enough to vote their economic interests which are not the people. I'm talking about they have an entirely different context. The ones who make it are a whole different scheme of this. All like this is a process that happens at every level based on your relationship to actual means of production. So if you made it like making having made it out of college and not was the difference between warren and bernie in the primary. So if you made it your calculus is completely different but if you didn't that college suite of of like social cues moires media propaganda you want to call it whatever you want to call it like whatever the ball of culture that kind of keeps people.

 having faith in any even symbolic worth in the act of voting for a democrat is going to shrink and its influence on the levels of government is going to shrink. Now the how fast that's going to happen is up to a lot of things. One big one is how they actually do respond to this pandemic which I don't know they could surprise me I highly doubt it. But they could actually do a competent job or at least better of notice will be better than the republicans could happen not holding breath so that changes the whole. Thing that could like re that could just by ass backwards like they accidentally like add up add a comma to the stimulus bill like it literally just was a typo and nobody noticed it and then boom they're able to you know like juice. The the consumer sector and like take the boot of debt off of a bunch of people's neck and allow them to participate in the market again and not be like fully extracted miserable. Little gig monkeys and biden's the new fdr by accident that would be the perfect end to his career and then he dies with a full diaper but no not gonna probably happen.

The other is who comes after trump. The big thing is like trump's specific non-college pitch is built into his celebrity not into any of his ideology. None of his ideology anybody who's and that's why the talk about holly and cotton and making it coherent making it. Policy-based giving ribs and and armature to to trumpism is putting the ass. It's. It's the kind of mistake you make when you're in the bubble and you turn the know man. I don't know do drock 2024. Now there's a campaign slogan. No.

[40:17](https://youtu.be/kyIcSMgEXgE?t=40m17s)

I would not trust any movement led by joe rogan. I do. I don't think he's a nazi or any of that. But just the mind's a little too open. I think you need a little more structure. There you need a few more first principles that you can depend on when you're dealing with something that would be you know as fragile as a celebrity-led movement. Oh. I guess. I'm talking about from the point of view the republicans. I don't think he would do that because I don't think he's committed enough to the project. I don't. I think that politics to him caring about politics risks getting owned like. I think a lot of the the apolitical like rogan type specifically one of the reasons that they in their mind or say. Politics is because why would you risk getting owned over something that doesn't matter and it doesn't have the visceral appeal to you something like a sporting fandom and so you're. Gonna always stay a little bit away from it and you might endorse somebody in a primary or something but you're not gonna. Pick a team color because what if you lose and the thing about tucker. Carlson is he's got the celebrity he's got the zim. He's got the zazzle.

I think he could get the college educated portion of the republican party. Those people who went through the machine and decided to oppose it and they're always there too remember we're just talking about them being brought about being having been having them added to by more working non-college people. But they're always there they've always been there and they would love love that but would it wouldn't have the same appeal to those people who although they're moving towards the republicans. It's not like it's fixed in stone. A lot of it depends on who they're running against and what the what you know the happenstance of you know who's in charge when the bad thing happened brands the democrats like. It's still it's still there like we don't know how I just don't know if cucker has the zazzle outside of that bubble to appeal in a general. The way that trump did don't know donut still not convinced that he could run a economically populist enough campaign for it to really matter at all.

And if that's the case well. Then you're just talking a rerun of trump but with this instead of the greatest famous guy who's ever famous. I just I think charisma is going to be a much bigger factor there in like creating some coherent trump. Descendant. Some evolved trump form because like trump is obviously he accelerated a process but you know we don't know yet if he was prefigurative or if he was then if the next step was going to have to come like up because none of these lines including the line that goes down goes straight down. They're all punctuated by changes because they're interrupted. All these processes are running against the the They're running on the corduroy road of of randomness right of the random distribution of evidence of of the butterfly effect and so it's it's it's never a smooth ride you know and the big thing that makes me say that is just who is who else is like trump in the culture.

I say john tafford but john tafford's not that famous basic cable. That's not a network show that was in the top 10 in the last generation of network television which is now gone by the way like that kind of the people being on tv the way trump was on. Tv that doesn't exist. Anymore. Trump was on tv and then he got the fact that he was a businessman so he could fake a sort of pseudo experience of politics. It's like I mean people say the rock but he is the soy boy at heart. I mean we know which which side of the cultural divide he is on. He is the soybean he might have all the appearance of like a a a republican type guy and say he's a republican but his he's got a soft core. He is humanities no matter how much he wants to say his football team stem. He's he's a theater kid. He's a theater kid. You seen him on saturday. Live is a theater kid so he is.

I don't think he could run that campaign now the real what if is if schwarzenegger could have run. That's a real what if right there because there you have like pure charisma and star power minus like trump's specific cynical invocation of like crabbish um bigotry because you know trump at the end of the day is just a disgusting fat little with seven billion dollars in debt to the russian mafia and there he has to fill that hole somehow and you know that's how he got people build the wall. I mean schwarzenegger my god you schwarzenegger and he did he did. Arnold did kill the apprentice but that was after trump left is the thing that was too late when I say schwarzenegger. I mean like 08. Maybe 12. Once trump shows up and he gets that he picks up the stick. The george wallace stick wraps it around his own like fame fame and glamorous public image. Ooh that was a powerful force that was like king arthur pulling the sword out of the stone. But it's all obviously academic because schwarzenegger could never run for president thanks once again to our u.s constitution.

It would be funny though if he just ran and won and got sworn in and they couldn't do anything about it because that is where they got that's what the constitution is now which I'm glad but at the same time the fact that people still other than republicans who should at all times be invoking the constitution because it is the the document that most closely codifies their conception of you know political economy and and and the social order. Like it is all there. It's all there which is why it should have been destroyed in the civil war. It should have been it was like the you know what it was is the goddamn ring. It was the one ring like for america to become a coherent national identity. The constitution was necessary because the 13 colonies were none of them were in a position to impose force on the other so they all felt but it beca but as but could potentially be subdued by them combined against them. It was a mexican standoff or an american standoff. I guess and the constitution is structured the way it is for the specific purpose of preventing base democratic overtaking of governmental structures and then on top of that. Any like faction within the greater united states can coming together to overthrow the ruling class.

The the boston merchants and the southern landowners who made up the revolutionary generation of our founding fathers and the civil war proved that the pressure of you know northern northern wage relationship. Upon this like quasi-feudal remnant was of course still capitalist. It was a key component of the global capitalist network but there was a fundamental tension politically at its heart between wage relationships and that could not be contained within the structure of the constitution. Because those type of people weren't supposed to be involved. They weren't even supposed to be here you know they weren't really like. Here you know they weren't really supposed to be here like you know they aren't real at all. Like that's.

That's where that boil stops and but the thing is is that the united the north was only able to defeat the south because of the power that had been accrued over the last 80 years to the executive branch to the federal government. That was only allowed by the constitutional compromise with the states. It was only while everybody's guns were down that they were able to accrue without even knowing they were doing it the capacity to defend the state itself against a fraction within it and then they put it down and then it's like okay good. It's done. We don't need this thing anymore federalism is dead. We just killed it. We just burned it. We've burned with landed to the ground federalism is dead. We've inve we brought a state into the union well. The representatives of a huge fraction of our country were not. There. Ratified. Constitutional amendments opened half the land in the louisiana purchase to settlement free settlement. The civil war should have been the end of the us constitution it had served its political purpose.

It had defeated mordor. It had defeated sauron. Rather. It had defeated the sauron of slavery. Now it was time to cast it into mount doom and then you get on the precipice and who's that who's that on the precipice gollum himself john wilkes booth andrew johnson. Now that's of course glib as I've said a million times.

I don't think that there's any reason to believe that lincoln could have by himself having lived changed things enough to redirect the flow of like racial solidarity and you know the direct the the the recapital reformation of the south like away from plantation agriculture to the yeoman model that persisted in the north even though lincoln lincoln's entire political ideology was premised on the idea of turning america into a yeoman republic as the whigs conditioned it. But we'll never know is the thing we'll never know one way or another the volcano and now it's sitting around just corroding everything and turning us all into slathering creatures and so that's a like. I want to talk another thing about american exceptionalism. Another big like obviously the number one element is free real estate but built on top of that first caused by the same material really reality shaping its politics our constitutional system which had sort of a natural historical purpose really as as a as a like.

A progressive instrument in the furthering of you know the consolidation of wage relationships into conflict with one another then keeping it around. Just. It's like you blew a tire on the highway going in 150 miles an hour. So I think any political movement worth. This we're going to have as an assumed assumed assumed basic premise. The constitution gots to go now of course that's not a thing you impose for outside. I just think it's a thing that an organic marxist not through ideology but through lived practice recognizing class is real less recognizing class conflict is the only meaningful the only meaningful pursuit of justice but the problem is one of the just as an ideological question. How do you fight a civil war on behalf of a document that you then destroy and tear up you know. I mean obviously the evolution. The war changed the war aims of the union army and the the america the northern public generally. But it wasn't you know supernatural. It was it was it was a it was a process and it was unevenly distributed certainly but that that that drive to preserve the union you know america as an idea that was a real motivating factor for people to join the army obviously at a certain point. You join because there's a hundred dollars in it for you or there's a draft but those early regiments that you know spilled blood bull run and whatnot. They had that as a motivation and there had to have been more pressure placed on the constitution for it to for it to come under the pressure necessary and it never happened probably couldn't have but man it's past time to recognize the the enemy for what it is

Esperanto esperanto is one of those really adorable 19th century. Grasps towards the notion of you know true universal human consciousness but it rests adorably on an idealist pedestal of like pure liberalism because I think like the idea of creating a language for everybody in the world to speak is beautiful in a way but the idea that it by its nature of its existence would naturally find itself over time to become a lingua franca. That is that's what happens when you don't recognize material conditions as the generator of this. But one day there probably will be only one language on this planet. Before there are no humans. The last of them will probably speak amongst them one language but who knows how long that will take um I'll go out with a soy face here. Apparently. I'm on the first page. I'm gonna look it up right now. I'm on the first you google image page for soy face. Let me check.

If that's still true yep first row. I did the icky. I did it. I did the iggy. I'm a soul man. I'm a sore man. I'm a soy man. I did not invent the soy face of course that was the nazis um who of course are the other side of the coin. These are the people who went through the college washing machine and came out opposed to it. Now once again. Not necessarily went to college but experienced college in the form of culture generated by the college mindset. You're pepes you're gruipers.

They are their relationship to politics is as sterile and doomed as the relationship of the democrats broadly speaking. They will continue to be disillusioned by the party failing to do what it really wants them to do because they have some cockeyed idea that they're representing some actual ideology and some actual like notion of the good which is what they got from college. Even though they don't know that so they're constantly having to do the same pathetic bargaining game with their party. Some of them are moving in the other direction. There are a number of alt-right people who have become like kind of bernie crats right in the past in the past couple years. If I'm not mistaken. That's the same process moving in the other direction and then the question becomes when they hit the zero barrier and preach do. They recognize that they are in a sterile loop that their relationship with politics is illusory and fantastical and that they need to re-foundate give it a new foundation or do. They just keep moving on and now they're going to be like the the most gripery leftist and then move their way through somehow you will continue to cycle through internally if you can't give up your libidinal commitment to one party or another one spectacle or another one feast of domination over another yeah.

The proud boys are the dsa of the right. It's the same college graduated losers with a different cultural sadism box and a different cultural grievance collection. Trying to act out a pro concept of their political identity that is so powerful that it is spilled out into the real world. They have to affirm it in real life but of course only in the most spectacular way possible because they're fully atomized and if they're more violent than dsa and you say that's not that's not a good comparison. Because the dsa is not violent. They don't do things they're antifas and violent. It's like they are on the right so of course. They're more concentrated in their violence as politics because that's what right-wing politics is it's the step remember the fascism you talk about aestheticization of politics instead of doing violence on behalf of a class project doing violence for its own sake. So of course they're going to be more violent. Now of course. The dsa is actually doesn't really have a right wing comparison because of how demobilized they are plowboys aren't a good really comparison because but they're the closest thing there is which just shows you how unorganized it is on the right and how atomized it is because they don't even have the fake solidarity of you know the grasping towards 

 you know a public good that once again is no one's fault and we're all including myself operating from it. It is the confusion of our libidinal self-interest with our understanding of a general self. A general interest we're only grasping at it. We're only guessing because we're not coordinating action through experience and through class consciousness whatever you want to call it and that's all of us. There's no blaming people. It's not saying anyone is bad for doing it like. I said there's and no one is worse than me or better than me because I am 100 implicated in every single thing.

I'm talking about and I think people in dsa. There's nothing that says they can't do great work within it and outside of it. But because it's going to be doing the work in the real world that they're going to find what works both inside and outside the organization and doing anything to stay in the real world is worth doing no matter how cringe it may be and no matter how politically sterile it might seem because if it feels to you in the moment like it's worth your contribution. If you see things in the world that you and the people within that organization feel like you can do that by god keep doing it if it feels good as they say do it. But when I mean good I mean actually satisfying of a you know d a a a a materialized political will to power a materialized material will devour as opposed to a fantasized one and that could that's in dsa. It's outside of dsa. It's wherever you are. But it's you have to drop the charade that you're finding anything other than pleasure from this pantomime and the spectacle of like political combat as you understand it all right. I gotta go guys talk to you soon peace.
