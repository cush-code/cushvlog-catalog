All right hopefully this works. It froze up on me so. I'm starting over hi Kate. How's Texas have they actually buttoned up in Texas. Are they just like thinking that they could shoot it shoot. The virus has it affected the deliciousness of Texas. Hill Country briskets god damn I'm hungry. I'm eatin these pockets we're having at two fates nights. I think that's gonna be tasty right. Now. I'm just eating some pockys which I think it's delightful a very convenient snack well. They're like little chocolate corn dogs. I said we're having a to fade.

Mon Ami I believe we're gonna have a little ball that brulee you guys aware that the that the whole Cajun thing like those people the the French Louisianans that they're there because of a massive act of ethnic cleansing. After the French and Indian War. There is this group of like people who were descended from the early French traders to who had essentially intermingled with local Indian tribes and created like a separate Creole ethnicity called Acadians for the Acadian Mountains in the northern by Quebec and in Maine and ever there and after the British beat the French in the Seven Years War our French and Indian War. They said you guys are basically on a syllable in a syllable. A table into this trade empire were creating you gotta go and so they were transported to the nearest still held French territory in North America which was French Louisiana. There you go I know this person saying I've heard of that I know not everyone has though not everyone knows the history of this country.

Like that definitely doesn't get talked about too much population transfers tend to get under talked about. I have to say victors of communism putting all Kovac deaths on the other communist. I'll. It's pretty good. It also puts all of our mocks tests and like auxiliary militias that carried out the Holocaust. They're all in the black book of communism. All right I realize I can press this button and see these questions so now I can look at these spill. Some tsys whose tea should I be spilling silly y'all are silly. We just recorded an episode of the show with Liz and grace from Troodon. It was really good and very happy about it. Another reason I'm feeling better as I feel like you had a good show. Here we go oh we're getting them now Walmart bad yeah okay.

So this is interesting the question of us balkanization. I've been thinking about this now. Obviously. It's very facetious when gavin newsom talks about like you know doing all the he's trying to raise himself in satyr to a president so they use a viable candidate either for VP or maybe president next year or next time or president. This time. There's a lot of fluidity in this situation and he could really benefit from it. But the reality is is that the degree to which this crisis leads to long term like secular economic crisis that that's worrying to say the least how do we maintain these I mean we are already largely vulcanized politically. How do how do we like maintain these these social networks and this like nation system when with competing like agendas competing cultures and with no scent like if there is nobody in the middle to like pay the bills like that's. The real thing there's nobody at the center paying the bills and and keeping the infrastructure tact. If we really do see a collapse of a supply chain that I could see that honestly no joke being like the best-case scenario like the US breaking up is probably preferable to it staying together under any kind of like hyper. It would have to be some sort of like hyper authoritarian construction or but the thing is the breakup could very easily just start into like private and more likely turning like private corporate fiefdom.

So like Snow Crash not good folks folks we love it. We love. It don't we well. I just said I just spilled the tea on authentic Neapolitan pizza. Now I think it's but it's not the worst type of pizza um. It's probably that st. Louis garbage. I like thin crust but the fact that the cheese isn't really cheese to me. It's like a deal-breaker. I would like actual cheese on my pizza. I mean I'm a kooky. I mean if you're gonna not have cheese on the pizza. I have it something interesting like a tomato pie or New Haven style. Not this gross like string cheese processed.

Get it out of here currently faux kylief. Oh. There you guys go I love tavern style honestly. I'm debating whether I want to make one later I got one little skinny one thin frozen pizza hi bad Whataburger water boogers pretty good I like New Haven wah all right new heaven I love Chicago tavern style. New York slices are good but I'd say it like inferior to both of those and I like Detroit if you want a thicker crust. Detroit is the way to go over like Sicilian in my opinion are you guys ready to have a McKinsey algorithm determined that your life is worth enough to risk going out in public in order to secure like liquid assets of a certain percentage of investment income in the market over a common quarter. You guys ready for that. I will say that the blonde products are great. The beyond sausage is a phenomenal beyond. Burgers are great. I have the beyond ground beef and I'm gonna use it for like the tomato sauce or something soon and I'll see you then everyone's that hat is so good and the Carl's jr. Beyond further they had is really the best fast-food non meat a product I can think oh god dammit I'm getting hungry. These pockets are not doing the job so yeah an algorithm is.

Gonna say whether or not like because like I think the reason that they're really really brought they're really wait. They're really considering this whole reopen thing is. It's gonna lead to a lot of deaths but they're seeing who's dying and it's people. They can live without like they're seeing even in New York. Like high-income areas. The infection rates aren't that high even at the spike and all that so they figure well. We can you know if we can get them to keep going out and spending and keeping the economy. Going we can say where we are will be safe. People who die will be first responders a groceries grocery. People bartenders waiters people who can always be replaced of course. It'll also affect people like doctors nurses and professionals who have irreplaceable knowledge and skills that will undermine the ability of the actual state to to function and that is of course the inevitable result of capitalism eating its own eating its fats until it's literally eating itself to death eating the muscle eating them eating the Oregon all - to sustain a profit margin that is no longer rep in in this new system with this unprecedented demand drop and with no no slack in the line to recreate a new hegemony we the way we did effort World War. Two so yeah they're gonna send us back and then we'll put us back after too.

Many of us died and it gets too overwhelming go home. For a few more months then go back and the people who will die will be acceptable. Losses just the acceptable losses life insurance that's interesting yeah because that must be blowing their actuarial models right now how the hell they're gonna if they survive in the future. They're probably gonna not cover they're not going to cover coke coronavirus. That's the way that homeowner insurance doesn't cover floods or whatever and this is the kind of thing you think would make people mad you know it kills me there right now talking in public about how many of you there one sacrifice the their their prophet. God. The they're making calculations on your life in front of you and what are people willing to go out in the streets and protest about so that they could stuff their. Fuddruckers I can't go okay dude while my fat ass the Old Country Buffet. This is tyranny that is the freedom that they're fighting flora. That's the only freedom that anyone is mobilized to defend in this. Face hog people I know you're not supposed to talk like this but come on. It's there give me convenience or give me death.

No I'm not. It's less me disappointed in the people who don't fight because they are the scared est√°ndar than those who lose which is why it's hardest for them. The people who are doing this are doing it because they feel invincible because they are that Boomer cohort covered in gold protected by the golden sheen of the post-war American cargo called the last vestiges of that money are just draping them like gossamer of gossamer cloaks so they can go out there and stop their feet for their. Tuesday's. It's like you either have been pacified by by the state it depending on like basically the accident of your birth. The state the economy exists to discipline you or to indulge you the print and the degree to which it is is the degree to which you are invested within the system as opposed to a burden to the system as a post-war consumer your precious baby we swaddle you we indulge you and so you become a giant baby and you make have tensions about going back to the fun.

Rutgers you have tantrum about guns you're never. Gonna take that gun insurance company charges you 20 grand after your Philadelphia who bought the Hanneman hospital downtown turn into condos and then they wanted to reopen it for kovin patients and he said yeah for a million dollars. You're you love your. You allegedly in the game parody so the gun is just a big pacifier. No I have my gun so I'm free the fact that I have the gun means I'm free no matter what degree of my life being totally constrained by the feckless decisions of the sons of sons of privileged dunder pates. Sorry I went off there going off there a little bit but that's because of course they're fighting to have the guns. Of course you can give those people guns. They're not a threat. They love the system they benefit from the system. You can give all the guns they want you can mundos him. You can give them all the starches and you can give all the things they want because whether they're they're invested. But the people who aren't the people who you need the people you need to be a reserved army of the unemployed. The people you need to do the grunt work that you're not willing or able to. You can't let them have anything other than fear and terror all their every day of their lives.

That's all you can ever. Cannibal monster have no ability to speak for themselves woman who died a 27 year old woman who had to go to work at a Purell and she died at 27. In her last check was $20.67. It's Brett. It's monstrous but like who can look up long enough to even think about a way to to stand against it. Meanwhile these Guy Fawkes masks and stamp their feet about how they can't go. They can't go to build-a-bear because civil rights exist for them of course. As always death to America.

I'm sorry I went off on a rant there. One of my classic rants. I gotta say after a moment like that I realized yeah. There's probably reason that people say that classic rats Chrisman that's me you know what somebody suggested a song and it is so perfect to the moment so perfect to the moment that I'm gonna have to play it even if I get like that little exclamation point next to my story. I don't think that mean I think that means you can still watch it. So I'm not too worried about it. Besides I got off. I already got off my good rants. But this song is too much for the moment. This is the song that everyone hears at every part of their mind and the reason that Obama never heard. Trump Bernie never had a chance really. This song.

Ah anybody have any suggestions for reading everybody does. Live dies loss. Tenure everyone in there is a tenured professor somewhere someone that every single person there has a especially since what were they to talk like they're saying look. This failure proves you were wrong don't your entire life's record of nothing but failure do a better job. I mean we have a longer record to look at and you're just huge. Self-important little toads you guys succeeded because you like everyone else in your generation. Just grab that fat that was falling off the corpse of the post-war economy and just grab your little hunk of it. You're a little rotted hunk of real cheap real estate with a subdivision. You can the house that they bought for a nickel scumbags. Only in the position you are in in in in in dinosaur legacy. Institutions only haven't been dissolved by the ferocious ma of private equity because they have some sort of sentimental connection with this written. This country's richest saps ah I'm getting all riled.

It does anyone want to hear me read it. I actually have one actually this is perfect. I was resisting doing this because it's got a little bit of um. There's parts that could be clipped and used against me. I would say basically like somebody could very epic ly make a joke like Twitter meme out of it. But it's also perfect especially since we were talking about the awful indulgent. Ex radicals who read the nation then the other fact the fact that it's like an open letter to the new left in the nation. It's like. It's not if you're literally directing it only to yourself only the selfs. Only the other self-satisfied smug tenured without $25,000 pizza stone and you deserve the house in the of like folding shirts of the gap or something.

They absolutely should follow you into higher education and take your spot because Wyatt look cuz no you understand. They have a learning disability so this is from the paddy Chayefsky paddy. Chef ski was a a great screenwriter. He started in 50s on the TV shows like Peyton Place and requiem for a heavyweight. No no that was Rod Steiger anyway Rod Serling he he wrote Network. He wouldn't an Oscar for network. What are the greatest screenplays ever a great movie incredibly prescient and he also made a movie about the medical field. He did the he did his media with network and that he did a movie called the hospital to start George C Scott as a hospital administrator where someone's like doing murders like patients are being killed and they don't know who it is and any place that's beleaguered and and it's all about just like the cynicism and failure of the medical thing about a few like how it's a business how it doesn't care about health. How it's like like so crushingly bureaucratic how it doesn't cure. It only seeks to you know this it doesn't seek to cure and then he at one point after you know towards the end of the movie. There's a big Rand and churchy Scott is like you know he's a classic Greatest Generation. Like Don Draper type. He's like a Don Draper for hospital that's actually kind of a good. At comparison. He is like the Don Draper of hospital administration and he's got but like a little older. So I Greatest Generation instead of Korean War or World War 2 instead of Korea anyway and he has that he has a young hippie son somehow the hospital George.

Here this you're wasting your time I've been impotent for years what the hell is wrong with being impotent. Kids are more hung up on sex with me. Victorians I got a son 23 years old. I threw him out of the house just ah box all right all right sir over you're wasting your time. I've been interviewed in three years what the hell is wrong with being impotent. Kids are more hung up on sex and the Victorians I got a son 23 years old. I threw him out of the house last year pietistic little humbug. He preached universal love and he despised everyone had a blanket contempt for the middle class. Even its decencies he detested my mother because my mother because she had a petit bourgeois pride at her son. The doctor I got tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good lady when she died. He didn't even come to the funeral. He felt the chapel service was a hypocrisy. He told me his generation didn't live with lies. I said listen everybody lives with lies. I grabbed it by the pancha when I dragged him the length of our 7:00 room despicably affluent middle-class apartment and I flung him out I haven't seen him since you know what he said to me. He's standing there in the landing you know on the verge of tears he shrieked me. You won't think you can't even get it up anymore. That was it you see that was his real revolution. It wasn't racism the oppressed power of the war in Vietnam.

No the ultimate American social sickness wuzzlympic dingus my god. If there is a more despised misunderstood minority in this country. It is our poor impotent bastards well I'm in an impotent and I'm proud of it. I don't mean merely limp disagreeable as it may see through a woman. A man may lust for other things something a little less transient than an erection a sense of permanent worse that's what medicine was to me my reason for being you know miss Drummond. When I was 34. I presented a paper before the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered a whole goddamn field of immunology. A breakthrough. I'm in all the textbooks I happened to be an eminent man. Miss Drummond you know something else. Miss Drummond I don't give a goddamn when I say impotent. I mean I've lost even my desire to work that's a hell of a lot. That's a hell of a lot more private passion than sex I've lost my reason for being my purpose. The only thing I've ever truly loved well.

It's all rubbish isn't it. I mean transplants antibodies. We manufactured genes. We can produce births in we could birth. We could produce birth echo. Genetically. We could practically clone people like carrots and half the kids in the ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio. We have established the most enormous medical entity of reconceived and people are sicker than ever. We have cured nothing we heal nothing the whole. Goddamn wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes that's what I mean.

When I say impotent there. We go Oh George. See Scott mad props to George. See Scott. He was a guy who always said he hated the Oscars. He wouldn't go to the Oscars. He didn't care about the Oscars. He didn't think actors should do that he thought it was a craft. He thought it was art and he didn't like them being brought out like show ponies to be like judged on the ha on the hoof and so when he got the Oscar for a patent he not only didn't show up. He rejected it. He said don't give it to me. I don't want. It respect the goddamn meat market man. He ruled come on George. See Scott bucked urges it.

Dr. Strangelove phenomenal. One of the great characters in Kubrick I mean I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed 10 million depending on the breaks also of course yes the hospital is great in. Hardcore turn it off turn it off patent that he played patent as a psychopath and he became like worshipped by like like reactionaries. That's so perfect that like Coppola and Scott saw patent as like a maniac and the whole movie was about how it was insane and guys like Nixon loved it. Nixon used to watch it over and over again on the presidential yacht like fire himself up to bomb the V North Vietnamese because like you're like you're representing this insanity and if somebody shares that insanity it's like looking through a keyhole. It's like oh my god. This movie is speaks directly to me that's how you know. It's a good movie honestly cuz. It really does it's like actually exploring something. It's not just like sterile E replicating it all right Peter Glatt Brian Dennehy a lot a legend and a pip.

He was good you know as a good movies. An underrated movie best seller him and James Woods. He plays like. A Joseph Wambaugh ex-cop who writes fiction about I like fictionalized like journalism about like cops and James Woods approaches him. He's an assassin and he a hitman and he wants to write his biography and then they go do crimes together alright Peter the real one Brian Dennehy best seller also FX with him and Brian Brian Brown that Australian guy which is really fun because he plays a cop and he teams up with a special effects guy a guy who does like movie special effects to like stop a drug dealer. It was always drug dealer. In the 80s. It was always a drug dealer. It was really funny. It's got a lot of wacky gags and stunts.

Yeah FX also fun so you guys I've started to read by the big book of campaign of the century about Upton Sinclair and the 1934 race I gotta say I'm very excited. The book is great. It's actually a really I've never I've heard of it. Before it's a really well well-done piece of popular fiction. I believe it won a number of like awards anyway. It's like a day-by-day chronicling of the whole campaign and man like just the stuff that you could remember just reading a reading back through about about that election. As nuts. They really pulled out all the stops to kill that guy if I could stop that guy they really thought that he might like bring communism to America and the funny thing is is. He was a total fruitcake. Upton Sinclair was not Bernie Sanders. Upton Sinclair was Marianne Williamson on God. He was a Puritan like classic 19th century. Like crank. He was like oh. He was like a sexually repressed wasp who believed in like like fad dieting and speaking to the dead. With like radios. He wrote a book about talking to the dead and he almost. He brought this movement that they had to bring out all the stops to stop events like it's very fun story and it's got a lot of resonances with the toilet. This campaign but it's so funny because like Upton Sinclair is basically the man posted cringe non-stop and like the question of Upton Sinclair is how do you weigh good intentions and honestly very successful attempts at political organizing. I guess all that goddamn cringe yes the the muckraker he ran for governor of California for three times twice as a socialist. But then he almost won as a Democrat in 1934 oh it's Richard Hoagland.

She's the natural law party guy I love the natural law party I have seen debates with like. They're a national law party and I like what does that mean and they're like well. We think that the basis for human law should be a natural law and I just has anyone know what that means I've never really found it out. It just seems like sort of a magnet for stray cranks who can't fit into any other of the crank party. Mold I don't know like leftover crank like prank trimmings like what they make McNuggets and McRib out of that's where you get the natural law party guys I don't know I'm starting the book about I have the book on my computer. The book about the carnation revolution. Oh. I'll be reading it. Shortly I hope after I do the signal theft in Sinclair but yeah I wanna I wanna I want to talk about carnation revolution because like like I was saying that military it's more than its.

It's a it's an X Factor just to put at least to this flowing quickly. Flowing situation did you have any idea. What natural wah party meant did you know what that matter was it just funny of course marianne. Williamson coasted crinch come on it was adorable but it was definitely cringe. I remember when she said that this was the time when America was gonna slam it and slam it hard but all of Hollywood conspired to defeat upton sinclair. All the studio heads were mega reactionaries and they wanted to make sure that their precious monopolies didn't get with because claire actually proposed using public funds to create public studios like public art that would compete directly with the studio. Phillips basically declared war on the movie colony and they fought back. Then you really see where hegemony comes in handy. Oh. No he farted in public dick Ranchi Oh. John Hagelin. I knew it would that's what I knew I was close John Hagelin. I remember seeing him in a debate when I had a kid on a c-span or something and I just never knew what the natural law party means. Anyone knows shoot me a line. I think they're anti-abortion.

I don't know yeah cuz. It sounds like that like the Nazis cuz like you could describe if you like cuz that's like fascism is notoriously fluid ideologically. It's like postmodern in that way but but if you had to like find an animating thing in in Nazism. Oh man forever say oh yeah if you can find like any kind of like justifying ideology philosophically like base. It's the idea that like it's the idea that strike might versus right that's basically where it all Springs from like. It's all life is competition between groups. The most the the worthy estroux p-- will win or that is what must happen because of the natural order and that like the race and all that stuff is all just an expression a social expression of that underlying reality so that does sound like the natural like natural law party would be a good. Another name for the further nazis so but what the hell are they actually like.

I don't know they did not. The Jewish studio has had no solidarity with European jewelry at all really grotesque stuff. Those are some of the worst guys those studio has very real scumbags. Ah are there any contemporary fascist leaders okay that's interesting right that's interesting that's an interesting question I would say in a meaningful sense not in the United States. I would say the closest you're gonna stop the closest I would say and there's still argument I can't even say to finit of. Lis. I would say you could put them on the table to like look at further and I honestly don't know because I feel like. It's such a fluid concept and it's like applicability to the moment is to me very fluid. I don't I don't know if things are changing so fast that like the conditions that created fascism might arrive again but without the precondition of mass politics. I don't know what that means I don't know if that's what you would even call fascism. So it's very hard for me to get specific. So what I would say is in the basket of those guys. You would have a guy like Modi muffin ro and or bond.

I don't think Trump's in that basket necessarily. Maybe he is leaning in that basket range is like learn like one to ask him for discussion. He's in the next most like in a Bayesian thing like he's in the second most likely situation but that's it and then we'd be on that I don't know I I can't say I was talking her. I had a little rant earlier. You might well when missus over you should watch it. I had a little rant about those Michigan protesters and their privileges.

Last lives and how pathetic they are and how they're they show that the the idea of like freedom because like there's human freedom right the human freedom promised by communism. But human Freeman promised by transcending scarcity right. The the end state of capital communism right. There's that if you can't have that what you can have is material comforts consumption choices like a sublimated desire for for human autonomy that's expressed through consumption and so those are them. So with those is the options what all you get from from America. All you get from American freedom is that second thing you don't get the real freedom. You don't get real freedom and I'm not saying that something like North Korea is real freedom. I'm saying that it's worth striving towards that instead of force wearing it for something that at the end leaves you bitter and an empty and that eventually destroys itself that's the worst part. It's not even sustainable.

It's all gonna eat itself. We're eating this like the system is eating its flesh. It's eating its. It's. It's reserved fat. It's feeding its organs. It's gonna eat its bones. It's just hollowing out like it can't respond to this happening because everything's been sold off everything's been auctioned off. I keep entering the rant zone. I'm sorry and nobody knows what to do because these guys never had that be asked to do anything before like they have to just say just seriously consider the reality of the state reclaiming sovereignty from capital in the face of a crisis that's what the actual job right now of a political figure should be the kirok you leonis a chat of mess up. The massiveness of that undertaking is so beyond the capacity of people who were never. This must be stressed. Never asked to do any real choices no executive no governor no Prime Minister.

No president in this country in this world has to actually make real decisions let. The real guiding decisions are made by bound traders by the Federal Reserve. Buy stocks buy buy the market in all of its expressions. Your job is to manage the outcome of those market relationships and that's easy that's just basically what line of. Do you feed people to mask the mechanical nature of their now. They have to make a real choice human lives or keeping the economy strong in the short term preventing a drop in stocks or something.

One of them would require like the reason they're there still one of the big reasons they're forfeiting authority to the market isn't just that they're bought for not just that they're bought. It's if they don't want the authority because they don't know how to do it because they were never asked to make these decisions and they want to forfeit it. They want to give the gun away. They were like no go give it to me because they can't handle it because they were never asked to do that that was never the job and now having them do. This they're just. They will sacrifice all of us so that they don't have to intervene because we could intervene we could but it would break the compact it would destroy it would break the spell essentially of capitalism and they can't let that happen because they don't know they'll ever be able to reverse it. It is an existential threat and like I said even if it causes huge breakdown to society and you end up with like little militarized fiefdom and like disconnected states. But you maintain hierarchies within them. Then like the architects said the matrix there are levels of survival we're willing to accept. It's not ideal but they'll take it over giving over power yeah very depressing.

I went on rant mode big time guys I've been ranting up. This is good. This is a good one I feel. Like some of these have been pretty good rants. I might pump. I might pick. My rent I might actually go on Twitter and say hey check out my rants. They're pretty epic. Today. We're gonna get all the death. We're gonna get all the death associated with just letting this go when we reopen haphazardly and then have to close again and all that all those people died didn't have to if we just manage the economy in a stopgap way until instead of needing to pump the bat thing back up.

I feel man is really slim pickings in world leaders. Everyone really sucks man just think of the awful but foods in charge like these like bloodless bureaucrats or absolute clouds literally bosun ro Trump. These are clowns and not even in the sense of like wise. Clowns like like Lear clowns like buffoons like empty caricatures that just floated to the top of just absolutely a moral and political process. Like when all the power and authority of a seeped out of government it became a hollow show and of course. These most entertaining puffins just pop to the top of it because that's what its values. It's what it's what it shows hey and then who's the good guys who's the good guys angle. A guys I'm sorry but like Putin no thank you. I don't think that guy's got anybody's best interests or heart running erawan.

Settler colonial state. I'm sorry the Chinese dot. It's like they really haven't seen to care about ideology or moving left or like liberating people. They seem really more about making that making that chatter I mean the record please pretty clear unless they're doing some sort of elaborate rope. It up where there's gonna like wait until we've like lowered our guard because we they out like capitalism must and then they like spring into action. Say AHA we were actually gonna do communism the whole time. It looks more like they're doing what everybody's doing which is trying to grab the resources that are left while we can. That's why they're in Africa. That's why they're pushing out around their territorial waters to get out gasps to get to get trade routes. Mountain road. Salmon Russia's doing what they're doing in the Middle East or in Ukraine to maintain these areas where they can have enough when these global supply chains break down. It's just a scramble by the top one percent in every country to use the it's basically you know. It is the global boudoir right imagine them up here or the global pack not bushwa.

The global like ruling class every other every society every social formation they're up. Here. They know the things falling apart there's a big pile of money. The big pile of resources the big pile of remaining like commodities that can like power a society with us with and generate generate surpluses because if it doesn't generate surpluses then you're back to the stone. Age's and you're back to equality honestly. You're back to social equality. Also instead you need you need to maintain a hierarchy. You need to maintain inequality and you need to maintain surpluses so that means you need those resources. So they're getting those resources to like build on and then the thing between them is like state structures like countries by corporations but then through corporations nation states and formations like NATO or whatever the funders and then those pull it off the table like Hungry Hungry Hippos. That's what we're in. That's what that's the global situation we're looking at right. Now. It's grim. It's a grim situation but it's like every country every country you look at what they're doing. You try to examine what like the what what frame makes sense for these. At decisions the answer is always preserving and expanding access to resources surpluses. If you want to make just as blunt as possible just abstract it as possible. Just so you think of it in purely economic terms. That is it ideology has nothing to do with it. And if some countries aren't able to stand up for themselves and they just become subsidiaries. They become another passive thing.

They become a colony a subtle colony and then you have local comprar door elites who get that join in with the other ones they get kind of picked out. Like that mat is a whole social class but like as individuals within a social order like them like the new rich in Angola like that the world's first youngest woman billionaire. The the the daughter of the former dictator of Angola because she's got a jillion dollars in oil wealth that doesn't trickle down in any way to the actual citizens. They're like Nigeria which has tons of oil and has also seen Dutch Shell hire mercenary armies to shoot protesters who are trying to resist their. Tonight. I like that I feel unburdened unpacking the real. The real and the thing is some social orders though have a better claim like I'm running for Cuba I'm ready for Cuba. I'm rooting for Maduro as Venezuela I'm. I'm rooting for Nicaragua to get their share in the scramble because I know it's going to be used somewhat more equitably and justly than the other stuff. That's gonna get looted so yeah I have countries I root for but it doesn't change the fact that like this is not an ideological struggle and ideology will not be what determines the outcome. I was a little half-hearted. I think I think that's I think people's enthusiasm for the hollow gesture. There's a is waning the work. Someone asked me about a below and I have to say the only thing I have to say about mo is to quote the old the old wildly dictator of Mexico Porfirio Diaz PD Mexico so far from God so close to the United States yeah.

I know yeah those those all those like friendly like like his. There's these people who want to claim that the Chinese intervention economic development in in Africa is some sort of goodwill gesture or like or ironically. They act like it's like the Peace Corps or something in reality. It's like an attempt by China to essentially buy their way the critical infrastructure areas and an incredibly resource rich region that's gonna be more and more. A place for exploitation is gonna. Happen I mean live with liking there's a lot of unexplored oil and and now of course they're feeling hey. We're you're ripping us off and the resistance is kicking in. I don't know who's gonna win. The Chinese certainly look like they have the upper hand if they bottled up coronavirus the way they claim to have or honestly. It doesn't matter I'm thinking either they bottled it up that well or they have such a control over their. Like information streams outside and inside the country that it doesn't effectively matter if they have because people don't know except for in their very specific regions affected they're pretty impressively ready to expand. The only question is can they handle the massive drop in export demand that's gonna come that's happening now because there's still an export-based economy. That's the real. That's the real question I'm certainly rooting for Evo Morales and mas mas mas we've Abbas.

I like it fast though Virgil is a little as real as he is in your hearts. Virgil belittle exists if you believe in him. If you believe in Virgil clap. Your hands you believe in virtual clap your hands Lazaro Cardenas was pretty. Good Cardenas is good. I have a soft spot for Cardenas. I mean I really like Zapata a lot I. Mr. Leon so carrenza pit Carranza ah the fact that he got shot in his ass good good riddance. The hey Carranza and Maduro is such a perfect live. Maduro is the perfect live like accommodating to the right and cutting off all connections to the popular base so that they could turn on you and destroy you.

It's like textbook and they keep doing it every time. Oh thank you you're the man I did a couple years that I on an unfinished m.a. In American history post-war. As my specialty I never finished my final because I have I knew I wasn't gonna do anything with a degree. Cuz. I know I wasn't gonna go like go to get a PhD so I was like do. I really want to do. I kind of like a sub cost thing of like do. I want to go through the pain of writing this whole thing that I'm never gonna use for anything for a degree that's not gonna help me do anything. If then so yeah. I just I just did song cause I only even died did the first year and I hated it and I only did the second year because I was accepted to Duke. I was accepted as a as a TA. So I got instead of having to pay I got instead of having to pay I got got paid so it made sense as a job just to do it so ITA for a year. But then I never really finished. I never wrote my final paper because it was like what this I'm not gonna use it so. I'm a lazy. That's the thing about me.

No one should ever listen to anything. I have to say I'm a big fat tub of failure. I am a I'm a large I'm a large a mondo tool. All right guys looks like we're counting down well. This is a fun one I'm having a good time. We'll see if this lasts or it's back down in the bare. Bay of the best we'll see I do listen alright alright guys peace in the chicken grease in the Middle East keep it real keep it sleazy.
