We were down at Maggie's bar telling stories if we had one someone fired the old jukebox up. The Sonic show was a sad one did I roll down Bubba's nose from the plane. The song was inflicting and all it was dropped to his feet and just like somebody kicked him and Bubba Shot. The Jukebox last night said to play the sad song he didn't lie went to the cup and got it 45 Bubba Shot. The Jukebox last night Bubba ain't never been accused of being mentally stable. So we're not draw an easy breath till he lay that coat on the table on his head till the cop showed up tried to drive a lot of margins. We told him don't you play dumb with us boy with no damn well what the charge is Bubba Shot the Jukebox. The last night said he doesn't sad song. He didn't like one of the truck got a 45 Bubbles at the Jukebox. The last night. The sheriff arrived with his bathroom. Uh confrontation was a Chris. One shook his head and said Bubba boy you always was a dance. One wreck was discharge of a gun that's what the officers acclaiming hell a hitch is what I was aiming Bubba Shot the Jukebox. The last night said he made a sad song he didn't like went to the truck and got it 45. Bubba Shot the Jukebox last night how well he could not they'll rap wrong with the teardrops in his eyes beyond the shadow of a doubt. It was a justifiable homicide.

Hello folks I'm back what's going last week but I'm back now. I hope you missed me certainly when am I converting to you Eastern Orthodox. No thank you why would I do that baffling I've said multiple times Christianity is cashed. Christ of course is live and will always be alive lives within all of us blah blah blah but the vocabulary the social technology of Christianity. Uh it what does it represent anymore. It represents a reactionary. It either represents literal satanism in the United States. I would argue American uh protestantism which now encompasses Catholicism and pretty. Much every other Christian doctrine is broadly a satanic worship. It's a because what is satanic worship what's the idea behind Satanism right. It's not necessarily that you believe Satan is real because that would be an incredibly Bad Bet like if you have believed in Christian cosmology. Then you would know backing Satan is backing the wrong horse Satanism is usually just a metaphor for selfishness right like Satan is the Fallen Rebel Angel who would not kneel he who he said it was better to reign in hell right well. What is what is the American project if not that the the uh attempt to reign in hell that's what it is we're reigning in Hell. Our our Christian Americans are fighting for the right to live and reign in hell a literal hell as you can see from the uh temperatures globally happening right now like changing my very narrow specific totally culturally inculcated uh ideas of what I want desires challenging changing my uh Matrix of uh of consumption and uh and preference the the the little habit trail mission of treat uh. Uh accrual that I have instead of any kind of like real purpose I'm going to consecrate that as literal Christian as literally God's will what the  uh artificial version of like pre-christian uh Society like I guess.

The Dugan argument is that like Russia is different because they showed up late because they had communism like they aren't tainted. They aren't turned into Commodities. Like us they aren't turned into little uh consumer satanists like us. But if you look at how the countries uh run you look at what the uh how power is accrued and maintained. It's through the same structures that dominate everywhere because fukayama was right fundamentally about the end of History. His problem was one of uh ideology. He so deeply believed that capitalism and democracy were the same thing that the one was the embodiment of the other uh that his idea of the end of history is a triumphant Democratic capitalism but that's not what has triumphed that's not what ended history. Uh what added history was just good old-fashioned capitalism and the way that different cultures crew uh acclimate themselves to that varies based on pre-existing structures. So yes we have Democratic capitalism in the west where the process of building these states was a me was uh lubricated with the blood of Untold exporporated and exploited uh Colonial subjects. It's not going to be the same for countries that never had that experience of modernization where there where like the polity itself had to take that on the chin like Russia like China or planetary like India where it never really happened or you've still got feudal  social relations in the countryside but the thing these people all these countries all have in common and the thing that would validate fukiyama if you could just accept the terms of his uh his correctness uh but he couldn't do that without uh confronting the reality of what he'd worshiped his whole life because the the real trick of capitalism in the west is that it brought with it. Real Liberation Marx wrote about that better than anybody it brought these Notions of individual autonomy and human right that that asserted every subjective human life in the face of its social structure which is something that uh that other countries could not and other I'm sorry not other countries other uh modes of production. Other social relations of production could not sustain their people had to be uh.

Grist for a mill capitalism said no we're all ends to ourselves which is revolutionary and and and and and uh liberating yes in like a satanic way liberating the ego but also in a humanistic way liberating us from the need to be dominated by one another and alienated and separated from one another and that is but that was only if this explosion had been harnessed to a project of socialism which was alive for a while and is now dead capitalism Triumph. This Guyana said but what that Triumph was was those energies Unleashed and turned into uh yeah satanic self-worship so yeah like Christ still lives obviously. But Christianity is dead because it'll be it'll be Christ among others who will appear to those in need at these times of Crisis and are appearing every day in one geyser another. But it will not be socially reaffirmed as Christianity as we understand it as it is as is legible to other people because we know what those words mean to each other forget what they mean to us what they mean to each other because we can't have a private language. So if Christianity is going to be a live wire we have to take as read. It's cultural baggage and honestly. That's the same reason that I don't think we're going to see Socialism or communism as we understand that because it's it's the same process has degraded and deformed those symbols and meanings as have Christianity. It's uh like the the fantas the the the mirror of of socialism like because socialism is the attempt to materially substantiate Christianity and both of those projects and vocabularies have collapsed in the face of pure extraction pure domination oh God. The bananic discourse.

I think I mean we know that problem is going to solve itself are you kidding the idea that this is a thing that any uh anybody alive is going to have to deal with. What do we do about bananas. It's it serves a purpose of all discourse about politics serves it is to uh make. It is to create an illusion of forward momentum when what you're actually doing because the sword momentum is is for everyone to look at and you know participate in and kind of trick themselves into uh oozing into because well you know these are important questions blah blah but of course they're important questions for people in power which no one is. Uh. So what we're left with is a real motivation because obviously that can't be the real motivation because we're not we don't have any stakes and we can't answer these questions. We cannot resolve these sort of debates right. We know that because those sort of debates uh are summed up as arguments right and both side has a uh a uh a Ace in the Hole. Rhetorically that cannot be overcome. The anti-banana people can say these as an unsustainable social model and no realistic attempt to save the vast majority of humanity from destruction can accommodate that level of just uh instant consumer access to any commodity in the world correct. But the response to that you've got to work with people who currently exist to try to build political coalitions and they don't want to hear that they're not going to be able to have the things they like in their life. Those are both absolutely correct you can't argue. One is the other is right so what you end up. Doing is psychologizing the other side and saying well you're saying this because you're a Bourgeois piece of  who doesn't care about uh. You know either common folk ways in the one way in one on one side of it or you know the oppressed third worlders on the other and it's a way therefore to demonstrate you're different and better than they are. That's it. It's a Marketplace for attention and esteem that's what that question is for so I don't give a  I have no answer but like that is a debate. You have when you're trying to pretend that you're doing something you're not which is deliberate politically instead of go look at me. Which is all. It is look at me for having the right opinion carrying the right amount about the common people. I don't really like bananas anyway but yeah that I mean the same people who are having this debate.

They all are on the same page about where climate change is and where you know uh. The trajectory of global uh resources is so they all know but apparently can't say it out loud that this problem is going to solve itself. We should go to Milwaukee for the RNC if we're around and I'm alive. We will got to come home. We were gonna go to Chicago. We were going to go to Milwaukee for the DNC in 2020 when we were thinking Bernie was going to accept the  nomination in the the city of sewer socialism.


My God. It would have been something owned owned but I mean it's fun you know uh. So we got owned by that experience obviously and now we're in the aftermath of it and we're all trying to make sense. And that's what I'm doing here trying to make sense of where I am and what I'm supposed to do. That's I can't help thinking. It's not the right thing you know I should be doing something else but also a lot of what I am doing and involved with feels right. So I can only go with the day-to-day signals. You know the pull me in one direction or another because I can interrogate that all day but I will never get some sort of uh like truly uh objective assessment. It'll always be a self-motivated uh Indulgence either either a self-loving or a self-hating Indulgence. But I don't sweat it because I truly do believe we're all saved fundamentally in one way or another ways that aren't going to be compatible and overlapping to totalize and say this or that I think it's going to be bespoke bespoke salvation for everyone. But a cop-out right for the people suffering true absolutely but suffering now could only be uh intervened with at a social level and how do you participate in that not in a way that can be translated into uh  entertainment. I'm sorry because entertainment entertains Above All Else. Everything is subject to that imperative and so even if you think you're approaching these questions from a truly like Earnest position of wanting to stop suffering the suffering you can stop is going to be a lot closer than a political campaign right.

Now. I mean uh someone's talking about I don't want to relitigate 2020 too much but uh somebody's talking about how Bernie telling people not to vote. Once the lockdown started kind of screwed him. I think by that point it was already over. It's usually over way earlier than any kind of uh postmortem will ever say I said this about the Howard Dean screen. The dean scream did not end Dean's campaign. It was just the gravestone of a campaign that died on that day when enough people showed up and were like. I can't handle the possibility of sending a liberal hippie against George W bush. Given what the country looks like given how much they love war and how scary they are. The scream was just him recognizing it was over and hollering his barbaric Yap and God blessed him for doing it. You know if he hadn't done that we wouldn't have forgotten it. Entirely. He left his name in the history books even though he's now a complete goofball. In the same way.

I think Bernie was done as soon as Saints. Uh I mean like the the proof was in the pudding in South Carolina because I think what I had assumed and a lot of others is assumed is that there were a bunch of uh uh in South Carolina particularly uh black voters and sort of downwardly mobile uh. Uh Democrats everywhere who had bought the line on Bernie that he was unelectable until that point and who after Nevada would be like oh he's the guy and then you know because they want to be on the team would just go to Bernie and be like he's a guy. He's a safe harbor because look what had happened here which is essentially what happened with Obama. After he won Iowa. He gave a lot of black voters in all uh in South Carolina permission to vote for him because it wasn't going to be a wasted vote uh and then because like right before South Carolina had been that astounding performance in Nevada which was like the Bernie case study like Nevada is a state that is not like we talk about diverse States but a lot of them are not representative of the nation as a whole. Nevada is like the United States demographically and and the electorate downwardly mobile working class and look what they did you know I was like this is going to happen and all the Talking Heads freaked out uh. Uh Chris Matthews are going to commit Harry Carey on live television because of it. But then South Carolina happened and boom two things occurred one that massive of black voters didn't shift to Bernie uh but way more importantly the homeowning Southern Democrats uh homeowning White Southern Democrats sorry of North Carolina which there are a lot of now especially since the last 30 years of the uh of the Research Triangle has created these like educated suburbs.

They all came out and in as as a person voted for Biden. The representative of the party stripped of identity uh stripped of narrative stripped of anything because at that point Biden was a skeleton he'd been stripped clean like a  POC known to man uh. The the other white guys were just randos who had personality cults the only one who spoke who only represented something that transcended the failed bespoke. Uh uh individualized um uh niches of the sort of Post Obama. Uh Democratic coalition had no uh purchase so they voted for the party which was Biden and once that once that evidence was there that oh we do have someone who we can all go behind and can expect them to win. We didn't think it was Biden because we were thinking oh the candidate is unpopular. Nobody likes the candidate who gives a  it's what he represented. He represents Obama and therefore the Democratic party which is what homeowning whites wanted.

They did not want socialism if you want to talk that Bernie was either too uh like socially conservative or not uh socially conservative enough like that is what the culture Warriors who picked on the carcass of the campaign wanted who and wanted to make keep this high up the sugar high up of political arguments with Stakes fought over was he tooed socially conservative socially. Liberal did he wear did he not wear the flagpin enough or should he have called for the abolition of Prisons uh and and like sex worker legalization or whatever none of that mattered Bernie was identified with the way he wanted it to be and the way everybody on the campaign wanted to be. He was identified with the messages that he talked about all the time because that's what regular people were hearing not people on the  internet people who watch television the people who talk to people who watch television from ads commercials and news and what they said and what they all said the same thing Bernie was associated with  like Medicare for all which Democratic voters they told uh of course. They told uh pollsters they all supported that idea but a lot of them said it was unrealistic uncoincidentally the ones who said it was unrealistic tend to be the homeowning well-off portion of the democratic party who don't really need health insurance to be free and who imagine a free health insurance would either be lower in quality or cost them more that might not be true that might be propaganda. But they're propagandized as we all are in America and those people were like we're not voting for  Bernie Sanders and so they voted for the party rejecting all the identity people and then Obama could make the call.

It's Joe I didn't even want him to run. I told him not to run again. I begged him and he did it again uh and then he won and or then he still he's still standing because he's the one who represents the party as soon as that happened it was over how many old people died by going to the voting booths. Because Joe Biden told them to that is a question a live one uh and it speaks to you know the the character the people in that party. But it's not relevant to what the outcomes were going to be. The the path for Barney was always getting people who don't normally vote and those kind of things well. You didn't get enough of them maybe if they'd spent every dime they collected in donations on the street teams to talk to people instead of commercials because I kind of think every single dollar spent by Bernie on ads on ran on television was basically wasted. Money. Maybe you need like a certain amount just to keep main application up. But the vast majority of that money should probably have gone to higher and they had these people. They did have a deal where they were hiring. People who like worked in the service industry and stuff to talk to their co-workers which is very smart but it needed to be way bigger. The problem is it's still a traditional democratic campaign. It has needs that have to be serviced by people with experience and those people have ways of doing this and those networks already created and you can only fight against them so much oh odds of a military takeover of the United States.


In the long term. I think 100 percent if we don't get a nuclear war with China. First. I don't think it'll be a fascist dictatorship. I've said that before and I really do believe it. I think it would be more like a a Thailand or Egyptian Style all right let's knock. This stuff off we have a  supply chain to administer type of uh dictatorship. Politics will still exist but in the States because people are already moving voting with their feet to move to states that support their politics and that is where political. But that's what's going to take over for political uh conflict when we can no longer resolve issues where we are now is going to be replaced by just one party States doing whatever they want in response to one another Dueling Banjo style which is what we have now California and Texas Florida New York outbitting each other in performative uh and punitive social um uh social policy and both of them uh making it illegal to be poor. At the same time you know it's funny with Obama. Though people when he came in people said like he could be the next FDR and the thing is even with the reform even with the terrible terrible job he did in recovering from the collapse in 2008.

Uh he was still so identified with like rescue and such just a a disarming and pleasant person in like in his presentation that if we did not have term limits even in this world he we would be in the getting ready. For the fourth Obama administration. Obama would be running for his fourth term and he would be comfortably up on his opponents probably would be Trump running again after losing big time although maybe not because if Obama had gotten a run for a third term he would have crushed Trump by we could you can't say like elf Landon uh levels because that that's we were too polarized for that but bush in 88 like a real ass kicking highly possible if Obama runs against Trump who would have been the nominee probably in 2016 because like at that point they were all crazy and uh Trump would have still wanted to run or maybe he wouldn't have because he would have been afraid of trump in a way that he or an afraid of Obama in a way that he wasn't afraid of Hillary. Either way. Whoever runs against him is a loon who gets killed and then they would get killed again and now this is a wild one but maybe one of the reasons. Obama did such a bad job and seemed so checked out even while he was president and now just doesn't seem to care is because he knew that he could never really be FDR because he could only get two terms.

An FDR is an FDR after two terms really you know he had to win. He had to fight World War II to retroactively vindicate the the New Deal which was still an open question because the Depression was still going on. When World War One started after his two terms in office so a two-term for the FDR. If a republican wins and we don't go into World War II or we botched World War II. We don't end the Depression or uh save democracy and the whole new deal is kind of embarrassment and FDR is a loser even with two terms. So if Obama's looking at the down the barrel of this generational crisis and knows he's only going to get eight years why bother trying to be FDR it's way harder and we're dangerous.

But of course like this is the butterfly effect thing. This isn't the Obama we have our Obama would never do that Obama. Our Obama never cared about anything but he was made but in a world where FDR uh that where they where the counter-revolution to the New Deal included term limits like you can't the 25th I believe Amendment somebody correct me uh that limits terminal that limits terms was a conservative reaction to the New Deal part of the taft-hartley ACT Red Scare reaction to the New Deal coalition uh and the experience of winning World War II as allies to the Soviet Union. So in a world where we get term limits we get well. We had a strangled American Socialist project uh and a truncated American progress towards social democracy turned reactionary after the inevitable Global crisis uh of uh energy imbalance that hits in the 70s 22nd Amendment and so in this world we get that Obama the don't give a  here's my summer playlist good luck burning to death Obama but maybe in the world where there's still uh you can still get for three or four terms. We get a different Obama you know I don't know it's just I'm not saying. It's the cause I'm saying it's symbolic of why in general the whole thing was  from the begetco and by this late date it's hard to even countenance counterfactuals. But it is interesting that we would definitely be in Obama's fourth term.

By now she would be more hated than ever by the people who hate him but there wouldn't be any more of them than there were it would be a. It's a it's a it is. For the most part uh a aging and dying movement surrounding extractive capital in parts of the country that are drying up and blowing away like it's being concentrated in you know uh in states that are big enough to you know turn themselves into uh let's sort of libertarian. Uh fallout Vegas level uh banana republics like Florida and Texas but you know we're seeing already that though that that uh platform is fundamentally uh undermined. They're not ensuring anything in Florida anymore and now and and the Republicans are saying oh. These are woke insurance companies. It's like okay yeah famously woke insurance companies like they don't. They aren't the people who don't give a  for uh human resources and tort reasons. They don't want to get sued same reason. All these companies do that stuff because they don't want to get sued so all this is falling apart yeah. They're fleeing California too because the wildfires so like the social basis for all.

These things are collapsing wow they're revving up who knows who knows what happens I'm either dying or I am just filling myself with Dread and creating a world where I would rather just Keel over now than deal with the future. But the thing that prevents me from doing that is love which I know exists and since it exists uh. Salvation is inevitable regardless of anything that we can't control all right. Let's do one deck of cards here. It's also true fentanyl exists you know uh. We got a war bird here.


The f117a stealth fighter. I remember these guys I remember how ugly they looked. I was like this is not a cool looking airplane. You're never going to see Pete Maverick Mitchell riding one of these things around invisible to radar the F yeah. I'm sure the F wouldn't one of these get shot down in Serbia. Uh the F1 11. The f11 is 7A f117a. Uh is designed to sneak inside enemy defenses and attack high priority military targets uh an Operation Desert Storm. It was part of the first wave of aircraft inside Iraq destroying radar installations and aircraft on the ground. It paved the way for the massive airstrike to come the stealth attack. Fighter employs a variety of modern weaponry and is Guided by the most up-to-date navigation in a tax system. Damn manufacturer Lockheed speed 455 miles per hour range 460 miles. Combat Armament TV or laser guided missiles or bombs or anti-radiation missiles prove one all right. Here we go another military asset.

The USS Theodore Roosevelt very appropriate. They named a  uh. They named an aircraft carrier for this guy he loved big ships. He sent the Great White Fleet around the world to announce America's military dominance part of his big stick policy just waving the hog around like Hey. We're on the big block and it's appropriate because it was during FDR's term in office. The United States officially surpassed England and Germany as like the biggest economy in the world. So it's like that's the coming out party Alfred Thayer Mahan.

The influence of Sea power on history incredibly inflictable one of the very few books that gets mentioned in like a high school textbook now of course. A lot of that ends up being it ends up generating a false historical idea and it contributes to our greater tendency towards being idealists in general because like how do they teach Americans like Imperial coming out the turn of the century well. This guy Alfred Thayer mahain he wrote influences see Power in history and he pointed out how important sea power was to establishing dominance in trade routes and stuff and then they say well that book you know it was part of a general like a trend in these directions and then it was read by people like fdtr and you know. Now this is there is good pedagogy here because if you're trying to talk about a general Trend that has been generated by material conditions changing you want to pick something like a book as emblematic people were thinking this way and here's a book you can read to understand how they were thinking. But it gives the impression when casually asserted that it was the reading of the book that led people to create an American uh deep uh water Navy.

No it was the imperatives of America's expansionary in uh uh the imperative America's expansionary telios. America must expand it isn't only America if it is expanding. This is what differs it from Europe. Now you could say that I'm sorry. This is what differs it makes it differ from post-westphalian European states that emerged from because the westphalian settlement said that's the end of uh uh enlargement as imperative.

If we keep doing that we're going to keep destroying the continent so instead. We're going to accept that these are separate countries that exist there's going to be greater and lesser influence. But we're not going to no one's going to take the whole thing over anymore but of course. While you're making capitalism. It's creating a lot of social conflict. Now it can't go out as much so it goes Events off to the United States where the free real estate allows it to turn into a live and unchallenged social premise that powers our entire political system. The Constitutional order and the political system that emerges on top of it so what Thayer Mahan represents influencency powers in history is just Americans in the context of having hit the edge of the continent re understanding and redefining expansion so that book is part of it but what it isn't is the thing that moved it. But how we remember it and how we stack events as a culture is that that's what did it because we have to impose idealism uh because that's where our ideas about what we are as a country matter because it's only in the realm of ideas that America having six percent of the world population and consuming half of its resources. Makes sense is uh unquestionably good and must be pursued to the end of time. Now other countries. Other people might want to expand but they're limited and so they have to deal with it and they have to make they have to forge a social peace with their own class. The class they have to support the social piece within the class conflict that they have internally and that has to do away with expansion over time and it took massive. Bloodshed in Europe to get there even after Westphalia was established because you ended up back to conflict and domination over territory only overseas territory instead of European territory by the uh late 19th through the 20th century. Only America could stabilize this stuff into a coherent and continuing social vision like in World War II. Germany and Japan were like guys who showed up after last year's championship where Air Bud won and they got their own dog.


They spent the summer breeding. They spent the summer looking for the perfect specimen of jockish golden retriever. Uh athletic ability they found one. They said this is a guy and then they trained it rigorously for a year and then they come with this young just beautiful uh golden retriever ready to win the championship and they get told by the commissioner. Oh no dogs can't play basketball and you say. But there's no rule against dogs playing basketball. They say yeah but they put one in sometime uh in the late 19th century as all of the available territories remaining in the world were carved up after the Berlin Conference it was understood that all right no more massive. Imperial uh uh Ventures you're not going to try to grab a bunch of land. This is all spoken for either by one of the countries that matter or uh by territory that was claimed by one of the countries that matter so now Germany or Japan are. They got this dog that they bred to play basketball and they can't play basketball so they tried anyway and they got slapped on the nose. But what's important is because their world view was the same fundamentally as that of the western allies.

The Democratic allies the United States and Britain and France. They instead of being defeated and at having their power structures overturned. Their power structures were simply turned into junior partners. The Assumption being look you guys aren't going to get to run the world but you'll be taken care of in a greater World Empire. Like the way that the Mongols would take over a warring neighboring uh tribe and incorporate them into the Mongol horde. They've been dominant since World War II and they got the bomb which meant they were never going to lose to the Soviet challenge or to the emerging. Uh peoples of the third world which is why that war in 1914 to 1945 was the war that the uh it was the end of the battle of Armageddon that you could argue began with the first 30 years war in Europe and it ended with uh although I wouldn't say that because there was no good side there was only reactionary Catholic uh feudalism or this emergent Protestant capitalism.

Nothing that could be liberatory nothing could truly bring Heaven to Earth but World War one had that it was Birth by the global communist movement. Now that doesn't mean everybody who fought on the Communist side was an angel or a good person. Even many of them were demonical hell beasts who are belong in hell if there was one and I think a lot of them are going to spend time there and have spent time there. But that there was this alternative. There was this uh millennary Horizon that could have seen violence Bloodshed horror Millions dead as happened in our world but a horizon at the other side of it. Uh the heaven on Earth to be built. We got satanic Satan triumphant and uh the end yeah of that Horizon and the slow and steady building of Hell on Earth.

That's a bummer but we're all still here and there are other worlds than this all right Theodore Roosevelt the newest of the U.S Navy's complement of carriers in Operation Desert Storm. The Theodore Roosevelt was four geared steam turbines and four shafts powered by two modern nuclear reactors the largest carrier in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The ship is equipped with the latest defense missile systems. HomePort is Norfolk Virginia. The nimitz-class carriers have a service life of at least 13 years displacement. 96 700 tons full load length 100 1089 feet speed 30 plus knots. Aircraft 85 good Lord crew 5084 and 72 Marines from what I understand those uh aircraft carriers are basically useless now thanks to to Hypersonic missiles. So oh boy. Let's give it up for one of the crucial elements of the post-war American Imperial coalition Good Old Republic of Turkey.


This brings us back to the very beginnings of Chapo when we were uh much more turkey focused than we are now historically turkey has tried to remain distant from the political conflicts in the Middle East. However as the neighbor of Iran Iraq and Syria this Independence has been difficult to preserve. No kidding turkey has been subjected to terrorist attacks and linked to the Palestinian and Armenian movements. The Kurds get nothing the Kurds get nothing. They were only a few years away in 91 from carrying out a devastating ethnic cleansing of Kurds in Southwestern turkey which is happening at the same time. Chomsky Chomsky always like to point this out what's happening at the exact same time that slovene milosevic was uh ethnic cleansing Bosnia and of course turkey did not get bombed. They got bombs from us. It is a member of the United Nations NATO and the Coalition forces geographic area. Uh 300 947 square miles population 56.7 million languages Turkish Kurdish and Arabic predominant religion Sunni Muslim capital of Ankara government type.

Republican parliamentary democracy absolutely head of government prime minister. Now that's changed. The president is now the head of state or the head of government. Too I believe they changed that recently good old turkey it's interesting they might kick him out of NATO though because their demand to let Sweden in is to join the EU and the EU I don't think would ever allow that what do I think of uh asalan. He's the guy who uh he's the one guy who read Murray. Butchkin I know that they need him in NATO but at the same time you can't have them in the EU. Like the US has helped the usn uh you have like really humored erdogan a lot because they need him to keep a cork on those migrants there and that just opens the barn door. They can't do that I don't think because they're terrified of the political response to any more immigration. In Europe you can say that that's wrong. It is obviously but it is a predominant political Terror oh. They got a a loan ah smart see. There you go.

That's a smart move you you threaten them with this Hobson's choice and then you give them an out nice fat IMF loan the Arab League. We got here the Arab League good old Arab League. The Arab League was formed in Cairo Egypt on March 22nd 1945. Today it is composed of 20 countries from the Middle East and Africa. The PLO is also a member the purpose of the League is to promote political economic and cultural Unity. Among its members. They're doing a great job uh uh yeah. No turkey is in NATO. I'm saying I'm just saying that that uh the you they really want to bring in Sweden and they do not want what arowan asked for which was EU membership for turkey. In response the issue of other descent Arab troops to participate in Operation Desert Storm split the league.

The majority of its members however supported defending Saudi Arabia from possible attack by Iraq yeah. They really turned on Saddam. They were like we do not know this man but literally everybody did that Islam including us after having supported them all the way through the Iran Iraq war of course. We'd also armed and supported Iran in that war.

Just as like the evilest thing you can do. We've got Bangladesh oh man did. We have Bangladesh already how they're going to be two bangladeshes. I think we got Bangladesh which is very funny to get Bangladesh. Twice. Bangladesh was part of the British India until 1947. Then for almost 25 years it was known as East Pakistan United with West Pakistan now Pakistan by religion Islam but separated by a thousand miles of Indian Territory. What a great idea that was independent since 1974. Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries. It is a member of the United Nations UNESCO and the Coalition forces yeah oh. It's a oh yeah Bangladesh very low to the water not good. A lot of people very close to water 55 598 square miles population of 1114.8 million people languages Bengal and Bengali and English predominant religion Islam and Hinduism Capital DACA government type Republic head of government prime minister qazi Zafir Ahmad.

I'm mad rather we help them do a genocide uh or we help Pakistan do a genocide of Bangladesh in the 70s because the local bangladeshis what a surprise didn't want to be ruled from Islamabad and they rebelled and there was a ongoing Massacre but because the president of Pakistan was the U.S back channel to China. Uh Kissinger Nixon supported them and all the way through and it wasn't until the Indians invaded and declared war and just kicked the  out of the Pakistani army that they stopped killing people. It's amazing that the two military interventions in the 20th century that you could really say were motivated at least largely by civilian concerns not entirely but like more than half at least half and more importantly than it motivated had the effect of literally stopping mass murder as opposed to a lot of these wars. We say oh we we saved all these lives like no you did not you killed more people than would have died otherwise the two of them India's invasion impact of uh of East Pakistan and uh later in the 70s Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia were both opposed by the United States and uh in both cases we supported the the genociders speaking of Kissinger and back channels he was talking to XI today they drove his. They put his 100 year old ass on an airplane for 20 hours or whatever to get him to China which is wild. They realize you really got to wonder what's going on. There.


Uh okay we got one of the coolest planes. There is the C-130 Hercules look at this bad boy look at the big bad boy a medium range tactical airlift aircraft the C-130 Hercules was designed to transport cargo and Personnel within the Operation Desert Storm area. It can carry more than 42 000 pounds of cargo or cargo passenger load. It can accommodate 64 combat ready paratroops as an aero medical airlift. It can carry 74 liter litter patients and two medical attendants oh Lord. He thick manufacturer Lockheed Georgia speed 374 miles per hour range 400 4891 miles primary function transportation of crew and cargo and Personnel crew of five that's a big daddy that's a big old plane and now we've got the A6 Intruder. Another airplane Another War Bird here uh capable of delivering long-range strikes against heavily defended targets. The A6 Intruder can also find track and Destroy small moving Targets in all weather conditions and provide close air support for ground troops in the air War. During Operation Desert Storm. The Intruder flew missions deep into Iraqi territory to destroy important military installations. So this thing will just wreck military installations if it was used for close air support maybe. But we'll see I don't know I don't know the record of the Intruder manufacturer. Grumman Aerospace range 644 miles per hour or speed 644 miles per hour range. 1221 miles combat Armament up to 30 bombs Sidewinder Maverick or Harpoon missiles crew too damn badass all right.

We've got a fighting ship the Midway. This is a very hard. This has been a very Hardware heavy deck which I enjoy a lot of hardware. On this deck. We've got yes the Midway a veteran carrier scheduled to be retired. In late 1991. The Midway was ordered from her specific duty to the one day from retirement damn uh the smallest of the U.S carrier Fleet hurt oh cute little retirement age baby uh adorable little uh death platform uh her compliment of aircraft through numerous sorties against the Iraqi military in southern Iraq and Croatia during the operation of the storm HomePort until she returned to the United States for retirement is hakasuka Japan displacement 67 000 tons fully loaded length 1 600 feet speed 32 knots aircraft 75 crew 4686 and 72 Marines. There are those 72 Marines again. What do they do on the boats they're not going to get deployed. Do. They just dick around do.

They have them swab the deck at least if I can keep them from just getting it underfoot and now we've got Middle East history. Colonial oh boy time for some awkwardness awkwardness. Oh boy yep the colonial history of the Middle East oh boy. I guess we have to talk about it yeah. The Arab lands in the Middle East belong to the Turkish Ottoman Empire for 400 years. I do love that phrasing they accept yeah they belong to the Ottoman Empire. They were the property of the Ottoman Empire that was that was right and then during World War One. Many Arabs fought with the British and French against the Turks hoping to gain their independence. When the war ended. The British took mandate control over Iraq Jordan and Palestine while the French claimed Lebanon and Syria. The Arabs felt betrayed why would they feel betrayed absurd oh that's right the Marine who put Casey Ryback in jail and then he got just murked unceremoniously. Just shot didn't even get like last words. He said in the in the reefer and then I believe he also got killed. He was one of the um deputies under Sam Gerard in both the fugitive and U.S Marshals and he gets killed by Robert Downey Jr U.S Marshals. Whatever that actor was if anyone knows throw it in there um. Although their lands later gained independence way to go guys the colonial period left a legacy of distrust and bitterness towards the West. I mean I guess they they're giving him. I'll give I'll give him credit for at least acknowledging it you know but they were they were mad all right um.

Two more here oh government oh boy the Saudi Arabia system. This is my favorite diet I love I love to get on the Saudi Arabia system. Keto Saudi Arabia system yeah. How's that work hey uh Hey Democratic guys who love democracy how does your very close Ally Saudi Arabia's system work. Uh Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy based on Islamic law yeah that's right not the petty whim of a clan of  Hillbillies. It has no written Constitution and no Parliament oops. The consulate ministers formed in 1953 is under the leadership of the king Islamic law Sharia is enforced. Alcohol is prohibited not everywhere and the public activities of women are restricted. Perna Saudi Kings have great power within the Islamic world because they control mechan Medina and administer the annual Muslim pilgrimage to those holy cities. It's true and they're our best friends in the world and they did 911 maybe on our behalf maybe because they thought we'd enjoy it and we did type hereditary monarchy in El solid family. National holiday September 23rd head of state King fad bin Abdul Aziz al-sad political parties prohibited suffrage.

None yeah. They are making golf great again so give it to them on that and here we go last card Oman oh boy. These guys love to keep it themselves. It's apparently very pretty there. It's like the most geographically diverse and interesting place on the uh Persian Gulf I guess through the Gulf of Vermont never mind foreign principally on petroleum which constitutes 95 percent of its exports goddamn. Its principal trading partners include the United Kingdom United States and China with a landscape that is largely Barren still supports some sheep and cattle grazing good for you. Oman. Oman's agricultural products are dates fruit and cereal and as a member of the United Nations UNESCO and the Coalition forces baby geographic area 82 000 square miles population 1.5 million language Arabic English baluchi and Urdu predominant religions Islam ibadi some Sunni and Shia Hinduism yeah. They've also got a weird Islam variant down there that's like all by itself like a like a fine wine Capital Muscat government type absolute monarchy baby Canada government Sultan Caboose bin sad and is he the same guy because I know that Caboose he was like dying forever Franco Style okay.

So there we go another deck down. We're getting to the end of this set. Honestly. There aren't that many left. I think we're going to be able to go through them all which will be cool. He died recently. I thought so oh R.I.P I'll definitely see Oppenheimer but uh not right away. I gotta get that I gotta get that 70 millimeter performance baby. I'm a buck. I'm a pig. I follow the the vision of the director I  with that stuff. What else am I doing with my life other than curating experiences. And I and I owe it to myself to curate this one exquisitely.


But I'm sure I will have takes honestly if we did like a deck of like upper deck or flare cards. From the 90s I could probably have a good time with that because I was big into baseball back then when I was a teenager and uh the early teen I had like a big big shoebox full of baseball cards. Oppenheimer conditions created Barbie conditions. It's true the plastic world that Barbie lives in the artificial dead world where like live engagement with the world around us live engagement with others has been replaced by a synthetic literally plastic petroleum uh replica. It was that was birthed the trinity because a nuclear-powered capitalism would never be defeated on its own terms you know by another state formation that emerged from European modernity which is what the dream of Communism was the extension and completion of the judeo-christian project of uh synthesizing social relations across Europe. The United. Then the new world and then the whole of the world and the world that was built by that nuclear blast was one of oil petroleum petroleum dollars powering the economy petroleum coating every surface turning us into dolls of ourselves that we play with and call living all right boys guys guys and gals dolls. Barbies oppenheimers see you later.
