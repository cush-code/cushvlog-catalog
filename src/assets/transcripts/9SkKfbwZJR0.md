Hey oh crap are we gonna get in trouble oh hmm perhaps. I don't know. I forgot about that until you did it oh well whatever oh we'll cut that out before we after we do this that didn't happen apparently. Twitch has been descended upon by rhea which to me. That's that's your missing the force for the trees if ever. I've heard it like where what what are you doing where what is the the even theoretical point where you're gonna squeeze some more money out of this by doing that like oh darn it. I can't listen to somebody on what playing zelda listening to to the the chain smokers now. I don't have to buy that. I could just watch that and it replaces that experience for me. It's ridiculous but folks what are you gonna. Do you can't fight city hall or more accurately. You can't fight mickey mouse who is the avatar for the copyright regime that stands bloodily over our destroyed cultural corpse. Did you tweet about this matt. I didn't yet thank you for reminding me you should put it up. I will right now. I often forget welcome to the early morning when I do it. When I do it myself. It has a thing that prompts me to show it so. I often do it that way so. I've forgotten. I'm having a bit of okay. There we go.

I shouldn't put it in that pocket so congratulations to andre cunanan o'brien for joining. The supreme court with the other worthies with the other wise men and women who will decide this nation's future. I think it's going to be you know what. I think it's all going to turn out great Let me just write this out rgb plus a cb equals that's right folks what the what's gonna happen now. There's a lot of ways that people are hashtag coping with the reality of this new unbreachable 6-3 dem republican essentially super majority on the supreme court. There's basically no way that they'll ever that the right will ever lose a case again because every every avenue of of swing voter has been cut off. Like roberts is certainly a wild card when it comes to things that he thinks are crucial to maintaining the um sense of like institutional legitimacy that he thinks the court needs to maintain. And kavanaugh is kind of a wild card on Like criminal justice stuff. You don't have to worry about anybody throwing off any kind of curveballs because you'll always have at least five to do the dirty. So that's cool and of course. Everyone is very angry about the democrats just letting it happen and of course. The wise smart people will tell you there was nothing they really could have done and I think that is technically true. There is no because the senate rules can be changed by a vote of 51 at any time and there is zero zero chance that mitch. Mcconnell would have hesitated to do it do that which means that all they really could have done is. Maybe delayed it until after the election and then hope maybe that changes the calculus maybe because it is pretty close hypothetically but honestly. I don't even know if they could have done that but the one thing we know is that they wouldn't find out They didn't try to do it and that's the real question that people are asking why didn't. They even try like even if they knew it would fail.

Why wouldn't you try to show the seriousness of it because the supreme court has been the thing that democrats have pointed to as a reason to get people to vote for democrats and the presidential level for my entire adult life. Every every answer to the reality of the democrats you know total neoliberal character and and constant drift drifting to the right on all major economic issues is met with yes but the supreme court and now it happened the the red line got breached. Rbg died girl bossing and they replaced her with a younger morphekund and psychotically catholic one rgb so congratulations all around But the question has to be if this is the right big red line and they crossed it without an effort being put up without them. Even trying then how could it have been that big of a deal and how can you expect the democrats to put up a bigger fight to anything in the future. This is what the real baffling thing is and I think the answer to why they wouldn't even put up a fight is they don't want to show how fundamentally powerless. They are because they need to maintain this fiction for a majority of their voters that they are crucial that they exist as a crucial stop gap for the worst rapine of america's reactionary government and and base. But also they have to fail at every specific juncture that they would count as a red line important one without any kind of effort. Like they they can't How are they they don't know how to reconcile that fact but and so what they do instead is not establish what it would be to fight at all leave every fight to the next fight so that you never have to show your cards. Basically you never have to actually say oh like this is how much power we actually have because you either see how much they've been holding back or you see that they can't actually stop anything and if they can't stop anything you don't need them and that's the real nightmare scenario. If the extent of their full incapacity is ever expressed publicly. They lose all reason for being so they essentially have to at every point back off from a final confrontation and convince their voters that it isn't really the final confrontation that there's something else well hey what was the point geez.

This is a bummer get vote vote go vote even though biden has said I he has no plans to do anything significant to change the court's composition which guarantees that any major legislation that did come out of the biden administration would end up being shot down including any attempt to remedy like the wild amount of voter suppression and and misallocation of representation in this government where you have these this permanent minority that is able to exercise veto power over all social and economic issues we're gonna vote vote vote vote you know even though we now have said that this is gonna be the way things are that nothing we do will ever actually go through. You still have to vote because that's the next thing. That's the next fight and then at every point. Every fight is on the terms of the democrats meaning they determine how much effort to put in in terms of engaging republican reaction so that they can always exist in this quantum state of of being the only thing stopping you from the horror happening and the horror also occurring right in front of you how they just phase shift away from the point of crisis because this is supposed to be it. How many people on the liberal left said if they even try to fill that seat before the election we will burn this down. I mean it wasn't just reza ocelon. It was a bunch of people and at that moment when it happened they probably would have agreed with that but then after those hearings after feinstein after the democrats doing nothing except say some about keeping arrows in their quiver. It's just like cutting your veins in a warm bath. It's like well it couldn't. It can't this. I guess isn't the thing to burn things down about. I mean obviously it all springs from the fact that they're not serious about doing anything ever so democrats never have to worry about a response. They never have to worry that they're gonna get kicked out or punished for failing to do the thing because not doing the thing just it keeps these liberals in the state. They want to be which is always activated about politics and aggravated and worried about it but at a bone deep level not willing to do anything except virtue signal publicly and vote because anything to do otherwise would be to engage in a politics that could undermine their social position which they do not want to have happen so they have this relationship with the democratic party where they're kept in this frothing state of of crisis and the democrats have to be reinforced over and over again to the public as the only thing standing between us and oblivion and then allow the thing that we fill our minds with as the worst case to occur and then do nothing thereby meaning.

It's not the worst thing meaning. There's a new fight the next day that we're going to keep having and we're going to keep withdrawing. It's It's an amazing mechanism and I have to say you know if you ask me what. I think's going to happen realistically nothing. I think there will be no court packing. There will be no court impeachments. There's not gonna be anything they're not gonna even do term limits. They're gonna do what joe biden has promised to do which is to form a commission and that commission can exist as a idea. An option that could hypothetically change things that we have like studied and found to be worthwhile. But the making of it is the action. Not the implementing of it. Implementing it is is another moment where the the what's possible kicks in because forming a commission is never going to really get any kind of real veto from the the republicans they love a good commission. I mean they don't do them when they're in power. You ever notice that they don't do bipartisan commissions. They just do things only democrats do commissions because it gives the illusion of action without the actual action which means it doesn't engage conflict with the republicans that would require them to actually pursue like political change that can you know allow them to compete for power realistically as opposed to play the washington generals for the next hundred years which is what they're on path to do so yeah it's 

It's a real bummer but you know. I think the good news is just this mechanism is so deeply broken. I think that that these questions are going to become obsolete as I've said in one or two ways like either the political has been totally foreclosed in which case you can at least kind of relax. You know you can stop worrying about politics because politics aren't real anymore in any sense. It's it's. It's just been foreclosed as an option or the terrain changes so fast and so dramatically that. Like the composition of the supreme court is no longer an impediment to anything because the social investment of authority in those institutions has been compromised so thoroughly that they can't be enforced anymore that's going to be it and not saying that will happen or even likely to happen. But it's not off the table and that's what I i hold in my heart when I think about how just from like the chessboard perspective the american political system is so d it really does feel like. It's a 747 where the pilots have been killed and somebody has just chained the tiller to one side. There's such dive bombing into the ground they're just it seems like the the the the the existence of the constitution overlaid on like a late capital crisis of of profit and a fully polarized ideologically sorted. Two-party political system has essentially means it's like pouring sugar into concrete it. It just it destroys it it destroys any chance of that political mechanism working even at the level of just ameliorating the most dire crisis in a culture you know which is subsidiary of course class rule is about maintaining profits and all that but what maintains profits is a viable social base for generating surplus and at that at that basic job. That bourgeois democracy is supposed to do better than anything that came before it and has a good track record in some cases is essentially zero. There's no capacity. There's no state capacity at all because the political structure is so deeply broken which means that whatever is going to kick-start. This process is going to come from without if it and is going to attack it orthogonally but once again.

[14:52](https://youtu.be/9SkKfbwZJR0?t=14m52s)

I don't know. I don't know. I mean last time. This happened in the 30s. It was a work. It was a labor movement. It was workers striking and rioting and sitting down in their workplace. I don't know if the conditions obtained for something like that to happen again. But there are certainly enough people working in enough dire circumstances close enough to crucial nodes of production and distribution in this country that if they were organized they could bring this goddamn thing to a goddamn halt. It is possible. It's just we're very far from it. But the 

I don't know the the way that this political system has been just denuded of all authority beyond just the naked words of it. The way that no one really believes that any power is legitimate anymore that there is a public. I mean. I know that scares people and makes them think there's going to be a civil war. But I think it's also a necessary precondition for people to rearrange their understanding of politics like for people who think that it's all voting and it's all elections being disenchanted from that and for people who also think it's all voting in all elections and that voting in elections are stupid. No. It's actually something that you can contribute to and can make change in your life inshallah.

Of course. We hope but like take for example the prospect of joe biden presiding over this upcoming continuing coveted crisis and concomitant economic collapse like we're really going to see depression level economic activity in the next quarter or so and they're going to come into office going to leave the filibuster going to do. Nothing about the supreme court are going to get on to the process of passing you know excruciating compromise in the obama care mold piece by piece just like like passing kidney stones until the failure to do anything about the underlying economic crisis and probably not doing much about covent honestly because come on what's on the table at this point the genie is completely out of the bottle. Nobody knows how to put it back together that you get another repeat of 2010 and there's a republican reaction that means that well now there's not even a possibility of operating within the system as such because even the possibility of passing legislation has been removed. We'll see though because that seems so bad and it seems like it's so likely to happen that you wonder if maybe self-preservation will kick in for some of these democratic leaders. Maybe they will and maybe just ambition. Maybe just the fact that they want to stay elected maybe that'll do it but that requires people to be pissed and that requires people to be pressuring these. Hindering everything they're a huge impediment but the people who who are going to be really pissed and still pissed and not mollified by biden's presidency. Are the ones you want out there in the first place but how are we not going to become further and further estranged from any expectation of redress from government when our decrepitude and our disaster and our catastrophe are presided over by a guy who is going to preside like lloyd benson in hot shots.

Part two chris can we all get the video that was of today aye aye captain jamie can you pull this up. I'm getting to rogan it out right now jamie. Yeah can you pull this up. Here we go. This is biden being asked a question and look at this fellows. We got we got kush with a earphone so we can both listen to the clip at the same time here's biden being asked to answer a question today oh up. Here we go get back to back to one thing. That is important is that today soon he's still going in the background okay. So he says he says here's the deal. The one thing you have to remember is that it's important keep in mind that reporting that they're going to vote on barra today. So it's important to keep in mind because he says it again right you got to remember. It's really important. He goes you got to remember. It's really important to remember that she's getting confirmed and it's important to remember that just a circle a doughnut hole. There's no content to that it's just fillers and they're confirming her. Today.

This guy's going to be president and I know they're going to try to hide him as much as possible but that's going to be hard. You know what I mean he's gonna have to give big speeches. He's gonna have to give an inaugural address in january in dc. You know william henry harris in it and how is it. I mean he's like obama's just his charisma and his persona and what he meant culturally and and and racially and socially just blinded everyone to what was happening. But we're going to have just the skeleton like because barack obama is like barack. Obama is the terminator and when his exoskeleton gets shredded away it's joe biden like that's the the exoskeleton of the politician. You know that obama is under the flesh the surrounded with human tissue that that metal carapace is biden so all of that mystification is going to be gone which is good not necessarily helpful. But I think better than the alternative. So you know another thing. We can look forward to at least it'll be funny even if nothing else holy. It's gonna be funny can you imagine. I'm really glad that now I get to call things up like rogan rogan.

[21:54](https://youtu.be/9SkKfbwZJR0?t=21m54s)

Hey dude can you bring this up. Jamie ah oh yes like a baby cyclo on a diet of straight kabango. First anyone get that reference oh dang. I realize I forgot to set up you with your monitor for the chat. Today. Matt you want me to hook you up with that real quick what I forgot to set you up with your monitor. For this yeah. You didn't. It's all right you can see anything and pull it up real. Quick did you did. Anyone get the right answer there. I I don't. I don't think so. I was a monitor in the chat. Oh was that.

A talk about borat that's all. I'm seeing very nice the answer to that is battlefield earth. That's what's a little quote from. I saw borat too. And I think borat 2 is a perfect example exhibit a in any case you wanted to make that donald trump killed american comedy. I'm not saying that borat is bad or terrible. There's some good stuff in it but you know it's not as funny not just because there's less novelty. Although that is part of it it was not going to be as good. It would have been a miracle for it to be as good as borat because it just wasn't as fresh. You know and I mean how the hell do you even fight people who don't know who borat is in america at this point but so there's good stuff in it he was good in it. The daughter was very good but all the stuff about trump and politics just felt so stale and and aaron. It's like making fun of russia and then like how trump's a horny cheeto and then going and seeing the awful supporters the q people and the conservatives and tricking them into being racist. It's like I'm sorry but in the intervening 14 years since the first borat those people who he made fun of got self-aware trump showed up. He told them that it's okay to have fun with this stuff.

They're they're winking they're. They wouldn't they it doesn't matter. If they even don't know they're being filmed in their head. They're owning the libs so what are you even proving they're in on it man. They are laughing with you and then the fact that it ends with literally saying vote are you kidding me vote. Hey america is a wasteland of savage bigots and vapid narcissists and people who are willing to just dehumanize each other and and oth and foreigners at the drop of a hat in pursuit of of mere looker and and some fantasy of racial purity vote biden what the heck it It just feels a little it. It felt a little felt a little lib to me and in a very it's like a like a genuine like bone-deep way like it was a project of liberal cultural analysis it is an attempt to make sense of the trump years through the ve the lens of like a a liberal of a cultural liberalism. So but parts of it were very nice. I gotta say. I was I kind of felt like giuliani might have been set up a little bit when I saw it in the movie. I thought maybe he was tucking something in but like but it's still an absurd amount of intimacy for someone he just met It's clearly someone who is used to being led into a room by beautiful women and then just sort of taken care of be it you know flight attendants or hostesses or you know paid escorting partners cousins the guy married his cousin folks. They were first cousins amazing 

I want to say one other thing about about bite and trump. I realized after I saw this amazing picture from a rally. It was a woman in a a shirt that said my son died of corona and I am still voting trump which reminded me of course of charles taylor's slogan when he ran for president of liberia after being a warlord during the civil war he killed my mom. He killed my paw but I will vote for him and the funny thing about that is not just like yeah. He can kill my kids that it's that it it it. It admits that a central premise of trump's defense of himself over covet is not true. He has said that he did as well as he could and that none of the corona deaths are his fault because it was china and democrats that made it bad and that he made it as good as possible. That shirt essentially says no trump is responsible for all the corona deaths. He he chose to slay my sons but that is his prerogative because he is my abrahamic god like christians.

At this point they worship america which means they worship an avatar of america which is both themselves and some external alienated version of that which has become for many many people trump. He is their god but he is not a christian god in the sense that he is not ecumenical. He's not universal. He is tribal because they see themselves as under threat that's a fundamental thing that defines them as a sense of persecution which is what will give them licenses within themselves to persecute. In turn all the violence that they will sign off on culture police and military borders and everything is premised on the idea that they are in fact under threat and persecution and that anything that they do in protection of themselves is vindicated and warranted It's it's a pure projection of what they want to do onto others like when clay higgins to defend a regime of concentration camps on the border went to auschwitz and talked about the jews being rounded up and so that was going to happen to suburban louisiana white people that he represented by ms-13 gonna show up with cattle cars outside of a like they have to feel persecuted and that's why they love trump so much because trump you know is nothing but this ball of persecution. He's constantly being oh my god. Everyone is against him which means anything he does is is justified um and so trump is their avatar of america. He is their avatar of persecution and suffering. He is their christ but he is here with a sword. He is here to to destroy the unbelievers and the infidels and the faithless and and and that is all the people who are outside of the communion of magga outside of the tribe of maga. Now that's the appeal of trump to the people who really like it.

I think the reason he's going to lose at the end of the day like I'm ready to say it. I'm ready to say. But I'd say right now. It's gonna be too big to steal and the reason is because that pitch of trump as being the abrahamic god of thunder and apocalypse no more water the fire. Next time cleanser of the earth get on the ark or drown There are enough people outside of that who still might vote for trump and maybe did last time who are going to see that and contrast it with biden's pitch. Well. Biden is pitching himself as the new testament god of jesus incarnated here to to embrace all in forgiveness and suffer on their behalf because trump because he's always talking about how democrats republicans are good people too. They're good americans too every all americans need to come together like just like obama did yeah and he was similarly christ-like and and and biden's personal sacrifices and tragedies in his life and his obvious pain that he's in. Now. Those are all are signs of the suffering that he's enduring on behalf of bringing a wounded nation together to one communion of of common humanity who are all saved essentially by enduring the suffering of covid and austerity together and even though by the end of that but his term I think everyone's going to realize that he was a false messiah. I think right. Now there are more americans who are going to be turned on by that pitch than by the idea that it is in fact time for the the flood to come and wash away the unbelievers because I think a lot of them might feel like they're unbelievers at heart too like those crucial swing voters that we talk about and ex and suburban republicans who are maybe college educated and who find the cultural demands of being a republican to be gauche and who don't want to find themselves on the outside of the tent when it's time to start raining fire from the sky and I think that as a new testament nation we will we'll embrace jesus biden as our savior for a minute until it's until the the threat of The final judgment of our abrahamic god trump is gone. I'm looking at the chat hero what's going on apparently you can vote at the barclays center did you see that you hear about that. Chris.

[32:51](https://youtu.be/9SkKfbwZJR0?t=32m51s)

I walked by the park. Late today. People were waiting to vote did you know that I assume it has to be your precinct to vote there. No no. I don't think so. I think the early voting locations are concentrated and that like they just there's a I think you get a directory and they send you or something. I don't know but it's all in one big place. I think they're also doing it in manhattan like madison square garden anyway. I think I might go vote there because I haven't been to the barclays center inside. I'll maybe want to see what it looks like oh. It's nice inside yeah. I haven't gone to anything yet and you know why not and waiting in line is fun not if it's too long they'll.

That but if it's not too long. I'll probably do it and now probably as I've said write in hillary cause. I still think that's the funniest write-in option that could change um. I was just trying to find that clip of trump at one of his recent rallies being like no one likes me anymore. Why am. I even here oh god. That's so good. I wish. I want to get in that truck. I want to drive away. I want to drive away. I want to go away oh. I was so happy. I was so happy am I over life and now. I'm here why'd I do it why why I never asked to be bored 

It's hilarious. He's emo af right now He's in his feelings as they say and it's pretty funny Although when he said I used to have a great life. I was so happy. He's lying that's why he ran for president. He was miserable everything he has ever. Drawn has been ashes in his mouth as soon as it has been there as soon as it touched his tongue. He is a miserable and hedonic toad who has gone from one just destructive hateful isolating attempt at like conquest and power and sadistic pleasure and had every one of them immediately just become used to and commonplace. And I mean the man has been strapped to the hedonic treadmill. His entire life. He is miserable and he ran for president not just despite barack obama because it was a different thing and he didn't even think he was going to win and then when that became a possibility hey maybe.

I'm going to be president. I'm going to be on the news. All the I'm going to be the only thing on tv because that's all the only way. I can like soothe myself for even a second like the way that the return of the living dead zombies have to eat brains to keep away the death the pain of their rotting. He has to continue to see himself on television and he's like great. I'll be on tv all the time. But what's this oh no. There are parts of the media that don't like me and say bad things about me and I have to watch that too and that immediately destroyed it and it has been misery ever since the first bad review the first the first thing the thing about the goddamn size of the inaugural that doomed him he he was never. Gonna have a second of fun as president after that and he hasn't except of course for when he put the the medal on the dog when he was in the big.

 truck and of course the handsome quarterback hamburger party. But those were it and that's why that's why he is coming to terms with losing because he's talking himself into how at least it'll be something different which means it might be better and then of course he'll be ex-president and it won't be better. It'll be terrible many many french fries. I was thinking he kind of looks happy when he's doing the the trick-or-treat appearances. I think yeah oh god when he put the candy on the head of the blow up minion for some reason like what did he think that. I still don't know what he was in his head. I think he was trying to be funny or something like hey get this. I'm gonna put this on your head. I'm gonna put it over here all right. I found this clip. Let's play it real quick yeah. Let's do it by the way nice trucks you think I could hop into one of them and drive it away. I'd love to just drive the hell out of here just get the hell out of this. I had such a good life. My life was great and then I said let's do this darling. This will be a lot of fun. I'm so happy with it because nobody has ever done so much in the first three and a half years. No administration trump trump rallies have kind of the patter of watching stand up in a foreign language yeah where it's like no matter what he says the audience responds when the laugh line is so he's like he's up there being like I hate being here. I hate being here. I want to drive away and the audience like when he gets the end of the sprays just claps and laughs like train seals. I mean he insulted the city of erie pennsylvania the other day to their face. He says the thing that would have actually killed the campaign in that state. Anyway. The thing they would have talked. About years later is the legendary gaff ah the eerie kerfuffle. He goes. He goes I'll tell you right now if it hadn't been for covent. I wouldn't be here.

[38:06](https://youtu.be/9SkKfbwZJR0?t=38m06s)

I'll tell you that right now. I sure wouldn't be here that's for sure like you guys are beneath me but of course as I've said the trump fan is a worshiper of hierarchy because they believe themselves to be elevated but in any hierarchy has to have someone above you realistically and so like some avatar as I've said and that guy who combines christ and like george washington into one figure is donald john trump and then like his that's why they see him as so authentic. Even though he lies all the time because he is saying what they are. They say he he's what does he do for her presidency. He doesn't actually do anything even though he's responsible for everything because he's the abrahamic god he has no direct control over anything he's watching us. It's like the way god watched watch. The people of israel like lose their way and to get pissed you know and decide to smite some that that was it just watching and getting madder and madder at our failure to live up to him. But that he's watching on tv which is what they're doing watching television which means that there's no way they'll ever not like him no matter what happens in the world because they don't attribute that to him they attribute it to us failing to live up to him.

I was just thinking about ed muskie and how his presidential campaign was basically the canuck letter thank you that's a great pickup. That's a great reference. I was thinking of ed musky the canuck letter when he ran in 1972. One of dirt. Nixon's dirty tricks teams the guys that the ones that included dudes like roger stone sent a a fake letter to I think a newspaper claiming that they had overheard muskie refer to french canadians as canucks and there are a lot of french canadian abstracted families in maine so It's like a sizable minority in fact in the 20s when the clan was all over the united states there was klan in maine but there were basically no black people or other minorities so they went after french canadians the french canadian. The most oppressed person of north america yeah so and it became a huge scandal and he had to go and deny having said it.

But people were mad at him and it ended up helping contribute to his campaign being torpedoed because the other thing was that they released some oppo about his wife. Yes yes yes that was the best that was the end of this right yep. He had the canuck letter and then there was the accusation about his wife being drunk. I think or something like that she was alcoholic or that she had cursed or something. I don't know and he went and he gave a speech and he famously some people say it was just snow hitting his cheek but people said he cried and that was the end of him bye bye bye-bye. You're a loser. I had a tear hit. His eye defending his wife's honor out of the campaign trump goes to erie and says you're all you all suck yeah awful pigs. Why am I here and and and yet it goes and so yeah paul lepage is a native french speaker. That's hilarious that's perfect that he's that much of a freaking canuck. He's that much of a frog that he's one of those like deep deep woods acadians coming out to be like hey. I'm going to be goldar. I know that's I know that's louisiana but same origin. I'm going to pick up now hey. I know the canuck isn't for french canadians. But that's what he called the kai that or in the he was accused of calling him. Matt can.

I read you some highlights of a jacob wall. Yes let's get some teeth spilled. So this is a I you know. I was thinking of putting this for the show yeah that we were thinking about doing yesterday before we moved on to doing belly garage. Right. After this we'll record it. We're laying that down so that's But this is something somebody passed to me of jacob wall and jack burtman their their first hearing in their federal trial about robocall their robocall scheme um which it was basically like a voter suppression version of homer simpson and the happy dude yes auto dialer so they're just like mail your vote to 631 evergreen terrace 7 30. Three things from this I found really funny blundering right wing activist. Jack bergman and jacob wall appeared before the u.s district court in the southern district of new york monday morning over a newly filed lawsuit on behalf of the national coalition on black civic participation. Here's the thing that made me really laugh. The suit alleges the two violated the ku klux klan act by sending out over 85 000 robocalls to discourage back communities from voting fellas. You do not want to get accused of violating. No that's you don't want that odd stapled on your resume. Oh. It says here a clan act violator h yeah well.

We'll keep you in mind mr wall The other funny thing is that they ended up representing themselves. Notably friday afternoon always a smart thing to do the old saying is the man who represents himself has a genius for a client. Notably on friday afternoon wall texted the daily dot and informed this reporter. He would be represented by new york city-based lawyer that lawyer david. Schwartz did not respond to multiple qual requests for comment from the daily adult dot in court that morning which the daily dot was present for the duo further claimed that schwartz would represent them but at the hearing no council was present okay so I got to say something now. I have talked about how much I respect jacob wall as an artist and how in all I am of his commitment to the bit whatever it is. But I've always said that there is one possibility in the jacob wall. You know mysterium one thing that might explain him and it is that he is just insanely stupid but he is just deeply dumb and I've always discounted that just because of how perfectly he seems to hit these notes it just seems like a hundred thousand monkey tiptuation. Like yes you know one of the monkeys might write shakespeare but what's the odd that the monkey I'm looking at is the one who wrote it you know and so I just always said that doesn't seem. I know occam's razor but it just seems too pretty too neat but the fact that he did this. Even though god like why would he not get mad at me when I'm screaming in his face with laughter tears are running down my eyes and then I see him at the cadillac ranch two hours later and tell him how much fun. I had and he's just like the terminator just like glad you enjoyed it. His eyes dead eyes like a doll's eyes. Maybe he just is that dumb amazing 

The judge asked whether berkman had in his possession a list of all who were contacted by the robocall to which berkman stated. I do not in my. I do not comma in my possession. Berkman then admitted to giving the third party california company which sent out the robocalls of green light. Here's the other funny thing. Bergman's associate jacob wall then chimed in claiming that the robocall contents were conducted with publicly available registration information and that the robocalls were never never stated to quote stay home so he never stayed to stay home navarro. The prosecutor completed the hearing dave navarro yeah dave navarro. The prosecutor instructed everyone to live moss completed the hearing by shutting down's wool objection. She read the transcript back to the court where the last line of the call is quote. Don't beat don't be finessed into giving your private information to the man. Comma stay home wow see the other thing is that means berkman's as dumb as wool and I wonder the odds. There are two guys that dumb who are like able to function and you know clothe themselves of a vastly different of like different generations like how do these two even find each other yeah. Bergman's like 55 or something and jacob wallace what still 20 yeah. They remind me of like the the little gangster mice and looney tunes where one was like. That's very yeah and one was like big and dumb that was very good. I wonder if this is going to impact his only fans output well.

Jail is a great place to get even smaller I do not believe. Navarro played on under the bridge matt. I'm sorry damn it. He was only briefly in the chili pepper right yeah only after they had to let fruciani grow for the first time they brought in navarro for an album or two was that due to heroin yes was george washington chad yes george. Washington was a chat george. Washington was insanely chad he was huge for the time he was over he's six feet tall six feet tall which meant a lot back. Then he was always described as a physical specimen strapping powerful rebuilt physically intimidating he athletic very much so a writer and sportsman accomplished a military man of course but he was always in kind of ill health. He was like jack kennedy in that way. Jack. Kennedy was always the picture of virility in you know mid-century manhood but the dude was just wracked with. What was that the graves disease or the addison's disease and his and just was whacked out on painkillers. All the time oh yeah. But anyway he had terrible teeth that's true very bad teeth very and he was kind of miserable.

But he's the he's the most he was the quiet founding father. He was not an intellectual. Unlike all the rest of them he was the stem guy Washington was the stem lord because he was all about practical application. He was all about buying land and making it cultiva cultivatable and all that humanities nerd. He was a stem lord and incredibly repressed just like throbbing with suppressed emotion because he had this like weird. He was he was a guy who had come from like the middle. The whatever like kind of vestige of british english aristocracy was left in america. He kind of came from like the middle gentry part of it and he was very acutely aware of like not being fully being sort of semi-rusticated compared to like the higher levels of even american but certainly especially english society and he chafed under the under The belief that you know that the colonials were seen as lesser in some ways than in terms of refinement and you know breeding than english people than english people and it made him kind of miserable. This is always just like a throbbing but I think from outside he was He was viewed as a chat. He was also sterile or he might have been sterile. He's never had a child. No kids but I would say that he was definitely the chattest of the founders.

Six foot. Twenty fell off and he he got bled to death by his quack doctors not the last president to be killed by incompetent medical intervention amazingly enough I saw another one that asks I think less interestingly who is the most soy president but another one that I think is more interesting who's the most lunch pail guy nine to five no flash president eisenhower eisenhower yeah eisenhower. He he did the work but he did not make a show of it. He did not make it about him. He was a real caretaker he was really the last president. I'd say who like transcended partisanship you know. He was the last president because there's a real problem in the american system that we have the head of government and head of state being the same guy.

That's bad it confuses our politics because we have this understanding of our presidents as exemplars of the nation as a whole and then also as representatives of a faction of political of a political faction within that country and that those there's a conflict that gets to become psychic confusion and we end up fighting over like the symbolic role of the president. Like right now. I would say that trump and biden are almost the enti. The argument is almost entirely at the level of like what what is america what is the head of state as opposed to what government is going to do in the face of. I don't know catastrophic climate collapse a rampaging pandemic and a steadily worsting economic failure how about that nope we're talking about like this like people want to talk about how who to vote for if you want to get rid of wokeness like like there's a bill someone's going to pass to end wokeness or make wokeness. More like any of this stuff is this all happening organically within that culture as a response to accelerating material collapse and and the the the shredding of like the political fabric of meaning and like anybody investing in this.

And we have these clashing notions of the presidency and eisenhower was the last one where that kind of made sense because he was not really seen as embodying like a republican agenda because at that point the republicans had been so thoroughly cowed by the dominance of the new deal that they were almost a self-consciously they were they were in the position of the democrats are now. The republicans of the 50s were like the democrats now basically not I mean not as bad because they had more money. Like that. They still were you know institutionally powerful and they had a lot of They were able to hold on to like huge chunks of the midwest and the northeast. But they were having to sort of tack towards the center of this. Like this center-left country around the pole of the new deal and the new deal state and eisenhower instead of challenging that just sort of implemented it like from a common sense perspective by virtue of the fact that he was presenting it. It turned.

These you know new deal concepts into concrete and turned it into a consensus and he was the last I think president to really do that and I think one of the big reasons for that is because the real frictions that are going to come up during the period of economic growth when you know we stopped. Politics was still you know we still had political control over the economy but it was smoothing in such a you know. We were getting such return on investment during that period that we ended up talking about culture stuff. You know not as a distract not as a distraction from pressing economic concerns. But from an emanation of like a growing prosperity it really was happening like the economy was distributing gains evenly across the society which prioritized for younger people social issues and prioritized for you know minorities like a commitment. A access to this new prosperity and raised within white people for example willingness to change socially because they were being The social order was benefiting them and then this so but but then you had the people for whom that didn't apply and the crisis that emerged around things like civil rights and then vietnam war um break that and I don't think we've had a president who really captured that since reagan came kind of close after 84. Just but that's just speaking to the hegemony of you know dominant republicanism. But yeah. I'd say I but eisenhower did all that without without foregrounding himself during the whole during the whole course of his presidency. The fortist consensus that's it and so who better to represent that period than the the time when you go to work in the factory and then come home to your split level than the guy who went out to the golf course every day and signed off on alan dulles overthrowing another government and on them doing mk. Ultra and and then told america hey you know how we just built this giant military industrial complex. You might want to keep an eye on that bye peace that's a whoops I suspect. I know the answer to this question but I saw somebody posted earlier and I i guess. I was wondering about it. At least what your answer would be um which is lol nothing matters.

But what do you think of the rumors that bernie is trying to get in at labor in the biden administration. I mean as I have said the we know there was a war in the democratic party and we know the winner. The the conditions of their victory have not changed which means the leverage of the left versus them has not changed which means any concession to the left in the form of giving bernie sanders. A cabinet position would be on the terms of the party which means it would already be determined how much influence sanders would actually have how much ability to influence policy he would have and it would be judged acceptable like that's has to be assumed now you might argue even in that case that maybe he serves enough purpose to do it or you could argue that his acceptance his part being part of that administration will do more to camouflage it from criticism than push it in another direction. I would argue that that is the case because I see no reason to believe that the biden administration is not going to push austerity. Is not going to be a nightmare for working people in this country and that people coming to terms with that as quickly as possible is going to be the key to organizing resistance to it. Bernie doing fake work in the cabinet is only going to make it harder to get people to that point. I'm not saying they even will get there but he'll make it harder because I don't know why any where anyone is getting anything about biden's presidency being anything other than a intensification of obama's one of the things that I've been finding concerning about the way that I've been seeing some of the returns in this election going and seeing some of the democratic establishment talk about it. You were posting about this in a chat.

The other day matt a breakdown of voting groups by income and that trump still maintains a highest support. Among the richest members of the poorest areas yes right right the local barons but at the other hand yes the beautiful boaters the beautiful boaters. But on the other hand the democrats increasingly have the support of the richest people of the richest areas oh yeah. The richest zip codes in america. I think are all now represented by democrats. I didn't know that the congressional ten top wealthiest zip codes in america are yep. Congressional districts are all represented by democrats yeah if that's your doc if that's your if that's if that's if that is where your votes are now. I don't know how the hell you interrupt their progression how you turn them into anything other than another and a party of neoliberalism and the other thing. I was I was I um you know.

I was watching looking at some um breakdown of the early votes and basically seeing some some democrat democratic people talking about the white working class. As always throughout this entire time has solidified as a problem to be overcome not something to be reached out to and even more troublingly. A small but significant shift of black and latino working-class voters too republican even under trump as being something to be overcome not fought for and it's hard for me not to imagine that one of the outcomes of this election is just not a further entrenchment of that. The liberal party in this country is something that explicitly exists to act against the interests of the poor for the interests of the well-off yeah. The people have talked about a realignment party realignment and you know people talked about that in in terms of a some sort of socially conservative or socially liberal or socially conservative fiscally liberal like ethno-nationalist party that would you know be take trumpism to the next level. Things like the people have talked about tucker carlson representing that maybe and I've talked about how I think that that's not going to happen because there's no money in the tail. There's nowhere for them to actually from a position of being the republican party and being controlled by capital to offer anything realistically to make any play pilot. At persistent you know concession for about okay you win once now what you know I think more likely is that you have a d alignment along race which is what we might be seeing now in which case you have change. You have pulled apart. The two parties and now the divide line dividing line is no longer economic at all. It's off there are no real economic issues in the political sphere.

It's purely cultural and the two parties become the socially conservative. The republican party and the socially liberal democratic party I mean and that means that the racist the the minorities who disproportionately vote democratic because they ignore the social issues where they disagree with the democrats on in order to vote for economic issues that they think they're getting have now decided well. What I'm real I might as well get the make they're gonna make the same decision that a generation ago the reagan democrat white people did which is if I'm not gonna get any bread and butter. I might as well get some blood and thunder and they're going to do the same calculation and all of a sudden you're getting pulled away like huge chunks of working-class black support to republicans because they're the party against abortion and against homosexuality which they are as well and same thing in the latino and other minority communities where there are is social conservativism but it hasn't been salient to them because they thought there's something else. That's salient now race is the problem. There you would have to have some sort of de-racialization of like the white chunk and that's a big question but I feel like the if there's any movement we're seeing in polls.

Now. It's in that direction not anything else oh man we've gone an hour already yeah. We're we're we're gonna have to sign off. Here yeah. We gotta record our battle garage we're gonna go win a bit. We're going to talk about what's going on in the states and the government do you have your final picks locked in yeah.

I mean. I haven't thought about it. I'm going to go for the hip but anything. I say. I will believe because I feel like I've internalized all the data and I feel like anything. I say extemporaneously will have my full soul behind it with no no second guessing from the cheap seats well.

[62:19](https://youtu.be/9SkKfbwZJR0?t=62m19s)

Let's sign off and do that folks in the chat look forward to a beltway garage on your pod players and I would guess let's see. It's 5 p.m now six and a half hours yeah. Let's make that turn around go. It depends how much time. I want to spend making that song sound good but we're good wrong all right. Say bye-bye.
