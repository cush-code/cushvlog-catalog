Oh oh am I on here finally is it. Oh there we go. I always feel very very old when I'm trying to start the stream because sometimes it doesn't go and I had to do it three times and I was like oh boy so. I just. I'm like grandpa trying to get the damn vcr to work. Let's go. What where is this oh no embarrassing but I am old. I'm a boomer you can call me that I'm boomy boomy boom boom. I'm big boy boomer. I remember. I remember when vh1. I remember when mtv showed videos can you believe that yeah. I was writing about the world series. I said the dodgers and that made sense because like they've been so cursed right in the last few times they've gotten to the playoffs that what better time for them to win than in the most cursed season. Like that is an asterisk season.

I gotta say that seems like that seems like bad hoodoo feels like bad hoodoo. No thanks so. I was thinking today about how much how donald trump is a genius. I talked about a little bit on the show we just recorded and I think it's a good one. But there's a lot of talk about like trump's murder dumb and I think when you're talking about like the stuff that you're supposed to be that you're supposed to be doing when you're president traditionally like the job is theoretically supposed to contain no he doesn't care about that stuff and so it doesn't matter trump. I mean if genius is the ability through application of will and ability shape the world. The into some warped version of the world of the way you want to see it like that's. I would say the genius is when you are able to grab reality through some application of some ability mental or physical and some skill and some just in a deep bottomless desire drive towards it. A combination of those things is genius as we define it. That's how I define it anyway. Donald trump is a genius who applied his genius to the singular task of being famous and if you want to get simplistic about it.

It's because his dad never loved him and honestly that seems cliche. But you know a lot of the times it can be that simple. I mean when you see his pathological lifelong need to be recognized by others because of an in of this hugely indulged ego that centers a complete absence and a terror of of of being bad of being insufficient of being unloved and madly he seeks through his whole life to have people talking about him reflecting well on him. So he can fill that hole and he drove himself towards the goal the singular goal of being famous. However it happened was incidental like he wasn't a genius business. He was a very bad businessman but he didn't have to be good at business in fact his business plan was being famous.

He got so famous that once his ability to actually manage businesses was revealed to be non-existent and he started going bankrupt. His name was too valuable to let him actually lose any of that position or or equity because if he didn't own it well then who the hell did and then debts get called in and the whole thing falls apart and so his name became this thing that could also be used as a money laundering front and then he also became it was able to drive himself towards becoming a actual game show host and that's why he's president and then he ran for president because somebody's he was being talked about but in a negative way and it drove him crazy. He needed to drown out that negative thought and he did it by running for president and he wasn't trying and what I'm trying to say is that donald trump is a genius because this man who doesn't know or care about any traditional element of becoming a politician either from the point of view of having a political philosophy caring about anything politically one way or the other having any any coherent political beliefs at all and then trying to apply them to any subject from economics to civics ethics anything. Nothing and then also just like the the job of being a politician of of like conforming to sort of the the media ecosystem in such a way that you like maintain homeostasis.

You don't create too much sparks and tension and and and hostility. Whether you're able to stay under the radar and stay stay viable. By massaging you know all the instincts that all the stuff that goes into being a politician or a policy maker of any kind or a human being. He puts no effort into singular pursuit of fame meant that he became president by accident. He did a thing that some of the brightest minds of american history have sought with their entire body and spirits many of them have been dashed across against the rocks of their own ambition. Others of them few of them have miraculously made it to the ascent to the top all of them powered by this gnawing need to be The president trump just wanted to be the most famous person in the world and that just eventually led him to by definition becoming the president of the united states who is generally the most famous person in the world. So he wasn't trying to be president. He was trying to be the most famous person in the world and by seeking that so successfully and singularly he accidentally became president so trump's not stupid. What's stupid is any system that could produce that result any system that would create a political structure that would incentivize and and select for being psychotically good only at getting wrong attention to yourself.

But we bungled that that ship sailed but I honestly think trump's done for and today the real honestly more than any polls. I've seen and there have been some really eye-dropping ones or eye-popping ones. One that showed that trump is Trump won people who said they disliked both candidates by almost 20 points in 2016 and right now people who say they dislike. Vocal candidates prefer biden by almost that much like those the breakers and the late breakers last time went incredibly far for trump way out of proportion even to historic trends that's not going to happen this time almost by definition because he's the incumbent and and traditionally incumbents. Are not the choice of late-breaking voters like breaking voters tend to break against incumbents and then you have the fact that trump is. People look dislike him more than they dislike job unless you're a real psycho trump wrist.

[07:28](https://youtu.be/EBNrW_X0nMI?t=07m28s)

You don't really hate job and honestly do. They even really hate joe biden. He's sleepy joe. They have to make up the idea that he's a puppet of antifa. But most people don't think that because he's sleepy joe so. I don't even really hate him enough to like drive it successfully and yeah the covet spike.

I mean it was predictable. People all said brace for a second wave in the fall. It's because that's how these things work and yeah here it is. I mean we never got. It's not. It's our third wave because we unlike the rest of other a lot of other countries allowed us. They never really ended the first wave and created like a second wave of the summer. That's the real trump difference is that and you might honestly though if it turns out that we end up having this thing for years and we end up somewhere near here like actual herd immunity. Just by incompetence and inability to do anything else It ended up might not be a difference. Like this. You're gonna have the same number dead just like maybe different names but if there is some sort of biden coveted plan that's going to turn us around. Then I'm sure we'll see that but the thing is voters even if they don't believe that's going to happen. They're going to pick it. They're going to pick not this because they know this isn't working unless you already buy into trump premises. This isn't working but anyway the real nail in the coffin for me more than any of the polls.

 is the court ruling specifically the one today by a federal court. Just judge who is one of the most nakedly partisan just judges on the federal bench rejecting a a republican party. Injunction request to have a hundred thousand plus harris county votes invalidated because they were collected at a drive-through location instead of a fixed polling place. A classic fa absolutely fraudulent basis like prima facie ridiculous but that doesn't matter and the the judge. Today. The last hope of this thing he shot it down and to me this is confirming what I suspected which is that there is now no question that the the apparatus exists within the federal government just specifically within its judiciary and its currently aligned. State legislatures in key swing states that if there is anything like a close election the republican party has a veto override on the outcome. I I think that's true with coney coney 2020 on the bench I think it is. They have that the only question is when would. They press that button for trump and I say the answer is they wouldn't okay. I'm back on okay. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I've not been redacted. But I did lose my train of thought.

What was I saying oh why they're not gonna go out There's two It's essentially a question of how much they'll be willing to stick their neck out how much they're willing to break norms now. As I have said all norms will be broken if they have to be. But it is like an emergency type situation and will people in power in the republican party specifically in this judiciary and in these state legislatures where there's not as much scrutiny like not. No one of them is ever going to lose their job because they fail to stop biden from winning. People will just get mad at the deep state and the media and stuff and they'll get and they will not blame the dop for allowing it to happen I really don't think so so. They have the freedom to to operate off of their self-interest as members of a party clique which is they are what they are which are independent from the interests of trump and trumpism which is entirely based on his personal not even political objectives but personal like mood objectives and that there's no reason that they would want to have to spend being the party in power during a giant recession and continued covet crisis dealing with this guy's ego as the sole basis for party policy especially since they got what they wanted out of them. Judiciary locked up the veto in place if there ever comes a point like say.

Bernie was on the ballot this time and it was closer for some reason and there's a few jump states. They would press that they'd mash that button you wouldn't even have it wouldn't be a question of people matching it. Everyone would come spontaneously to the decision. The self-interested decision that this is what we're gonna do just like there didn't need to be a big plan before before the 2000 election as soon as that ball got in the air and it was tipped. They just everyone knew what to do because everyone knew what the stakes were at least the republicans of course. The democrats weren't doing that the republicans instantly knew what the stakes were and that's all you need is everyone understanding the stakes and moving towards those ends. At the same time. Then you have a spontaneous judicial coup and that will happen. But. I don't think it's going to happen in this election one because I don't think it's in it for in it for the average republican judge or republican legislator for trump to win really especially at the risk of deepening a political crisis that might eventually snap back in their face of course. There's no real reason to fear the current democratic party but you can't guarantee what's going to happen in even the median term considering how deeply deep the crisis is I mean. Some of these people know that but the other one and the other one is that I don't think it's going to be close enough. You would need to have like three or f the idea that's all going to come down to pennsylvania I just if that's the case polling is not a thing anymore.

Maybe it isn't but I think you need extraordinary evidence to make a claim so. I'm going to hold off and say for now since. I'm only predicting and this is why predicting things is stupid like. It's an if then situation if polls are broken. Then trump will win but like well are they. I don't know. No one knows you can't know. It's in insane but yeah predicting stuff. I talk about how like arguments online are exist just to be had and some in some cases. I think people are aware of that at some level and I think I hope people are aware at some level that like people predicting who's going to win that that is purely ornamental speech. But I don't know the way people get invested in it and the way that like they're signaling something by which thing they're predicting and how that speaks to their like overall credibility and whatever even though you're just talking about a snapshot of a moment and there's so many variables that nobody can have confirmed until we get some actual results. It seems like you're you're putting your. You're demanding too much of this as an emotional load star of conversation and and concern about investing ideas about who it is. I speak for myself. But I see a lot of people stressing about this stuff and I usually I've tried not to do too much of it. But it is literally tomorrow so. I'm kind of psyching up because I'm gonna have to talk about it a lot and then one way or another.

[14:39](https://youtu.be/EBNrW_X0nMI?t=14m39s)

I think there's going to be a big. It's really interesting so we're not going to get catharsis no matter what happens no catharsis. But I also don't think an explosion. But I also don't know if we can continue the level of pitchiness without an explosion. I think the only way to square that circle is if there's some sort of just thwarted orgasm ruined orgasm as they say in the internet and just sort of like a refractory period. I don't know. I just think everyone's still gonna be miserable and tense. There's not gonna be any kind of exhalation. But I was also like even if trump wins there's not gonna be some apocalyptic confrontation with the state. Even if trump does a coup. There's not going to be that there's going to be hyper normalization but how do we assimilate that at considering the level of tension and the fact that people are literally running out of money running out of money.

So there's a real material wick burning away in the background of all this cultural. Frenzy that the election is provoking and that's the thing that's really driving it like that's the actual engine and it doesn't appear to be that there's any chance that it's going to be extinguished before it hits. The pile of dynamite lame dump trunk will be very fun. Lame dump lane dump trump lame. Duck trump will be funny very funny. I honestly think that if it's with if it's around nine or ten points which I think is really reasonable at this point to think of as an interp of a vote gap. I think even with states not declaring right away. I don't think trump's gonna have anything like the ambiguity in the air to even get the wheels spinning especially. When you see these early decisions kind of setting the tone um but he and so he's gonna give it a go. I think but the thing to remember about trump.

The most fundamental facet of him is that he is a coward which means that as soon as there's a bit of resistance he will crumble as soon as he makes a half-assed like request to like the joint chiefs and then they they rebuke him. He will shrivel up like a turtle dick ah the famous turtle dick simile yes. I've got turtle dicks on the mind because I'm always not far from thinking about mitch mcconnell. I would be funny if he like literally crumbled into dust as soon as The new congress is inaugurated like he just he willed his body to stay together long enough to get the judiciary completely zipped up for a generation and then he just transcended the physical realm am I not sir at long last totally enough for the turtle club. Sir. I ask you have you no sense of turtlehood at long last.

I mean people are going to go a little nutty that's going to be interesting. But I see the vast majority of these suburban warriors. Everyone's kind of deciding to freak out about they're not going to do anything they're not gonna do anything. There might you might see some some of those awesome like protests like where they drive onto the road and just park their cars. It's perfect like you could hey go to the drive-in and get a. Guess get a soda and a burger and then just sit there and honk your horn. What are they gonna storm. State houses. They're gonna raid armories. No they're not going to do any of that a couple of their more unbalanced kids might do some sort of elliot roger. But that's at this point that's just a background radiation of american life and then of course you gotta factor in domestic gladio. But I honestly think for at least a little bit. I think that the powers that be are gonna try to down like tamping up was good for a while. It was especially good when bernie was going on tamping up was good but now especially especially considering how high it got. They're gonna want to tamp down a little bit so I wouldn't be surprised if the gladios got turned down although instead of or the gladios get busted more and you get just a bunch of fake fbi entrapment stings.

Like the one they did in michigan to justify like the state and and like turn the left around on on the deep state basically because hey we live in reality and these institutions are the only thing standing us between us and the ravening mob. The fascist hordes I'm sorry. We have to corral them it'll be very interesting to see how q metabolizes the trump loss at this point. I'm sure most of them are too far gone to consider that oh no maybe this was a dumb idea. I think some of them will because you know not everybody's at the same level of commitment and of an imaginative you know an emotional identification and transference to it. You know like people internalize concepts like cued at a point where it's like an identity and once that's the case nothing can change it because it's too fundamentally existentially terrifying because if you're not that what are you and that's a question that most people don't want to answer so it will have to for some good chunk of these guys.

It's going to have to be turned into something else and it'll be very interesting to see like trump is occluded. Is he is he going off to to summon god's angels and commence like a right like wait for the sign of his return. I think that stuff might be I mean if it is just a modern-day gloss on the the evangelical christ story. Then it would make sense that it would it would culminate with like. I think a a figure who essentially becomes the messiah like trump is no longer just because you know for for christians right for self-identified christians. Their leaders are their ideas of jesus you know that's one of the big reasons that people said that's so hypocritical for them to love trump so much. But they viewed trump as like this embodiment of Like this embodiment of all the that is worldly and corrupt but who it has like a godly soul which is of course the fate of all christians who know deep down that they lived the botched and fallen lives that they are totally slaves to the flesh slaves to the lives. They have that they don't really have a spiritual sense at all and that they but they seek to transcend that that shadow knowledge and trump going into occlusion. Basically him stepping down for power can become some sort of passion play that you know will presage a redemptive resurrection that will then finally abolish the distinction between the world matter and the kingdom of heaven so. I'm looking forward to it if that happens it'll be fun.

[22:59](https://youtu.be/EBNrW_X0nMI?t=22m59s)

 everyone has such opinions about daylight savings. I can't I can't seem to care. I don't know I like the fall back. I like the extra hour. I know people don't like that it gets dark early but it doesn't really bother me. It's not like abolishing the penny which I am much more passionate about. It's just a symbol of how the like the the built the dependency bias of like a large bureaucratic state is genuinely infuriating. It's one of those things that you need to have like democratic controls on the mechanisms of state to prevent like when it comes down to it. The reason we still have pennies is because there are more people who are more deeply invested in the production of pennies than there are people who are even aware of like pennies as a stupid thing that we shouldn't have like because the it's essentially. I think the copper lobby or something wants to maintain demand as a lobby that keeps the bucket that makes sure nobody even comes near the penny and who's going to make the penny their priority and that's what you would need you'd need enough people to have make the penny their priority to make it a litmus test of involvement in government or politics and that's just not going to happen because who is what is the vested capitalist interest in not having the penny and since there isn't one it'll just continue forever and that is a small silly example but it it. It's this rolling ball of gunk that fills every piston of governance and you know. People say that that's that's like oh that's bureaucracy.

That's the nature of the state well no in this case. In a lot of cases. It's the nature of capitalist capture of the state like the specific interest capture that's part of the broader you know assimilation between like ideally. I think from the from the liberal model of the state. Not the way it is. But the way they theorize it is that yes you know they will admit maybe if you really corner them all right yes liberal the liberal government liberal bourgeois government.

It really is the executive committee of capitalism but I'm a liberal. I think capitalism is good and if we're going to have it which we should we should have it integrated into a system of democratic check that can prevent the colliding and uncoordinated short-term interests of specific capitalist concerns from leading to a accumulation of inefficiency and conf waste more than anything that essentially make the government no longer functional either and and turn eventually government towards the specific interests or perceived interests of a smaller section of capital. That maybe doesn't know what the it actually does want maybe it because it cannot see beyond the end of its nose and it brings the whole edifice down and they would say no we don't want that we want we want. We want a seamlessness there between the interests and and they and checking the emergence of like specific capital formations taking power. Over the overall you know mechanism of government and conservatives point to that and say no look. This is bureaucracy. This is bureaucracy.

This is this is the doom of the liberal cons. This is the doom of the liberal conception of state and liberals. Only real response is No we gotta just get rid of the corruption. But it's like well where how if the whole system is powered by money at every point and it is just a piston response system of industries you know engaging with industries and and capitalist individuals in firms and such and individually like interacting with the government and producing outcomes that they want for themselves eventually wherever there's more concentration of capital. There's gonna be more concentration of influence and that means. There's no way to have the system that you're imagining you can have unless you eliminate profit and you eliminate capitalism from the mechanism and you clear that out of the out of the the pistons of the state bureaucracy. So that's like a a central right-wing critique of like the liberal project and once again as with all these things the finger points backward.

It's not crony capitalism. It's capitalism. Capitalism becomes crony inherently. No matter what kind of equal playing field you're starting from and of course you're never starting from one. It just accumulates pockets that then self-deal. So even your even your. I idealized liberal state will not be able to prevent specific interests from overwhelming any generalized interest because remember the liberal idea is sure yes. It's capitalism. It's it's the it's the executive board of capitalism. But capitalism is just the accumulated choices of people that's the liberal idea. It's like the yeah of course. The market should be this the total thing because the market is the expression of choices of people and therefore what they want to do is what should be done and therefore the state should just coordinate it and make sure that it's it can't exist within like a a a safe space of like market transaction but even on its own terms it fails because of the unequal distribution of capital within industries and within interest segments and demographics that buckle it and turn it even away from your idealized notion of a general will that is expressed through the market transactions. You got to get rid of the profit you gotta get rid of the capitals.

You have to just you have to socialize the surplus you have to socialize the surplus. I would love to be an admiral someone said general will admiral matt what was the other one who is felix going to be colonel colonel yeah. He's he's like those ops guys you know. They don't want to be on a desk. So they're not general generally maybe a captain. Even I'm definitely an admiral.

[29:57](https://youtu.be/EBNrW_X0nMI?t=29m57s)

I'm not really cold. It's in the 40s. It really is. I run hot anyway and I grew up in the frozen wastes. So I generally don't get very cold. Can you see my breath. But I gotta say a lot of people are wondering what's going to happen in the coming weeks and months and I've decided and it's going to be a little bit because I've made a few commitments. I now realize you know in the immediate going on. Some other shows to talk about what I think is going to happen. I'm really hoping though that like after sort of getting it out of my system. Following this you know this specific pageant that we all get psychically fixated on every two years or four depending on your level of intensity of worship um oh yeah. I'm going to stop trying to predict anything because without the election coming up there's nothing to peg it on. It's all vaguely in the future and so there's less of a pressure to specifically opine on things going to happen so. I'm going to try as much as. I can I'm going to make a conscious effort to reduce my amount of predicting things because it really is 

It's catnip. It's it's. It's a it's a It's an analgesic for the brain people are saying is chapel. Gonna be funny undermine. I honestly think it's gonna be a whole new. I know this is self-serving but if mine wins there's going to be some hijinks because like he's going to be president. You know his brain is jelly. He is so out to launch in a completely different way than trump is which means we're not going to get you know. It's not going to be boring just very funny and then the fact that they're going to have to dress up whatever like monstrous neoliberal regime. They're going to do out in like like inclusive woke language and the army of people who are gonna try to do it on its behalf and the number of people who are gonna go from like prison abolitionists to like talking about working within the system and understanding like what the realm of the possible is. Oh that's going to be finger looking good seriously. They're going to be so many people who couldn't support bernie because he didn't he was like against. He wasn't for reparations or some bending over backwards to defend this old. White man imposing this austerity authoritarian neoliberalism. It'll be it'll be worthy fodder for japes and amusements. I think and the way they're gonna like have kamala out there to try to like remind people.

Hey. They're a few. It's not. It's not. It's not this old skeleton. There's a new pup. There's a new bottle. I'm gonna we're gonna do a ritual dances like the spirit of the party is gonna infuse me and now it's gonna be all bouncy and inclusive to match our messaging. Even though the actual policy is the same cheese grater to the soul that we will be subjected to no matter. What man I got to say that that video of of of schumer saying I got. I heard about this veteran who lost his job to decoved and then got his house taken away and killed himself and how as a result we're going to introduce legislation to require police to require and fund local police to do inter self-harm interventions. I mean this is this is the ratchet effect. It's like you make the life on top intolerable and then conditions of intolerability create You know pathologies and then you you put all of your energy into fighting.

These things that are direct outgrowths of the system like look at pieces of politicking I've seen in a long time. I honestly say more like self-consciously evil than almost anything trump's done so the boy the boy wonder. Macron knows that he is on a knife's edge that he is like the the opinion poster man. For this. This unbridled neoliberal state that is like coming for the french way of life like they're fighting but they're coming for it and the resistance to that is. It's. It's. It's not polarized the law from right to left culturally like there's a big right-wing chunk of it like like the front national and then you know you got melanchon and stuff and macron knows that you know the french love love picking somebody to fix this intractable crisis not do anything and then get really mad at them and throw them out and he doesn't want to be that he doesn't want to be chump bait so what he's doing is.

He has decided to declare war on like a separatist islam in order to polarize that right-wing populism towards him and mobile and and and undermine the the the risk that the national front and marine le pen who le pen was the opponent in the last the run-off opponent to the winner in the last two presidential elections and and I think got a significantly larger vote. The second time he saw the writing on the wall potential the arc of that and he wanted to interrupt it very much like cameron deciding to do a brexit vote to neutralize ukip cynical manipulation of a cultural problem that is caused by the fact that I mean yeah there's like cultural issues with france in assimilating anybody. But there's this fundamental you know perpetuating neoliberal austerity and specifically the fact that like that french you know way of life was never really extended to um muslims who came to france and and they exist as a economic underclass and these things cannot and will not be addressed. Instead. You hit the beehive with a stick to get everyone frenzied to to essentially make any kind of class project impossible and now like. Horrible shit's gonna happen like the guy gets killed a teacher gets killed there's attacks and people say well look at this is this proof he was right. It's like well. He's right that there is a problem that he literally is completely invested in not doing anything about except to profit from the creation of it. Monetizing the rock politically someone says do.

I think that chapel would have been funnier if hillary had won. I know that that's what we thought at the time because we had basically prepared for hillary winning and had a had an idea what to do with it I don't know. I mean she's very funny but she's also kind of she's got um. She's got x-pock heat. You know what I mean and yes some of it is some of it is gendered. I'm not. I'm going to admit but it's not entirely like hillary. Clinton has a transparent hatred that she hides behind this screen of fakeness that is so revolting to me anyway and yes. It's probably gendered to a degree. But it's it's. I feel it like resonating like off of like but my fillings and I don't know if that would have like made it less amazing over time or if that would have made it funnier. I don't know I do think we did pretty good making fun of giving the business to the old orange the old the old mango mussolini the old cheeto in chief. The saffron the saffron satrap.

[38:36](https://youtu.be/EBNrW_X0nMI?t=38m36s)

I don't know but we're gonna find out if making fun of you know the the wokification of neoliberalism will be as funny. I mean. I do think that the the the hairpin turn that's going to happen with the maximalist rhetoric around around around identity issues that has been whipped up like the notion that we are in this like hell hole of white supremacy that requires immediate revolution and that you can't reform this. I think that is gonna pop and watching the fallout from that is going to be uniquely entertaining and seeing the entire media try to act like. Not only is this decrepit old man some sort of civil rights icon and slay queen but that he's not mentally incapacitated because you've got to figure he's they're not gonna be able to do. I mean trump proves that you don't actually have to do anything to be president. I mean he watched tv all day like they could put him in front of a tv. It wouldn't even have to be on um but you still have to give speeches you know and you still have to do semi-regular contact just to like shape the narrative because you know you're the one everyone looks to and that's going to be a lot of stress. On the brake pads. He's going to be smoking and you'll have an attire and the media will be very funny to watch to watch. These guys who spent the last four years you know doing the whole resistance insurgents thing you know. P descent is patriotic deciding that the deep state that the the police the police power of the united states is now legitimate oh man that's going to be funny. John biden was pretty sharp in the debates. I said although the first one he was really blown off the blocks by trump and then he had a very hard time centering his like stream of consciousness. I don't know it's like next to trump.

I guess it's okay but he really does get. He can you see in his eyes. He doesn't know where he is I guess. I would say and that happened multiple times during the debates like you could. There. There would always there was a there's these moments when you know you're arguing. It's like answer the question and somebody will like have to be like wait. What was the question because you know it was a long clause. He would have those moments but you could tell it wasn't about what the question was. It was like deeper than that it was where am. I what is this like he was having to go. He was having to like collect himself more than just what question were you asking like there's no there's no adherence to anything other than the very narrow tunnel in front of him. He has this way that he like tries to name three things and by the third one he just runs out of gas.

He was talking about how trump is inciting racial hatred and he goes praising charlottesville telling them they're very fine people building a wall. It's all a mexican's rapist just going out there and doing all kinds of stuff. I can't get to a third specific. Example can't actually engage beyond just the most capaciously nerf like sentences and and and phrases that just it's like it's like somebody getting like a diamond ring in a giant box filled with p packing peanuts like there's like the actual the actual content of the senses he says even in a debate where people said he was good are just these tiny little kernels and it's just the rest of it's just peanut packing peanuts and I don't know how that gets better. I wouldn't be surprised if they try to have him step down depending on how like the the whole operation goes.

I mean maybe maybe dr jill. Biden is the 21st century edith wilson. Maybe she's able to lock that comeback like hillary sneaks in disguised as a as an intern. I do not think that he will run for reelection that's for sure. It's funny as that would be and I also have to say though like whatever adrenochrome based therapies they have for these guys work well because before the primary before the convention. I was half convinced and a few times. I was able to fully convince myself that they were going to try to switch him out because he was transparently not up for the job. I think eventually they realized that kovid kind of covered for a lot of it and they were able to reserve him. They were able to keep him like on the battery saver mode in a way they wouldn't have been able to do. He didn't really do a basement he was out and about but like they were able to curtail it in a way they would have been able to do if it was a normal election and I didn't maybe. I didn't anticipate that how how well that would go in terms of not hurting his polling like I kind of my assumption was him not being out. There was gonna hurt his polling but no turns out he's the alternative.

All these things are set all this stuff's baked in nobody's really considering moment-to-moment changes really other than at the margins and those people aren't really paying attention to you know how much he talks and what he sounds like in his or his record or anything. Like that. He's just the not trump option which I think is going to be the more popular option and so they got him through they're going to get him through election day. I don't know at the rigors of the office like. I said it might not be rigorous but it's going to be a question of the power dynamic that emerges in the white house and that's the thing.

I can't know so once again. I'm see. I'm still. I'm still predicting things. I'm still toothpaste out of my tube and leave me a dry husk. You know.

I thought I think jim. Carrey's joe biden impression is actually a decent impression of joe biden like he kind of has the same croaky voice and and like some of the same intonations as him. The difference is is that he is much more coherent than joe biden which is why it's not a funny impression and the reason. It's. It's. It's not good as like an impression for something like snl is because impressions are supposed to exaggerate things to make them funny instead what jim carrey has done is. He has taken all the absurd things about joe biden and sanded them down into a less terrifying least incoherent like like a friendly grandfather like they literally had him do the fred robinson. Did fred robinson the the mr rogers. Like they're they're they're not trying to say wow isn't that they're trying to like enforce that that's manufacturing consent because the snl writers are and cast are in an unprecedented fashion just clearly doing propaganda on behalf of the biden campaign because they literally brought a guy in who's known for doing big.

Wacky exaggerated stuff to do a version where joe biden is boringly coherent and maybe he'll just maybe he maybe he wanders off a little bit grandpa but you know at the end of the day. He's still he's still sharp as attack. He's spry. I mean that's a that's a that's serving a campaign function of course. Maybe. It's just the fact that like they already don't really exaggerate anything about trump for baldwin. That's because you can't exaggerate trump. I think you can exaggerate biden or you could at least not do the opposite of humor with the character. Like this they're trying to be funny with trump. They're deliberately not being funny with the biden impression.

They're putting their thumb on the scale and the thing is it's like if you're a conservative. I can see why that's alienating it allows you to feel like you're oppressed and if you're not oppressed. But I can understand why seeing like all of the tv stations of which we only have a finite number. All the things that have like a cachet of mainstream culture and are accessible across like a broad demographic are all in alignment against you. I mean that's why they give. I can see why they go crazy over it yeah like That's why the good impressions of trump not mine because I do try to exaggerate it. But I'm trying to just like do a soul. I'm just trying to do a soul impression. People are trying to like make it sound like him. You can't make it sound like him more and make him funnier. You can just sound like him and then it's what you talk about and it's just doing a it's. It's having his words come out of the mouth of someone else and about something else folks you can't do it. You're so good. Scooby-doo sees doobie doo but he doesn't do.

I have kept up with a good lord bird still have not warmed to it. I guess. I see what he's trying to do. It's not terrible. I just haven't really found it terribly engaging like forgetting any ideological or historical issues with it. I have found a lot of just the stuff isn't very interesting. I mean it just doesn't it doesn't interest me as a gloss on the material which you know. I'm familiar with like. I'm not really learning a lot here. So it's an interpretation and I'm not really grabbing. It's nothing that grabs me. The come lord bird come on that's chat come on. I think we're better than that very very crude fargo. Ooh terrible really bad pretty impressively bad. No this season is bad hush up sprinkles not jimmy's. I'm not a southerner. I'm not a south run. I don't know there's like nothing. I like about like the fargo season. I don't like the heavy-handed way that it plays its its themes. I don't like a lot of the performances that like that the italian brother is like. He's in a silent movie and chris rock is not a good actor never has been. He's a stand-up comedian and the characters aren't interesting. I don't know.

I'm not a fan um if trump wins revolution no to put it lightly. No the one thing I know is that if trump wins it will be by stealing it but that no matter how if he successfully steals it it will be not metabolized as a coup. It will have a patina a fig leaf of legitimacy enough so that as outraged as people get they will for the most part talk themselves off of the precipice of doing anything about it because at the end of the day they are relatively comfortable only in the sense that they would perceive their precarity more than anything. They could win out of some sort of apocalyptic confrontation with the state. But I think that anything that would like actually look like a coup to the point where it could not be metabolized. You know just canceled election guns in the streets that kind of thing they wouldn't do that like. I said the forces that would do that are not invested in trump enough to do it on his behalf.

So it won't happen ah waukesha wisconsin fascinating place so crucial waukesha county as it's called is one of the gop strongholds in wisconsin. It is the county directly west of milwaukee and it is the white flight headquarters. It is where everybody went in the 60s Once the blockbusting within city neighborhoods was successful and they are very concerned about public transit out. There they really don't like the extension of bus lanes. They really don't like the idea of any metropolitan rail system. We had a we had a mayor of milwaukee who was like kind of a mini daily. There he was got he was mayor for like 16 years. His his machine ran the city. His name was norquist and his single policy objective of his 16 years in office was to extend some sort of light rail system connecting the suburbs to the city and it was the providing political project of the generation of politicians. That scott walker emerged out of actually the guys around mike mark belling and like the talk radio and and like waukesha county republican political leader you know formation and and they vote a lot.

They vote. Their votes come in suspiciously late sometimes and they off they often form the the margin in a lot of like off-year races and stuff like especially supreme court which is lamentably elected in wisconsin which means for a long time. Right wing would just buy it by spending more on ads than their democrats could raise once again because they know the stakes but yeah it's very racialized as you could imagine milwaukee being one of the most violently segregated big cities in america. I think number one by many metrics. I I went to college there but of course like it's been diversifying a little bit. Recently the irony of irony is there for me is that so waukesha was originally a resort town. It had a it had a system of hot springs so people would come and take the waters and albert parsons actually. One of the haymarket martyrs after the haymarket bombing fled chicago and he was hiding out in waukesha before he turned himself in but there was a like a water war with chicago over the waters from the hot springs from waukesha and it saw like armed confrontations over people digging pipelines and now 100 years later. Not only are the springs all gone or if they.

I sure as hell don't know if there's anywhere you can go and take them if you can. But the water table is contaminated with radon and they want access to milwaukee's water. The place that they fled the county right next to the lake that has access and privilege to whitewater thanks to the great lakes compact which is to prevent any areas outside the immediate contact area of the great lakes from accessing it in the coming thirsty times and now they want hey you know we like fled and took all of our tax money with us and you know created a hyper-segregated social corridor sanitary that we heavily policed could we get. Some of your water please ours is all gross well. The water war is between places that currently have access to great lakes places that want it like for example. Arizona arizona wants great lakes water and the great lakes compact is a regional agreement to prevent that from happening but I don't think that's going to stop it from getting privatized and purchased at some point all right guys.

I hope everybody's excited for tomorrow. I hope everybody's ready to take a potato peeler to their frontal lobe. One way or the other metaphorically by observing and absorbing and having wash over you the results of our magnificent democratic pageant we will probably I kind of think we will not we will not have a call. There will be no check mark. There will be no call to on election night because I think the the media is so neurotically fixated on not accidentally helping trump. Do a coup that they're not gonna do that But I think that you will probably know before you go to bed who won if it's biden that would be my prediction and I would say that since I think like. I said I think 9.
