Um okay my knees people are very excited about bucks. It's it's good to have like a major piece of cultural real estate reaffirm. You know your demands. That's it's it's very validating and and it helps morale for sure it definitely. I think that's for sure in this in in this society for especially so that's good so. I have no no complaints obviously. I wouldn't criticize them for doing it that would be churlish and I think people should be excited. But I think people need to also be a little realistic. I think people are kind of hoping that this snowballs into something but I feel like that's sort of what everybody is doing. All the time is hoping that the next demonstrative act leads to in a sort of bunch of copycat behavior and I'm not and that is not because anybody is making a bad analysis. In fact. I would say they're making a correct analysis of the city society. They live in like the kind of social organizations we would need to coordinate action don't exist what we have instead is the hope that we could that individuals could be simultaneously inspired by the act of someone else and that that's what we have kind of. I've been banking on and I think that there's a role to play for that. It's just.

I worry that it becomes a totalizing theory of change ugh yeah. I got a mug I switched to a mug tonight. It's just water actually not even seltzer. I'm out of water ooh what if the romans never left britain well. I mean that's really covered in escape from rome among other things. But one of the reasons that the british political system proved dynamic enough to accommodate the cultural revolution relative to the stagnant. Monarchies of of the continent like france for example was that because roman rule collapsed apocalyptically there leaving very little civic remnant that as a result british society rebuilt along more horizontally oriented lines of authority just because there were no existing nodes of authority to to build up from that's why you have like the common-law tradition and cinder. But those elements as were progressive in in in the past in the past in that they helped create a political culture that instead of allowing the industrial revolution to like fatally undermine social balance of powers like it did in a lot of other countries and that's why it was suppressed and kind of kept away for and for so long The brits were able to accommodate it because the romans weren't around long enough and with enough residual influence to shape their political structures towards the sort of absolutist trend and specifically like high rule by large land owners that makes the emergence of bourgeois much harder.

I had to take it. I took a I took an ancestry dna test yes. I know they have my dna whatever they have anything anyway. I underst I understand why people who aren't enmeshed in these networks should try not to to stay not enmeshed in them. But I feel like I lost my soul a while ago so. But we were gonna do an episode about it that we never really got around to where we were going to talk about like the weird politics and cultural resonance of this genetic history stuff and the way it recreates a lot of kind of terrifying racial essentialism. Honestly not a good. It's really not been a great development. It plus like hyper awareness of race as like a a as a perceived positive social force. It's a it's a back and of course deepening economic contradictions in crisis.

This is not a good stew but anyway. I did take the thing yes. It gave me basically what I assumed. I would get which is mostly northern northern europe germany it looked. I got. It was like a map with a bunch of lines coming off of it. Germany denmark england. I think nor france a little bit or belgium or something and then the big surprise 15 mediterranean which usually means italian but of course as we all know. This is pseudoscience what they're doing is. They're taking mark markers that appear predominantly or not even predominantly but like statistically more likely in certain areas than others and then assigning that in your dna to that group that's not science because for any one individual person those could be from anywhere so yeah. You're saying you probably are from here you might be. But it's barely above a guess which is not how people take it. People are like well. I'm 25 percent freezian 36 percent waloonian and I've got a third. got a half a s a half a percent swabian. It's all just made up. But I mean I would not be surprised if my actual like real ancestry. In terms of the people not weird allele blobs was aligned that line all.

I really the only real clues. I have is. I was born. I was born in wisconsin born. My family has all been like multi-generational from wisconsin. My last name is christman my mother's mask. My mother's maiden name is even more german sounding than that. It has two ends which are the real german sounding names or the ones with two ends and that both of my grandparents were catholic families. I put two and two together and it comes out bavaria. But I mean I honestly feel like if you don't have relatives who are alive that you could visit in another country. You aren't really from there and you shouldn't really identify that way. It's kind of dumb. It's it's it's it's It's basically astrology. It's the exact same sort of deal of like trying to take a random thing and then like tack your personality around it intentionally like self-hypnotize yourself into an identity that is is essentially synthetic. So like if you visited family members in in another country where they live you know and and certainly you don't get to cut. And if you got a yeah. I was going to say if you have like dual passports but those irish guys those irish passport. So that's also a bunch of baloney.

 aldo morrow assassination false flag. I would say not even possible. I would say it's probable when you look at the fact that morrow was in the process of negotiating to bring the communists into government for the first time in the post-war history of italy in the middle of the years of lead in which the vast majority of terror attacks including ones that were publicly blamed on red brigade. communists were being carried out by the p2 masonic lodge black aristocracy fascist paramilitary groups that gladio funded with bob mub money funneled through the vatican bank hilariously enough and in fact moro before he was kidnapped. He was he visited the united states and kissinger gave him a talking to about the communists that I don't think there's a record of what he said. But there is a record that after morrow got out of his office he was essentially shell-shocked. He was stunned and he like talked about how he was gonna quit so and then you got. The actual case itself has a the evidence like oh you know all italian. criminal cases is all over the place but there's a fair degree of eyebrow-raising stuff. One of the most interesting one of the fun. one of the things that I think is funny just in terms of you know circumstantial evidence is is that the kidnapping of moro was it wasn't like. I mean my god like by the way they the gladio also or the like. The gladio network the south africans probably killed olaf palm but that assassination really could have just been any crank. The guy was. He never had bodyguards. He was walking off out of a movie theater shot him in the back. Morrow was in a motorcade and his guards were like eliminated with machine guns by guys dressed as cops. There aren't a lot of of genuine left-wing kidnappings and terror attacks from that era with that kind of coordination. If you look at like the ship spider-man hop pulled in germany. The just hilariously botched bloody goofy mops that those guys pulled off while they were trying to kidnap or assassinate german like capitalists.

How close are we to a civil war stop it. There's not gonna be a civil war who are the two sides in the civil war tell me who the two sides are hassan has asked me to come on the stream and I would love to I'll be honest on stream in the future because we're gonna be chris. And I are gonna be adding a I guess. I should announce this here. The there is like they're already. I know people have asked like could you get an audio only version of these which I totally get because I don't watch youtube videos. I really only listen to podcasts in terms of engaging with audio media on the internet But I also am dullard and lazy and don't know what I'm doing technologically so like they've been bootleg. our rss feeds of the audio of this which is fine by me. But we're gonna be creating a like mixed and like audio spike audio juiced podcast stream for the vlogs all of them and that'll just be going on to all of your podcasting app applications incl and spotify which we are on. We're talking about the civil war though before that see people say it's going to be anti-5 versus militia. I'm sorry. I don't I've talked. I think I've. I hope. I've expressed enough why. I don't think that's a real thing why. I don't think that this is a real demonstration of social forces so much as a a performance by people who have self-radicalized away from a a fundamentally apathetic and a political public. You might see a breakdown of social order that will then be reasserted from beloved above technologically and militarily. But I just don't think that that's a civil war does anybody know about the greensboro massacre have you ever guys ever heard about that. I'm curious how how well-known that event is on like online. Left circles has anybody heard of the greensboro massacre.

All right. We got a lot. Some no's. We got some yeses don't know. I'd say. I'm gonna go. It's probably honestly. It's like 60 40 note of yes yeah. So In 1979 a bunch of members of the communist workers party which was a maoist group that came out of the whole. The new left was getting ready to do a big anti-clan march in greensboro north carolina and there had been a escalating series of provocations between the two leading up to that and there was a lot of heated rhetoric. It was called death to the clan was the name of the march and while they were setting getting ready they were getting their pickets ready and while they were marshalling for the parade. A carloads of members card-carrying members of the american nazi party and the local clan organization pulled up and there's video of this. Their people had camcorders. They took rifles out of their trunks of their cars. They walked over to where the communists were. They started shouting and and there was an exchange of of insults and then fists and swinging I believe there was maybe one gun on the side of the of the marchers.

But at some point the clan guys and the nazi guys just opened fire and they killed five people and wounded over 12 others. they were all charged and and charged with first-degree murder and they were all acquitted on under self-defense and later it came out that the that the klan groups which had informants within them which all those clan organizations did. They were half of them just like it's hilariously just like the communist party half of the klan in the 60s were feds and they local police had a tip that the local clans was planning to do something violent to the the the communists and they sat on it and this happened and these guys got acquitted in that was in 1979 and I just bring that up to say that as horrifying as what we're seeing happen is I noticing a trend where people are without even knowing it seeking some ratification of the horror that they're imagining like. I talked about yesterday and things like that things like what happened in kenosha. It really fires that cylinder like but apparently the person who did this. I was talking the other day about how a 19 year old kid running for you. Know state senate is an expression of a meat of a of a movement that is not being organized that is that is individuals acting individually a 17 year old. fascist gunman is similarly indicative of a movement that is uncoordinated apparently.

He went there because like somebody tweeted about it or did a facebook post about how like hey let's come up. Let's go up to kenosha and he just grabbed his ar and he went up there. I mean that is an expression of the kind of social enemy that is bringing everything to the. It is but one of the big symptoms of that is that people don't organize effectively. They come together along axises of shared interest an affinity but they are always self-interested and that means that they cannot coordinate and that means we're not going to get a civil war and people pointing out the horrible fact that the cops basically let this guy get away with it. At the time. I mean he's arrested now but they were hands off him all day and they they didn't. They didn't engage him after he'd shot yes of course that's horrifying and proof of whose side these guys are they are reactionary forces they are. They are filling the role that there is such as it is for a social expression of the coming authoritarianism or end latent and current authoritarianism. But it's a narrow thin strip. It's not a big fat steak full of social like organization. The way that the nazi party was the way that fascism was in italy The thing you have to worry about is that the cops that are the power that they really represent the cops to the power. They really represent that is where the authority rests. That is that is one of the load-bearing structures of this edifice and that has to be attacked directly that has to be attacked head on and I i.

I think that there's a there is a libidonal desire to have a public confrontation that will be satisfying you know what I was talking about yesterday that will be satisfying personally to engage in to finally see the fight brought about. But. I don't think that that is recognizing the broader moment and the real the reign of struggle which is organizing which is mobilizing. Now. There is an argument to be made that these public displays have that propaganda of the deed function and I would say yes but like with anything you have to do a cost-benefit analysis and is the benefit of that propaganda of inspiration is it offset by the way that it counter mobilizes among the enemy pushes away. The unengaged and distracts from meaningful work opportunity cost and my main concern about the current moment is that no one seems to be even aware that that cost-benefit analysis has to be made because everyone knows that no one's really in charge and so they don't want to say don't do a thing to people who are going to do it. Anyway. You're left having to defend it as a maximal position why because that accords with letting everybody do what they want everybody do what they want which is what they think is good for everybody but is really just good for them the way that it's good. It's fun to yell in the face of people having brunch you know the way that it's fun to to to smash a fash if you're that kind of person or doxyfash if you're that kind of person or just call other people fash to win arguments.

If you're that kind of person eric jr and john and don jr and eric both had tarot very bad speeches. eric is just hilarious because he's complaining about the working man being left behind like you've nev you've never. We watched him work for that show we watched that was on fox where it was one of his job is picking the cover of the of the magazine that they just put in the hotels. But they bring four out and they lay him in front of him and he goes we were thinking this one. They actually push one towards him and he goes yeah. I think that one too like they might as well just put peanut butter on it and had him lick it like he was mr edge to make him look like he was talking. They're dollars and they've never worked for anyone but their father and they've never held a meaningful position of authority or influence anywhere. They've never done any of the things that they demand.

Everyone else do to just deserve to live in. This country serve in the military build a small business disgusting pig boys and the fact that anybody likes them and the fact that I mean previous generations working like people talk about how you know a lot of the a lot of the stuff in culture. A lot of the cultural changes of the last 40 years would be alienating to working-class people 100 years ago. The factory guys they wouldn't really go to the pride parade and like feel included they would more likely kind of just think it was wrong and they would go reject it. I mean there's you can argue about what that means. I doesn't mean much because once again those were that's 100 years ago. We're here these these are not the same things. That is not this that working class is not this working class. Its composition is similar people in relationship to each other. But it's not a comported social category. So that is that's why it's wrong you know But it's still it's still an argument to be made but just in the same way as that a hundred years ago working-class people would have looked at don jr and eric and they would have thought look at these little fault leroy pieces of one-sided in any direction like the social turn pushes people in directions that are not controllable or predictable in the moment but that have to be reckoned with as they occur and then dealt with. We live in a different reality where we have to deal with the fact that a lot of a lot of rough and tumble regular folk look at a chinless goon like eric trump. A habsburg like he is he's like if the fourth clone of michael keaton in multiplicity got cloned and he's going to tell people about the virtues of hard work and how like the forgotten american man like culture has zapped our brains and one of the ways that zapped them is to tell people that it's like the west. Virginia coal miners who sat in a big theater to listen to donald trump ex complain about how the hair spray isn't as good as it used to be. That's that just shows that like these categories only look the same everything is inside. The contents may contents may shift you know over the course of a century does anyone know who was on tonight I forgot. I I couldn't even remember I got to say last night. You guys anybody who watched last night how oh that smarmy little prick well. I got my eye on him. Ah we all like to have fun we like to have fun. Melania just went on forever what the was that that was insane. I gotta say that we had a lot of fun on the stream. It was a fun stream honestly. I think that the boring nights are more fun because I don't get distracted as much by getting mad at it because I understand it's okay fabe and you should never argue these things on their merits. Because they're pointless.

The argument exists independently of like ever being resolved. It's It's just it's the s it's the subject you have to step away from it but god damn it. They pull me in with when they get really going. They really pull me in all that stuff the first night about how like thanks to donald trump i. Got a z-pack in antibiotics when I got sick with covet or whatever it's like do you guys you. Guys think that he's like a volcano god. I mean you think that if if donald trump was not president the sun would not have risen that day and earth would have flipped off of its access and pinwheeled into space and we would all have died in frozen horror. All that stuff still would have happened dude oh still gets me so but it's more when it's more boring. You don't even really process the garbage it just kind of goes smoothly over your brain but if I might get I get might get a little head up at crenshaw because he's such a smug prick and he's he's he really is trying to be the conservative aoc. That is exactly what he's trying to be because he is he is soy.

He is a conservative soy man and I'm not talking about because he likes israel. I'm not talking about his positions. I mean that he is the embodiment of the caricature of a millennial. a social media star. The way aoc is the way that he is just the way that he weaponizes grievance and the way that he um and specifically the way he plays on sympathy of on amongst the public. He like tries to flip all the social justice stuff on his head and be like well. If you he really does do like well if you were really tolerant. You'd be tolerant of this and I feel like that and the way that he courts epicness you know like he's epic in a very specific way. He's bacony. You know he he's like oh me and me and pete. Davidson went on snl. He's like a millennial. He is in his essence. A like a millennial bug man that these guys hate but because he grew up in texas or whatever. He's still a republican even now and also he's a loser. I really think felix is onto something with this thing about how we're getting a million veterans running for things but people don't want to. like bathrobes and and tires strapped to their feet. I mean what the hell a bunch of losers that guy lost his eye in afghanistan. What kind of schmuck yeah. There's something cuckish about being a veteran. You're not a winner and like conservativism is nothing else if not a sorting mechanism for winners and losers we're going to use. We're going to use this extractive hierarchy to sort people and there's rewards and punishments there's rights and responsibilities and they arrive align along how how much worth you have how much of a winner you are how how how much do you contribute to the market. What are you worth to me.

Don't give me some abstract. What do you what is. It dude what is What do. I get out of you being here. What do. I get out of you. If you're a woman. What do. I get out of you are you attractive do. I want to have sex with you all right. You have value if you're if you're a minority. It's like well. What do you have to give me and if it's a bunch of stuff about how oh we don't have as much to contribute because you know enslavement in poverty and racism. I'm sorry. What does that got to do with me you're a loser you lost white men won black people lost and along the way there's winners and losers within those strata and they get rewarded and punished individually and then as a group and it all over time sorts out itself. That's what they think so everyone is totally seen as they must be in a market through the lens of utility utility and a winner is by definition of having won something possesses value. If they've won they've won something whatever it is social material sexual spiritual whatever you want to think if they've won something they have something they have value if they're a loser you've lost. Something you don't have value veterans sorry losers and of course you know that's very low that's down on the reptile at this point but over time as the sorting keeps happening they get added and that's why I said that there's no future for ethnonationalism. Ethnonationalism is a dead end because because it fixates on sorting it it imagines itself oh well. We'll stop at white people or whatever we'll stop at slurbs we'll stop. At this group we will create a a full enclosed harmonic social order but if the thing that got you there is not changed when you have that harmonic social order. You're going to keep sorting winners from losers and you get new categories of people who are on people and you get new explosions of social strife. You get new admiseration and then you have new social conflict congratulations until all is destroyed mutually. The mutual ruin of the contending classes which you idiotically thought were not going to exist because race is the real class well guess. What race is not. The real class class is a real class and that's why class has to be the first basis of analysis because otherwise you could make a utilitarian argument for ethnonationalism that's the echo fascist thing right like well.

It's too late socialism is too late. It's barbarism and improves in the lifeboat and who's out. We're gonna go by race. But I'm saying no it doesn't even it doesn't even um make that case that isn't even accurate because even if it got there it would destroy itself. Then because the sorting mechanism wouldn't continue the winners and the losers would get put apart stretched apart and it would undermine the social order and obliterate it and socialism is a different sorting. It is a sorting outward of pain a redistribution of pain so that instead of some people experiencing exquisite amounts of alienation and pain and other people experience and I'm not I'm talking material and other people experiencing almost none that you can re-distribute that pain so that it is felt lightly by everybody and the more lightly it can be felt. The more our social antenna can be connected to each other and facilitate actual harmonic existence and a flow that is regulated not by the brutal algorithm of the market which none of us can trust with one another because we're alienated from one another to a holistic market. A market that doesn't require signals because it is It's It's spontaneous and you can say oh that's not likely with no. I mean ethnonationalists aren't going to get what they want either like.

I'm sorry we're not going to get the pepe kekistan. We're going to get military camps like worst case scenario like it really does collapse. It's going to be military fiefdoms. It's not going to be a epic new like fourth reich meme lord land. You're not even gonna get that so you're living in a fantasy world too. At least my fantasy world actually is a fantasy and not a disguised nightmare oh the brabont killings man that's wild stuff just think about this belgium's got like seven people in it right. It's a postage stamp. It's it's it does it shouldn't even exist. It's this stupid. It's like why didn't the netherlands and france when they pulled it apart. Why didn't they pull harder and get the whole thing and then they wouldn't have had to worry about this stupid. So it's a weird little appendix.

In the low countries very small small population 11 million now okay but we're talking in the 80s we're talking single-digit millions which is about as many people as our within nuclear radius of me right now and over the course of a number of years. In the 80s there was a string of insanely violent robberies mostly at grocery stores but also break-ins at gas stations that led to the deaths of over 30 people. These are the the the descriptions of these crimes are like grand theft auto do three dudes pull up you know their little citrion or whatever her little nose it was a van pop out and just if someone's in the parking lot just start shooting people in the parking lot go into the place shoot anyone. They see grab the money and they got barely any money. They would like steal camping supplies and and like a bulk food items and toilet paper and and then a little bit of cash. So these were like if this was Economically motivated is the most widely like miscalculated decision matrix that humans ever possessed like.

I want 40. How am I going to get it how about I kill 12 people in broad daylight or like in the or in the middle of a city and then at several points. They had shootouts with cops where they killed the cops. Cops showed up at one point as they were leaving one one of the grocery stores. They lift their asses up like heat and it got it never got solved. They never found them how would that happen how does that happen they never found him. Nobody got arrested even and then when you consider the fact that there's a cache of weapons associated with the problem killings that included in it nato specific firearms and and shells that were part of like the complement of armories given to the belgian special forces as part of their nato training. the connections of people to the stolen goods from the robbery connected to far right not neo-nazi orgs with ties to the military including a guy who had in his possession at one point. Nato documents classified nato documents when he was arrested and at another point before his suicide. said that he had connections to mark dutrow mark dutrow was a belgian child murderer.

One of the most monstrous human beings really. I I've ever encountered in my in my readings a real piece of who was allowed through a baffling array of police misconducts to go undetected while abducting raping and murdering numbers. I can't remember how many it wasn't. I think it was more than ten young girls after being released from prison for that very crime and at one point he had girls in a subterranean vault that he built himself while police officers were searching his home and even though the girls were screaming. None of them investigated the downstairs and they found tapes in his house of him building the basement lair that they did not look at until after he had been arrested late later for something else for like fencing cars or something and when he was arrested he said I work with a network of high-level political financial and military leaders in belgian society and providing them with young children for ritual sexual assault and murder and he gave names he listed actual people and he and those associates alarmingly ended up mostly get dying one way or the other. There's it's like jfk only.

I think even more impressive. The number of people involved in the investigation both as prosecutors and police officers and as potential witnesses who died through accident and suicide and there at one point and and then the real eye raising stuff. Eyebrow raising stuff is that the victims came forward claiming that they had seen dutrow during abuse at the hands of like belgian social people and those witnesses gave descriptions of buildings. The interiors of buildings that they otherwise would not have been able to have and it's not obviously an open and shut case. But the connections you have there just in belgium between international child sex rings. Right wing neo-nazi biker gangs prison gangs police off networks of fascist police officers. Literal former nazis like the gellen oregon and west virginia west germany and of course the the the neo the neo fascists in italy. I mean those guys were led by those p2 lounges had guys who had been who had been actual card carrying fascists under mussolini in there and then of course coordinating the thing nato.

The arctic are the architecture of our of our western military alliance against the soviet union where always at every point the front of the cold war like you could talk. I've said that like you could call it the third world war. The cold war is the third world war but there was one quiet front and that was europe but that was where the game actually was. Everything else was battle for europe in the minds of the planners. I mean there's a reason. The folded gap was the fixation of planters on both sides of the urals and the obsession among the military. For the creation of tactical nuclear weapons small nuclear weapons that could be deployed at the battlefield level by generals. They actually thought that they could create our nuclear artillery shells and biz and like a mortar rounds that could be fired to destroy like a tank column and that would not escalate to a full exchange of nuclear fire which of course was madness. There's something called the davy crockett. It was a. It was a nuclear mortar.

It had it was looked like a regular mortar almost but with a giant mushroom head and like donald trump's dick according to story daniels and it was supposed to like fire in a mile and go off one of those just like the delusion going down to the idea that you're gonna survive after you press that button amazing but anyway the reason they were folks fixated on that is because that was the ball game. Europe was the ball game in the minds of the planners because that was the developed world that was the that was like the rest of the world was where we were getting the resources. The rest of the world is where we were getting the that we ground into the end and the end result the commodities the world commodities. They were consumed in the uk or I mean. They were consumed in the united states and europe and so that's why it's called the cold war because the one place that didn't there was no fighting the one front that was quiet was europe. I do not have a thousand islands there.

Thank you. I would like more information about the milwaukee child trafficking house by the way I i got yelled at by a guy because I had said that I didn't know anything else about after it happened and he screamed he got my dms and he was furious because he said you're from milwaukee. You should know this stuff why are you asking and I said i. I don't know man and I just. I don't know what sources to go with. It's. I'm not there. I don't have local connections there anymore and he just and I even asked him like is there anything. I could look at. He's like you don't know you fraud. And I was like damn. I'm sorry and I felt bad for the guy because he seemed very invested in it. But I swear to god.

I have after the initial thing. I have no idea how to do anything with that other than drive myself insane by trying to find a pattern that I couldn't realistically think was you know or. I find a pattern out of something that I could not even really convince myself was a body of evidence. I my guess is is that what people were saying at the time probably isn't true because that kind of stuff is almost never true. The first draft I mean come on because how much stuff are people drawing conclusions from that is just inference and then eventually it gets fall like how many how many people think that there's crisis actors and false flags because they because of the evidence that initial reports said there were multiple gunmen. How many people use that as evidence of course there's going to say that because the guys over here people are running somebody's over there they see him what if they see a cop there's another gunman. What if somebody comes around the bend and twice people somebody's over you hear screaming how the hell are you going to say that initial reports are going to indicate anything other than everyone's freaking out. Initial reports have to be sifted through and when all you have is like a live stream and then nothing what are you sifting through and that's why I say it's about triage a lot of this stuff. Like the first step towards disengaging from the discourse is triage like one of the things that will really make you cut down on the amount of time you spend on here swear to god is if you cut down the number of things that you allow yourself to give a about. I'm not talking about like you know this specific case. I'm talking more about something like the kansas thing. I talked about the other day. you have to be able to recognize quickly what is pure discourse. What is discourse brain and what is meat and then that allows you to funnel out and that means if there's less stuff you're paying attention to twitter gets boring faster because there's only so many takes and only so much to talk about.

If everything is worth getting excited about then you'll never leave you'll never find an end to that you can stay there for hours but if you start whittling down what cares you care about. It's like oh I'm done. I'm basically done with the internet right now and then you can go read a book oh my battery is running. Low might have to cut under early but I'm good for now. I feel like. I'm cruising. why should we not freak out about kenosha. I think I said that earlier if you didn't come on. I may. I think.

I made my argument about that oh my god how would a evangelical view spinoza. I mean as as the devil he's a demon. He's a communist you. They would just say he's a communist because it means there's no hell. There's no damnation and that means that you can do the devil's business without punishment and that means because they're because they are bad people because they are fully libidonally motivated. They also have to motivate themselves to even hold the fiction of their religious belief that they need in order to maintain sanity through a coercive mechanism. There has to be a hell there has to be punishment because if I didn't believe in god. I would do these things I would rape. I would pillage. I would murder. I would do. I mean honestly. They already do a bunch of terrible stuff that they've convinced themselves as good. But they would also do even worse stuff and they think that what's governing them is god. But it's not.

It's their own superego protecting them from annihilation by going too far against the social world that they don't recognize as social because it's essentially a psychopathic world view. But the spinozian the spinoza religious perspective by robbing by getting rid of hell gets rid of the stakes of interactions personally in such a way that unity can be can arise in perception. It can become perceivable because the stakes are lower because the pressure is lower. It's why people it's why that's why social enlightenment comes to the middle and upper classes before it comes to the working class because you have to have a certain level of comfort in order to accommodate others or else you're in tunnel vision. Gotta get my mode which is what these people have even though they already have everything but that's the thing you're a hungry ghost. You have no perspective that means that even as you are always satiated any displeasure becomes as bad to your brain any displeasure like a pee like the the pee in the princesses mattresses that becomes as searing as the hunger pains of someone who has had to skip the last three meals because their favela in brazil or something to them. It's as real because they feel nothing but pleasure any any pain. Any discomfort is is is everything if you don't have that if you don't have that that the horror of obliteration there the the the consciousness of the obliteration of your ego which you are worshiping without knowing it. You're you're secretly worshiping your own ego.

But it will annihilate it will be annihilated. It can't be reconciled unless the ego can be turned outward essentially and externalized into social connections with others and if that happened people don't have to be told not to kill each other people don't have to be told not to exploit one another for profit. It would occur to them to do. It now of course that's not going to be true of everyone at once and that's. Why utopians utopianism is a bad way to organize your politics because it is so far from us that we have to have some vision of what this is for. I believe and I believe this is not and and I believe that what sounds goofy about it what sounds pie in the sky about it only feels that way if you're imagining it as being totalizing and instantaneous. But if you imagine it as a process being moved towards and then at one point you get a critical mass of people and the the social mechanism that generates evil is overcome over time and fewer and fewer people are operating under those constraints that social dysfunction will also be leeched out of society and out of our out of our human nature. Our human nature will now be something completely different than what we think it is.

But it's only because we've resolved all the contradictions of producing for use and surplus on a planet of resources and so that over time that becomes it goes. There's a tipping point is reached where that because the thing is there's that in society at all times it's just right now being crushed. It's it's being destroyed. It's being obliterated by capitalism but of course capitalism is acquiring elements of it. Like the wokification of capitalism is a dialectical process like the the the the base of neoliberalism is actually being changed the way because the base this has to be remembered and I don't think I sometimes I emphasize. This enough is that the base generates the superstructure but then the superstructure changes the base but the reason that that distinction matters is because you can never change the operation at the superstructural level because it's not generative. Once the process begins though it's reinforcing and so the woke stuff that looks like to a lot of people who are just kind of reactionary socially and they want a reason for it to be socially acceptable. They see that and they're like oh. This is socialism being you know commodified. It's like well kind yeah that's the motive. But it's also at a social level. It is capitalism being humanized a little but of course.

Over time. It shrinks and grows. According to how much money we have how much wealth we have how much ability we have to spread pain around like we had the civil rights movement during the height of america's prosperity for a reason. Because expectations were heightened and more and just as importantly among the white people there was enough prosperity for most of them to go ah you know what let them have it that wasn't an accident. Those two things drove each other. Now we're in a situation where standards of living are declining where people are feeling more and more even if they are not materially deprived. They sense the impending deprivation of their material circumstances like they say that the the white the the white bourgeois most likely to vote for trump were white bourgeois in places that had high levels of unemployment poverty and opiate overdose as in they were the rich people. But the rich people in the poor towns as in they saw what could happen to white people. Something they thought could only happen to the lazy and the black could happen to white people which means it could happen to them and so that is happening now and now we're getting this locification of capitalism and it is trying to like back down the generalized anime produced by the system and and the need to maintain and increase structures of control both enforced through the law.

The military and the police but also culturally through the discourse not generative but culturally generated by which is yes you could argue that all this discourse this is all cia operation. You could say the cia created critical theory in the 60s to make everybody talk about this. All day you could say it and in in function that that discourse does serve capitalism which you can argue very clearly because it exists within capitalism and nothing that prominent at a social cultural level could exist if it was incompatible with capitalism. But it doesn't mean that that thing must be negated in socialism. It's created by the social instinct it has to be kept. It has to be cherished and integrated into a class analysis and bike and through class action and protected the way that the labor movement was one of the founding funders and infrastructure providers of the civil rights movement whoo hot damn I i do declare so does that make sense man that feels good. I feel like I got something out there that I've been like trying to articulate for a while and I just didn't have the right. The moment wasn't there where I had the right symbols in my head that I could see through the keyhole does anyone remember when madonna became an edm.

Dj. I remember that one of her many reinventions oh general strike oh no no no no no general strike. No nobody is nobody knows how to strike nobody nobody can strike we cannot strike. The few general strikes that have ever happened in western history have happened at the city level which is because that's the degree of organization or the degree of organizational coherence you need to pull one off for even a few days is neces is usually only found at the city level and you're talking seattle um san francisco. there's one in vancouver. I believe they never they don't spread generally because it's difficult to maintain that organizational coherence beyond the city level and even and but those were in cities with super high union density within key industries. We have unprecedentedly low union density in this country winnipeg in in unprecedentedly low union density in this country. We have we um do not have the coordination to ensure any significant degree of critical labor inputs being withheld from the system which is what you need for it to be anything other than a demonstration and the thing is is that I think there is limited value to be had in demonstrations and I think like like a national day of action type thing like a real show of strength type. One day like they used to do during the iraq war like the mobilization against the war did during vietnam. The mobe that could have a clarifying effect and could certainly help shape the political landscape in a positive direction. But I don't think that you should put it through the you should not look at it as a strike. People should not organize or create expectations along the avenue of it being a strike because that will guarantee failure guarantee. If people think that they're going to do what a strike can do on the timetable people are talking about they will only be disappointed. It will only be a disappointment. If it is understood to be a demonstration of just voices heard you could be some you. I wouldn't say far because demonstrations are of limited value but a coordinated national moment as opposed to individual related explosions of discontent could have an effect on just getting people out there hell exchanging. Emails texting each other joining orgs put some tables out hey. Here's an org hey here's who's got a who works at who works in a big box retailer show of hands who works at a big box retailer. You know that could be useful but that's not a strike and because and the one the desire to call it. A strike is that same libido forgive me desire to see the moment. It has having arrived to know that you're not just participating in the slow boring of hard boards and the tedious creation of a new political reality. No you were at the summit you were at the mountaintop because everyone wants to get to the top. Everyone wants to see it resolve towards something great. They don't want to see their work just be seen to themselves in their life. The only one they're ever going to have is a waste of time but that instinct is what drives us to the grandiosity of our reach overseeing our grass and our and the constant compulsive misidentification of how much organizing needs still to be done and how weak the left is talking about a strike talking about a civil war. Those things delude the self and anyone who hears them and believes them into how strong the left is how coherent it is. It's not coherent enough to be the side in a civil war and it's not coherent enough to organize a strike at any kind for getting a general one. But god can you imagine it. One day everybody in the streets works at a big box retailer who works at amazon who wants to do this who's who hey you know hey who lives in this building. Maybe we like the rent strike thing was also kind of in the same thing if it's just people just deciding not to pay the rent. A lot of people love the idea of a rent strike because oh I don't have to talk to anybody. I'll just not pay my rent everybody else will just not pay their rent and boom. We won't have to pay our rent that's precisely how you get.

Talking everybody in the street who lives in this building who lives in that building who lives in this neighborhood who needs this thing like mutual aid is another thing that feels to a lot of people revolutionary. But I think is more people just sort of doing the charity that feels good to them in the moment which god bless and is better than doing nothing. But that's the kind of situation where that sort of mutual aid organization could be hypothetically linked to some other organs and create actual structures of connection at the level of membership not at the level of belief and assertion of belief so yeah damn. I mean maybe that's a bad idea. I'm sure some. I'm sure some hardcore materialist types will tell me that that's that's all rad liberty too. It's a fantasy. It's a la rad lib fantasy that we could ever do that because how would you even get enough people to agree to show up and ask the people the same questions and not have it boil into a big argument about what representation should exist within the structure of the organizing that I'm. I'm forgetting the role. The culture is going to play and poisoning the well because everyone's going to have to do their own little thing and everyone is going to have to feel represented regardless of whether or not. It is um congruent with the project or whether it makes it more difficult and the thing is is that I don't know the answers to those questions. I don't know what where you draw the line that's a thing that has to be worked out. But it can't be worked out and here's where I get back to what I was talking about yesterday with the the idea of the difference between libidinal politics and like a social a socialized. It's essentially because it's sin. It's the same libido like i.

I called it the other day. I think. I called it like a social obligation and I think that's wrong. It's not social obligation obligation kind of implies coercion. It's a social will like you you're doing it for other people because you identify at the level of the self them with your your their interest with yours. So you are. It's a social being not a social obligation so there's a difference between libido politics and like a socialized spiritual let's call. It spiritual politics. The the the yeah the spiritual and and the personal and what what's the difference between those and like how specifically does going by the one make it impossible to actually organize and I would give us an example people who say want to do real organizing to the like their libidinal. Their their desire to feel like they're contributing to politics. matches their personal desire or matches their social desire to engage with the world so they join an org say the org says hey we're organizing. We think we're going to do medicare for all we're going to do a medicare for all. We're going to operation to try to build support for medicare for all by talking to people by getting in people's face. And this is like a building the baseline outreach that can contribute to building greater capacity and now here's where the first the first hurdle is going to come doing things like going door-to-door suck they're not fun. They're not fun in the way that we have been acculturated to think things should be fun so that means that we have found now our first division. Our first conflict do we go yeah. It's not fun but I could make it fun and it'll feel fun right because it'll make me feel like I'm contributing and the thing is that's what happens that's the process right of turning your life into you're spiritualizing your life. Right getting rid of individualized desires and creating a a social a social self that gets spiritual sucker from other people's advancement and the advancement of humanity. So by going and doing it. It becomes fun or at least more fun than you thought it was going to be. It's still going to suck the way that all things that involve dealing with people suck but if you're going to be able to find more out of it but you haven't done it yet in your head. It's just something that you don't want to do in your head.

It's a thing that your libido wants to avoid so maybe you think you know. I don't really want to go door-to-door what else could I do well. It looks like nothing else. I could do would satisfy my sense that I'm doing something which is what I really want to feel what if it's actually bad that they're going door-to-door what if that because I I'm uncomfortable going to door-to-door. I actually. I have a condition that means. I can't go door-to-door. It makes me uncomfortable. It gives me anxiety interacting with strangers gives me anxiety unlike other people and like saying that I'm not a really good socialist if I don't do that you know what they're They're not being socialists they're being ableist and I'm actually serving the revolution and serving the advancement of humanity more if I denounce them and form an organization of people to also denounce them until they understand that I need to be centered and at every point. This is where I want to stress subjectively. That person doesn't think that they have ever deviated from doing the best thing and the right thing and the good thing they are not operating off of bad faith. They think they're doing the right thing because they have no idea that they are only operating. Libidinally. They have no idea that they don't have a spiritual connection that would allow them to make the leap to do something. They didn't want to do and you can take that example and it happens a million different ways. I mean how many people once dsa started said oh they're too they're too epically.

 they're too epically woke for me. It's all a bunch of handholding. It's like well. I mean that's what you see online but maybe it's different in person nah. That's like well wouldn't you want to find out if you thought it was worth getting mad about as an org if you thought the organization had enough um if you thought the organization had enough potential to be worth getting to be worth caring about to be worth pending and spending any attention on and focusing on and caring about what happens with if it was worth that attention wouldn't it be worth you getting off your ass and trying to look at it and then once you're in that situation yeah you might see some wokeness. But there's not just one line of wokeness that might makes all the good-hearted you know would-be well-intentioned white guys flee how much of that is this is a dysfunctional organization and I'd say the thing is is that you could only know that at the level of the um of the local and I think that there were locals that were irredeemably messed up internally and that yeah I would walk out but I would. I would also say that was a minority and that in majority of them as much as you would have to roll your eyes well maybe you roll your eyes. A little bit h maybe maybe you ignore it a little bit if you think it's worth doing and then at some point maybe the point where you decide. It's too much wokeness. It's really just that you want not do anything because it sucks to sit in meetings and it sucks to go door-to-door and it's more fun to complain about it and so once again same way.

That person doesn't think that they're not operating in good faith that person thinks no. I'm I want what's best for everybody. These guys are the enemy I have to no but because they aren't even aware of the disconnect they don't know. They're merely operating out of libidinal political satisfaction and the thing is. I would like to say if you're saying now how does that not describe you it. 1 million zillion billion describes me. I became a podcaster because I was a poster and I was a poster because I would rather post about politics and be seen posting about politics. Then I go off my ass and do anything and I have the excuse that well what's to do everything sucks. It's like yes everything sucks but one of the reasons. Everything sucks is because people have an excuse to not even engage and make them suck less and that's called the internet and I'm not saying that means everyone should join dsa. I mean the ship might have sailed honestly. Like at this point. It was so distorted by this process. I'm describing on both sides that it might be. It might be beside the point it might be pre-figurative without being able to be like emergent but something I'm just saying is that orgs like that anything you can find that seems like a plausible place for you to put your energies. Um. You have to actually evaluate from a from a spiritual level. You have to apply the spiritual lens not the personal lens to the project and you might still find. It's. And it probably is because we don't know what we're doing it might be irredeemable but it might be redeemable if you were willing to put the work in and you got to ask yourself am I convincing myself. I don't have to put the work in because it's easier not to and I'd rather go online or is it really irredeemable at least get to that point and the thing is. I think we're where we are and why things are so bad. And there's no transmission belt of persuasion from the left to anywhere is because not enough people ask that question and I must stress. I have not asked that question I am only even coming into realization of the void that I had in my conception of myself my conception of the world my duty to my fellow human and myself. So if no and the the point of talks of talking like stuff like this is to disarm these things because so much of these arguments are based around people feeling deeply nestled guilt about their inaction and wanting to expiate it through validation from others.

In a public realm. They want it so everyone's on trial every day in front of everybody else and we all have to prove that we're on the side of the angels because of the consequences. Because the rage will feel towards the people who fall short and the shame we will feel and the misery will feel if we are found to be falling short and I'm saying is if there is a jubilee. If we drop the rocks and start over we can actually move forward. Wow. I hope that made sense.

I was getting some stuff in my face all right. Maybe. I'll ask have one. I'm almost out of battery actually so let me take one question and then. I'm out of here. No. I'm out. That was the last gasp. It was like. I got. I hit. I hit the. I hit. The apogee came back down. I got like a second second wind but you only get two wins with my cardiovascular health. You only get two wins so I and and my battery's almost dead so. I gotta go thank you guys though. I felt. I felt really good about this one. I hope it's I hope it makes sense I hope people like it. Bye-bye leave them. One more baby.
