Uh okay I think by now we've established. Everything is inherently worthless and there's nothing in the universe with any kind of objective professor to scream for a hundred years split. The sky with a thousand curses to tell the evil that men do honey you wouldn't even scratch the surface too. Many implications not enough time to make them explicit too many generalizations not enough time to make them specific hi folks. So uh some was there a vote last. What happened was there a sports ball uh oh boy uh. I've not really looked at anything. I looked at the the the uh. I streamed through stuff a little bit to find out just the general stake. It looks like we're get it's going to be the bush gore again. It's going to be bush gore again. They're trying to stop count votes from being counted. There's legal challenges. It's bush b gore uh. It's a coin flip though. I mean it's. I'd still my gut says trump pulls it out. But you know biden could still win. At this point. I realized the full stupidity and futility of protecting anything in politics. How it is totally futile. I'll explain more about that as we go on but uh but that's as much as I'm going to talk about. I'm not actually interested that uh much like the debate the first debate with the biden between bind and trump where just the experience of it helped me like sear me into a deep level. A deeper level that I've ever been able to like uh um lock down my knowledge that there's no reason to listen to these guys talk because nothing they say means anything something you know deeply. But it's not accessible when you're dealing with it and you end up getting caught up because you can't detach and then that debate helped me detached this election. Another one of those moments where you are able finally only in the in the uh aftermath of it to look back and see what the hell you were even in the middle of the owl of minerva alights at dusk. As hegel said you can only know the  what was going on until afterwards which is why the entire concept of predicting elections in the first place. The entire nate silver world is an absurd and insane uh uh pursuit. It's a pure. It's a pure entertainment product that's the thing they pretend. It's. It's suppose. Polls are supposed to be a science but they're an entertainment product and it's like you have a choice. Do. You accept the reality of that and then decide. I'm gonna um. You know what. I'm gonna have some fun with this uh. I know it's an entertainment product.

Let's do the horse race or you're gonna be like no this isn't an entertainment product. This is actually real science like nate silver and then you drive yourself insane because if nate silver was smart he would have realized that what he was selling in 2012 when he became popular was not um expertise or science specific scientific knowledge or anything. He did a thing that any  aggregate polls instead of looking at one specific one. That's easy uh. He just specifically did it in a year where by happenstance you had a situation where liberals still traumatized by uh. The last election that didn't go their way in 2004 were absolutely nauseous at the thought of obama losing to mitt romney and they did what liberals always do before an election. They pull their hair out and freak out about oh my god we're blowing it because they know in their heart. They're  blowing it and the thing is is that they're always blowing it. But you know it takes time for blowing it to really sink in. So you might still win a few elections. Here there and hey maybe this is it um uh and they're like oh my god obama's gonna lose and then specifically when he lost the first debate mr obama mr smooth mr entertainer ate. Presidential debate and his numbers dipped a little bit and liberals were tearing their hair out and nate. Silver was the one place they could go on the website the internet to feel a dope a soothing cooling feeling instead of anxiety and freaking out and oh my god because they had nate silver there. Oh and he poured over them like a holy gravy and to feel centered again and then when he won when obama won and it wasn't even really that close he uh and the one person who had told them and calmed them and petted them and kept them kept their bot kept them on the couch and and sated and sued like mommy's finger before that election was nate silver and so they just decided to worship him and dumbass nate silver instead of looking at that be like oh. I got lucky I better cash in and then just like figuring out a new grift decides. No. I'm gonna. I actually know something and I'm gonna find out things and so what happens oh no those conditions don't obtain anymore. That was just happenstance that you provided that service for those liberals that entertainment service for those liberals now in the midterm when no people don't really care as much how do you make that interesting because they don't need to be sued and then 2016 it was the other way around everybody assumed hillary was gonna win and so what did they need nate silver for he was he was discarded like yesterday's uh toy and he was freaking out about it and trying to like figure out. No there's still a value add for me and so what he could. Do is just say unlike everyone else who says it's 95 hillary. I say it's 75 hillary and then of course he felt vindicated after the election and everyone else was like you're an idiot but once again he was correct in a narrow sense. It's like yes there was a huge statistical voting error that was making everybody's predictions off and he was able to recognize it more than almost any of the other aggregators were able to that's still a value-add but it's not what they wanted. They wanted the oohs they wanted and now we're in the first election where nobody trusts polls at all which means nate silver has nothing to contribute. They don't even remember why they liked him and he's frantically trying to like find a way out of this maze to find a way where he can give himself a a a like a a status as a scientific scientist somehow or an authority when he is doing a thing that is fundamentally irrational and meaningless. When you say 75. It's it. What is it right now uh. It's if trump's up four in michigan. No he's not that's not a thing. All of this is just what is the general vibe like if an election happened today and that means it's. It means things in like you know a lot of big numbers way. But it has it has essentially no. There is no uh the amount of like objective scientific like attachment to the material reality is very very tenuous to begin with and then there's the fact that the end result is a binary outcome where your percentages mean nothing because it's going to be one or the other so giving me a percentage is not an answer. It's not a scientific response to the thing because it's not a thing that's worth doing. It is not a science because there's no reason to do that other than to provide entertainment for people. I mean yes polls are used to like guide coverage and stuff but for the people who consume news polls exist to provide entertainment either or yay boo a little more for the for the uh for the pop and hiss of the political theater that we're living that is the mug's game of predicting these things and I and I felt leading up to the election. I felt like every time I was prodded to talk about what I thought was going to happen with the election anything from who's going to win to was there going to be a coup or was there going to be some sort of all these questions. Uh were ones that are essentially like asking somebody. What's what's the poll say. It's like. I'm just looking at the polls. But I don't know if polls are real. We're not going to know if polls are real until the election happens and now we know polls are not real anymore. And it's because I think I don't know this but I suspect it's at this point. The only people who answer a poll are a person are on one side of a coming divide. I'm going to talk about with an american. Uh politics that's now emerging between people went to college and people who didn't i.e. Broadly speaking people who see politics as a field of meaning or people who see it as one. Uh option among a bunch of other options in an entertainment menu that they choose not to really engage with and that means that those people are the people are the demographic slice that everybody talks about and the democratic party is most fixated on and is the majority of voters in that they're the ones who show up every two years. But then there's this other group of people who show up every four years. What is their thought and I say those people do not  pick up the phone.

That's what I say. I have no way of proving that but it doesn't matter. It's just it's I'm just speculating on a hypothesis. It doesn't matter what matters is is that there's a systemic and now undeniable break that means you don't you can't you cannot think you know unless you want to just be like assume. It's just like add a number or something you know at that point. You're just pulling things out of your ass and I'm very glad and polling. Breaking breaks another thing in me and that is uh and that is just to look at this to look at the voting outcome look what we're seeing with these returns and seeing how it uh blows up a lot of our perceptions and understandings of how american politics operates uh and honestly. I feel like in the last four years like I feel like we breached out of a like a reality out of like earth. A when trump won we're like thrown into a quantum state where whoa that was a big that was a weird bump that was like that was like one of those things that was in the arc of history. One of those moments that's one of those few moments that is both contingent and consequential because you know all events all events obviously are you know enmeshed with both of those historically. Most historical events are a concept if they're consequential they're not contingent but there are a few some assassinations battle and war. Uh outcomes uh uh big social like pivot points where you actually do have both uh contingency and uh um consequence and that put us in this quantum state of like what did we run into and then our response to it was going to be how we figured it out and among people who were on the left. The response was oh  battle stations what do we do now of course the republic. The democratic party decided and didn't decide and I'll get to that later but did what it was essentially programmed and required to do by its own internal algorithm which was attack right tacked to the center attack towards disaffected republicans who were grossed out by trump that was inevitable and could not have been stopped. Nobody made a decision to do that any more than anybody wakes up at. Goldman sachs and gets on the phone and says hey uh make more money today. No one does that it's just it's it's it's the underlying logic that you never even get to in a day-to-day conversation of motives and stuff the deep deep structure of ideology um. But the contingent thing was the emergence of the bernie sanders concept the social democratic alternative to uh to the new coke of dlc uh democratic politics and the four years where people drop manning battle stations and trying to like okay. We're in new space but what does it mean all right uh well. Hillary did terribly because they didn't talk about material issues and the democrats had gone away from labor and we need to recommit to material uh politics right and you get a big quorum of people on the left saying yep that was it and they said all right well. Let's do it and from certain assumptions. They operated and one of the big ones was we have to change the electorate. This electorate is trapped in this partisan box where these people are just biting each other's faces off because they're just bored suburbanites who are watching television. You have to have skin in the game in terms of feeling like changing society is something that needs to happen and and that your perception of your own self-interest is merged with a class of people like oh. This is going to help me but me as a group also um and so that's what bernie did. That's what bernie tried to do tried to operate off that big. Uh huge bump in his popularity and and people's awareness of him and then he hit the streets. For four years. We all operated off the assumption and we operated the assumption that if you change the electorate you enlarge the electorate and if you enlarge the electorate by definition you will break through a lot of the structures that the constitution and now later on gerrymandering and self-dealing by the gop at the state level have erected against like popular participation in government which would mean popular participation by working class people because there's more of them than there are owners uh and that was that was those were the assumptions and I held all of them. I held all of them and I think basically everybody did until yesterday and if they're not if they're not dropping them. Now this is the point where you're like you're  up. I don't blame anybody for accepting that that was the reality. I think everybody was operating off of that base assumption and we weren't going to know until the election and bernie's primary defeat really signaled that oh maybe this isn't how this works because bernie was able to get a good chunk of those democratic voters. The young engaged ones uh and and brought you know and he did get some working-class people who were aware enough of politics cared enough about it and knew who he was to believe who he was because he was so genuine like he read authentically in a way that only guys like trump do and which you need to actually break through like the the kayfabe of politics to get at people who are not already invested in it. Uh he was the guy he was the potential like he would if anyone was gonna do it. It was gonna be bernie sanders but the thing is if he was gonna do it. He would have been able to do it in a country where in the smaller hot house of the of the uh primary campaign where you have individual states where you have turnout that is much lower than it is in a general election that you can micro target through outreach which you can you do because you have a big army of motivated volunteers and a ton of money from people willing to  did it. I saw it folks. I saw it and it got results but what it didn't do was get decisive results and we know that because whatever you want to say about the dnc rigging it for biden at the end of the day. If bernie had been able to expand beyond the base of democratic uh primary voters. It wouldn't have mattered that they coalestronpide because he would have been able to have a chunk that could have still overwhelmed them. He was left with this fragment it was never it had the lowest he had the lowest floor but he also had the highest ceiling which is what we found out because it wasn't going anywhere because no one was coming in from outside of it because the door had closed and now we get these results where we see that uh yes the dnc strategy of appealing to uh suburban republicans worked.

They moved there. The white people moved white people with college degrees or associate social status moved to by that happened and it might have been enough for him to still win. But at the same time not only do you see a continued drop away in working-class white uh uh um working-class white democratic vote. But what's this you're seeing a racial dealing among latinos here and even a little bit among blacks where now though that that's that that bifurcation is now extending beyond the dreaded white working class. Maybe. It's just the dread white. Working class were like the canary in the coal mine and because they were privileged they didn't really get uh get a fair hearing when they started getting pissed off that. Everything was going to  around them because hey they didn't have it as bad as the minorities but now these people who are supposed to by the fact that they have it worse than white people as a group are supposed to inherently band together and against whiteness. What's this turns out that the culture  about like what these things mean what these cultural uh arrangements are you're literally just creating two political parties. Uh where the message is from one don't be a  like deep uh like primal associations with you know like concepts like aggression versus cooperation like deep hardwired stuff and all that stuff that's supposed to matter shatters and so we're seeing no coattails and so even though this might be enough to get biden across the finish line what it did not do and no one can deny. This is that it has denied him the ability to govern right. We all get that everyone understands that right like no matter what happens here governing is over you're gonna have a  uh. Uh a tied senate maybe uh with biden uh and a reduced house majority with han nancy pelosi at the realm. Nothing will don't will happen uh and that is all because the the coattails don't exist in that concept and of course the model of the change people. The bernie people that I was was well if he got bernie. In there c he would have changed that because he would have got those working-class people to vote for their material interests because he would have been engaging it and I think that would have been true to an extent and I think bernie would have won much more decisively than this but on the question of coattails and creating like a governing ability in this country. Uh it's it's grim. It's grim because what happened in this election is what the left broadly has been wanting to happen for a generation which is for people to show up to people to start paying attention because the assumption is the mass of americans because they have like broad liberal left-wing conceptions of you know the working class and the and the ruling class that they ascribe that they believe even if they might not agree on who those constitute they believe that that is the central tension in paul. They understand vaguely that that's the case because that's why they think of themselves as uh on. The left is so that if you can get participation you can breach the walls around democracy and flood the zone with people just voting their own interests. But this election we got that break 100 uh uh the biggest turnout in the century. Uh shattered records everywhere because kovid made it easier for people to vote so a lot of people who vote casually which means they don't put a lot of emotional investment in voting which means they have not ascribed to a lot of the cultural values around citizenship that lead you to wanting to be a member of the. Don't be an  and I think that if bernie had been out there he might have got the same deal because at the end of the day I honestly think this and jeremy corbyn is why I believe this um is that people don't think that they can change anything with politics anything structural. If it's structural. It is by definition not political. That is what we believe because that's what we believe and why do we believe it because it's what we live we. It is the just our lived experience ironically enough our collective lived experience is capitalist realism. It is that because we stopped having a uh a like a class adversarial relationship at the top level of government in the 70s and that the democratic project has basically been dead since then uh and that as a result of that the two parties don't argue about things like how how long should people work whether that should be the conditions of their work what should be renumeration what should be the standard of living for america. Those questions are not political to people even if we talk about them sometimes high-mindedly and what that means is that at this point I feel like if you get in front of a bunch of people casuals who are going to just come into the polls because it's so easy now they're going to hear you say.

I want to get rid of get medicare for all and I want to make everybody have free college just like corbin did because corbin got to run a general election where he got to make his message spread in a country where they have a  constitution. It's a majority rule and yet uh in the in the red. In the red uh the red red out. There the red wall they went uh with. They went for brexit because brexit was more real to them than the stuff corbin was promising because they didn't think he was telling them the truth and even though some people are going to be disarmed by the genuineness of a guy like corbin and bernie and that's going to get you some people. It's not going to get you enough people and a lot of people are gonna. See it and they're gonna be like yeah and then they're gonna go back to the big questions which are cultural and identity based uh and I think one of the big reasons that there's a disconnect here and that like the political class and by that I mean literally people who pay attention to politics at all uh and give investment into their vote. Uh they believe that um when they think of a political party they think of it as a historical entity and they think of it as having a history of things that it's done and as having a coherent platform that involves things like distribution of resources. But the thing is that's only if you learn that  and keep it in your head when you think about the democratic party for these casual voters who will come in. If there's a if there's a breeze they will be blown into the voting booth. They uh they only see the party in front of them and the democratic party is the party that is just says don't be an  in a wheeling voice say come on guys. Do. We have to be so mean because as trump says trump's big joiner to the kids in cages is who's built the cages and the thing is we're gonna have cages and the question becomes culturally are. We gonna be an  about cages liberals. Democrat republicans say look we gotta have cages don't be a  about cages that's it. Those are the two parties as people understand them as cultural uh uh signals like those things in older generations. The people that make up the leadership of these political parties and are largely like disproportionately hurt in its culture such that it is this is political culture self-conscious political culture. They all remember a time lived in their lives when there was some sort of uh ideological coherence and meaning to the democratic party that involved material relationship but people living now certainly. Ones who just decided to vote in 2020 do not have that they see the don't be an  in america comes down to did you go to someone said. Someone said college thank you that's it educational attainment did you go to the etiquette school. A thing that used to get you entry into a real middle class right because you get a professional degree and it would give you an access to a professional lifestyle. Those are gone but the attendant social uh uh prestige is still there and so people still go to college and consider themselves part of this thing even though it doesn't get them anything but the same gig economy job. Everybody else has but it changes the way they vote but not on material basis because that's not part of our politics and then you have the people uh who and in college you learn you know hey we're moving papers around in here. We're we're muffling all the horrible  language that we talk to each other nicely good good phrases and we raise our pinkies up. We learn this from the british when we talk about how many  equatorial guinea uh we have acculturated ourselves to the brutality of extraction of being at the top of a pyramid of human misery and so we've learned how to uh kind of ext. Let off the steam of the anxiety of living that every day the horror of it in the form of liberal politics like it used to be manners. It used to be religion. Then it became manners after god died and that manners used to be you know in the old reactionary era pinkie extended stiff upper lip. Now the thing is a lot of guys are going to hear even going through that system just because you think. I'm actually going to make money out of this like the ones who go into college thinking hey. I'm going to really get a career out of it the suckers. In other words. They're going to come out reactionary because  thing it's so awfully con ascending and sadistic and contentless.

It has no meaning related to anyone's actual lives. It says keep your voice down. We're trying to study and what if you don't  what am I studying for you used to be able to say. I'm studying to get a job. But now that's not it. I'm studying so. I can sit around with another bunch of people and pretend that I'm part of a. I'm not backing. I'm not going bad. I'm not gonna be like my dad. No no. I'm a good leftist. I'm a lib and it's going to affect you regardless of what your uh what your gender demo is or race or whatever. But if you didn't have that experience. If those if those manners and the anxiety the social anxiety related to being aware of things like privilege didn't like seep into you and like become constitutive of your ability to enjoy yourself which you can only get in those experiences of collegiate. Uh brainwashing then what do you know you don't. You're not thinking you know what you're right you're thinking you're lying you're just saying that to get me to be quiet because you're a  about oh. We're gonna do we're gonna all get good grades on the thing. It's just it's disingenuous. It's a lie oh oh the caged babies you built the cages and it's it's true.


Because the conditions of american politics assume that there will be like there will be climate catastrophe. There will be pandemic that will never be stopped. There will be continued economic bottoming out there will be people killing themselves in greater and greater number indirectly and directly. There will be just social collapse like it and the replacement with just the mere like attenuated like nerve endings of pure stimulus response the people who can bury themselves in the internet to find some like reason to keep moving forward imagine frontier. They can walk through into the digital realm well. Everybody else just dissolves and we are seeing this with the vote. We are seeing this with the vote. Cl. Race is being uh. We're seeing the poll now the biggest weight.

The most dramatic one you can. See is latinos and of course people say ah those latino men. It's the machismo. It's like well that's kind of true in like a vague sense in the sense that the don't be an  party is masculine and so if that's just down to boys versus girls. If politics is just boys versus girls and you're you think you're a guy why wouldn't you pick guys unless you wanted the girls to like you and you only learn that when you're sitting with the other kids at the  tea party in college. So if it's the dude's rock party and the uh and the hens party or whatever. I don't know the a woman should name the the equivalent of the dude's rocket because obviously this is not dude's rock. It's awful. It's toxic masculinity. It literally. It is it's awful it's bad. It's political expression is noxious awful.

The policies it proposes are terrible but they're the same policies and the same outcomes that the democrats do they're just coded differently and so because latinos do not experience race in america. The way that black people do because no one in america experiences race the way black people do and the idea that like because we race like we invented racism you know through capitalism but like branding black labor for to keep it. You know uh trackable in absence of greater technological ability like if we had if they had chips in people's uh wrist that could like blow up. If you weren't working enough they wouldn't need a color system. It was that I'm taking people to the new world. I don't want to first run away and start a farm with the indians which is a hell of a lot harder to do. If you have a completely uh alien uh culture and  a notifiable color difference that marks you as as as as out of place if not uh uh uh accounted for and so. But then we took all like the people outside of this.

Mostly liberal whites basically created these theories where like they listened to minorities. They listened to lived experiences of being a minority but then they took them and applied them to the only rubric. They knew which is white and black and latinos do not experience race the way that what black people do and the evidence for it is this  election like look. It up think of the way that like uh. I think of the way that uh that trump guarantees that the like he will never get no republican will get more than ten percent of the black vote right. It doesn't happen it's not going to happen. He might have done a little better with some black men. But that's the ceiling for and that's and if you think about it when you think of the way every other demographic breaks down in this country. That's an insane statistic. Especially the user how many black people are in this country that's a crazy amount of real estate that they are seeding and cannot even hope to get off the block.

Meanwhile latinos are flat fluid and even though he went hard anti-hispanic he went hard anti-immigrant hardcore anti-immigrant and that said oh god what are they gonna do. He actually didn't do that bad he did a little better than romney. I believe with latinos and then what's this he's done even better again because all that stuff about kids in cages. It's not experienced as like that level at the visceral thing like the blm stuff like every police killing. I think it reverberates to the black community in like a shock wave but like kids in cages if you're an american latino. There are so many different what things that could mean from being a  gusano in south uh south florida to like a like a fourth generation mexican american in in texas or something you're an american and those kids in cages aren't and that's deeper they're not your. People they're not my kin the way that like george floyd's death is felt as like a collective uh attack by black people and so that means they're not gonna respond to race the way black people did which means they're not gonna be the malleable mass that the uh college educated elite that make up the democratic party can mold to their liking oh.

No what's this it's packing away oh no our stuff's only working on the college-educated ones. Oh  exiled themselves to the dude's rock party because that's what they care about they care about dude's rocking. They don't care about some. Do you think american mexicans people who are american remember. None of these people are going to get an ice raid by definition. They're voting in american election and so they see. This is like look. I'm in america. I have a barbecue. I don't want some  that we gotta have a barrier. How do we have a berry. We have a  about it and of course like the black thing is going to be a little different though you're not going to see that happen because part of that dude's rock lifestyle we're talking about involves explicitly in a way. It doesn't with any other racial group in this country not being black not like a specifically like blood quanta stuff like liberals do like the 23andme psycho. So it's like well look at my  studies or whatever um. They uh they're like no. It's an americanism. It's an american nationalism and that means that like latinos yeah look like but black people no thank you and that means that you're gonna see college educated. Uh blacks get even more dedicated to being democrats and not allegedly blacks not voting gop just not showing the  outcome because you are not invested in the state project to the degree that they are because they're not aware of their collective uh uh exploitation and their collective alienation which they which is class-based that is based not on income but is on class and is disproportionately felt by african-americans but is uniquely among african-americans felt collectively whether you like it or not and some of them don't like it and become republicans but that's a minority. Most of them are going to see this  out and what that means is is that the only reason that democrats ever had for thinking that they were going to be able to like take over politics and time to stop this country from just burning to death in the  lava field. Uh is that well the demographics look we're getting younger and we're getting browner brownie of america. But the thing is that brownie of america is not a blackening of america. Either the population the us the u.s black population I believe is decreasing or if it isn't. It's steady. It's latinos it's asians and if that if they can be melded into the dude's rock uh uh keep the noise down party structure. You're going to see the emergence of two political parties that are going to fight what appears on paper to be a class war between rich people and poor people. And it's gonna be fought on those terms and the republican party will to some people look like it is now the party of the working class but uh oh. What's this working class just means culture. Oh no.


It's completely. It doesn't like because we've assumed everything else because remember. While all this is going out the gears are turning. The system is pumping out the only outcome it can do which is profit extraction through stripping and destruction and undermining of the american. Profit out of this thing as the rate of profit sinks and because we've created a situation where our ruling class is this like lumpin uh billionaire class of non-self like class unconscious rich people which is not supposed to be a thing. Like we. There we have literally a lump in ruling class in this country and and when I say this country. I mean the whole atlantic sphere like the nato sphere uh that it's a  um. It's it's just a bunch of it's the way. It's. It's this thing that it's the thing that government structures exist to prevent from happening which is the direct competition of capitalism reducing and destroying all profit and surplus instead of allowing it to be uh hoarded by some. That's what government's supposed to correct. But we've created a system now where because uh politics died in the 70s. It's been dissolving and so now there's no way that it can respond to changing conditions because changing conditions were the only thing it was the only temperature gauge we had things got worse uh pressure built up you had.

The monitor is broken now and it just steams off into culture war and so that means that if we do get this slick big realignment where it's like a working-class republican party which I think honestly is inevitable probably it will be totally divided of any meaningful connection to a working-class project that has any meaning any any hope and why I say meaning any hope of creating the conditions to transcend the uh the um contradictions of capital and move to another  stage of human development because that's the only question anybody should be asking about politics is like do. These conditions allow us to actually build a future and uh the answer here is. No it cannot so the real issue here is that uh this system cannot be defeated from outside of itself. It's completely self-contained uh and I want us and for anybody who's saying actually no you know. I think that there is something to this working-class trump thing and I think yeah cucker. Carlson is going to be like he's going to synthesize trump into his trumpism into a working political economy and then that's going to he's going to use the revenge you know uh reactionary heart. The cultural like you know uh the cultural gag reflex of like you know traditional culture to wheel fend off the worst excesses of capitalism which is essentially the duganes. Thesis alexander dugan is like the mastermind behind putin but it's mostly full of. That's the dream that's the fantasy that's how you convince yourself to sleep at night. After your coke binge that no this is for the good of humanity uh the real the real the real smart people the real dead eye geniuses.

They know that that's emotional they know that's all  and the proof of it is look at trump's campaign. If trump won this election because remember the thing that matters is the votes and the votes came out and the vote said people. Walk people walked into the voting booth during a unprecedented pandemic that had seen 200 000. Americans die no end in sight and in fact the highest rate of infection we've had since the thing  that it could we're talking depression people. Just don't want to say it because that's one of those words that triggers things and we don't want to trigger anything do we shh they walked past that  tire fire and because they were just pushed in by the breeze remember. These are the casual voters who filled the rolls because it's easier to vote. Now. They saw the two choices and uh they voted trump and you can say no. They voted because he says he's going to bring the jobs back you could have argued that in 2016 and that's the thing we had a quantum space we were floating in space. For those four years. We were in a quantum superposition between that happened because uh well we know why it happened happened because the democratic project is doomed. Dlc project is doomed we're going to press this button and see if it connects to anything and then there's two states that we were in the  lid off and the and it died is what happened. Uh. The cat is dead and now it's a question and the thing. Is I my prediction that I'm now owned by oh was premised on my guess that the cat was alive and I only thought the cow's alive because I'm bubbled in a cocoon of of media like self-satisfaction where I really only talk to other people on the don't be a pus.

People do you like interact with online to not make fun of in a day no come on so you think yeah. These polls are right but it turns out polls are literally you even the ones who are even the conservatives even the conservatives even the republicans. These are the never trump republicans in that screen. That's where they are. That's that's suburban shift. But that's just this it's not connected to any other uh data and so then we get the moment the actual tally we see what people poded we see when they saw the tire fire. They saw a situation where it was. This current situation hell world exploding everything corona disaster. Guy who's keep doing it someone else in every previous like crisis moment in american history like magnate 32 when you had the great depression a deep deep spiral and nobody doing anything to stop it. You add on the ballot the current state of things or something else and it was a no-brainer. It was a no-brainer because you had this emergent working class movement that was connecting to the democratic party in a way. It never had from an ideological valence and not just patronage which it had been like the working-class relationship. The relationship between the working class and the democratic party goes back to the 1820s when the democratic party was founded by my boy martin van buren but it did not become uh actually left-wing in any sense and still the depression or until uh and then when the new deal happened and when when roosevelt got it. That's what actually gave uh uh like working class interests a stake in democratic politics because before that the relation to the working class was patriotic networks and it's not like patriotic  went away after the depression. In fact the two things became merged but before that it was just patronage at the 30th boom seat at the table why because people just regular americans pursuing their lives not ideologically committed most of them not having gone to college at that point barely anybody in fact very few people with manners. Many people with problematic takes that we would all cancel them for now.

I think we can say that pretty clearly they saw the burning tire fire and they said no let's give me something else please because everything was on the table because politics everyone understood to be the distribution of resources splitting stuff up whether kids go hungry or not that's politics and so when an election happens and something like that's happening hot damn. I can help make this thing stop well. We've had the biggest one of those since that election and the results are in person who is just casually engaged in politics tries to better their life. They will watch the two options and what was trump's closing pitch. His last video was him dancing to ymca and a bunch of hooting  dumpster and they can't go down. The toilet give me one element of his of his post-covered pitch to this country that was changed in any way with any genuine policy-based appeal to material conditions especially considering as I said while he's campaigning. He's allowing a non-existent response to covet to be the the only response which is of course just destroying the working class saying you guys. We're not going to pay you to stay at home and prevent you from getting sick and making your family sick. No you have to work. You have to work you have to get your family sick and when you get sick you don't get to you you're going to have to pay for it because we got to keep this thing going that's on the that's not that's on the menu. This is prefix. That's not optional and so you get there. You don't you're not picking between this horror and something else. The horror is baked into the choice. It's how are you gonna experience. It are you gonna live in hell like an  about it. We're gonna have a war in afghanistan until we all die don't be an  get coveted until everyone's dead uh well okay but let's pretend huh. Let's like let's make our masks and let's be distant from one another and hey everybody. You know let's let's try to be responsible uh yeah. Everyone's gonna get it everyone's gonna. Tgi fridays what difference does it make and the fact that trump got covet and then didn't die that sealed it for him.

I mean I'm not even talking about him winning or whatever. I'm talking about just him him wildly over performing for any other president previous to this time in american history running for president in these conditions and his entire campaign was anti-fun thugs being very unfair to wear statues that we love him getting banned off facebook people being very nasty to it. Luciano pavarotti you know lady gaga and it all boiled down to lighten the  car. Why is there a giant vehicle that could just crush you at any given moment well. We got a road there. What do you want. We got to get the stuff to the stuff lung scarring and dead family. Members is just baked in now are you gonna accept it and just  fun while you can or are you gonna whine about it are you going to cry about it. So corona response doesn't didn't hurt him because people just people who hadn't really thought hey. What can the president do about. This thought about it for a minute and said oh nothing but I really like the way dance is. He's pretty funny. He's sure he sure seems more high energy than joe biden who seems like he's asleep all the time and what does he look like and what are his policies actually like why do I even care like god damn this trump guy. He's he's pops look at him pop on screen because he's good at being on tv. He's good at being famous even in those in those when he was like zooted out at the end going to those rallies to talk about pavarotti in front of these like absolutely bemused uh hicks and  your feelings t-shirts and he's like yes sir luciano pavarotti. One of the three tenors I believe it was his performance. It says you wanna you want more of this on the tv or you want sleepy joe and it's like if that's the only question.


Then it's not a moral one and that's where liberals get  around them and they're going to be morally obligated to stop it that would be if they thought they could by voting. You think you can by voting because you've deluded yourself. You've gone to college and gone brave scrambly brains. You've been brainwashed you've been microwaved. Sorry. You can think your way away from it but like that's going to shape your ability to understand the world. Around you all that stuff that you think are moral horrors that trump is responsible for. I think a lot of people don't see them that way they see them as the weather and are you going to complain about it or are you just going to like enjoy it you're going to go bro you're going to hear those big rattling thunderclaps that are going to cry under the  and that's the question people are asking and that's what they're going to keep asking because as I said this cannot be engaged with from below. No mass movement of the left or right will ever affect it because it won't be a mass movement. It'll be a mirage of look like one that is only ever a part of the group of the party. They could either be apostate republicans and then you have a situation where like. I honestly think if this tucker carlson thing goes anywhere. It's going to be the absolute mirror image of what like stupid paul uh people's talk about like the aoc wing of the democratic party. It will be a sheep dip operation. All those people all those like true true-hearted americans like those those uh those guys who love america but did go to college. That's who they are really. There's the guys who did go to college and  hated all the sanctimonious liberals and now they really want more than anything to go back to the state of grace that they used to be in when they were in the land of innocence. Before they even knew it was bad to be an. They want to go back there and like tucker whoever else is going to be a a a dog whistle to get them all to think that their petty identity politics which is all.

It's going to boil down to uh is going to mean anything against the vast machinery of the republican party which is just part of the greater vast machinery of world capitalism that's not going any  where and you're going to pull. People who might otherwise have had some like dim notion of like a civic duty to one another like a dim remnant vestige of an idea which is now just something you learn in college. Not something anyone's have a lived experience of who's under like 60 of like a social obligation to undergird society that's going to just pull you towards these twin polls. These fake parties that are gonna fight. This endless culture war until the world drowns and they will be mirror images of each other yelling across the divide that the other one is either being a sucker or is a. What do we do. We have the data now all right you can say. I told you so to the libs but that doesn't mean anything. It doesn't matter because the notion undergirding a lot of the criticism of the democrats here that I think is misguided and is going to be that they made a choice to run the campaign they ran. They did not make a choice the logic of the party. The fundamental operating system of the democratic party was rewired in the 1970s during the crisis that I like to talk about the crisis of profitability in the in the world capitalist system where we had been the central like productive heart of for our generation and piled up this unseen amount of wealth that we were able to just dis uh distribute to in a obviously racially unbalanced but uh but downward uh redistribution.

The whole system froze up the  engine melted and the political order had to put a new engine in and just like in the 30s this crisis was happening but in the 30s the crisis was experienced as the crisis that it was. But because of all those years of of you know relative security well where where these questions that had been live become deadened even if it's towards like a new deal uh social democratic like uh uh status quo that status quo still becomes dead over time because it's not being engaged with from below. It was created by a huge downward explosion of energy from those working-class movements from the strikes and the wildcats and the  sit-downs of the 30s that pushed uh the working class on into the into the room where these big questions were being asked. By the 70s they were out of the room. The only people in the room were uh people who had no class identification with working people either like as an experience as a felt ex felt lived life experience. Uh or uh materially had no connection to the working class at any time had only an emotional and uh psychological uh uh conception of the working class and the thing is is that any cause if there been any real. Democrats in the room just like if there had been any real union leaders in the room in the 70s when all these things happened not just in the us. In france where there was the great turnaround for meteron and of course in the uk uh and um all throughout the  nato sphere that crisis came and the people. In those rooms. They had the titles of those other guys and girls prime minister secretary. A treasury secretary of union or whatever comp you know but the people in that spot had been changed by time to now be embedded not in the working class but in this professional managerial class and so that means when the working class is on the table. They're not. It's a corpse and because if you were really in that room and you saw the stakes and you understood the stakes you would leave and you'd say. I can't be involved in this and if enough of the people at the top and throughout the system were still engaged enough in politics at that point to get to that point. Then you have a confrontation with capitalism which must happen and it did happen. It just happened behind the scenes. It happened behind our  throat of of of democracy in america and it is done and it was just all right. We have to re-center the economy's profit engine inward. We're not going to be exporting anymore. We're buying. Now that means people are going to have to  turkey and they said well the black people. Uh when we de-industrialized well. You know they haven't really built up a lot of working of a you know middle-class uh experience because you know we so unevenly distributed all that lucra after the war. Because of the racism they we really can't buy them off so uh uh they're gonna have to be just shuffled off into prisons in a mass. Uh just a war on crime that annihilates the urban centers and prevents them from becoming hotbeds of civil unrest.

Uh and then in the suburbs we're just gonna give them bubbles bubbles bubbles bubbles credit credit credit uh and their money. They're not going to realize it that they've actually gained nothing they're passing nothing more on to their except for oh what oh yeah that house that house grandpa bought after world war. Ii you still got that everything else and they were only able to make those decisions because they did not in a critical sense have skin in the game and that meant the party was different and it became constitutionally different. Like the watergate babies were all uh. They were all college-educated professionals in suburbs. They became known as the atari democrats and gary hart became kind of like their kingpin in the 80s and then they essentially took over the  party completely. Dlc was like a attempt to basically put uh the atari democrats into a uh like blue dog southern and like midwestern democratic uh basically a way to like get uh rural get. Some rural votes out of uh and urban votes out of you know that coalition just to extend it a little bit. It had nothing to do with changing the undermined dynamic and the thing is is that that dynamic was set as soon as the working class was dead. You are now just the ghost of a democratic party but you have to pretend that you're still living to fool. Everyone else. No you don't know you're doing this but that's what everyone is doing they're making. They're making trade-offs that you wouldn't make if you knew the stakes and you don't know the stakes not because you're not smart enough to know because it doesn't behoove you to know because your position is better if you don't know there's no way you can upton. Sinclair said there's no way to convince somebody something that they're paid to not understand and what that happened what that meant is that like the project that I was a part of the bernie project. It was dead then but no one. Sailing and obama shows up looking like this absolute mirage until you find out oh. No. He literally was just the the embodiment. He was the anti-christical like hobzy and leviathan composed of this new group of people who were supposed to be the future because look at their demographics. They're so young and diverse.

But it's like oh no then the con. The economy never got never recovered because it can't recover because it's just uh. It's secularly stagnant and we're all doomed and to just strip life of every meaning and replace it with a  transaction that leaves us bereft and that drive is going to make us matter and madder and it's going to make us less more and more alienated from the political system. We're going to be more mad at things and we're going to really want to things to change but our political system is not going to be able to accommodate that and the parties whose job it will be essentially to absorb. That anger is the working-class party of the democrats and they do that by finding the anger points that can be profitably integrated into the greater agenda of capitalism unrestrained by human intervention and that is identity and the thing is that's not the democrats making a decision if any and also they're doing it. After the republicans did it. The republicans did that  the whites uh they they got him in the divorce. Uh what about um how about we get some um what do you call them uh how about we get some of those. Uh this is blacks let's do it good idea. Let's do it and that's what they did and uh that meant that everything then just built around uh it. Every emergent crisis and misery of capitalism was recast as a cultural issue like there's actual issues and policies at play. But the embedded ones that generate the problems cannot change.

Only the epiphenomenal ones like I'm sorry police brutality. Police brutality and police violence is epic phenomenal. To this. It is not the wellspring it is. It is the epiphenomenon it is the system. It's so it's. It's the white blood cells of the system of american capitalism. Attacking this this tumor of like the undigestable uh prolonged. Uh you know uh deprivation of like a racially classed underclass hold. On let there be light okay um. So the whole thing was dead then but people fought the good fight in these systems because they're the only ones we have and only conditions can clarify our situation and for me and other people got here before me and I give them credit but also hey you know if you want to do an end zone. Dan fan fine but and don't end zone dance fine but the whole point is to get people to a place to an understanding so that means that if they do it don't get mad at them for doing it and don't say that you're better than them because you did it first congratulations and there are people who haven't done it yet. But I know for myself that clarifying moment has happened with this election and what this means is that the democratic and republican parties will break away will realign along this axis and become a pure culture war spectator party while the actual business of american capitalism is con concluded behind this uh the scenes which will be the deterritorialization of the anglo-sphere broadly into cantons of techno-feudal uh overlordship. That's what's that's where it's going. If that's unless can unless something intervenes and it might but it'll come from the bottom as scary as that is for anybody who's not because you don't know what they're doing down. There. You're not really one of them you're only guessing what they like what they think what their instincts are are. They really maybe they're all maybe. They are all savages oh god. They scare me maybe maybe. I do like this police state. Now maybe I do like the idea of government. Actually you know what all that drone striking and uh prison population stuff that we're doing you know what I've decided is actually good uh the fact that now we have like a much higher uh white incarceration rate and therefore there's less racial discrimination in our prison system. I feel like that's progress now because you could gotta fight. Off those bad guys the gremlin demons but I'm sorry that's where that's where the power has to come from. Because this system is the uh.


The the ships are in collision course. The the the um the wheels are lashed to the fat masts and they're going to smash and what's going to be left. The remnant of that is just going to be whatever capitally accumulated system of private power has been accumulated and the thing is uh. That's because I really think um. Wait was community communicated. I just uh yeah so there's no there can be no interference. With this. There can be no transcending of this within itself like. I said within itself like that in this and this is for me. This is a continuation of a realization. I had about twitter.

I was like oh this isn't politics. This is a mere shade of politics. Real politics must be engaged with in the real world but now. I realize that oh no that extends to the electoral and not just electoral because people who like don't vote as a principal. I'm sorry they're voters at heart there don't be. Like I was wrong about basically everything. I mean I feel like I was right in that. I understood a lot of like. I feel like. I'm kind of recapitulating a lot of stuff. I've been saying for a while now like. But it's all a growing creeping dread and the reason. It's only a creeping dread is because you can't know there's so much other data. There's so many other possibilities what are they building in. There it isn't until you have something like an election as in 150 million people saying what they want at once basically do you actually get to snap out of it be like oh that quantum superposition the  uh. It's not the frankfurt school or or anybody. It's not and it's not white supremacy. Uh it's not the it's not the just the racial hate at the heart of america. I'm sorry.

It's not that either uh it is the fact the bare fact that we have collectively been stripped of political subjectivity as we used to understand it as people as as a  species political subjectivity meant the the the like uh the 19th century emerging understanding of oneself as a liberal subject among equals uh participating in a political process to chart the destiny of broadly understood. A a group you might think some people thought of this as internationalists. Like this communist. A lot of people found themselves as nationalists but they still thought there was something there that they were working on behalf of and what what our free real estate. What what the fat of the land strategy what the shut up and eat strategy of american rule that just developed out of the sheer fact that we had all this land that we could just distribute and then all this resources by the by the fact of the world war two to distribute then that we could just put off all this stuff and and then like so all this class anxiety that should have been building up like even like even with plenty. There should be there should be class antagonism and alienation building up. It is the thing is it's all being steamed off into culture uh because uh we're able to buy people off but now we can't buy anybody you off. Anymore can't buy anybody off everyone's going to be miserable everyone's lives going to be worse. The kids guys are going to be worse than theirs are all you can do is blame someone for it.

Political theater is involves finding someone for your someone that you have imagined as an other that the techno state can punish on your behalf techno state's not going anywhere. They're going to be throwing people in jail. They're going to be shooting people in the streets someone's blood's running. The good guys are the bad guys schmidty in reasoning which is fascist and I'll get to that um and that's what happens not out of like some sort of you know white supremacy or some uh woke plot by capitalism to to exploit identity. Politics is because people don't experience uh life through a lens of class. At all. They have they have class experiences but they are experienced not on class terms but on gender race demographic terms.

That is how they feel then that is how it absorbs into them and that is how they express their politics which means we move to this carbon copy world without us even understanding it. So that when the time of crisis came in the 70s oh  have we been building ourselves to a conflict with capitalism because we've come to a crisis point. No we spent the crisis point fighting over this big pie that we all had not knowing that the pie was going to start  shrinking and so now it's all about blaming somebody because we're not part of a class. We are 100. We're 350 million individual american consumers with individual um mediated capitalized identities pringles in a tube the raw peasantry of the world and it is the peasantry like america is a country of peasants like if you were enmeshed in a in a bourgeois like uh life matrix for the most part. In most like early formation of america you stayed  uh ireland and uh um italy uh throughout uh and we got turned not into workers. We got turned into consumers because while we were building this post new post new deal political power the engine of our of our mobilization. Uh motivation which was class felt antagonism class felt alienation is steaming away from life and being replaced because you got a house.

Now you got a backyard you got a knife hey. This is pretty nice why do you have to work. Your. Concerns are no longer material because you're taking it for granted and so we had a ghost of a political movement already even before the  uh we're putting a bullet through the heart of the working class and we're going to use bubbles and credit to keep us. Going and people are gonna have to learn to live with less like carter said but then rager came figured out yeah. They're gonna have to learn with less but hey you  because carter was a better man than reagan because parker was a good enough man to see what was in front of and how horrible it was in a way that a lot of those other lizards weren't. But he wasn't uh connected to the working class. As a concept enough to realize the stakes he moralized him his way into thinking well. If I just tell everybody to wear a sweater and be nice to each other it'll be okay. It's like good intentions but it didn't matter because you didn't have anything but that's not anybody's project that is the de materialization of american politics and so what this means is that the democrats cannot act any other way than they do with no political subjectivity. There's no way that the mystery and disenchantment of living in this world will be funneled into a coherent challenge to the existing structure of the democratic party. It will just bleed out into cultural uh resentment that some of it will go towards political targets but a lot of it will just go to people's like people. They don't like in their lives like somebody who stole their headphones or you know somebody who doesn't know how to raise their kids or somebody in the next town over of the wrong race or whatever the  whatever like thing that just can satisfy that urge to make somebody pay for why everything's so miserable and that's the only thing anybody's gonna vote for and you're gonna either get the abstract expression of like actually punishing somebody for for something or the uh. The the more uh the more civilized voter type form of boop going yes please. We'll have a we'll have one murder. I'll have some uh all some murders. Please can. I have some murders. I mean. I would like uh the fbi to raid a uh proud boys. Meeting and shoot 50 people could could. I have that please yeah yeah what you got can.


I get some like 15 blm guys get run over by a  medal to the guy in the white house loan. It's like death machine either way and the thing is the funny thing is is you're not even really picking who's gonna get it. You're picking is who you are going to feel good about it happening to that's it. You're just putting a cone of like perception around some people that you can feel bad for it or feel good about  up depending on if which party you're from and the democrat republicans can't do it different either there's no class base to this. There's no class base to this move to the this working-class move for the republicans none at all and if you can look at any of this stuff from from trump's actual term in terms of things happening like policy happening helping working-class people which up there is zero uh and then the actual. It's all you're picking that  entertaining yourself with politics like it's a sport because that's the kind of thing you think when you go to. Sheep dipping grift as the left wing version of it would be that people are freaking out about it and the thing is that was happening that was coalescing during bernie. Like oh. There is this new like wave of alienation. Oh no we better make sure it's not directed towards class that was a project for sure and it worked to an extent. But it didn't matter because the people you needed to hear the story. The people who needed to hear the whole fight you were having in one way or another or even if they heard it to assign value to it didn't because bernie was selling a line of  because if you say something like I'm gonna give you free healthcare they say well you're lying okay.

What are you really gonna do just like with corbin corbin put social democracy back on the ballot and they said I want brexit because brexit was real to them even though brexit is  not a thing. I mean none of the things that it's not a thing in the sense that when you press the button for brexit basically nobody who is doing that is doing it with any expectation. That brexit will accomplish that fact it will only punish the people they don't like again. You can make it. You can make a left case for brexit and of course the  eu is terrible but leaving the eu. Because it's part of the system is part of this collapsing contraption that's heaving towards defeat and destruction and this bleeding robot corpse. Uh can only  hurt. It's not gonna be a good left there's not gonna be fertile left ground and I think that this election once and for all settles the question of like is fascism here and I think that once again we got turned around spinning in the  quantum wave waiting to be brought into superposition. At by the election we were like yelling at each other about well trump's fascist. I don't know what's your definition of fashion are we talking about uh. Why is it just racism you mean or that's not that's not fascism well actually. I think the country has always been fascist. America is always what that fascism is already here that was all waving at  ghosts because you were talking about 30s fascism. I mean even if you can say no no it's an american vegetable. No if you're using the word fascism if it's going to mean anything it's going to mean the thing and what that thing was what the 30s was was. Yes. It was capitalism and crisis.

Yes. It was capitalism bringing the  uh metropole to to you know enforce uh authoritarian extraction economy and to to replace profit laws uh yes but it is it but what is its political expression. Its political expression is the aestheticization of politics where you take the politics which is in the 30s for people hey sharing shaping human society. That's what people thought politics was in the 30s in europe and italy shaping human society because they were fresh with it. This was like the first liberated work class conscious group of people in human history basically and uh fascism was a way to square the circle by taking that enthusiasm for change the idea that you can change things and directing it towards these notions of like national national identity. Uh of course an internal other who must be defeated because you can't have the one without the other uh as as a antidote to communism and it worked to an extent in that it was mostly effective among the lower  lump in bourgeois. But the thing is is that you are no longer a political subject. You have the political you have the class cut characteristic but you do not experience politics the same way and so applying a table like fascism to it doesn't make sense because as I kept banging the drum reading up to this we don't have fascism in this country because fascism is about incentivization of politics taking the project of of politics and turning it into life. Making. Politics like life like strength through joy projects national greatness because we have no political subjects in this country. What we have instead is post-fascism which is um where aesthetics is politics. Andrew breitbart was on the right track when he said politics is downstream of culture. I was like that's not true because like I'm a marxist but I didn't understand. It's like it shouldn't be true but we have created this unique freak show situation where it is  true and now it's even more true. Politics is no longer downstream from culture. Politics is culture and that is post-fascism and you might say well.

Where's all the where's all the uh the scary stuff that you know is it. The proud boys is it the police. It's like is it trump. It is literally everything man and it has been for a while. It essentially has been since the 70s when the public space collapsed. Something was going to fill the  uh diaphanous culture politics and behind this scenes what it was was the total militarization of society and the technological intensification of our methods of surveillance and enforcement as well as good things like fentanyl and massively available. You know mind-soothing drugs and potence and entertainment options beyond belief all of which get huge amounts of money create whole. New revenue streams to make up for the old dried up at revenue streams and keep things specific you don't need people. You don't need brown shirts. The brown shirts is everything the brown shirts is just the air you breathe but that's not fascism. It just post it as a concept and the reason that's important is because that's the only way you can think about it that reminds you oh yeah. This can't be street battles. Then this can't be fighting along these political terms. These can't be this larping campaign between these joint members of the college party. One of whom are pissed one group of whom are pissed that they're in there and they want to be in the other one and then they fight each other over who's the right person and who deserves the misery that's being inflicted on all their heads by  neoliberalism and that's the key about this. That's the real fascism as it's going to intensify the post-fascism as it's going to intensify into just you know like. I said techno feudalism like like amazon warehouse encampments where you like live work uh and get your nutrient face like that all sounds like a cliche. But it it is in everything and it's not. It's not even a joke anymore. You're not you're not even.

Gonna get any like satirical buzz by saying that it's so s evidently true and what that means is if if we're going to try to like fill in the void of people who are essentially just entertaining themselves with politics even though they think they're really doing politics if we're going to fill it with enough energy to keep them invested. It's going to have to mean that all politics will become essentially sadistic and all politics will be about voting to punish either the  and you can say well that real people you're talking about real issues and real body people in cages and you know real climate stuff and it's like yeah. It all is. It's all true and the body count is going to shift depending on who's in charge for sure specific bodies are going to fall differently one way or the other but the  come to these conclusions. Some people came earlier bravo. I have not is it voting at this point and has been for a while is it's like voting like voting for heidrick or himmler to like replace hitler in 1965 to like who's gonna sign a better treaty with the japanese you know it's like oh. No it's like and then now oh you know there's the moderate nazis which is literally the end of the hilarious thing is that that's how the first season of man in the high castle ended where hitler is the like. The reasonable moderate he's like the never trump. Nazi against the crazy man hydra who wants to start world war three. That's basically in like a less of a scene and of course like we do have real differences but in broad strokes. That is what politics is just in the sense that it cannot be the engine of a change. Like the system no longer has the political participation and that's why amber said something on the stream last night that really hit me like the thing that makes sense now 2024 who's running for president donald trump jr.

Versus ivanka trump because trump no matter if he wins or loses. This. Election is now we live in his america in the sense that he has changed politics in that he has heightened the stakes of it as an entertainment. He's broke both brought poor people in just because he's entertaining to look at. But he has heightened tensions due to his his unconscious just maestro-like ability to pluck people's sensitive spots related to things like identity the things that cleave them to politics and so if if it's trump no matter what then the trump family should really duke it out between the college people and the non-college people. Now of course at the top. They all went to college guys like josh holly what the hell went to college turner crosstalk. Obviously there's tons of college educated guys in the non-college park. There's they're they're they're the ones directing the show but they have an affect. They have views all of which are cultural. Even if some of them they pretend are material dj tj mr carhart hillbilly. I like uh triggered uh epic griper. Uh uh par uh cocktail girly friends the divides right there and eventually we will all be ruled by the  scribbles and so the question then is like all right well.


Where does change come from. I think. I have to uh charge this phone it seems to be uh. It seems to be losing gas. I think that might have helped it. I hope it doesn't run out of battery um so where does change come from well. If we are in that situation where it's like. It's we're at the same state like we're at the same stage essentially in our development that if we want to put a crude like uh comparison to the nazi germany. Uh is like after uh after the enabling acts basically were passed if like if if if if the volker shock is like the enabling acts of post of like spectaclized post. Uh uh uh spectaclized entertainment based uh techno uh post fascism. Uh then how well how do you defeat it. You can't defeat it from within nazi germany held pretty. I mean there was very little internal resistance to to its uh project. It was from without it was from a force that was able to marshal enough but. Human material to defeat it and of course like we helped but at the end of the day we were just a different version of them who had just gotten there earlier like the anglosphere war with germany was essentially over the third world. It was basically we got there first from england in the united states and france to germany and italy and japan who came late because they developed their economies later in the 19th century but realized the same point oh this line only points down  land what do we need to do they gotta crack open somewhere and so laban's realm and the  greater uh east asia co-prosperity spear. But the real horror of it from the point of view of the anglosphere was that they were trying to horn in on turf that had already been taken so that was essentially a sibling rivalry. The real enemy was the soviet union and the thing is is that soviet union was not like I'm talking about how like this world this this system we have is not a project that can in its current condition get us to cap communism. The soviet union was not either and like that one is definitive like we can't say that about now really because there's still contingency that could emerge. We can say it very definitively about the soviet union why because it's gone because it's a. It's a it's a kleptocratic. Uh uh. It's an absolutely cr. It's a kleptocratic uh nightmare gangster state.

It's like devolved capitalism. It's our future. It is the techno feudalism just less techno more and less. Amazon drone techno um so. But they were able to defeat defeat nazism which was good even if they themselves were you know an attempt to like stick create this like zombie communism out of like this. This just resource extraction machine that just turned them into a state capitalist enterprise uh and um but it was it did very necessary and progressive work. It also while it was around helped shape a lot of the post-war world in towards a democrat social democratic way. It pushed it helped give people like leeway in the third world away from imperialism. It helped push the center of gravity left in europe and the united states and latin america that was all good. It did the job but then once it stopped doing the job once once it was gone which was the real bye-bye and that was the inevitable uh end of the 70s. Because as soon as like this is so uni was cut off completely from any hope of a working-class collaboration. Outside of the uh the second world it was over so we're we are in a world now where confronting us is this system where we are ruled over. In this this atlantic. Uh you know global economic order. This the dollar empire that is completely ruled by what is now a fully atomized and lumpin ruling class because when I'm talking about the de-atomization and declassifying stuff that's happened it didn't just happen to the working class. It happened to everybody. It happened to the ruling class too and now they have so compromised the political structure of this country to pursue their naked aggrandizement to to strip the wiring and get the copper piping out cut taxes. Keep profit keep labor costs low that they're destroying the thing. They're destroying the engine that allowed the thing to go they're killing. The golden goose because they don't have anything else. They can do because anything else reduces profits and there's only one button on the  machine and it's more profits that's that's the logic of capitalism that's the algorithm. It's a teleology extract. All profit until our problem is gone. There's nothing else you can say there's other stuff but it all gets squished against that reality. So that's what we have we have this like lumpin. This terminally decadent lump in brutal capitalism and what is what is opposing it and I gotta say.

I look around the world. I don't know a lot of stuff. I know a little. We are all to to paraphrase nixon. We are all dengusts now because I do not think that china is a communist country or even or a socialist country. Remotely. It's not social democracy either which I hilariously saw somebody call it. It's an authoritarian state capitalist enterprise because uh the communist revolution was not like a real communist revolution. It was essentially a peasant. It was a cyclical peasant uprising that was like a feature of chinese uh uh chinese history for two thousand  toppled but the western powers kind of pushed the coke back over to render coke machine from falling over and then it wobbled around for a while and then it smashed and all the  goodies went everywhere and when the communists took over there essentially was not a mode of production we as we understand it there which means they couldn't build communism. But communism is you take the mode of production of capitalism. The development of it and then you tr you you further transcend its contradictions. They didn't have any contradictions a thing they had  moved any of that but there got to be a point where you had people in charge who understood that they felt communism to them was chinese in a way that communism wasn't for soviets. Like soviets. It was not russian. Like there was there was soviet. There was always russian uh chauvinism of course in the soviet union but communism was not russian to soviets the way that communism was chinese to the chinese because like most of the places where there was a post uh world war ii communist insurgency or revolution uh nationalism was engraved with it because they had not gotten to a point where they were able to create like a fully realized bourgeois democracy to create contradictions within itself. So they were still stuck at the nationalist level. That europe was in in the 19th century and that's not their fault. They didn't do anything wrong.

It's inevitable uh but that's what happens and so we don't it was not. It's it's not but what it is is. It's essentially capitalism with chinese characteristics and the 21st century will be capitalism with chinese characteristics and a capitalism with atlantic characteristics and what that boils down to is uh the algorithm of capitalism working its logic of extraction and stripping resources and human degradation until we are. It's one guy in a  a sex bot in his 50 000 uh uh clone body. Uh that's like more like the only uh. That's that's it now once again not saying that's inevitable it has to happen because there's the stuff from below and that's happening in china and it's happening in here. And we can't know what it's gonna do. It's a black box because we're not in the box. We're here we're here in the the the discourse zone and we can't get out of it. We can only guess so. I'm not saying black pill. Nothing matters. I'm saying it's going to come from the roots and that's all you can say you can't operate from lonely premises and try to make it happen. You can't be unintervened with its capitalism with kindness chinese characteristics and capitalism with atlanta characteristics and so it's like all right if that's our option don't give me this. Because check me off about that for a number of reasons one of which is like the matt stoller terror vision of the chinese taking over like they imagine they imagine that the chinese took over. They would imply the impo they would import the amount of social coercion they use in china on here. They absolutely would not do that why would they do that what would be in it for them. They wouldn't need to do it. We are all conditioned already. We have our toys. We're fine just give us a  blues clues. We're good so it's not nothing having to do with that.

It's if the future isn't building socialism in the near term. It's um essentially dealing with the uh not unstoppable number of uh exacerbating and and echoing and resonating crisises that are going to make up the 21st century climate related. Covid is number one. It's like we're already doing. All these disasters are happening but they're happening beyond the perception of like us as happening to us. It's just kind of a thing covent is is is the first real event like global warming. It's all discrete stuff that is not this is materialized. This is a crisis like this is like model u.n  like crisis. How do you deal with it and you give the you give you got the model you and hey chinese team. You got a corona outbreak and wuhan american team european team because it's not just us. It's the entire anglosphere. European team. You got this all right. What's your project. What do you got china yeah. We contained it locked it down. It's gone you can go to wuhan the place where the  uh rave jacuzzi wave pool with 500 other people um how about you atlanta says oh. We've all just uh realized. We're all gonna die of it or not uh or maybe get a vaccine uh. But we're just kind of like working out. How we're gonna you know deal with the fact that we're. They have the chinese communist party which for now anyway seems to have maintained a degree of like self-consciousness to some degree understanding of china as a project understanding of themselves as having a part in a project that is chinese as in like the well-being of the people abstractly understood figure into things at some level and you might say yeah but not really no. Of course. Not people are sacrificed every day. It's a  thresher there's just fresh. There's just thresh so people say this is dark. This is depressing but for me this was liberating because I realized okay. We're all dengueists we have to in the coming conflict between uh the dragon and the eagle. We must back the dragon uh and I think that's true uh.

But the thing is there is literally nothing. I can do about this at all zero percent zero percent. I think can do can't do a thing a thing about this uh. I'm not gonna move to china. What am I gonna do join the  people. They're good. They have no use for me all right. I stay here. I go somewhere else what am I gonna do am. I gonna go on twitter and like argue about how many swimming pools they have at the uyghur concentration camps and how that means they're actually woke what difference does that make it's all just in the  holodome of political amusement am I getting anything out of this if I'm not contributing to the chinese victory. No so why do it. The most you could ask of me is that like I will live my normal life and I'll be like those early english romantic poets who would sit around and do opium and read each other's sonnets about how much they wish. Napoleon would invade so this whole thing has just been the circle. I'm back to exactly where I was. I still have this political system. I still have this job. I still have this brain. I still got to do what I got to do. But I have just shed myself of an expectation of politics providing a meaning being a vessel for pursuit that I thought it had and what that means is is that if I go forward talking about american politics the way I have the last four years. I will be a grifter which many people of course have called me over the years and I always never. I never got that I'm like I give people a show they want to show what do. These people mean. I'm not I'm not lying to them. They get a show. I'm not like wrist delay but not saying you know pay for my wedding or you know pay for my kidney replacement than buying a  vacation. It's the undergirding grip is that and this is the reason everybody calls each other grifters is because in the political media which is where the term grifter emerges and what people use to describe it not just consumers and distributors which is a lot of the same people. It is a understanding that we that there is no political there's no political meaning to any of this that all these arguments will flow towards no good end. They are being had for amusement and so that means that if you talk about politics for entertainment and you invest it with meaning you are grifting them and the thing is. I think now that that's true but only if you know that it's empty and I swear that god hand to heaven. I didn't know and nobody on the  quantum zone. I can't like this all makes sense now. This is all obvious now but we didn't have the data yet we had polls which who the  box the cat is dead. Pretending. The cat's alive now would be grifting and so I'm not gonna stop talking about american politics obviously sorry. I am going to promise right here to do it only in that entertainment mode and to not give the false impression to people listening that their consumption of the product of my show or stream or anything I might put out is constitutive of political action.


I mean I always used to say that but god I didn't know how much I meant it. I was afraid to know how much I meant it because then what do. I do with my life and the answer to that is. I can still do what I do but if I feel like. I want to make life better for the people around me. I have to look around myself and what is that if I'm looking around myself if I'm really paying attention to the world around me where I might notice oh my god. What's that oh my god what the. I was on my phone the whole time. Why was this happening what. I'm in here now oh my god is that gonna happen. I don't know I do know that if I try to convince myself that that's not the case no I'm gonna get out of this rat maze. I will end up like nate. Silver. I will end up like anybody who uh has fallen into the discourse hole in the side of the like real world ruling class is uh like globo homo or whatever this idiocy is you have all been trapped by the  maze and I'm still going to be in the maze. This election just has given me a experiential load star that I can grip whenever I feel like I'm spitting off into anything other than a cold-eyed understanding of where the  grip he wants to keep it going this guy. This sort of thing is the perfect way to keep it.

That's true too I of course. I don't want a real job my god who would they're horrible. I've had real jobs they suck. I would rather do this. I think. I'm good at it. I'm pretty. I think. I'm pretty good at it. People seem to like it. I want to keep doing it if I can but I i can't pretend. It's politics anymore at all which I used to be able to certainly during bernie. I really thought oh my god I've squared the circle. I can just have fun and not do real politics and actually be doing. Politics is to look at this but anyone I was wrong because I didn't understand how the mechanism worked. I guessed it. I wrote an article for jacob about the uh the iowa state fair and how I saw bernie and I thought it was really cool. But I just noticed how few people actually stop and listen to the presidential candidates at that fair. Considering how many people go to it how many people are just going to get the  corn dogs how many people are just walking by at the end of the article saying it's going to come down to how many of those people are going to stop and turn around and we didn't know and now we know. I think definitively what we have so.

It's up to you to decide to see full of  running around uh and then you pay me put me on the pain on my list which I understand or does any of this make sense and if it does is it entertaining to you does it help you maybe re-center politics for yourself so you don't spend the next four years whether it's biden grinding through some fight with a republican congress giving way to uh. Uh john taffer winning in 2024 or um or dealing with trump ratcheting up and then like trying to cope with it by uh deciding actually no. I'm going to convince myself that the aoc if I'd uh neoliberal uh like synthesized post-bernie left thing. That's going to create a real working-class movement in america or against that saying you  cucks it's tucker carlson. An american greatness conservativism that's going to save the working-class project in america. You were both unable to get out of the maze and find real meaning in anything other than convincing yourself that this little  rat maze means anything you will be rate silver and look how nate silver his age. The man is just falling apart because he lost the ability to recognize where he was in the maze of of perception and being able to understand the vast difference between his position in the world and his ability to affect change on it. The only promise I can make anybody is that my god if there is a. Here it works somewhere somewhere it worked we're  here.

It's gonna be because enough people have broken out of the this rat race of of stimulus response and just grievance mongering where you're driven towards a politics that is just is polarized grievance aggregators it'll and because they've seen the conditions surrounding them and with people around them who they trust who they build trust with through cooperation move forward together and break through a lot of uh political like superstructure that is very rickety and could be once again orthogonally attacked from an unexpected direction just like it was in the 30s but it's not going to come. It's not going to be reasoned out that means not only not being on reasoned out through talking about elections. It's not going to be reason out through elections now maybe at the local level. You can get enough people together behind a candidate with a position like a position a specific fulcrum of power within a system to actually help things create a thin uh thin edge of a wedge that you can gather momentum behind go for it. But the only way you're gonna know about that is if it's right in front of you. You're not gonna  experience and that sucks because we don't have the time or energy for that. That's why it's very difficult to imagine it. Working but detaching from this matrix is the only way and that just as logging off it means logging off from caring about politics as we have conventionally understood it entirely and it is sports for ugly people.

That is it and anybody who said that before me you were right but if anybody who says it isn't saying it after me. I'm sorry you're wrong and you might say well you were wrong before and it's like yes. I was wrong before and I'm still wrong about other stuff. But I'm not wrong about that and you can just look back. We have an actual record. Now. It's a fossil.

Limbo. We're out of the jaunt. It was a long jaunt indeed and we're the gibbering madman at the end of that story and now. It's what what are we going to do are. We going to just go to the mental hospital and tear our eyes out or are. We. Gonna get the  work uh figuring out our connection to reality again re-territorializing our surroundings so that is our task we'll see how we do with it. I wish you luck in the coming year.
