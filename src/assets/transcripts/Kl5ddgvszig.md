Right about now oh so brother check it out now thanks little brother right about now the funk soul brother check it out now a funk soul brother all consumers all consumers consumers the funk soul brother right about. Now the funk soul brother check it out. Now the funk soul brother consumers are consumers and about now about now about now about now about now about now right about now the funk soul brother check it out now on the funk soul brother right about now the funk soul brother check it out now the funk soul brother do we loved. Fatboy Slim didn't we for a brief time a brief a brief moment. He was our national Bard really a little pig-faced British man at a piano talking about the funk soul brother talking about praising you weapons of choice. Oh man don't ask me about the floating Rock I have no. Idea.

I am not a science guy don't call me that I'm not Bill Nye I'm. I'm remarkably narrow in my understanding of the of the world. I cannot even understanding because obviously that's non-existent for anyone certainly me but rather for even um like competence you know to engage on it. It's mostly a mystery because I can't do math and I just sort of as a lazy little turd was like you know what this is difficult and why should I try to do better. Yeah didn't really see the point in doing good at anything when I was a kid That is that feeling has persisted ever since and has gotten me where I am today which is not a endorsement of me or my worldview. But rather a absolutely lacerating indictment of the world that I've emerged into that let me float like a turd through the sewers into where I am okay.

Yeah did I say something about Oppenheimer because I saw it and I thought it was pretty good. I liked it I liked watching it. I think that it's It's a little weird how it's balanced because it's very short um very short scenes up until the the bomb going off and then as soon as you get to the the dueling conferences. The scenes get longer or they feel longer anyway and you know that is an accurate way to to depict someone's life retrospectively. You know it gets longer as you get closer to the end. It stretches out you know like a singularity and we know our boy Nolan loves his time dilation um so I think the latter half of it drags a little bit although the latter half does have my favorite scene in the movie which is Gary oldman's demonic hick Harry Truman just being fully contemptuous of oppenheimer's pretensions of moral ambiguity and I think people have said like some people have interpreted that scene as you know Harry Truman wanting the credit for the bomb and others are saying no you know he's he's He's indicting oppenheimer's cowardice and the thing is. It's. It's they're both true. You know Like there is the horror of the realization of this guy who had convinced himself. We have to build the bomb so that people will be properly afraid of it coming face to face with who people in charge are and who how they are not people who give a about any of that stuff. In fact there are people who are turned on by the prospect of mass death and who are going to be morbidly compelled to move closer and closer towards it.

That's who accumulates around power but also like there is something more virtuous to Truman's maybe Psychopathic acceptance of responsibility. I dropped the bomb. He didn't crybaby because I don't see how anybody could see the movie as as being is it excusing oppenheimer's character. It's just deeply deeply critical of him as a character. He is a cipher and a coward throughout and that's the kind of person who gets bent. That's the kind of person who's genius and abilities get bent to the will of a uncaring and impersonal machinery and like even a guy like Harry Truman. He is a demonic hillbilly but he is also trapped in Gears and to me. The best part of the movie is that Nolan's limitations as a filmmaker. His literal mindedness It limits his ability to really try to get across what he is trying to emotionally which is the reality of the the Machine World harp. The bomb was a harbinger of a machine world that was built by a bunch of people with their with some variety of good intention. But that intention mixed with personal selfish interest alchemizing into being this. This Alien machine Consciousness powered by literally the Sun a God. If you will a new God on Earth and the people who built it. None of them were seeking its to its creation. They were seeking some other Horizon but while their eyes were on that Horizon they were in with their hands building something terrible and Nolan can't really get at what he's trying to come across because like I said he is too literal-minded.

He gets he has a few moments of artistic license like when the hand the black the gloved hand is briefly shown drowning his girlfriend. His communist girlfriend and when you know he gets his panic attacks and the screen starts to shake and it gets light but for the most part you know he's stuck in his his literal register and but he's gesturing towards it. He's reaching. Beyond his grasp and just seeing him go for it kind of highlights. The the shadow shape that he's trying to gesture towards a lot of people have compared it to Oliver Stone and I think that is after comparison because but he does not have the lyric heart of Oliver Stone and the will and the willingness to be embarrassing basically that Stone had the earnestness if you will the lack of calculation the hot blood running through his veins. But even then it's it's even the fact that even Nolan a director as cool as Nolan is trying to sketch. This thing out makes its presence all the more resonant and Dreadful when the movie ends like I get the purpose of the straws character and the Strauss turn which is oh here's another guy who is motivated by a combination in his mind of best intention and self-interest destroying Oppenheimer.

The same way Oppenheimer destroyed all those Japanese people and he will in turn be destroyed. Like that is the reason that that's in there because you have to show that this is not just one tragedy that this is the tragedy of modern life being brought down by your adherence. Your unconscious adherence to a machine of Destruction that incl and the destruction includes you foreign but it probably went too long. I I think they could have probably trimmed it The bomb was nice and somebody says my favorite side character. You gotta go with my boy David krumholtz. Is Isador.

[09:26](https://youtu.be/Kl5ddgvszig?t=09m26s)

Rosin was his name. I never heard of that guy but now he's awesome and because krumholtz brought it. And I think I've said this before. But I love watching Crum holtz's career because he's about my age and I remember him. When I was a kid. He was a kid. He was in like Adam's Family Values having a hard crush on Christina Ricci and I was like join the club and then we age the same time like when I was in the Apatow movies as a guy of my demographic was basically bound to be because you know I'm not a rebel. I'm not a I'm not outside the system. I am a product of it. I am a piece of I'm a Pringle He was like a knock-around guy with the app attacker and I'm like hey Crum Holtz and now though he's like aging into a real like fat classic Fat Guy character actor like who can play a authority figure or a lawyer or a scientist with like a bit of humor. But also gravitas and I compare him to like the millennial Saul rubenek and he's he is like Saul rubinek in um Buster Scruggs so yes love my crumb holds. So yeah. I would say a thumbs up to Oppenheimer probably one of his better films for sure but also you know it is.

What we can make right now you know and that does mean this sort of middle brow you know engagement with the past like that's that's what money can get you nowadays and it's like. It's one thing when that's one thing of a bunch of stuff you can get. But when it's the best thing you can get it really does speak to a general decline in cultural production and when I say that that is not just me being a grumpy old man I mean it is looking at the material. The economic reality of media has changed in fundamental ways. We still have media and you can argue that it serves the same function. It has historically but the media that I think of when I say media is declining but I mean for my own sake. I'm also happy that oppenheimer's excited because I know anything I would want to create would be about that era as well like that 20-year period when the the the being that was birthed by the defeat of Christ at Armageddon aka the end of World War II at this point like documenting. It's it's existence is is sort of a bleak docudrama if you want to get creative and artistic in any way you really have to look backward. At least I think so I'm not or I'm not certainly not imaginative good enough to go beyond that. So it's like everyone who's left who still wants to pay for media is going to want to hear a story about how we got here oh. Somebody asked Upton Sinclair movie instead of a straight biography of Upton Sinclair which would be very interesting because he was a fascinating guy and an example.

He's like a signal figure to like tie the Puritan tradition to like modern American progressivism and socialism. Like there is a strain of American leftism that is not Marxist really and that was born in the communitarian impulse of early New England and was then nurtured by the congregationalists who then became universalists and then became by the 19 late 19th century spiritualists and eventually became like new age secularists and the guy like Upton Sinclair. Another guy like Henry Wallace like exemplify that but up to secularism or even more interesting because he embodies the woo-woo element of it too because like he was big into he wasn't just a socialist but he was also big into telekinesis. He wrote a book about communicating with people's mind to mind called spirit radio I believe which had a endorsement in the front by Albert Einstein. Although it's very condescending. He's basically like well you know we don't really know anything about anything. So. This isn't any more ridiculous than any of the other stuff. But I think it even more interesting take on the character would be an adaptation of a great book by Chris. Bachelder called us I think I might have mentioned it. Recommended on stream before that would be a good movie to make it's. It's about a Eternal Upton Sinclair who keeps getting dug up and executed by right Wingers and then very then unburied and then shot again and you know you know he's a metaphor for the American left. In general it would be and it gets at what like what a weird guy he was you know he had He didn't just write like um expose although that was his bread and butter He also wrote a series of sort of like Espionage novels with this character Lanny Bud that were big like best sellers when they came out and I think he even won a Pulitzer Prize for one of them and now are. I think almost entirely out of print but it wasn't great. He wasn't a great writer you know because that writing wasn't his first impulse. It was social change and the book us is largely about the difficulty of trying to do political art.

It's interesting because you think about the end the Epic campaign in 1936 when he ran for governor and um you see the way that the capital in California played Hardball in that election. Like the way that the Hollywood bigwigs were they were literally doing fake news. They made the first like propaganda pseudo newsreels to show like hobos are coming from around the country to vote for Upton Sinclair so that they can get a free meal and they docked their employees pay including all the big stars to donate to the Republican non-entity who was just like a complete husk Frank Merriman and how they were able to overcome Sinclair's huge lead early on after the primaries by swamping him and how you know he couldn't really respond and you think oh if only he'd been a harder character if he'd been. He'd been less of a wooly headed idealist a goofball but who else could have body that message at that time realistically who's. Gonna get a major party nomination in a state like California other than a celebrity who came at socialism not from the class Warfare streets but from Realms of abstraction and idealism and liberal universalism because the former is not metabolizable by the electoral system because it denies its principle which is a Cooperative democracy as opposed to a zone of constant non-stop class conflict and the government as some sort of all-class Coalition. Affair that uses Democratic means to pursue ends policies rather than the dictatorship of the bourgeois but the book isn't really isn't about his life. It's yeah this fictional zombie Upton Sinclair. But it's it's very good too who would play Upton Sinclair in a body of biopic that's a good question. We need a big lanky guy honestly the same the same answer whoever you whatever answer you gave would probably also apply to Eugene Debs bio biopic because they're both. They're both tall. Patrician looking string beans even though Upton Sinclair was like from the declining New England aristocracy.

 and Debs was like from the from the midwestern the Pioneer stock but they both kind of look. Similar God damn it. I'm on the wrong page where are you ah. Oh did I get rid of it. I think I got rid of the chat. There. It is the family actually was a were from money but you know they were relatively recent immigrants as opposed to sinclairs who were old time like Mayflower types I haven't seen Barbie. Yet I will though I know I have to I know that you if you see one you're declaring more on the gender of the other and I don't want to declare war on ladies. So I will I will see it. But I have not yet playing around in the in the the petroleum graveyard bequeath To Us by the nuclear age like that that creature that techno machine powered by the Sun that Oppenheimer helped give life to. At the end of World War II. It took the world from us and what it left us with is a pseudo realm where we get to play with its products with the things that it shits out as it consumes the world to choose through the biome and shits things out and we get to live in a sandbox of its turds and that's what I'm going to bring to Barbie like okay. You know we're talking about mid-century toys which is part of the process of building the consumer. Heaven that the workers at the core of this new capitalist regime would be incentivized with you know like the big big cars with fins for the dads and little plastic dolls for the boys and girls barbiturates and frock coats for the moms.

Someone says that Elon Musk has had hair plugs 22 times I believe it I gotta say that's how you know that that um in terms of like personal charisma you know like in a room with of the of the super billionaires I hate to say it. But it's clear that Bezos is like the alpha of that group and one of the way you know. That is that when his hair started falling out he just shaved his head and he was like yeah. That's right. I'm a musk stapling carpet samples to his forehead. That is you're coming from Hunger. You are you are deeply insecure and you're never going to be able to command a room. Bezos was from money and he famously got a hundred thousand dollar loan from his parents to start Amazon but he was you. I don't think his parents were as well. I don't actually know if his parents were as wealthy as as elons were Zuckerberg. I think was sort of from professionals right. His parents were like College professors or lawyers or something. I believe it'll be really interesting to watch the the different rich people as they start taking ozempic and you sort of see them get weirdly thin like not just thin but weirdly thin and just call it out as it's kind of spreading up and down the celebrity wheel and God bless them you know.

[24:27](https://youtu.be/Kl5ddgvszig?t=24m27s)

I don't I don't begrudge them they're right to do so. I don't think you should you know shame people at this point for just trying to get through you know that is a big political difference. It's like to what degree is. It is it incumbent upon you to stand a thwart. Folly and Shout stop how uncommon isn't you to like say to say that like social pathologies are real and I gotta say not very because all you're doing is wrapping yourself in a flag of righteousness and branding yourself as one side or another of a affective culture War that doesn't make anybody's life better either and that it's just another brand of of of pathological Solace. Seeking okay somebody asked about the West African coup situation and this is one where I don't really know that much. But I think this isn't I I would like to know the answer to this question and how people have like metabolized. This so people have pointed out that all these generals who've been doing coups in the Sahel got training by the United States. They were part of that core of officers that got picked out you know as as the Colonial administrators for American power in the region you know but now you've got a situation where ecowas which is an American cat's paw like ecowas is part of the whole NATO complex of American hegemonic military force deployment is now threatening to invade Nigeria to overthrow their coup government and these guys are apparently collaborating with Wagner group dudes so does this mean then that the rubric that has said historically anytime you see a formerly some group that was formerly trained by the United States doing a coup doing some sort of bad thing that it is on American orders. Like the classic example of this are the Zetas in Mexico who were Special Forces operators from Mexico who had been intensely trained by the United States to be the point of the Spear of the Mexican War on Drugs and they promptly took their talents to the gulf cartel and then eventually became their own. Cartel noted for their extraordinary ruthlessness much like Isis in the post-iraq civil conflict in Syria and in Isis. What do you have you have a leadership that was in the case of the original Isis imprisoned in American Military prisons in the case of the the Isis in Afghanistan. That is now at war with the Taliban our old enemy. You've got guys who like were literally on American who got American training and were on the American payroll and worked for American. Approved Warlords. I mean that does look to wonder that one's what does look like to one from one perspective by this seamless. Garment of oh you know it is in the interest in any one of these unstable situations to control both ends of the dial of a dynamic by having a side that you have chosen backed and then also having a a control over like the most violent element so that it can be directed and then its existence can be used to justifies further spending and involvement.

Like that's all that all makes sense it all tracks but then you got these. Guys in the Sahel who are taking their American training to South Beach is that part of the same plan or can sometimes American assets turn now the way I think you could distinguish this if you wanted to save. Your premise is that the distinction between these things is that now for the first time guys like the generals and Colonels that we train in the Sahel see an alternative to American hegemony to pursue an alliance with and because now Wagner standing in for Russia and and the the prospect of China out there willing to spend to develop African countries now gives these guys an incentive to turn against their former Masters whereas in previous situations those forces that Americans were backing had really nowhere else to go perhaps I don't know that's why I don't sit from my perch and point out psyops and do I know all I have is a rubric to apply but the very thing about these rubrics. Heuristics is that they guide an encounter with evidence that I'm not going to have because I'm not going to find anything out really about what's going on anywhere and I feel like it'd be more healthy. If more people understood. Exactly how limited their perspective is no matter how expansive it appears through the glamor through the is the image is is the thing like it's like if you think of a heuristic as like a Target you know like a crosshairs on a scope and then you're trying to like you know beat. In on something you're so lens that all you're seeing is the big cross in the middle and everything else is blurry and then you're describing that like it's the world. So I'm happy to say I have no idea. That's just something I thought was interesting and that's all I'm here to do is to be mildly interesting to be more be more to be a more entertaining option than staring at the wall for the people who tune it.

As always. The messages do not invest in these things as aren't as part of an identity as a way to interact with other people as a way to guide your understanding of you know the life you you live as opposed to the life that you encounter in a pseudo form and again. This is just me reminding myself to not get carried away. It does seem like the ukrainians that whole thing is not going well though not seeing even the Ukrainian sources. The pro Ukrainian sources like the New York Times are even kind of admitting that it's not going great and when you consider how fervently they were in unison and insisting that Ukraine had this for them to now be like God damn. We tried to train these people so that they could do combined Arabs assaults and now they're all getting their asses kicked so they just went back to walking artillery up and down the ammo. Although I gotta feel like for now that is still an endless well to have to dump Surplus into you know I do wonder if it would do it if it would be to the rhetorical advantage of China maybe to I guess not they. I think yeah just for someone to articulate the idea that like it's not the US is defending like a free world against a some sort of subordinated authoritarians. You know Empire. But it's also not you know a campus epic third world is defeating Washington's you know America kakan Empire. It is compete for Spears of influence you know in the 19th century pre-ideological sense but of course you point out that led to World War one and you're like ah yeah. There's really no way out of of the conflict unless US unless technology saves us. That's really it and it feels like. Evermore are are the world that we're fed for I'm not talking about the world. The life we live the life we lead. But the life that we are fed is filled with these tokens of annihilation and political Annihilation and natural island or technological salvation and I think it is not.

The point is not to pick one or the other. The point is to accept them as both the the polls generated by a giant social psyche encountering a real mental break and and going through a mental break towards or away from one or another versions of the future. Not one or another of course infinite but like broad strands like how it's going to turn out and it's going to look different than it is now but that process is a continuous one and it does not. It is not made up of a final irrevocable break. It's made up of smaller breaks that are then after they happen assimilated into a new normal and and we continue to be suspended between those two polls between salvation and Damnation and then we all get our individual salvation or damnation or both one than the other that's my theory damnation. First then salvation. We all get it individually but like the the social apotheosis we seek is not coming and if that's not going to happen because as I said that battle was already fought and we lost then how do we gather together as many people to experience something other than that in their lives something other than the continued march to annihilation and that only comes if you have something else that defies the world has fed to you the world that you can that you are choosing to consume. Also it's not just being force-fed. People think of it in those terms oh you're Force feeding me this ideology. No this is a mutual relationship. It's a it's a nectar. It's a it's a Nepenthe. It is opium but not just in the in the pathological sense of opium but in the sense Marx used it at as a Soother of pain pain that must be sued for life to continue yeah.

It's like oh aliens are just going to show up at the U.N and fix everything we're gonna get this room temperature super colliders and we think the accumulation means that apotheosis is near. But we are absolutely the one thing we cannot really reckon with in when we're trying to consider. A moment in time is that over time the ability to accommodate a more and more granularly populated data set where vital stuff is pushed out to make room but where the the the the the it is essentially an endless input until of course. Everything gets clogged up and then you explode and that is what we're all in the process of doing but those explosions because we are de-atomized and we are de-politicized. They do not that that explosion does not pressure power a like a piston action. The way it does in a revolutionary situation. It's just dispersed because there is no vessel to contain it. Those vessels have been destroyed. What comes next is an organic re-emergence of something that is not maybe a automobile but is a social and biological machine capable of survival and that will emerge like roots and and and weeds growing up through that the cracked engine of a junked car yes Guild Navigators. That's what we need. We need people to eat this stuff and let it poison them but then also spew it and you know what what a coincidence.

I think I just demand for the job I get to keep doing this in any world. I am so lucky. What are the odds that I am perfectly positioned to do the right thing God what a coincidence better not think about that too hard all right. Let's do another fun thing to do that's just fun. It's just fun like I said more fun than looking at your more fun than looking at Twitter although you might be doing that too more fun than looking at Twitter and watching something else. I guess more fun than whatever menial task you're doing while you're listening to this and that's all again that I can aspire to so.

[39:30](https://youtu.be/Kl5ddgvszig?t=39m30s)

We got one more pack another pack. Here we have more than one but this is today's pack of go4 trading cards. We've got a military asset the A7 Corsair. This is pretty cool looking Corsair of course. An old-timey way to say pirate the Barbary corsairs first Loan in 1965 the A7 has been phased out well. Why am I even talking about it then after long service to both the U.S Air Force and the US Navy that modern version can carry more than five fifteen thousand pounds of an Armament and has a reputation for delivering its weapons on target oh well. That's good for Operation Desert Storm. 20 a7s were deployed in the Persian Gulf. So this guy's this guy is out of here bye bye manufacturer LTV core speed 793 miles per hour range 943 miles. Combat Armament one 20 millimeter gun variety of missiles including Sidewinder Maverick shrike harm or bomb one-man crew.

We love one of those yes the Corsair specifically as someone points out always a Muslim pirate like I said the Barbary corsairs. And Muslim piracy was a good gig. It's like one of the best things that could happen to you if you like were a Catholic child in a like. Calabrian Village is that a Barbary Corsair would roll up you get abducted you get brought onto a ship. They convert you to Islam and if you have a little bit of gumption if you got a little get up and go in in only a few years you'll be in command of your own. Corsair and stacking ducats and also what a way to convert someone to a religion you know like sure they probably didn't necessarily believe it when you did it to them as a children child on forcefully. But after hey I accepted Allah and now I am him all right.

We've got the fighting ship the USS Ranger. The new SS Ranger Ranger commissioned in 1957. The USS Ranger was the first ship designed exclusively as an aircraft carrier. Of the forestall class. She is larger than her sister carrier in the Persian Gulf Midway by more than 10 000 tons holy crap why were we even reading about Midway earlier. Them the ranger ordered to the Persian Gulf in November 1990 carries an assortment of 85 aircraft. HomePort is San Diego displacement. 79 200 tons will load length 1039 feet speed 33 knots aircraft 85 and a crew of 6289. It doesn't say any Marines though on this one interesting I guess. There's no law on the Ranger. There's no one to throw you in the brig. If you want to get nasty okay.

We got the intelligence files here rank very important to the military. Very important to the military got to say it's it's not a great sign for communism that or at least some of the you know Associated assumptions around communism. As it's been practiced historically that every time a Army abolishes rank. They end up reinstituting it one way or the other. It's like when you're when you're trying to kill get people killed. You really cannot abide to talk about who's going to get killed because the at that point. There is a full conflict between each member of the group because it's a zero-sum game of dying or not dying and you can't have unit cohesion at that point. Military rank is a position in a chain of command through which information and orders are transmitted for the non-nable forces. The basic positions from top down are General Colonel major Captain Lieutenant Sergeant Corporal and private for the U.S Navy. The officer positions our Admiral Captain Commander. Lieutenant and Ensign intermediate ranks exist between some of these positions.

Someone says some people say it hasn't happened that often well yeah communist revolutions are relatively rare in history. I mean they've only been possible in the last like less than 200 Years anyway um but you know the Bolshevik Army. The Red Army started off the ballistic. Revolution was in large part A Soldier's Revolt among conscripted Aristo and that did not last the anarchists tried to do sort of non-hierarchical militias and that did not last either yes. They were sort of forced to by the communist. Bourgeois government the the popular front between the Bourgeois and the Communists. But you know they were a lot. They they were unable to defeat that you know if it's if it's. If it works. It should work against guys who really you know. They have. They've hoarded the Weaponry from the Soviets. But it's not that much of a of a a of a conflict I mean. It's not that much of a it's not wildly out of size and you got a big number of guys in concentrated in places like Aragon and in Catalonia. But they just they couldn't. They could not.

Then the big test was in May when the Communists came for the Socialist or the anarchists Social Power when they they came for their control of infrastructure and control of military units and the control of production among the cooperatives they could not Marshal a defense. Their Grassroots wanted to fight but the leadership could not realistically imagine coordinating them and so they saved their own asses which leadership is always going to do and even the anarchists ended up with leaders because you're in a crisis you were in a moment of complete extremity and those are the moments when historically hierarchy is temporarily essential. Somebody says the Spanish Civil War makes you really feel like the entire project is doomed and that is a very interesting thing to say because I think that that to get Bill Clinton on it for a second I believe that is 100 accurate as long as we agree on what the term the project is now. If we describe the project narrowly as the Christian the judeo-christian Socialist vision of of of transcending class Society through the app through socialization and the application of Technology. If we want to call it that that project I believe that was a 20th century project that was defeated over the course of the 21st century starting gunfired and preserio Sarajevo in 19 um. 14. The the tide turning the the battle the most meaningful battle. The outcome determining battle being won at the end of World War II and then the final the final route in the early 90s was the end of the Soviet Union and the Spanish Civil War really does exemplify exactly why that project failed and the big the big reason and this is what the thesis of my Spanish Civil War series I'm writing right now is is.

It comes down to the these spatial and temporal shape of the communist movement. The however you want to define it incorporating not a specific agenda but a generalized idea that animated people everywhere to one degree or another even in opposition to or in support of polarized towards and of course the way they act is contradictory. Sometimes it helps that cause sometimes it hurts it. Sometimes it can do both. At the same time Christian is a made-up term but the idea of the the monotheistic Amino a monotheistic conception of of of the universe that puts the self one one self defined as a member of a group at the center of it begets the the intellectual lineage that is on top of the machine of capitalism that we live within and it's been developed over the centuries through that machine's operation and it created within it contradictions new emergence and counter. Hegemonic Notions and socialism is the 19th century variant of that. Like the peasants.

Wars had been of the 16 1500s but you have a situation where War takes a process that is happening nationally at a given Pace in every country and forces them to confront the necessity of modern State Building at the same moment like everybody was getting to capitalism by their own speed but then in 1914 that is no longer an option speed has to be maximized. Countries that are behind have to catch up fast. But they do not have the developed the capacities to do that so their social organism is destroyed by contradictions but different contradictions in each country creating different oppositional Frameworks incorporating different elements of the society whose encounter with capitalism is coming from a different perspective in Spain. Specifically you have people who are encountering the they've missed World War. One right Spain did because they were so far behind that they didn't even bother competing and because due to that fact their class war was kept at a certain manageable level which was it was becoming unmanageable in the other countries more developed countries of Europe. Now Russia is of course even less developed than Spain but it is more devoted to a territorial. Empire is crucial to its mode of production in the feudal sense not in the modern Imperial sense and so it's slower in Spain but you already buy the buy the 1940 by the 19 teens who have this Anarchist movement emerge among the most recently dispossessed peasants of the South.

The people who went from having land to not having land anymore and did not trade land for Capital the way that City dwellers and even the priests did after the introduction of capitalism through the inter external invasion of France in 19 in 1808 that kick-starts the whole process because it's war that aligns that that brings a that takes a one pace of change and accelerates it to a standard pace of change in order to meet a moment of conflict. Now Spain avoids World War one but it creates a boom in their economy as a result that raises expectation connects these people even more thoroughly to Modern media to social Technologies so that by the 30s roll around you have a situation where the dispossessed peasants who in other countries have been moved through a process of proletarianization to the point where their enmeshment in a modern State structure is taken not as a threat to their identity and the annihilation of all that is good. It is seen as sort of their natural environment and the Socialist Horizon is a way to use that position to move through to a higher level of that development but for the anarchists of the countryside and and in Barcelona that that modern subjectivity was an imprisonment. It had no positive elements to it and among like in the Catalonia.

For example you had these medium-sized textile concerns that ran the city and ran ran the economy. But because they were able to exert protectionism all through the 19th century they were not forced to come together into conglomerates the way that Freer trading liberal states in the in Europe and the United and also in North America did so. They kept these smaller family firms that were not able to be like wired into a governing like a bureaucratizing um disciplinary met structure like was built in the United States the progressive kind of cage on these newly built Monarch monopolies because they're so so concentrated they could be easily suborned. These Regional little these little dictators these little family mafias running the textile firms in Barcelona refused any deal with the workers and the state couldn't make them make a deal with the workers. The state couldn't make them ameliorate the conditions of the workers. All the state did was send civil guards to kill them and allow the owners to hire fake. Union members fake cynicalists who are essentially just criminals to shoot them in the streets and not have any consequences. So there is no they had not been integrated into anything and and in the countryside the people who became the CNT base in rural Catalonia and Andalusia and Aragon were the dispossessed of the countryside who weren't didn't even have the capacity. Didn't have the spoons basically to move to Barcelona and get a factory job. Instead.

They were idle for months and months and months in the countryside worked working only seasonally for the owners of the latter fundias. The vast Estates there and they were always on the very edge of starvation They they ate little and they lived in flea-ridden barracks. They wore sandals and straw hats. They were totally substantly isolated because in the cities like your professional class they might very well like be of the former they might have. They might be like the child of a of someone who came from the countryside to get a factory job you know They could have some sort of solidarity based on like that family experience with a worker and they could have a political sympathy with a worker and because even in this in the cities workers you know they had a minimum standard of dress. They were afforded by their positions in the countryside.

The Divide between the landless workers the braceros and everybody else anybody with a job was so vast that there was no solidarity like you might be a professional in this Village or a clerk or a paper pusher or even a waiter. But you wear shoes you wear Thai and that puts you at a fundamental distance from these sandals and straw hats of The Bracero so they're totally isolated not being integrated into capitalism with any kind of carrot pure stick so there. By the time the Spanish Civil War crisis emerges they are fundamentally resistant to the imposition of a state that marxists by this point who ex who were entering their engagement their final Conflict with with capitalism at a different point having been often. Factory workers for years if not. Generations often being intellectuals often being bureaucrats and professionals often getting benefits through their encounter with modernity and also confident that the State apparatus could be used for good and there is no reconciling those two perspectives because they are made by different times and places encountering capitalism at a critical moment when they're brought together. By these new social Technologies I got off on a rant. There didn't I um now the what if that might have saved the Republic is not the anarchists getting their.

Western democracies had backed the Republic. They had a real chance to win if France and the UK had supported them. Materially had recognized Franco's Rising as illegitimate and and made solidarity which the French popular front government which was basically the same collection of marxists and Bourgeois liberals that was ruling in that got that got overthrown or attempted overthrown in July of 36 in Spain. They at first made moves to supply Spain with arms but England said no because England's policy this is what undergirds appeasement and which is often forgotten about when discussing appeasement Britain's policy was some sort of rap roachmont with these with the fascist States against the Soviet Union. That's what they want. They wanted Hitler to settle down take yes for an answer and Orient towards a prayer towards conflict with the Soviet Union. But Hitler would say no for would not take no for an answer because you know fascism is this is the death drive it's not going to allow It doesn't have the people in it aren't again encountering capitalism at the same time in place as those fat cats in Whitehall now like guys like Anthony Eden in the foreign Ministry. Like they personally some of them wanted the Republic to win they were rooting for the Republic but they didn't want to upset the apple cart and this is where I'm sorry for the Communist. You know the the the the the cosplay. Communists who like look at the Spanish Civil War and root and imagine they're on one side. They look they look at it and they're like you dumb anarchists. You didn't realize that you needed to. Get your together if we're going to win this thing we have to be coordinated and we have to like accept that this is that these are the the state is the the Implement of this battle that we're having that there is no other zone of of conflict worth having which I think is what was being slowly realized during that period but too late because of the temporal spatial distinctions. But the the Communists were kidding themselves too. They were kidding themselves that there was a basic a basic feeling among the repel of the um.

Bourgeois states that fascism had to be defeated that they saw fascism as the same threat that Communists did and that is not the case. Capital people say liberals always prefer fascists. It's like that's it's if that's true it is simply because Liberals are not at the end scared for themselves under a fascist regime and when I say that I don't mean all liberals I mean liberals where it counts liberals in positions of power. They always believe that will not come from them because they believe that politics at the end of the day is kind of a game and I have my team you have your team. I'm rooting for my guys you're rooting for your guys. But at the end of every day we just get back and we we divide our spoils for the day the profits that we've extracted and the thing is. They're right to think that because fascism does have the same capitalist political economy powering it liberals will see communism though as their annihilation so no long-term deal can be made and yes. Eventually there was a point where the the the the where England was like all right like we told you how much you can have and you're still going. So you are. Now you are as much as we want to orient against the Soviets. You're a greater threat right now to our interests. You are coming for a you are trying to overturn a global economic and political order that we are at the top of you are not trying. I know you're just trying to get your your snoot at the table of the empires. But it's too late. We already divided all this.

You cannot do this flag on the play and they had there was this beautiful popular front moment when you could be a communist and a good Democrat in the United States for example and it was amazing and people wanted it to last forever but slowly but surely that the capitalist part of that Coalition was working behind the back of their allies to secure a post-war world where the defeated quote unquote Nazis were in court and the defeated quote unquote fascists were incorporated into a new front to dominate the former Colonial world and prevent it from socializing its economy and the the the the the Spanish Communists got found. They found out too late when Madrid fell that they were just waiting for it to end and by that point everybody just wanted the war to just wind down because they all accepted war was going to come but they did not want it to happen where they were not anticipating. It and Spain was always somebody else's Baby by that point and they just wanted it to wind down before they found a real like action to orient around and it's because everybody was caught in a Kobayashi Maru. It was an unwinnable War based on the way that the the tiles were flipped you know but to get way back to the the question that somebody asked about you know does that mean that the project was is over again. This is a project I'm describing but we should not complete that conflate that project with the human project with the project of Consciousness coming into awareness and encounter with itself. That project can never be defeated. That project is what lit The Souls of everyone who was pushed in the right direction during those holy years and it is what will start to burn again within all of us and is and yes like Oppenheimer is a good example of this. Oppenheimer thought he was saving the world for the Nazis but he was handing over the world to the Nazis in the form of the capitalist gargoyle class that controlled fascist and democratic governments and which at that time had the Communists along for the ride with.

But the Communists had a faith in their basic humanity and to the general Arc of History that turned out to be misplaced because it was self-motivated and I could argue people get mad. But I could argue that that wrong turn was inevitable. The moment that the Soviet Union became the materialized vessel of the Communist Horizon we think of it as the thing that allowed for possibilities and it did but it also foreclosed other possibilities and since we are now in the backwash. I think we can say without controversy or it shouldn't be that at some point this was lost and that was when what was the guy supposed to do. Though I know that's the thing it's nobody's fault everyone's acting according to what they think is the the terrain that they surround themselves with we move through history and only in in the Stillness. Only in moments of Stillness does like the greater shape illuminate us and allow us to feel it and allows things to emerge to erupt to break through a sort of a glacial determinism. Yeah FDR's body basically shut down because it could no longer handle the contradictions that he was trying to enhold to and embody he was holding him within himself. This entire coalition that was just breaking apart as the conflict was reaching its critical mass okay. We beat the Soviets. We beat the Japanese now what are we going to do about the economies of these countries. How are they going to be organized where is power going to reside. That is the Fatal conflict and he was just standing in bethwart it until his head exploded and with like Lincoln was in the same position and his head also exploded and Kennedy obviously. I I would argue a absolutely pale imitation of those two people and an Evidence of just how like character is leeched out of power over time in capitalism but similarly like a thwart a barrel in terms of democratic governance of a secret Nazi state and all their heads exploded like their their inability to manage the contradictions because remember if they didn't manage the contradictions they wouldn't be dead.

One way or the other FDR's Health would have been better he wouldn't have had a FDR I think I've said this before. But I believe his his blood pressure taken before he went to Warm Springs Arkansas or Georgia where he died was like something like 350 over like 150. It was comically high someone's pointed it out before I said this before but yeah that that's that's just him. A kettle like one way or another the pressure destroying him and with Lincoln and Kennedy the the pressure evinced in this marshaling of hostility to him and this is the important part for both of them. It Reckless Behavior because Abraham Lincoln I would argue going to the Cinema sorry going to the theater Abraham Lincoln going to the theater with one drunk sitting on a stool as the Confederacy was writhing. It's and dying on the battlefield was asking for it JFK refusing to put the bubble top on the wind in our hair at the very moment that I'm threatening to smash that I'm threatening to if you believe in conspiracy stuff the very moment that he's threatening to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces or the very moment. He's planning like the end of the Cold War which I don't believe at all. I think that is fantasy daddy worship. That's like he if he's going to be that important to character. He has to be that great a character and it's like no that is you wanting everything to be a storybook. He can be kind of a dump kind of a himbo who had like basically his heart in the right place who got in cold war.

But he has to if your ego requires it to be the case but even if you don't think that everyone half the country hated Kennedy by that point because of the Civil Rights Act that was in the offing and that he hadn't even passed. Yet. There were there were there were newspapers that had wanted for treason ads posted by militias. The the minute man. Adley Stevenson had been spit on and hit at a hotel in Dallas as you know Oliver Stone by the way has um Donald. Sutherland say all this stuff in his big speech in JFK to just highlight how how endangered JFK was but at no point does anyone say well how the hell didn't. He think to be a little more careful and not just go along be led by his nose and then insist on leaving the bubble top off I can't handle this contradiction.

My head will explode. This is also me narrating my own hypochondria about the idea that I'm also going to have like a stroke and my head's going to cave in and I think if it does happen I don't it could. It's probably neuroses largely but it's probably based on some physiological thing you know but it could be wait years years in the future it could be tomorrow. I don't know but either way I'll think of it in those terms of you. Know. We're all eventually done in by our inability to face the contradictions of Our Lives because we see a resolution of those contradictions is the annihilation of us and we are so very addicted to us all right. Let's get through this quickly ooh Syria our bodies in Syria Syria has participated in the arable Israeli Wars. I think I had this one again too. It says that it adopted a radical stance in the Middle East of supporting International terrorism and then it says despite these unfriendly positions towards the West Syria is a member of the Coalition forces which really does say no hard feelings geographic area 71 498 square miles population 12.6 million language Arabic predominant religion Islam Sunni. Although you know there's a lot of there's some alawites. In there it's caused some problems Capital Damascus government type Republic under a left-wing military regime. Ah remember. They are this the bat the Arab bath Socialist Party head of government good old president. Haifa's al-assad a real player who who kept it all together his whole life but the thing about that kind of personal Union unless you're giving birth to something different and sacrificing yourself in the attempt.

If you hold on to it too long. You create a brittle inheritance that will crumble in the hands of your your predecessor your. Descendants which of course is the process that we are in right now which is why all of our media is about fail children failing to live up to their parents. It's an understanding that that is why we cannot handle the crisis we're in because even if we could use the machine we have to a Positive Purpose. The people who could do it have been completely edited out of power over time by the Persistence of a aristocracy that clothes itself in Merit but which is as decadent and failed as any previous strictly what's the word strictly. Heritage inherited yeah a strictly inherited aristocracy because you get like one maybe two generations of mobility and Merit under liberalism and then it freezes and we they think about oh good men strong men all that it's like that framing is wrong because it it is it just it. It's just it's um explanatory. Power is nil. You're not explaining anything with that cycle. You're just narrating a a a social transformation. What is driving it at every level and it is the establishment the perpetuation and then the collapse of a underlying political economy that is inherently driven by social contradiction and that over time accumulates greater and greater social contradiction. One of the things that makes crisis inevitable though is that crisis appears to a decadent leadership at the very moment that leadership is most important and most potentially helpful. Again. This is within a system. This is a within a leadership class at that very moment.

Those traits that allowed for the establishment of the thing are now detrimental or absent all right Bulgaria oh my God. What do the bulgers have to do with anything the boulders People's Republic of Bulgaria. I guess it hadn't Fallen yet here located on the Black Sea in the Eastern section of the Baltic Balkan Peninsula. Bulgaria is currently in a transitional state of government yeah I bet if they're still calling it The People's Republic. It is of historic significance for being a country of shared influence from Greece Asia the near East and Western Europe after 500 years as part of the Ottoman Empire. Bulgaria achieved Independence in 1908 to joined the United Nations in 1955. For the Operation Desert Storm Bulgaria offered troops that's interesting it's saying they offer troops not that they were accepted. They were like hey you want some troops and we're like we're good. We don't need Bulgarian troops. They're only going to get in the way we got to feed them geographic area. 44 823 square miles population 9 million languages Bulgarian Turkish and Greek dominant religions mainly atheistic or non-religious damn you commies Eastern Orthodoxy. Some Islam and Roman Catholicism capitalist Sophia government type in transition. It's complicated they should really have had it's complicated on here head of government president Andre lukanov. Whenever I think of Bulgaria. I think that there is a Byzantine emperor called basil the Bulger Slayer.

He knew what he liked and it was slaying boulders. We've got an armor and artillery weapon. The M109 dsws Howitzer. This guy looks cool. I love Howitzer big thick Barrel. It's a self-propelled Howitzer designed to add maximum Mobility to the 155 millimeter Hollister Cannon to provide artillery support for armored and mechanized infantry units in the field. An Operation Desert Storm the M109 was part of both the Coalition and Iraqi arsenals. How did that happen again Jesus we keep doing that they keep getting a hold of our weapons. They must be sneaking into Fort Bragg and hot wiring it.

We're glad somebody does or how are you going to pay for a half of your Contra guys and Nicaragua or the or the AUC in Colombia. None of the U.S armed forces tolerates drug use that's a good question have. They relaxed that yet because I got to feel like they're going to have to at least let you smoke weed if they want anybody to join. The Army. Now drugs impair the ability to think and move well don't want that just like in civilian life a soldier's success and survival depend on clear thoughts and careful actions. Good soldiers and good civilians never take chances with illegal drugs don't do it. Legal drugs only yes you live in a society where everything of value is a soporific where all all ways to like self-create and and self-define are commodified and neutralized. So the only Journey you can take is towards the soothing of pain don't do drugs.

The Kuwait system did we do the Kuwait system. We did Kuwait but I don't know if we did the Kuwait strict system. I'll just go there they got appointed prime minister. Council of ministers. Legislative Authority shared by the Emir in a 50-member National Assembly democratically elected legislature is unique among the gulf Nations but the Emir suspended the assembly on July 3rd 1986 oops oh well. Kuwait enjoys a relatively Free Press but freedom is highly restricted for non-kuwaiti Nationals and now type nominal constitutional monarchy. I like that it's like theoretically there is not a constitutional. We have a constitution but if if the vibe isn't right the Emir can just say never mind national holiday. February 25th head of state Emir and Jaber al- Ahmad al-sabah political parties prohibited suffrage native born and naturalized males age 21 and older and the last card of the day Afghanistan. Oh boy oh boy you guys you have no idea what's coming.

[83:24](https://youtu.be/Kl5ddgvszig?t=83m24s)

I mean you have had a lot of stuff but now you're gonna get you just hold on. We got a whole lot more in store. For you. You thought you were getting rid of the Russians well guess what the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to put down revolts against communist rule a government a civil war. That's not really kind of I guess that's a little Civil War followed in which the government and the Soviets controlled the cities while the Guerrilla forces or muja Deen ruled the countryside since the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. Communist and muja Deen factions continue to fight. The Guerrilla Force sent 500. Mujadin fighters to help in Operation Desert Storm what I didn't know that what were they doing. I guess you know it's like hey pay it forward. You know you helped us kick out the Russians. We'll help you kick out the Saudis. Wait what's this oh no what oh.

We're being blown up and innovated for 20 years and then we'll leave and then America will leave having built nothing and having only brought death. It's astounding geographical area. 250 000 square miles population 15.9 million languages push to Darian Persian predominant religion. Islam good old Sunni Islam. Although there are very persecuted Shia minority. Honestly could see a long-term war with Iran over that and other issues. Capital and Kabul government type Communist Regime supported by Soviet forces so this is not. It has not yet happened yet they have not yet kicked out the Russians head of government president M ammad najibullah.

So there you go tune in next week for tune in to blowback season four. If you want to know more about what happens what happened to Afghanistan until 91 and then what happens. Afterwards we all we love our brave. Muja Deen Fighters don't we folks we love them. I mean yes. The Communist Regime was the best government Afghanistan ever had that's for sure but the Soviet invasion's still a mistake. They really themselves. There yeah. The Afghanistan Invasion came at a point for the Soviet Union when they needed to like look inward and then instead they decided to go into Afghanistan and then they ended up having to do the looking inward way later and on worse footing and with a much shakier economy and and the whole thing collapsed that's why if you if it feels like you should be going to war. You need to stop and ask yourself what is pushing this like what below the causes belly what below the strategy what in the our political economy is pushing. Us in this direction and the answer is there's a crisis somewhere within our social body that is not being addressed and then we're like well. We'll go to war instead of dealing with it as a last as the last effort like somebody said to me when I was sort of criticizing Putin for invading Ukraine. He said well if you're if you're saying that Putin thought like in the long run. That's the end of Russia if we don't invade that didn't he have to and I'll say well.

No he could have tried to do communism and you can laugh at that and say oh that's stupid. But it's like. I'm sorry like the form of the states that we currently have is not sacred. The polities that we have now are not sacred instruments. They are they're wrecks they are shells but hey who knows. Maybe this time it worked maybe. Maybe this invasion is going to have gonna knock over the American Leviathan. We'll see and of course the the dream. A lot of Western leftists have is that what I'm describing is actually what's happening in Russia or in China right now like China got to a crisis point or recognized crisis signs and is internally moving away from them. Using the structures of the party state that they were bequeathed from this 20th century struggle that may not be communist in any respect but which still allowed themselves to be animated by like collaborative human will in a way that the other governments of the world just can't do anymore if they ever could. And that is a whether that's true or not is a question that I from my distance can't answer and I don't think anybody else who was really invested in one or the other answer being true. Can a that are honestly we'll see what happens. It's not a big deal. We'll all meet each other in the fields Place Beyond right and wrong and I'll meet you there. Peace.
