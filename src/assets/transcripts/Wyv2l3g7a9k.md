Foreign people are strange when you're a stranger faces seem ugly when you're alone. Women seem wicked when you're unwanted. The streets are uneven when you're down when you're strange faces come out of the rain when you're strange. No one remembers your name boop when you're strange when you're strange when you're strange all right. Now people strange when you're a stranger faces seem ugly when you're alone. Women seem wicked when you're unwanted. Streets are uneven when you're down on your strength faces come out of the rain when you strain. No one remembers your name when you're strange when you're strange when you're strange equal to strain. You know when you're stranger faces seem ugly when you're alone. Women seem wicked when you're unwanted. The streets are uneven when you're down that is the one door song. I like and I think that the rule should be everybody gets one door song that they can enjoy unironically and that for me is the one all right folks we're almost done with.

Grab grows dawn of everything here. We're getting there chugging along like little little trains and we've finally gotten to the point where they have shown their hand their their specific like ideological matrix that they are funneling all of their information through and that they're using to seek information to prove their points and it is very relief. Like this chapter was was very cathartic for me. Because reading this book. So far it has felt at the entire time. I'm reading it. I'm engaged by it. The prose is very conversational and clear the examples that they bring up are fascinating. It's a bunch of stuff. I've never heard of that really has changed how I understand you know civilization like what that even means and how it develops so I absolutely recommend the book to anybody who wants to kind of crack out of any set understanding of their world of their world. But the whole time I'm reading it. There. I just feel like. I feel like. I'm sitting on my keys or like my wallet is too thick or something. There's just something poking against me as I'm reading it something that bothers me a little bit and it peaks back.

It peaks out in corners and bits but at no point do they really stop and luxuriated en enough to really kind of see the whole thing for the whole ideological project beyond just knowing like they're trying to you know detach us from established narratives of how human civilization begins. But here we get because so far we've gotten a lot of benefits from their approach. A lot of new interpretations of interesting recent data in archaeology and anthropology filtered through this very lively voice and now though we see the limits of their approach. We see where they hit a wall and it is unsurprisingly related to their idealism and their visceral allergy to material considerations when they are talking about you know the history of humanity. They fundamentally reject the idea that there is anything binding people to their relationship to their environment because to them. The implications of that are that there is not full human autonomy which as you know the idealized synthesized liberal subject that anarchists are they rejected and cannot accept it and it giveth it a taketh. It gives you this romantic understanding of your own capacity and the capacity of your fellow humans that I think is useful But it blinds you to the reality in front of your face because it just does not fit with the romantic notions that you sort of I guess have to adhere to in order to truly feel like you can be a autonomous free being which you have a visceral a non-rational addiction you could even say to fixation on and that is really the true legacy of of 

The enlightenment and liberalism in general is that it primacies the self in this way and and they analyze the world through this and of course. The ironic thing is that the thesis of this chapter you know is that our modern understandings of freedom liberty individual autonomy that we cherish and have cherished since the since the dawn of the enlightenment in europe. Anyway. were actually forged in north america by people who were responding to regimes of domination and hierarchy that had emerged and had fallen and wanted to model something different and in so doing came to many of the same conclusions that later animated the enlightenment and in fact communicated those ideas to figures in the enlightenment and of course what they're trying to do with this is say hey look look what they did. They gave us these neat ideas. They gave us these great ideas that helped us animate understandings of human liberty and yet when those ideas hit europe what were. They put what would they put to the use of were they put to the use of creating human liberty. No they were used as justifications for the establishment of the most thoroughgoing and hegemonic regime of domination and property.

 hierarchy ever created in humanity is what they did with it. They used it to create the backbone of the capitalist ideological superstructure because the people who came in contact with these ideas were people who were fully enmeshed into regimes of power control and alienation from their environment that meant that they could not apply them the same way that the native americans applied them in the material conditions of north america. They had to apply them to the conditions of europe which meant what ended up happening no matter how much freedom and liberty people were trying to express in the face of this new. this newly revolting system of orders that they had recognized they could pressure push against it. But what ended up being at every step created and solidified through their actions is merely the furthering of capitalism which is the refinement and perfection of the regimes of domination that begin in the early grain states of eurasia that then dominate the world so how can you wonder how can. They not see this and we'll get to why they can't because they cannot take materialism seriously and as such they cannot really draw any meaningful conclusions from their very well presented and you know persuasive vision of human capacity in the abstract because there is no such thing there is no real thing as human capacity and abstract. It can only be situated in a material context so they start this chapter saying okay so why do we get here how did this happen if the state was never a thing if state structures existed in different formats everywhere then how the hell do we get this system where state domination emerges and they go as they as anarchists love to go to our boy.

James c scott our boy who loves to see like a state our boy who loves to perfect the art of not being governed a boy who hates carbohydrates. He hates grains and he and scott's thesis which has been backed up by apparently. I've been reading about. This has been backed up by like other harder sciences is that it's not really agriculture that superpowers state formation. It is specifically cereal agriculture grains because grains can be easily sorted stored transported and taxed in a way. Other agricultural products can't and so it's this grain thing this. This grain agricultural structure that is used by you know whatever mutant form of power emerges somewhere to assert itself and they ask okay so that happened in eurasia right. The grain grain states over they got bigger. They collapsed they got bigger they collapsed. They merged they got bigger. They collapsed. They bashed against each other and created 

They they got to the point where they had dominated and and redefined along propertarian lines every area within the entirety of eurasia and into north. Africa now was this inevitable and our The traditional argument of of arteleological understanding of civilization is yes as soon as you get those states it's inevitable and the grab growth thesis of course is no. It's not inevitable and in order to make their case. This is where they show their hand and where you can just like feel the bottom drop out of the whole project. They say well you can't really say what could have happened.

You can't really make your case that there was an alternative by just like imagining different things happening in the history of this continent-wide expanse that becomes dominated by agricultural states because only one thing ever happens right at a time and you cannot you can't you can't you. Counter. Factuals are fun and useful but you can't really know anything to the extent that you are trying to prove here by resorting to them you need an experiment. You you need a comparison sorry. Not an experiment you need a comparison and you can compare over time and over distance but you can't compare.

 . Once those formations occur you can no longer do that in eurasia because it's all one thing so what grad grow proposed to do is to compare as like a natural experiment in comparison the developments in eurasia to nor the new world specifically north america not central and south america which as we saw create very similar structures of imperial domination and serial agriculture as you see in eurasia so they they're not a good. example either north america and the very fact that they can propose this and mean say that this is a meaningful comparison and that you're going to learn something about any meaningful. You're going to be able to create any meaningful insights as inactionable insights into human civilization or like the capacity for human self-organization or whatever by comparing this is absurd because they have different materials constraints and and realities.

They literally are different environments with different materials within them one of them being of course plants and stuff. I mean you have maize in in the new world but like things like rice and grain and you don't have that you don't have those the the ones that became the the most fruitful of the early cereal cultivars. You don't have those you know what else you don't have draft animals of any size. You know you don't have specifically in the areas that he's talking about like woodland north america and the great plains you really don't have minerals. You don't have tin or copper you know the stuff that went into creating the bronze age. There are there's some copper in north america but it's all in the southwest and it's like oh so what you know Copper tin moved all over the place in in eurasia yeah.

Once again they had horses for example so all your you know this chapter can make a perfectly legible and persuasive pitch that in these specific ecological conditions you can create a system where people can maintain that social control over their their culture and over the like political economy they create. They do not have to create alienated institutions and they could do that indefinitely because they can come to the same conclusions about values and individual rights that animate a modern. You know the modern liberal identity which we can't escape. I was like okay fine congratulations so what there is no isolating humanity. We are all in one goddamn global system and the fact that north american native native north. Americans are able to craft these intricate webs of like clan. I clan hospitality and also maintain structures of democratic accountability that that prevents alienation into institutions. They're only able to do that because they have the luxury of abundant of access to abundant super abundant resources relative to their population because one thing about the area he's going to talk about they're going to talk about this chapter. Northern north america is that relative to other parts of the globe. At this time. It is sparsely populated of course why that is how that relates to these questions grab go don't even get into. They just are like oh yeah sparsely populated. They can move around yeah. You can't do that everywhere and people are everywhere. As soon as these structures emerge that they're talking about they get rid of the space to allow this sort of existence to persist you need a space you need a place that you can have a relationship to your environment and to each other that is marked by inefficiency and so all you can create as like.

I said I'm persuaded by their vision of early human civilization across the entire globe as this shifting mosaic as people move in and out of relationships with each other and move throughout and move through space geographically while they're doing so to facilitate it. Finding homeostasis points getting getting into a balance that then becomes unbalanced that is then overthrown a natural relationship but then the cancer tumors start popping up in the The pancreas that is eurasia and how they come into being is that regimes of domination which as they say in this chapter lay latent in every social formation and among people everywhere and that led to people in north america trying to build the same sort of dominant state that we're talking about elsewhere but failing to do so failing to sustain it and extend it why because they did not have access to the material resources that would have allowed them to reify it into continued domination. It resided only in its persuasive capacity which exhausted over time as it fails to deliver on its promises to people. Once this space has been touched what happens all of these structures that they they that they worshippedly describe and and which when you're reading them get you misty-eyed imagining being able to live that way in relationship to one another like where religion is not some. you know reified structure that is tied to domination and therefore makes every attempt to express like the real sense of connection.

That religion is a byproduct of being corrupted and turned on in itself and used to dominate you instead. Like there's a great part of here where they describe how there's this essentially a psychotherapeutic culture in native american tribes where they would bring their dreams to the square and they would all decide what they meant and then they would try to get the person the thing that they were dreaming of which is basically a communal analytic framework. That is also religious all the things that have been splintered into less meaningful boxes like taking psychology and removing it from religion and removing it from science. It has given them it has given us the ability to more efficiently study them.

That's where the efficiency thing comes in again and use them and apply them to the project of maintaining domination. But they are more powerful when united but they can only stay united when the social order is united when no one is being serially alienated. It is that serial alienation that fractures the psyche and makes that sort of collective consciousness impossible to negotiate but yes imagine a world like that wonderful and yeah. I believe they existed all over the world not just in this area but they persisted only here till contact because it was the only environment on the varied surface of the globe that could sustain it that long. But once it was confronted with the those ruthlessly efficient structures of domination it rinsed them.

They were gone swept off of his the face of the earth and I honestly don't know how anyone can see this happen and then think well. This means that the way that we fix this is we all just pretend that we're living with these values and live through these values which this chapter shows you how like a real tradition of experienced and validated and religiously imbued social harmony. Like that. This chapter is a big chunk where it argues that that that the social structures of the northeast indians in like the what would be the medieval and early modern period in europe. That same time they were literally building an enchanted version of the western liberal tradition because it was connected to a a social order that was not alienated and then it encountered the regimes of domination. The society of orders that it was hostile to freedom that had been embodied that was embodied in you know early modern europe as a transition from feudalism to capitalism and they encountered these ideas and I don't understand how grab grow who says we're stuck in this monstrous cage.

This global capitalism that is destroying our souls and our lives and our planet and it's going to end it unless we stop it all of that all of the the big victories that led to that happened after that encounter. He wants. They want to take credit for this transmission of values that they all hold even though they were put realistically to the purpose of bringing about the destruction of humanity. Now of course that doesn't mean that they aren't also the values that we all must uphold abstractly because yes as soon as you become a a liberal subject.

You have to go to set about the life goal of not ignoring and denying the the idea of individual rights and freedoms and autonomies that undergird this tradition but to synthesize it with the reality of living in a society of living socially in not abstract world where the human can do anything but in your concrete specific conditions where your actions are constrained materially and that is what the anarchists want to tell you is that they are not. They want you to tell you that there is no material constraint their entire premise of this book is imagining human history without material constraints and trying to come to useful actionable politically. valent conclusions and you can't do that we have to create the world that they're kind of glinting at here where post-modern mass subjects such as ourselves or I guess d-massed atomized subjects. Technologized subjects such as ourselves can live with cheap to jowl 8 billion on the planet the way that these people did and that is the ex the goal but that goal will not be and cannot be achieved by people just pretending like that that's where we what we live with. It's gonna happen by grabbing the material machinery of exploitation and with it surplus extraction which is necessary for the title type of life. We're talking about and pushing it towards those towards social ends and of course. You can then go back and say well how do you do that unless people believe something believe in something yes once again correct but then how do they motivate that belief into action and if if you go by the anarchist way you have an allergy to the necessary structures of constraint of action institutions that can push these machines and tell them what to do. If you do not get in there and control them. Your action will be liquidated from outside by them the way that these social structures these beautiful.

Organisms that existed in north america were by a bunch of vd-riddled freaks from england all right so that's my main issue with grab grow as it is exemplified in this chapter but let's get into the specifics of stuff that they talk about so. They first pitched. The idea that in the I guess around the same time the roman empire was collapsing in europe. In north america. There was this very fascinating. This is part of the book that's really interesting is is the way they describe this history. I had no no idea about this zone of cultural exchange and ritual enactment in ohio. They're called like hopewell exchange sites and they're the remnants of these periodically seasonally occupied areas where people from vast distances would come together for like a week and essentially have a big old music festival. It was woodstock for for the pre-columbian north america and in it there would be rich games. Rituals. Information would be exchanged and during this time their thesis here greg ross thesis is a diplomatic language of clan was devised and transmitted such that its collapse is not so much necessarily because it was no longer sustainable. as it had used served its purpose. It had created a transmission belt of of of cultural ideas that allowed for hu people to move huge distances and know that anywhere they got. They went even if they didn't speak the language of the people there that there would be somebody who is who they knew from camp basically who would keep take them in and that this this system is a way to diplomatically wrangle the reality of people living in isolation from each other in groups that then come into contact instead of fighting each other. Every time they met and and then creating regimes around winning those battles which is what happens in eurasia. They can manage relationships largely peacefully because they have this shared vocabulary again true once again allowed by the conditions of north america and so one of the things that this would have been transmitted and accumulated.

During these ritual festivals would be the esoteric language of control like we talked about last week. You've got two groups of people who end up vying for power and eventually like coming creating some sort of symbiotic relationship of dominance and submission within each other. the warrior elite and the nerds the jocks and the nerds. The the warrior fight the fighters the sportsmen and the people who watch the skies all the time and make up stories about them and and create um esoteric knowledge that by access cannot be transmitted to everybody because it's not. It's understandable by everybody because everybody does not have the same brain just like everybody doesn't have the same body and then they they took this information back and at some point the same thing is going to happen in north america as happened. Everywhere else which is this flow gets interrupted by some group somewhere of those esoteric knowledge havers getting together and deciding that for the good of the group they were going to have to create a more efficient structure that is a structure of domination and extraction and they created a vocabulary around it that convinced people to accede to it but of course neither one of the groups can do it alone. It's always some relationship and the relationship that they sketch out in here is that around 600 a.d. Some people who would encounter who's who came from people who had gone through this cultural exchange process invent this sport called chunky where a duality is a trap.

This is so stupid it's meaningless to say that it is the it is the lenses you ha observe reality through of course. It's not real but the non-reality of it can only be observed in grace trying to escape. Duality is literally what we're all trying to do with every transcendent application of body and mind that we can think of. But we still are stuck in our quotidian with binaries and duality and then looking at them and and reconciling them provides the literal motive force for our minds and bodies. It's the engine of existence so this game of chunky which apparently involved a big rolling stone and people throwing poles at it and trying to get close to it like kind of like like mobile mobile cornhole. If anyone has played cornhole get out. It's like you can you can't you can only speak through it. You can get out but it's going to be the last thing you do from the perspective of anybody else because private language as wicked sign tells us is impossible and you need a private language to communicate nonduality to actually communicate as opposed to use words to get an idea that has no that has lost so much potency in the latent transmission into symbols so pretty. Soon after this chunky game is invented and people start playing it and investing because remember their needs are mostly met because of the super abundance of resources. They can go where the food is and it's always there and they can spend two or three hours a day doing stuff that is basically play basically like what kids do or like what hobbyists do. It has none of the alienating psychic damage of labor. Under direction they could can't play a game all afternoon and then they have to care about it. They have to invest it with meaning and that's where the nerds come in and pretty. Soon you have created here in the mississippi river valley in what is now southern illinois. One of the most cursed places on earth. So this makes sense that this was like literally a cursed land from the pre-columbian era.

 this new settled urban social order emerges around packed earth pyramids with with walls and with palaces all around a jock. Aristocracy made up of people who over years prove themselves at being really good at chunky. Because somebody's really good at chunky. They which as a game that apparently a lot of things were bet on people would bet like all their other even their families in chunky and of course. That was also a equalizing ritual at first because yeah nobody wants too much surplus. You gotta originally destroy it and it all gets because the game is basically random right who you bet on so over time. It's all going to slew us back. It's not going to accumulate. Except talent is not random somebody's good at chunky and they succeed they're probably going to be able to reproduce a lot and they're going to create a line of people who over time are better at chunky than everybody else and all are directly descended in relationship to one another have a deeper and separate relationship to each other than they do to the group but of course being really good at. Chunky doesn't give you a lot of time to sit around and stare at the stars and smoke so much tobacco that you pass out and come to understandings of the world that you can communicate symbolically linguistically to others in a way that is convincing because at the end of the day what grab grow point out. Very adeptly is the only real authority absent coercion is persuasiveness and you get persuasive by spending a lot of time in your head. There's a charisma that comes with being a chad but it has to be married to a vocabulary that has generally created by other people the nerds and they got together and created this structure that persisted for not that long.

I think a couple hundred years they say and it spreads out and you see like a a surveillance culture. Like the people at the top of this pyramid are literally doing the like the foucault bentham thing where they are literally doing physical surveillance and therefore embodying like a religious transcendent um omnipotence that the state would then embody but it collapsed even though it set out feelers they created like it created an entire standardized iconography around certain gods. Specifically the bird man that is found all through regions that are connected mostly by water to that mississippi valley and that spread it was like a cultural diffusion and like beca and if it had accumulated it probably would have been turned into the sort of like assertive state structure administrative state structure that you see emerge in mesopotamia. What don't they have the same resources that they had in mesopotamia that's the answer to the riddle that this whole book is trying to solve material conditions were different. They can't say that because it makes them it makes their liberal hearts flutter but we have to return to the earth. At some point we have to give up some of our fantasies of the self and that's the problem with anarchism is that it separates the self. It isolates the self conceptually and the self cannot be and never is no matter what fantasies we tell ourselves isolate it. We can pretend it is and we can live as though it is and we will destroy ourselves for that delusion. But we are not ever separate.

If if the same combination of animal power and mineral power desert power that could have created a combination of technological structures that could have extended the power of cahokia which is where this is this this site. Then it would have done so because it couldn't over time. Its persuasive power collapsed and it collapsed because it had nothing but persuasion all those other pow. Those other empires got persuasion and what is persuasion technology. I'm sorry. They were only able to keep at the level of persuasion. The empire the grain the grain states of eurasia what was the difference they were able to create regimes of coercion to go with persuasion and what is coercion. It is technology which is the human alienation and manipulation of the material surroundings turning the rest of the stuff that isn't people into stuff that is commanded by the minds of people. That's what it is. That's the third leg of the stool. That's what takes the the the ideological fantasies cooked up by the rituals of the warriors commemorated by the nerds of of the esoteric knowledge. It's what keeps. It's what allows. It's what allows for the maximum exploitation of some and then the redistribution to others that is the important thing. It widens the base by using technology to take from others at the point of a spear and then redistribute to those at the center and buy them off and whether or not you bet that's that technol technological structure together to create that system of coercion to go with persuasion because you're coercing some and you're persuading others and of course you're also doing it to the other. The person being directly coerced is also being persuaded in some degree and the person who is being persuaded is also in some degree being coerced. It's just a difference of which one they're aware of which one they are consciously processing.

The other one is then sublimated and turned into the conflicts of the subconscious that then are expressed through our pathologies. So the rest of the chapter. I'm not going to go into it too much because the details don't really matter is a very persuasive very honestly moving description of what happened after cahokia and another um. Little mini. King's kingdom that emerges in georgia later called etowan which they kind of They imagine was the product of people who had had experience with the cahokian culture or with its collapse excuse me collapse also rising and falling this self-conscious political culture in the plains and in the northeast and southeast where people who had had encounters with the state created complex rituals and I won't get like I said I won't get into it read the book. The actual details of this are fascinating complex rituals of myth-making of of um imbuing like all decisions with like full buy-in from the community along all gender lines and across clans and all that now of course warfare between like structures of of symbols still happens people who you you because of the symbols that you need to communicate interiorly render you illegible and them illegible to you exterior externally and there was like warfare but it was low level and it did not lead to the state formation that happened in eurasia because the material conditions didn't allow it and in doing this they create before they are anticipating by hundreds of years. It's around the same time which is interesting but it's hundreds of years later. There are hundreds of years earlier the exact same culture of questioning and of individual liberty that you saw in the enlightenment europe and the funniest example. They say is that the use of tobacco and coffee goes from being something that small groups of elite in the cahoca era would imbibe heroic amounts of and go into trances.

After consuming to something that was largely accessed by everybody and people would instead of having some guy behind a palisade take do take up all of the tobacco and then come out with an understanding of the world. You would get together have a little bit of tobacco and coffee and focus your minds and come to a conclusion collectively about what was going on the same time or I'm sorry. A few hundred years earlier before the european salons of the enlightenment would be filled with people smoking and drinking caffeine and coming to these and having these same democratic. conversations and coming to similar conclusions about like what it is to be free and human. But they in north. America are doing it where it is fully connected to the world. It is inextricably linked to the material realm. It cannot be divorced from a specific geographic area whereas in europe these ideas are free-floating the people having these ideas have been severed detached from their material environments. For millennia. They have lived in a regime of property defining power for thousands of years. So their ideas of these are are even though they use the same words.

They describe a different reality. A different universe one where the self is embedded and one where the self is segregated and separated and what the left tradition within modern modernism is is the attempt to gain control for some self-conscious selection of people within the greater class structure of the technologies of coercion and control and direct them towards the restitution of a expanded self the reawakening and if it expand itself in a context of technological intermediation with the world around you and marxism is that strain of the left that recognizes that to do that you have to accept and embrace the material. constraints of your historical spatial relationship which is deep into capitalism after it has ripped up all of the roots where this kind of the kind of life that grab row described is impossible because what facilitates it in is and understood connection between one's own self-interest unknown conception of the world and the environment that you live along and I'm not saying you think that you're like a tree or something. I'm just saying that you could not existentially ontologically you could not sever your best interest from a greater conception of best interest that can strain your actions so you can get petty tyrants rising and falling people who basically go insane from the burden of esoteric knowledge or the traumas of warfare. If they're a jock and decide that they have to control and dominate in order to maintain sanity and material. Conditions can push them one way or the other but they can never gain and hold.

This is the important part they can never hold power because most people don't have that trauma most people will isolate and remove them from power ritually by having a real participatory political model. So this the second half of this chapter shows you like oh. I get it. This is how we could be. This is what we could have yes but to have it we would have to re-enchant the world. Literally we would have to have the average person not everybody but the average person who participates in civic life walking around with a world where they do not end at their consciousness at their at the ends of their fingertips and that has to be made and it has to be reproduced. People have to believe that and then they have to have kids who believe that and that cannot come from the incredibly inefficient process of convincing people and persuading people alone. It has to marry persuasion and yes some coercion and that is the anarchist objection. We can't have any conversion coercion but it is the combination of persuasion and coercion that literally conquered the globe that made it so that the subjectivities that built these societies no longer exist and so that the average person not the average anarchist which is a fraction of the population.

The average person cannot imagine living in such conditions of freedom no matter what they say they value because they don't trust each other enough and they cannot imagine sacrificing their own degree of personal pleasure that they have grown addicted to to substitute for that sense of connection that we are robbed every moment of our lives robbed of every moment of our lives. I should say the real the real just heuristic failure of this book is that grab girl decide that they want to imagine and describe so human social orders as being determined solely by humans. Like that is their big pitch. People make these decisions but no they don't people make these decisions in a material context that constrains them because at the end of the day necessity trumps everything the reason that these models persist for so long in north america woodland north. America low birth rate north. America is because of the super abundance of resources because necessity does not pinch the same way it does in say. Mesopotamia say it does in like heavily heavily populated yellow river valley of china. You cannot really understand humans in isolation from their environment and this entire book is about doing that it's about pulling the humans out of their structures. The political social historical fixed relationships that may gave them consciousness and defined consciousness for them. Pulling them all out of those and imagining a universal one and yes there is a universal like sensory apparatus and reasoning capacity.

I would agree with that yes. I understand why that is considered sort of bold and revolutionary considering yeah. Like western white supremacist thought says the opposite it says. No everyone is not equally capacious in reasoning like that's the whole premise of imperialism that's what undergirds our social order to this day. Now that we've killed god okay yes god's dead. There's no spiritual reason to do anything there's no right or wrong. But there is my pleasure and my thriving and the thriving of my line and the people I like and the things. I recognize symbolically why should mine thrive and then others not well because you are more capable of manipulating the symbols and keeping the system going that's it. That's why the west has to rule because there is insufficient equality of of abstracted reasoning condition understanding and that is then turned into a moral ranking and grab girl point out here and absolutely that is their best contribution why this book. I still absolutely recommend it to be read because they they really do put a snake nail in the coffin of of any like you know hardcore realist ideas that that conflate like conditions of you know thriving socially under under modernity and any any lying like intellectual capacity and therefore any like moral distinction you can't there isn't and they.

They do that job well but what that doesn't do is. It doesn't tell you anything about the inevitability under in the shifting and swirling conditions of life on the whole planet. Not just in woodland north america. The emergence of these regimes of domination and I don't think that they I think that's a swing and a miss because they just they remove the material consideration. They remove the material constraint as a as a factor in their calculations as soon as you add it. The the the claims they make just get deflated as soon as you add it the the the phenomenon of north american indian like liberty. loses its loses any ability to persuade you that we can just step out of this because it got as all alternatives to surplus domination as all alternatives to property was destroyed and that leaves us with the grubby work of conquering institutions and putting them to work including coercive work and that lends you towards a certain politics and beyond that you have to make your own decisions.

How can I make that happen again can't be can't be. A prescribed has to be experienced so yeah. All humans are are are have the same capacities socially individually and and socially but the closer you are to capitalism once it emerges from like this churn. The better you're gonna get at becoming adept at its symbols at its language and of course. Like the scary thing is that and this is what drives some people like crazy and turns them into you know accelerationists for the the singularity is that they they see how totalizing this process is which goes to show that like it is of over time the material consideration which is to say the technological consideration crowds out everything else and the stuff that used to be vital in determining human actions is now tertiary because all the real decisions are being made abstractly and algorithmically and carried out by technology that does all the work that used to had to be due by he had to be done by humans and that means that those technological regimes have to be taken over but they can't be taken over from within because the last people to be alienated are going to be the ones in the center which means that if you take this seriously and you say oh nothing from within is going to change this which means revolution is impossible as in a revolution from within a social order is impossible well then I am since I'm in the middle.

I am just going to watch over the next decades as the re as the technological regime that exists in part to keep me relatively comfortable and keep me protected so that I don't and that other people like me don't actually like change the algorithm because obviously I couldn't but enough people in america could probably do something about that algorithm. But again it would have to be a lot of them and they would have to be willing to act in a revolutionary way and that only happens if you are fully alienated from the state and that alienation it adheres in in spatial alienation adheres in places that are spatially removed from the actual nodes of power spatially or you know culturally because you got plenty of people who are fully alienated in in all of our big cities right by wall street. But they are socially disempowered by those same regimes of technology and if you take that really seriously that means all right so things are going to get worse over time at the margins. The technology that exists now autonomously of human agency is gonna keep on cutting off bits that are like cutting off limbs securing borders. Cauterizing wounds strategically retreating into archipelagoes of power. I've talked about this before and you're gonna be on the inside if you maintain a a leftist if you maintain a liberal understanding of humanity which says yes I am the center of the universe.

I am the only thing that's real but everybody else is just as real as me. If you keep that in mind which is the thing that like fires liberalism an attempt to like accepting capitalism is inevitable direct it towards a social aim. It can't be done. It's a failure it has failed. It will only fail but it is incredibly powerful at wielding political power because you're just going to watch as worse and worse. Stuff is done on your behalf and how are you going to be able to enjoy the freedom and comfort that you have and that contradiction is really what's driving people. I think insane because if you're too comfortable you don't because the only real way to feel free from this is going to be to be in legal alienation from the state un oh no longer under its protection because if we're creating a situation where it's it's it's the it's the homo saucers and it's the full citizens which I think is inevitable as long as you obey. The law pay for things to keep a roof over your head participate in the market economy. As a net positive. You are fundamentally under this. you are constrained any action you do will be meaningless. I'm gonna do politics well you're gonna decide what politics is in a way that avoids the risk of you being dispossessed because you're scared of it because you don't feel that connection you feel at the end of the day that you really are the only thing in the universe which is what liberalism propagates and this is what's so funny about these trad. Fulfilling it they're fulfilling liberalism. They're saying if I'm the only thing in the universe. If I'm the only thing that's real well and that means the most important thing is to keep me comfortable to keep me living to keep the universe going and comfortably and happily because the universe is my state of being and that means watching through the glass as the world is destroyed on my behalf and thinking this is good.

They had it coming so you you're gonna be like. They are coming because they're degenerate they're coming because they're don't go to mass they they could be coming because they're low iq and therefore in a dog-eat-dog world don't deserve to live whatever you tell yourself. It'll end being the same thing and of course. The comedy is that the libs the people who think they're embodying liberalism. They're going to end up in the same boat they're going to end up embracing the same ontology only they're going to look through the screen at the misery and they're going to pick out the white supremacists and and and the the misogynists. The people with politically bad opinions make them bad people of course. Everybody else is going through the buzzsaw too including many of the people that they think deserve the the umbrella protection of humanity of human rights but sadly they cannot get that because of those others and so they're righteous they get to participate in the spectacle of violence while rooting for the state for the monster for the algorithm and that's like. I think that's the entire neo-reactionary project. That's the entire like dark enlightenment.

That's that's the whole new right thing is to identify with the machine is it's like that is the singularity that they dream of and it's and it's also the religious ecstasy that the fake. Traditional catholics are also imagining. Oh Jesus is actually a medieval epic teutonic knight congratulations you are literally just a You are just as sadistic and vile as as any a perpetrator of religious. fraud any atheist communist commissar. It's satan worship satan in the form of the algorithm in the form of the idea of self that has been generated electronically and then sold to you and that is very like the reality of that is. With people. It means I'm either at some point going to be very much less comfortable than I am right now and and much less enact able to access the the treats and goodies that soothe my my modern soul and my alienation and that salve all of the gaping wounds. That modernity has left that I know are there and I spend all day. fetishizing about from the comfortable safe nourished pod that I live in and po. I could post it out or I'm gonna stay comfortable while becoming yes essentially a willing spectator to a gladiatorial combat. That is how I will absorb the I will that that's what I will be viewing it. As what it really will be is planetary destruction planetary just planetary destruction planetary destruction and genocide ecocide.

Because it's not even going to be really racially we will observe it through a prism of race and ident and identity and and virtue and and evil and politics. But it will be carried out relatively even-handedly if you don't have money. If you don't have utility you will be. Omnicide bottom first as we direct resources to maintain this supply chain that at this point just feeds the network that just feeds the the real nervous system of the earth which is the its um internet infrastructure and of course caught with that dilemma people move towards religion and of course they do. But the thing is if your religion is as intellectualized as the rest of your life. If you come to the conclusion that you need to have a religion now in order to square the circle.

It's just going to be an extension of your ego which is what it is for all these neo-trad reactionaries. It's like oh yeah no god's real and he wants what I want which is to relieve the anxiety of being a first world subject through a ritual of um violent spectacle that I get to observe which is what I've done. My whole life is I've observed through this prism. This violent spectacle of world politics and of the annihilation at the at the margins of life. Both human and animal but of course and it did far enough removed that I can intellectualize it which we all have done. But it's getting closer the degree to which I can really filter this is becoming strained. I know I'll just add another layer of abstraction to this and then get pla okay. I I i have to I go to church and it's giving me permission to root for the demise of the earth because god coincidentally just wants what I want yeah.

He has all these critiques of capitalism but wouldn't you know it. We got to get literally the liberals first okay. You got rid of the liberals you mean the ideological category that is just a way that people work the worry beads of like first world. Consciousness that at the end of the day is totally hostage to the machine is still operating the thing that did this that turned all of those dowdy yeoman that you worship into bug people. How did that happen how did they let that happen it wasn't the jews. It was the machine you call it the jews because that is a human face on it.

Because it is unexaminable. It is a reality that cannot be confronted. Anything that gets personalized and narrativized is the abstraction of that and the ex and the sublimation of that that cannot be confronted. So yeah you've just deepened the the meta you've just deepened the metaphorical language. But you still haven't felt anything you're still dead inside because you reasoned yourself to this because you're not moving towards something that is not speakable. You're not moving towards I hate to use the word because now I sound like just a hippie. But this is what happens when you really get to the point where formal communicable ideas hit the real boundary of like the ineffable reality of human experience love because that won't let you do that it won't let you abstract out any and it won't let you keep an idea of religion. That is that abstracted and is that instrumental to your narrowest ego desires. But the good news is the good. News always is is that the capacity to have an experience that changes one's relationship to their narrativized understanding of the universe that they carry with them is infinite.

It happens all the time the same and with the same sort of jostling process that that re that creates and then re-creates and generates over time um our conceptual matrix. Because what makes culture is experience. It is an experience something happens to you you feel away and that feeling is carried around you in memory and in the body and then transmitted and turned into a social memory symbolically and it's those symbols that get people to act a certain way over and over and over and over again. But it also creates but because it happens over and over and over again. What we call trauma emerges over time within a person within a culture unless it's able to ritually renegotiate its relationship and break up those trauma patterns which is what for example the what the post kahoa society that graduate talk about did is. They had the trauma of the experience of the cahogan culture and then they broke up its remnants ritually by not allowing the accumulation of social structures that are crew power in one direction breaking it up that feedback loop that keeps you stable but in the right material conditions.

The technology prevents the feedback loop from being converted. It blocks it and that is because of stress and trauma accumulating in a social organ and that is inevitable only in conditions of a total abundance like that of north. America can you stabilize it. It is in conditions of constraint and in access to certain technological multiplying resources eventually dominant and it creates new structures that reorient people's relationship to symbols and to the feelings they have and what it does. More than anything is that it makes you live in a society social relationship to others where you are repeatedly socially mistreated by people that are inside your group and then all those symbols that were designed to express unity are put to the purpose of justifying why that is it is. It's it. The cancer is the metaphor. It is a runaway growth. It's a runaway adaptation. It's it's the cells of the body rejecting the basic code understanding that there is no distinct interest between the cell and the body and you know the same way like you're less likely to get a tumor. If you're not around carcinogens of various kinds. Things that like throw random atoms into your body and like maybe might knock a dna strand into a different direction. the more of those things you have the more likely you're going to get a tumor and eurasia is just oh. There's so many social carcinogens.

There. There's so many cereal crops. There's so many draft animals and forget draft animals. Another thing they don't have in north america pigs which are huge. Pigs are gigantic in the formation of agricultural states. He was if you want to talk about buying off at the top. One way. You buy off at the top is with access to luxuries and in the early stages of the development of any social structure. Luxuries are hard to come by because of the lack of that administrative capacity right that comes later how do you make up for that you have some delicious basically near humans that you can distribute so that's another mechanism of of persuasion that they that all these north americans didn't have access to but like. I honestly think all they're really doing with this book is they're switching the moral The moral lens the the the prejudices then then because we worship progress that the emergence of systems of power and control is natural and the stagnation of you know non-improving cultures.

 is somehow eventually non-operative non-non- now that there's a state beyond nature that is preferable and all they do is say no that's that is the natural state. That is a that is a social body in homeostasis which is environment. That's what we literally all should be if we and that not being is in the source of most of our social problems of course. We'd still always have human problems. But we could solve them because we would be able to isolate them and people could be able to socially deal with them because there would be no class interest to subvert and undermine by dealing with the problem. That's why we can't deal with problems no matter. Even though we have democracy because every problem we have is premised on property relationships and that can't be addressed. So the only thing we can do is solve a symptom that causes another problem that is the one-way ratchet of all democratic governance and it's the reason. It's. It's also the source of the critique of liberalism and of capitalism that you see on the right. It's like oh. It's all it does is create more problems.

That's because it cannot confront the real cause of those problems and because personal problems now get totally subsumed into this social category. We are the tumors like we. This is a fundamental malady. A social malady that has to be fixed how do you do it. How do you get on a tumor. I guess the question is do you eat grape juice do you drink grape juice like steve jobs wants you to like honestly like grave. Girl want you to do you Do you do you do the dr sebi diet or do you accept the the benefits that come with technology that are right there as the janus face of its of its miseries and use those modern technologies to cut it out to you to you do chemotherapy chemotherapy to flush it out of your system. I guess like the the the left is divided between the the homeopaths and the people who want you to use. The the latest. Most well scientifically tested scientific technological advancements.

So the anarchist for me they want you to drink to drink the naked juice and and stand under a crystal and the marxists want you to get some goddamn chemo and and get somebody in there with a out like a goddamn like that like the like you're getting the lobster harmonica from the claw game on the simpsons okay. I thought this was a good one. I thought this was a great chapter to really get at the heuristics here. next week we're gonna wrap it up with the conclusion. also someone gave me a heads up that my boy walter scheidel who wrote the book escape from rome that I'm a big fan of actually wrote a review of this book which that's world's coming together that that's chocolate and peanut butter so. I'm also going to before next week read the schedule review and I'll talk about the conclusion of the book in conversation with the schedule thing and then we'll We'll think about what the next book will be. I have a couple of good suggestions. There's one leo pondage book somebody gave me. I think it's the origins of global capitalism that sounds very interesting might do that one. But we'll see all right bye.
