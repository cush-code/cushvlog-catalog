I got the wrong can I change this. I need to change the designation. I gotta edit the stream info because I'm not supposed to have. I have to have the correct type oh. I also didn't turn off the volume. I'm really bungling today sorry guys. I think I sound better. I realized I literally just forgot to turn the knob up on the volume last time and when everyone was telling me it needed to be louder very apologetic sorry. I am not good at this stuff okay. It's now under talk shows and podcasts hopefully that will register there we go all is right with the world and it sounds a little louder does it sound better. I was getting all frustrated and I realized oh. I'm no longer just on my laptop with the laptop microphone. I have an external device over here with knobs on it. You. You gotta turn the knobs so I turn the knob and I think it's louder. I turned off the other thing so it should not be echoey any so. I'm going to turn it up a little bit more.

How amazing is it that the taliban very well could take control formally of afghanistan's government on the 20th anniversary of 9 11. Can you just get your head around that and even if it isn't it'll be close enough for government work 20 years 20 years all of it thanks to america's choice a chosen war of aggression. We know this because we know that the taliban offered in fall of 2001 exactly what we have now or what we're going to have now which is a taliban as part of a government at least but without el and al qaeda and bin laden handed over on a plate to the united states or at the very least like executed in afghanistan could have had that deal and instead we got this and it you cannot say that it was a mistake. This is the important thing that it was a bungle or a up or a missed opportunity. We were we've been ever since the fall of the soviet union. The united states had been blindly groping for a political agenda that could fit the underlying economic necessity of a continued war economy.

The united war ii was premised on military military spending in order to maintain a military hegemony that then undergirds a economic hegemony. A global capitalist system that is not distributed evenly across the globe but that is concentrated in the united states where the entire global economy acts as a ratchet pulling towards the united states like the big black hole and it's the and that regime is a imperial regime and that regime is undergirded by imperial relationships but thanks to technology more than anything that imperialism no longer has to be formal so that means no more colonies. Instead you have trade networks and the us dollar and then after the 70s the petro dollar. But it's also upheld by the military.

It's upheld by this force projection that makes the american dollar the safest place for value to be stored because we have the will which is what is the actual basis for the value of currency. It has nothing to do with intrinsic value of precious metals or anything else. It doesn't have to do with any transcendent notion of value. It is the the power of the state to affirm the exchange that involves that currency and thanks to our military. The united states is the world currency that is most affirmable militarily so therefore the most stably store value. So we get to be the consumers at the end of the supply chain. Our consumption gets to fuel the entire machinery and the context whereby we affirmed that after world war ii was in the context of a cold war with the soviet union a conflict of values between democracy and totalitarianism or freedom and and conformity whatever we wanted to jack ourselves off about with the soviet union that prerogative failed fell away and the nakedness of american empire became clear and there was a crisis. At first there was a lot of talk in washington about something. They called a peace dividend at the end of the soviet union. All that money we spent in the military should come back but that would require but that would undermine. America's consumer economy would undermine the machinery we had made so there had to be a new modus vivendi.

George h.w. Bush started it off by essentially tricking entrapping saddam hussein into invading kuwait. They entrapped him like like marion barry so that they could affirm the america as the global policeman after the global policeman of the new world order but that doesn't really have the same persuasive power of a civilizational crisis so we just kind of drifted even after that hell that war couldn't even get. Bush re-elected for christ's sake and then clinton spent eight years struggling for something hey what if we bombed the serbs some kind of argument were why we have this giant military and then 9 11 happen and this for me is why we will never get rid of the sneaking suspicion that 911 was an inside job because it fulfilled a historic role that seems outlandish to have just occurred exogenously to the system. But of course the thing to remember is it wasn't. It was the outcome of all of this. It was the outcome of america's imperial power play. It was blow back but when it got we received the blow back from 911 there was no accountability.

There is no danger there's no concern oh. No people are going to realize that we've made we brought this on ourselves because they have a new story to tell now and it does not involve making a deal with the taliban to hand over bin laden and then we all have to sit around and say hey why did that happen why why did these guys blow. This place up no because where does that lead sure. No and if you have both parties on board and you have more importantly than that you have the military industrial bureaucracy forget even just forget. Even the money involved just the sheer weight of bureaucratic momentum and then the specific desires of the freaks of the in the bush white house. No one is gonna take that deal they're gonna. Put pedal to the metal hell they went to iraq more than anything in order to keep that energy going somewhere they ran out of good targets to blow up in afghanistan that rumsfeld was pushing iraq from day one because they wanted a pipelines compared to the middle east. It's a total backwater.

They needed some place at the center of the great game and the great game had moved south and west. So the stake had to be driven in and also if you're going to keep this new war footing. It requires continued pressure and continued threat because eventually people are going to normalize that 9 11 happen so you have to create the prospect of future 911s and it's like the joke about like bin. Laden said that the point of doing 911 was to make america destroy itself through imperial overreach and people say ah. He's getting exactly what he wants well. It's no. It's what he wanted but way more importantly than that it's what he wanted. It's what the system demanded. It's what was neces. It was what was required for the system to continue and the system will continue because it can no longer post-soviet union be resisted or is resisted in the current moment. In any coherent way.

We have a broken working class a broken humanity and we are at the mercy of this thing and we have been for a while. By the time 9 11 happened. We had been declassified we had been atomized and the last 20 years has been only the continued acceleration of that process as the the systemic shocks the ex the the environmental the truly the environmental and resource-based shocks are accumulating in the system and creating this spiral of destabilization that is now reverberating through our entire political structure and it's undermining the system's ability to to continue and that is what makes it so hard sometimes to understand how this works because nobody actually in charge wants things to be the way they are like that's why people have to invent lizard men who want to eat babies. Because you ha there is no human desire for where we are and where we're going. Nobody wants the world to cook. Nobody wants it maybe there's a few nihilist psycho billionaires. I think they're going to mars but they are a fraction of a fraction of people and they don't really they have no power. Their money is what has power. Nobody wants this but we're getting it because we have lost the fight for control of the technological mechanisms. What we lost it to was. Capitalism was the was. The programming was the machine skynet became self-aware and so the thing that would have been best for humanity by any stretch including the ruling classes of america after 9 11 would have been an inward as is always the case it would have been an inward look towards you know actually creating democracy just like it would have been better after world war ii. If we'd had a henry wallace-led reproach mount with the soviets and in a mutual progress towards decolonization instead of the cold war and if we had gotten a real reconstruction and after world war one after the civil war and if we'd gotten a german revolution after world war one and at every turn the wrench moved the the the human intervention in the system became less our ability to actually do our regular lives and make it mean anything has has changed has reduced. We don't we still have power and this is why this is beyond black pill. We still have power we're all humans.

We literally are in charge of this thing still but we cannot be humans the way we are now and stop it if the incentive structures that are built into our social relationships if followed if l if rationally followed will prevent us from ever meaningfully resisting this thing until it's too late if it isn't already. So the hope is that we become different people and that the changes the changes that are going to come to our understanding of our material relationships and more importantly than anything our faith in the existing structures that we operate under are going to be fatally compromised and once that happens we aren't the same people. Anymore. We respond to different stimuluses and different different motivations and respond differently and so we have hope but the reason that it looks like we don't is because we are trapped in structures that were created at the at at the dawn of the of the mot of the of the modern moment. The high modernist moment of of the cold war like everything every structure we have is design was designed to facilitate existence in the context of the post-war world which was an extensively infinite progress that will always be able to create new avenues of profit by intensifying technology and that that process will be overseen by human beings who are in charge of it and we're going to utilize structures of science technology to be able to figure out the correct thing to do and then we will use democratic means of governance to figure out. What the what the collective interest is and then pursue it using these technologies and these structures of governance. Now this system contains within it inherent class contradictions racial contradictions al all sorts of social pathologies that come from the fact that it's an unequal society. But we can manage those that pain manage that alienation through a redistributive redistributive process we redistribute wealth to the working class first the white ones then after black self-assertion to a greater degree.

 the black ones than other groups as they assert their rights also and and are accommodated into a a common citizenship and that we will all be deliberating through the lens of a mass mediated culture where we all have certain understandings of what america is american interests. We have a certain credulity to the best interests or to the We have a credulity about things like the media and things like government. We assume a level of honesty We assume a level of trust because if we're in the center of this thing if we're people who are who have succeeded enough to be citizens to vote. Then our experience with america has only been positive. We won the war and now we're creating mass comfort and con in a consumer society where we all get to be wonderful. We all get to be. We don't get to express our individuality our humanity through control of our work. But we do get to express it through control of our environment in the form of consumption. So we have sublimated away all of that class conflict and we get in return material comforts. We get the suburban home we get new and better appliances that make our lives easier. We get dreams of greater and greater consumption bigger cars bigger houses trips to disney world fantasies. We never knew could imagine we create and then pursue them and we can pursue them and it functioned for a while but then first the social. conflict started heating up in the 60s but at that very moment the environmental constraints the material constraints started to kick in the one of those big key of that equation.

Cheap energy inputs blew off this whole thing there were a bunch of warning signs that the system was going to seize up in the 70s. and nixon tried his damnedest to try to keep the thing going with pushing every button that keynes has. But it was the oil crisis that permanent made it permanent and that put us in a new permanent position vis-a-vis all these inputs and what that meant is is that the treats couldn't flow. The promise of treats would would dry up and instead of confronting that because by then the democratic party had become a husk with no working-class imperative and all it had was more. liberal moralism to sell people wear a sweater and stop wanting so much reagan was there to say with a pitch honed by 40 years of anti-new deal. reactionary ideology being formed. Hey you know what there's still hope if we cut regulations and taxes. If we make you pay less for the state. Then you will be able to have more to use. We're not going to give you any more money. We don't say that out loud but it's the obvious outcome. We don't push. These points anymore. We just push taxes and regulations and people do make some money if you had a home.

By 1980 they protected it you were in under the gun if you didn't you were. And if you were in an urban area that had been de-industrialized early you got the drug war shoved up your ass but if you were in the suburbs you got home equity that you could borrow against. You got cheap credit that you could buy with. But what that means is that the number of people who are invested in this thing who believe in it who do things like vote and care and participate civically starts to dry up and the only ones left are those people who have succeeded through it. But over time there are fewer and fewer of them and their kids don't have access to any of these deals and so all the premise the structures of of government the structures of belief and compulsion that had been forged in the post-war era are still there still all we have cannot be interfered with because we don't have a political um counter hegemony to it but no longer hold any persuasive power to people we no longer believe in any of them. Fewer and fewer people participate and the ones that do are now participating through a lens that says these collective structures. These things that we believed had like a universal character like we're americans. In this together those are gone now. The outside is not not america. It's inside america and that's all because things keep getting worse and the ratchet of misery keeps going up and the ratchet of precarity.

Madigas is talking the other day. About oh actually everybody has it great. Americans have it so good and of course if you put it on paper yeah. Everybody has it good but that's not how people experience the world. The world experience is experienced relatively and subjectively and the relative subjective experience is being my wildly lonely and miserable. All the time some version of that. Some version of of anxiety and alienation felt and un that cannot be subsumed by pleasure by consumption because one the consumption is less satisfying than it used to be and two there's less of it to access. So everybody is miserable. You can put them. On a graph and say their lives are by relative measure to other countries great and there and things are john.

Shade said that the other day he's like he's saying why everyone's mad is fox news and he eliminated all these other options and by any by pointing out that the math the science didn't work and for him. It's like. Hey things are getting. Worse and shade says actually things are doing fine. Things are actually getting. Better wages are slightly increasing and you know all these people are earning wait. you know middle class lifestyles sure it doesn't feel that way and that's where people live people live. Their lives through those felt associations and politics is an expression of those feelings not rationality. Not some coherent ideology. Very few people operate that way. Everybody's miserable I was looking at this amazing thread that alex loan option. fym god curated of the police blotter of the villages in florida and a bunch of people driving drunk in golf carts but one that stuck out for me was a woman who was arrested at a burger king in the villages for losing her or something and was actually arrested. She got probation now. Obviously. This is a racist bitter woman who just saw a a black person who was not subservient enough to them and was enraged by it but just imagine the idea that you're gonna get mad that your tomatoes in your burger king aren't good. It's burger king man. It's never been good. You live in the villages how could this be your last straw. I can get somebody whose life is a misery getting a bad tomato in a in a whopper and then they don't get a nobody helps them and they flip out. This person's life is sim has been a gossamer hammock but it feels like misery because they're getting old because they know they're gonna die because they have to displace that anxiety somewhere and they put it in these culture wars. They put it in fixating on not any of the pleasures of their life but the all the ways that the pleasure isn't sufficient so that they can build up resentment which is the only kind of feeling. They can have anymore and people call that a karen or whatever but everybody is doing that to some extent or another everybody is trying to find somebody to yell at for the misery. They feel no matter where they are on the scale. It's universal misery and it is expressed through a universal desire to yell at someone.

Because fundamentally we are consumers. We're not workers. We're not pmc either We're not bug men. I mean we're not any of this. Consumers. I mean. I guess that is bug man fine. But we are all no matter where we are on the spectrum. No matter what our edgy political takes are no matter. what chan we visit. We are consumers and that means that when we're confronted with a bad customer service experience which all of us feel we're getting from living in the united states right. Now everybody feels like they're getting a bad consumer experience. They have only the resource and recourse to yell at someone to make it change because the assumption that we all live with and don't speak of is that we have no power over anything we individually people have no power over everything. There is somebody else somewhere who does though and if we yell at them we will get somewhere the same way that if we yell at verizon long enough they'll do something or we will get a free refill. I mean somebody says mad as hell that's one of the things that's so perfect about network.

Among other things is that it's understanding of like someone trying to galvanize the alienation that is accumulating in that other moment of crisis the 70s by the way that's when the great reset happened everybody freaking out about the great reset. The great reset happened in the carter administration and it was solidified by the by reagan's election that was the great reset. Everything has been reset since then now and what that reset was is the end of the equation. The end of that post-war order where you had a political system fed by this economic system. A political economy we built a new political economy but we didn't talk about it. We didn't notice it. We didn't actually debate it or fight over it. It just it just happened well. We kept all of the same structures and we've been using those same structures to try to govern ourselves and try to imagine that we're participating in a political process. While the actual political or the economic machine restructures our lives completely without our consent because it's being done undemocratically. It's been abstracted out of democracy. It's being done at the fed. It's being done where in the wtf wtf the wto and the imf is being done by the federal reserve. It's being done by nafta. So every decision is made every crisis emerges and a decision is made and the decision is made at the expense of people in favor of profit. That is chincy. But it's true and of course. There are people associated with those profits but they are really just at this point along for the ride. None of us are actually in charge of the thing anymore and so the reason everything looks. Hopeless is because we have structures that exist that are no longer connected to power in any way. But we have no way to act differently because there's no counter-hegemonic structures that we can involve ourselves in. We used to have that we had a working a a conscious working-class political counter hegemony. In this country that lasted from the popular front to the 70s. It right it reached its apogee in world war ii. It was beaten and destroyed and broken after the war with the counter-revolutionary forces of the american.

 bourgeois coming together to carry out the second red scare to pass taft-hartley and then it carried on as part of this executive committee of capitalism. Along with you know the corporate boards and and the the deep state and all that stuff the military industrial complex. All of it. The the whole deal they were. They were at the table of power and they were making sure that working-class people got more got. Better wages got more respect. We're invent we're allowed to move through and up into positions of cultural power and influence and therefore make art that was informed by a working class a self-conscious working-class experience that saw the new deal as something that had benefited them once you change the economic structure once you break class. Power like was broken in the 70s and 80s that conveyor belt to culture is broken. Nobody. More and more working-class people cannot expect their kids to be able to take the risks to enter the arts or to be able to compete on an even playing field with the richer children of the upper classes for the meritocratic spots that they're all going for and they get squeezed out of the system and the ones that are left have been exposed their entire life to a culture where they were never a worker. Whether they're working is not something that they understand they were only ever a consumer because they've only encountered culture that was created after the death of of the labor movement and therefore of working class culture.

But the hope. The reason that there's wild hope in everyone's hearts or should be is that these structures are of course doomed to be destroyed by the changing. material conditions that they deny but that doesn't just mean you know climate change. It doesn't just mean ocean action if acid ocean acid acidification or any of that. It's also that it no longer can persuade people to go along with it. It can no longer persuade people to keep doing their jobs and if it can't persuade them to keep reading their jobs keep doing their jobs. Then the thing can't operate because it still needs people for a while we'll see. It still needs people but right now. We're all stuck at the end state of of consumer panic where we're just complaining the capital complaining to the going on the internet to to complain to the The helpline of the united states on twitter anywhere else but no one is paying attention. No one is actually manning. The lines your call is not important to anyone and that's why it feels helpless. But that just means people have to are going to lose faith in this thing if you don't get enough calls. If you don't get enough responses you will decide to do something now the thing they're going to do isn't necessarily going to be great. Not. Everyone is going to be spontaneously moved towards communism but the window opens the historic window opens. There's a reason that toussaint breda which was what he was named called for most of his life when he came to prominence in the haitian. Revolution started calling himself to louvature the opening because that was a haitian phrase for like a liminal space where where possibilities emerge and he was that he was the opening that like haitian humanity could flow through. So we just got to keep moving and draw with the changes as aryo'd speedwagon said but of course this requires a certain degree of faith a leap of faith that we haven't gone past the point of no return that skynet has not completely con grabbed everyone who matters. But that hope is the same hope that carries you through the day. The hope that makes you think that opening your eyes is going to be worth doing and that spending any time on earth is worth doing and that is that is not a rational thing and it's certainly not a prediction that you can confidently make through the missive absolute bafflement that make up our understanding of the world around us we feel and so we live and yeah. That's why. I think it's going to be religious. I think there's going to be a religious element to it.

But I don't know what it's going to be just keeping my. I'm right now. I'm doing my best although probably not my best. I'm doing. I'm doing an attempt at keeping my no my keeping my ear to the ground to hear the tremble of horse hooves trying my. I don't know.

I do think there is something heartening in the fact that at a terminal point aristocracy which is always what the ruling class is becomes so interbred and so decadent that it can no longer exercise power. I mean that's one of the that's what doomed feudalism is that the aristocracy lost its vigor. Like there. There are potential kings who could have handled the conflict the the crisis of like 1789 or 1917 but they sure as weren't the kings produced by hundreds of years of in and I don't mean inbreeding literally. I mean inbreeding class wise of idle aristocrats in the capet and in romanov lines. The places where ca where power was able to stay in stable hands were places where the aristocracy handed over power to the bourgeois. On some conditions. The stewards had a hard time coming to terms with it and they had to be several times disciplined and then eventually removed because they could not accept the reality of bourgeois rule in europe. In england they had to import the dutch to do it. They essentially the first two capitalist economies of europe did a merger. They were no longer competing. They were essentially cooperating and it and out of that became a ruling class that essentially gave up power in exchange for privilege wealth and a big hat and so the dutch and krauts who came after the stuarts were a new house broken ruling class but in countries where that process happened differently like france like russia. the ruling the aristocrats held power until they had lost their control over the rest of populous and were ruled by incompetent dullards whose ability to intervene in events from a position of information and and will and authority. Leadership have been attenuated by their lack of struggle that their lives have been just as fat little babies sitting around and that would have been true for their child. Their parents and parents parents and we are certainly at that point now because capitalism is also class rule just as social so just as feudalism had been. It must also be ruled by an aristocracy but that aristocracy has to have a different cultural validation feudalis feudal. The feudal aristocracy was validated by their first their warrior prowess and then later more abstractly their the will of god through their ability to win at battle.

Basically. God's will is determined on the battlefield whoever wins deserves power because god is willed it. That is the evangelical christian notion of right that persists today into america's ideology. America's national ideology which is at war with its in the international ideology of finance capitalism but a new era requires a new justification. people didn't believe in god. That same way democracy was more insistent. People at the base had more of an ability to articulate their their wants and desires and rights like the urban hordes of paris and moscow and in that context a new validation for aristocracy had to emerge and it was the meritocracy and that's why the signal figure of liberalism. The the godhead of liberalism is napoleon bonaparte the meritocrat of meritocrats who seized power from the decadent and decayed bourbon dynasty through sheer will and ability replaced one monarchy with another where the premise was not god but of one's ability napoleon.

When he crowned himself emperor he literally crowned himself emperor. He put the fight and die in thousands on the battlefield march into russia and freeze to that because it gets results because he actually was a goddamn meritocrat but then the meritocrats kids you're not going to let the kid go out and and compete on an even playing field with everybody else they couldn't if they wanted to. They're absorbing at a level that gets them in the door inherently and so the kids of the meritocrats are slightly less meritocratic than their parents had been. Their kids are less meritocratic than theirs had been. Some are so unmeritocratic. They fall out sometimes people from the working classes move up in to the top through being so damn meritocratic but then guess what their kids less meritocratic than them until they either fall out or stabilize and it is a decline that cannot be interrupted and now our meritocrats are absolute. Habsburgian incompetence they are dull-eyed slackwits.

The president of the united states. The last two are demented old men meritocrats in different ways and so that's part of the reason that this machine is this. Plane is crashing into the mountain is that they have no ability or will to work against the impera imperatives of capitalism even if they even if they wanted to even if they desire something different they can only express it through the most idiotic way the rich. The the there are billionaires in this country who believe in q a basically pete ricketts. The governor of oklahoma or I think his brother the guy who owns the cubs. One of those ricketts is a billionaire.

 has had their emails leaked and it's all denise de souza are all that's left or people who are a little more. a little more practical understanding of the game but are 900 years old our gerundocracy they hang around because they're the only people with institutional knowledge anymore. Everybody else grew up in little pods little goo balls and this system and as I said the system is doing things against the will of those in charge of it. These people see their kids are worse than them. They see that their kids suck they don't want them to suck. They see the ways that the system makes them suck but they can still only do what the system tells them to do and so then they have to explain this and they can only get the same fake delusional cultural explanations that used to be for the dummies because they're just as dumb. They don't have any more insight into the world because they are experiencing it as just a far removed from power a guy like joe biden. He has faint memories of his hat in his head of when government meant something and he's been living in that echoing chamber.

His whole life. That's why these old are in charge of their democratic party because there is no will to take power from them among those younger than them because power doesn't mean anything to them because they know it's not real so eventually even though your ruling class has all of these tools at their disposal to wield power and the working and class has nothing but their their cooperation. Eventually their misery and alienation becomes so acute that they are able to come together and assert power that the decrepit ruling class can't resist. I do believe that we will get to a point of of organizing among the the dispossessed. The increasingly dispossessed and the question that is still open. Though is to what degree has technology filled the gap of human experience and intelligence and initiative that used to be the thing that undermined previous ruling classes and there is a hole that we can't see into because it will only prove itself one way or the other through the passage of time.

 and the intervention of events which we can't know. We can only participate in them in good faith and that is that is our task to participate in good faith in in the life that emerges around us and not to deny deny it. In fantasy. Somebody asked for an example of the demiurge in the contemporary world if you think of if you think of the the demiurge as as this as the will of humanity's the nightmare mind of humanity basically that is what are um that is generated by our alienation from one another and that we then inscribe in the world to reify that alienation. Because we need it. We need to be alienated from each other in order. To exploit one another and our will to exploit has been traditionally stronger than our pull towar away from towards each other because at every point those in power are using their power to create structures that reinforce alienation. One way or another and then everybody who's born into that world is experiencing it through structures that inhibit and that inhibit human interactions that can be a wellspring of of of solidarity and I would say that the american road network our automotive infrastructure is a psychic prison branded onto the land that has the lived effect of imposing. This false world on us where we are alone where we are fundamentally alone and where we have to orient our desires. We have to orient our values around solitude around isolation where we have to privilege our own sensory comfort and pleasure over others. Even others close to us because it is the only real thing we feel and our interest our. automotive infrastructure ensures that our felt day-to-day lives are isolated that we spend time away from each other time like the time in our bodies is alone and if we live in a in a in a house if we got a part of that post-war dream. It was in exchange for living more isolated lives instead of living in a walk-up good news instead of living in a shitty walk-up with two kids in one bedroom.

 you get a nice piece of land in the country and the kids can run in the background that's great. But what you're giving up is the fact that you had neighbors that you had you could you spent a day walking amongst people living amongst people. The that suburban ease and comfort and convenience is at the expense of time spent with others. Now if people say do new yorkers talk to their neighbors of course. They don't now of course they don't now. This is the next step of that our. computer infrastructure our media infrastructure are our mediated lives. Generate that are now pumped to us. Through. Wi-fi are another lattice work of demiurgical re constraint think of how much time you spend online think of how much even that how much time you spent just watching television or did before the internet that was time that you did spend.

I'm sorry commiserating building notions of value building notions of the good building feelings around ideas and symbols that are forged in a social context. We receive these symbols passively and apply them from a in a apply a solipsistic lens to them and that is not a choice. We make it is not us moving towards sin. It is us being put into a black iron prison that is yelled about swooping in and severing us from connections that would pull us towards the light of the light of unity which is where we are always living but not feeling as though we are living. I think yelled about somebody says does yell to both dumb or does yell to both get off on human suffering. I think if we conceive it as in human terms which is what you know what it all comes down. To these are all these concepts are just metaphorical and symbolic structures to talk about the human mind the collective and individual human mind and if there is a evil god in intervening through a assertion of will and power into our affairs as humans it is not individual poi. It is not the choices of individuals.

It is the combination of the the ritualized sadism of those choices and I think that's the real symbolic value of of you know epstein and and bohemian grove. It's the it's just a it's a it's a sociological observation that people of us of sufficient acuity of mind to know what they are doing. When they're presiding over this system have to ritually invert human values in order to continue living consciously subconsciously. They do this the more self-aware they are the more consciously they have to do it and that means ritual affirmations of evil now the problem with this metaphor and the reason it's dangerous just out there as a way to understand the world and why it leads to things like q and on is that I think the way people understand. This process is as powerful people doing rituals to affirm their power and to make us miserable. I honestly feel that it is that these rituals are better understood as coping mechanisms. You are trapped at the apex of a power structure that you are fully invested in. It's given you more. It's giving you pleasure. But more importantly it is giving you the anxiety of losing that pleasure. But it's also making you carry out monstrous acts and and preside over monstrosity well if you feel that you cannot leave that position and you won't remember if you do and leave.

Somebody else comes in who's in that spot who doesn't have those qualms then you have to do something to to make the evil good. Hitler did that these through his racial occultism and our rulers do it through whatever weird reptile religions. They follow now not all of the ruling class has to do that remember. I said they're mostly dummies and dumb people never have to worry about this stuff dumb people are so fully propagandized by their own. Koch brothers who think libertarianism was real. Most of them are dumb by which I mean they are propagandized by truths that given their exposure to reality they shouldn't believe basically is what it boils down to like we as regular people can be forgiven for believing the propagandized notions of american the values. That's why we live in the black iron prison. That's why we carry out evil even though we're trying to do good. It's because we emerge into a culture. We're told certain things. We can only live a life and then and then compare it to our experiences or compare our experiences to what we're told and then we have to deal with it. If you are at the apex of power you have a different experience of existence. You see different things that undermine all of the. That's why they do ritual stuff to fill in the gap.

But if you're just a dumbass who rises there because all it needs is a body and a chair it doesn't need will it doesn't the system. At those points it doesn't need human initiative. It just needs a um to complete the circuit. They need a warm body to grab two. hot ends together and so if they're dumb asses they actually think this stuff ron. Johnson senator from wisconsin. my cousin knows his family and has been to his house and he said that every room of their big you should know better. But he doesn't need to know better because what do you need to be to be a senator. You need to be a warm body in a suit. Who'll vote away same way in all structures of government. There are a few places at high at high levels of sensitivity and intricacy that you still need intelligence and that's where all the sickos are. That's where all the people who have some freakish inverted consciously evil understanding of the world live because you still need to be smart. But everybody else is just believing the same that we all do oh bungler obungler is a pure narcissist. He believes only in himself and completely to him in himself to to of degree where he has become god which is of course the ultimate sin and makes him satan. A human turned into a god is lucifer and trump is the same thing pure ego. But trump is also trump isn't really dumb so much as he doesn't care he is so purely self fixated that he doesn't care. He has no intellectual vanity. Obama has intellectual vanity trump just wants everyone to be paying attention to him but that's who's going to run for president and a glitching old robot like joe biden who still thinks it's 1975. That's it someone says trump is pure id but obama has a bit of superego. I would say that trump is pure id. Obama is id transubstantiated into superego by an act of superhuman will and that's why I really have to say that if I have a candidate for like archon of arkhans right now it would be biden. What did. I say by name and obama archon of archons is a bungler for sure you know what trump is. An archon trump is a demiurgical archon trump. I'm sorry obama is a demiurgical archon trump is more like one of those gods of chaos from warhammer. Anybody know about this warhammer. You guys are aware of warhammer paul paul. You know warhammer warhammer. There are these gods of chaos who emerge from like the the soup of consciousness like the residue of human experience and they and these gods are sort of risen up by like human human civilization so you've got a god of war. Obviously. There's a god of of of disease and then there's a god of just pure vanity and it's it's him like with with obama.

I think there's just too much self-consciousness there like he is trying to embody a system he is trying to become america. Trump doesn't give a about america. Trump is pure will to be seen like the collective desire the reason that he is loved and worshiped like no american president ever has been is because people who love him love themselves. They see him and they see a mirror. He is a media personality. He is a big. He's a air ballon filled with the collective narcissism of the white boomers. Basically no I see someone says you think you'd have a beautiful god of vanity. No no no that imagines that there is an objective beauty standard that I'm held to my existence is self-validating. It's not because I'm beautiful. It's because I'm me. That's why people love trump because he asks nothing of them just like they ask nothing of themselves. So he doesn't have the the directed desire to wield power or at least assimilate power so that it going through him. He gets to imagine is his will like obama because obama he knows that he's not really in charge of anything. But he feels like being in the room validates him and infuses him with this structure because he worships the structure he he is invested in the structure and he validates himself in relationship to the structure.

Trump just wants everyone to be paying attention to him. He ran for president for people to pay attention to him and then he accidentally won. He didn't want to win and then he accidentally won and then he just wants hey. Now everyone is paying attention to me and every act of his entire presidency is only understood that way which is why by the way there is no revolutionary potential. There is no socialist radicalization potential. There is no um. There is no useful political potential in the trump movement because it is an expression. It is certainly generated by how miserable everyone is and alienated from the system they are. But it captures that the form that it that captures that feeling is a form of pure nihilistic narcissism. It is looking in the mirror and being bewitched which is the opposite of the perspective that needs to be asserted in the political stage in order to actually create people willing to work against their own most narrowly conceived of pleasurable interests like I said be willing to work for free. Trump has never worked for free. He's never worked period. He's never for a second thought what can about doing anything that wasn't in his most narrow selfish interest and that goes for everybody who votes for him. Not that that's all they feel but that when they vote that's all they're feeling and even if they have some sort of vague populist resistance their votes aggregated are simply this this monstrous un unshamaled id or unshackled it rather unshamal. That's not a word so anybody. There's so.

I see the people like oh man like he he he triggers these bad libs who really are bad His. His followers have a knee-jerk um distrust of all these institutions which really are bad if we could just turn them towards a project as long as it is trump as long as the form is trump and if it's through the two-party system that's the form it'll take because that's all there is it will be this narcissistic project. This nihilistic project and the reason people don't want to admit that is because it means you can't post your way out of it. You can't oh. I'm going to. I'm going to epically meme trumpism into being socialist and then all these dumbasses are going to vote for what they think is trumpism but is actually socialism. No no now these trump voters could be part of a future coalition that challenges capitalism that's the thing and that is a thing that a lot of leftists claim and they are wrong if you vote for trump. You're you cannot be part of the pro. The solution that is absolutely incorrect bernie understood that and it's key in fact. It's important and it's crucial to any progress because there's a lot of them and a lot of them are genuinely getting by capitalism and could be useful against it. But they will have to be appealed to from a political project that is orthogonal to democrats and republicans. But that means you can't meme your way into it. You can't just argue culture war stuff and hope it has the accumulated effect of pushing us towards socialism.

It only advances this sterile culture conflict that benefits the machine that's whirring in the background. The whole time and doesn't give a about the outcome of these contests that means we gotta do hard work that means we gotta organize in work places. We got to give up on the idea that we're going to have a vested interest in presidential elections or what happens in the house and senate we're going to have to put our noses to the grindstone and and focus on local power which is not glamorous or fun or easy. It's going to take a lot to push people off of that hedonic treadmill. But it's happening. It's happening in bits and pieces person by person across this country and eventually you get enough popcorn kernels going off and you have the potential for something to emerge not the necessity that it will not the guarantee that it will. This is why in my mind marxism doesn't have to answer to any question of teleological. it doesn't have to marxism doesn't have to answer to the charge that it is excessively teleological because right there in the manifesto.

It says you have a conflict between classes one class wins or there's a common ruin common ruin is on the table. Common ruin is the house favorite common ruin. is a 14 point favorite going into the second half. But we can't say that's happening. Now we don't know that's happening now saying it is happening now is indulgence to get out of the political commitments that morality requires of you here. I speak of myself too both options are on the table you've got to fight the second half. It's difficult and we don't know. We don't really know what to do because we're all talking at a level of abstraction that cannot answer our day-to-day questions. We only have to think more deeply of those questions and ask more of ourselves in answering them that's not satisfying. But it is. It's a course. It's a course forward. Yes dumerism is absolutely bourgeois. It is a it is a decadent attitude and everybody is going to be indulging it to some degree or another because we're humans and we're treat addicted and we are solipsistic.

We're not going to change that overnight and if we do try to change it overnight. We'll probably end up becoming undestabilized. But we have to every day try to adjust try to try to hear. The voice try to hear the to sound like a hippie here but to hear the vibrations in the air and to don't not over run them with our own hedonic nihilism because that's never going to satisfy it's only going to feel bad. It's going to feel worse over time because that's the that is the real rejoinder to the argument that just be is that black pill is. The logical conclusion is okay fine how how do you feel your black pill. How does it feel feel. Good probably feels pretty bad so what are you gonna do about it and I ask myself that every day and if and if it feels fine if you're like grooving on on dumerism and it's like you've got a balance where you're not miserable more power to you. I don't blame you but I really don't think that's true of most people. I think most people are are are not satisfied with the hedonic calculus that they're operating off of but the important thing to remember is that nobody knows anything. Nobody knows what's gonna happen. No one knows what's happened.

No man shall know the hour or the day and I'm sorry. That's you. It doesn't matter how many posts you've read. It doesn't matter how much analysis you've done. It doesn't matter how many google alerts. You have for climate disasters or whatever the are you who are any of us. We're fragments. We're fragmentary people trying to find those missing pieces but giving up giving up the certainty that we're seeking is is agitating and I think in a good way because if you're agitated you are aware something is wrong and you have to address it there might not be a reason. But I really think that if you search for a place to put your energy that you'll find it if you're pursuing in good faith a place to put them whoo all right. I didn't do a chat all week. So. I guess. This was all built up. I am on letterbox. I just. I haven't seen anything okay so next week. I'm going to try to maybe on monday. We'll talk about what book to do next. If anyone has any ideas. We'll talk about them next week and then make a decision you.
