We're live wait for some people to fill in here. If you see a big sign. The sun ryan says stay away fools. How's that rules ah oh around and around and around and around and everybody's grooving baby folks lining up outside just to get down like a little shack funky little shack okay. So today. I'm gonna finish. We're gonna do chapter nine. This book talking chapter 9 chapter 9 which is titled hiding in plain sight the indigenous origins of social housing and democracy in the americas. I gotta say right off the bat that hits the ear bad because origins implies a continuity right and I just don't think that you can draw any continuity between whatever the hell he's talking about in this chapter and modern schemes of social housing. And I think that's a general problem with the entire. Frankly. The entire project here is attempting to imagine a continuous chain of influence reaching from these pre modern I'm trying to think like it's pretty historical. Not really they have let they have They have writing some of them do anyway but certainly not a lot of writing.

But like these these things and you know modern notions of liberty and freedom because he's he's trying to argue that you know that rather than emerging from a process of you know modernization. that ideas that we think of as modern ideas of liberty and justice and whatnot and freedom have their basis. In these these early human settlements pre-columbian I guess that works too and as I said. I don't know if that's really the case a lot of it ended up hinging on his whole deal with you know european the enlightenment being kindled by this interaction with indigenous cultures in north america and it does seem like he's kind of getting they're kind of getting to making that argument that there's like this circular transmission whereby you know icky hierarchical property relations erupt in eurasia and then you know in in the new world in the americas these traditions of autonomy and and and and democracy have survived and that when they interact with one another. it's when that's what causes european civilization to start to look inward and ask questions about what it really values and honestly even if it's true. I don't know what you do with the fact that they just got. Bad all these traditions that they that they seek to point out at some point in history get just steamrolled permanently with no recovery and I just I have to believe that there that that has implications that they just don't want to seem to really dwell on because it challenges the idea that we're all really just like a minds a mind. set a phase shift in in mental you know framing away from just recreating these social or organizational structures in you know the wreckage of modernity that we're living in so in this chapter grab grow.

After talking about early democratic or quasi-democratic governing structures in urban areas in eurasia moved to mesoamerica specifically into the central american yucatan peninsula area where where of course by the which are ruled by the 16th century 14th century 15th century by the aztecs which were then of course overthrown by the spanish. But what grab girl want to point out is that before the hegemony of the of the aztec empire which is of course you know a very brutal hierarchical social structure that involved you know slavery and mass. Human sacrifice um there were other models of social relationships in that area and specifically the aztecs themselves. were inspired in the construction of their their capital of tenochtitlan by a abandoned at that point. The time they were moving through the the the mexica valley there. a city that the aztecs referred to as the city of the gods because it was had these monumental architectural structures but was totally abandoned called teo. Han. I believe that's it teo te kwan tiatu kwan. I'll go with tio te tequan that'll work which was inhabited estimated from 100 bc to 600 a.d. So you got a good 700 year period where you have this area is settled in a urban space and it's a very weird site. So it's it. It defies a lot of architectural of our archaeological expectations because it has some as I said monumental architecture.

It's got two huge pyramids the pyramid of the sun. What the aztecs called it the pyramid of the moon and it's got a big open plaza with that that fronted a a temple a temple to the feathered serpent mesoamericans. They love the feathered serpents big on those and but it also has this weird layout of like apartment blocks. Basically all around it with no signs of you know the sort of social stratification that you see in other early urban settlements and grab girl point out that this seeming perplexity is sort of resolved. If you look at the structure. chronologically the first thing we built the first thing that lasts the thing that we built anyway were these. giant structures the the pyramids and the temple but at the point in the history of the city the temple was raided smashed. The idols were destroyed. they they did a saddam hussein pull down of the feathered serpent statues and after that you see the build this explosion in social housing basically where they start building. These relatively equal even sized apartment complexes like one floor apart story apartment complexes with like a hundred so people in one what you'd call a neighborhood which were all decorated at different you know like what what grav were referred to as psychedelic murals and you see in these areas that no signs of kingdom or ruled them.

 this the images of people everyone's the same size which is very rare. Usually you'll see one big guy to represent you know the god and then the king that the god speaks through here. Everybody's the same size. essentially everyone is vibing in the block and grab girl paint. This this narrative where you had a classic human sacrifice based because this is another thing that you see is evidence of human sacrifice bodies. Being you know people being decapitated and their bodies being sort of arranged in patterns in the again. The foundation of buildings you know that kind of thing and that stops the same time that the temple gets destroyed and doesn't happen anymore once. this move towards social housing building has happened and the picture that they that they tell is one where you have this. This classical civilization of brutal hierarchy and ritualized domination overthrown from within and literally the gods being pulled from their from their platforms and and smashed and that in the wreckage of that the people democratically coming together to provide for each other collectively by building this structures of social housing which while they were roughly the same size were not exactly the same size and all of which were decorated in distinct ways and involved plenty of diversity not just in styles but also ethnicity.

They say that there were quarters here for people from different tribes in different parts of mexico and and the central and the and central america. And this is this is where I really felt from when I was a young anarchist. I felt a real like tingle as I remember reading about like you know other moments in time like this that you can kind of freeze and and then texture and create an a a vision of like an alternative human potential and like they're with this. With this description. They're filling in a lot of know like it's a persuasive collection of evidence but that's because they're collecting it. It might be very much less persuasive being collected by somebody else with different priors.

But anyway like you do have the reality of this very unusual social housing you have the reality of the destruction of this temple complex so you have the every tool at your disposal to build this story of a period. A little idol where where people were able to organize themselves did not need gods or masters and and were able to provide for each other collectively which is you know the dream of all of the entire left in any respect you know. It's this is what this is if not like the teleology like an end stage. It is the it is the possibility the potentiality that moves you forward because if you can see it in your mind if you can imagine it really happening and especially if you can animate a period of history even if it's a moment with that with those values a time when those values governed and did do the things that reactionary social culture tells you ration reactionary. Social assumptions tell you cannot happen. It keeps you focused you know it it it it. It sharpens and directs your political action because what else is to be sought but that in my view like the any of the schemes of like natural hierarchy of the right all end in obliteration they have to and all they end up. Doing is romanticizing that annihilation and obliteration that death drive and and finding some apotheosis in it.

But you know it's It's sick. It's a sickness under death and and and it's not worth moving.

It's not worth trying to preserve or defend or or or validate you know. But at the same time it strikes me of of how how much of yourself and how much of your your desire of how you want things to be and flex this because I remember reading about the spanish civil war you know when I was like in my early 20s and reading about the july days when everyone knew in the city that the soldiers were going to come out of their barracks and they spontaneously organized to resist them and you had cab drivers welding sheet metal to the side of their cabs to make them into improvised armored cars and you had a athletes who were in barcelona for a socialist alternative to the olympia olympics in munich which many left-wing athletes had boycotted just grabbing guns and going out into the the barricades and then when sure enough. The next morning they came out of the barracks they got owned and then of course you know the the the collectivization of agriculture. in the the catalonian andalusian countryside. You know not not a stalinesque nightmare but a spontaneous expression of rural solidarity you go to a village the story of going to a village in in revolutionary spain and there's a that has abolished money and abolished the value form and there's a there's a poster that says john rockefeller could come in here to this city and he wouldn't be able to buy a single cup of coffee.

You read about that and it gives you yes a sense of what could be and and a desire to see to put some effort into making it happen. What's going on what happened. What is why can you not see me can you not hear me. What's going on it's normal. You can't do that to me people okay but at the same time as fun as it is to read and as important as it as it is just from a morale and spiritual perspective at the end of the day. Though what's it got to do with the price of beans you know like how does any of this.

 deal how does any of this relate to the question of organizing towards power in the time that we live in a time when all of these possibilities have been wiped out and a totalizing capitalism. a totalizing regime of technological alienation has defined human existence in a way that makes us as beings metaphysically distinct from the beings that are being described in this book and that's a question that I don't think that there's a lot of answers to that come you know in in in this literature so then so grab row talk a lot about this this city and it how it very well might have been this this little island of of mutualism in a sea of of bud burdening like death cults and and you know murder empires They also point out to the weird phenomenon of people from this city. tiatuan becoming like stranger kings in areas to the south of the city suggesting that if you wanted to be a king if you wanted to to rule over others you essentially couldn't do it in the city and you had to go somewhere else. You were You were like a adventurer a vagabond or a merchant. you very well might take the skills of governing and and you know asserting authority and asserting power that you learned in the demographic democratic tumult of of the city and apply it to polities that expected hierarchy and expected and in fact could not function without like monarchical domination and then the second half of the chapter is actually funny in a way because the entire thing is a argument that the god damn it. I hate gotta say they're the toughest languages for me or the mesoamerican ones the lakala the guys who helped cortez the tri. The tribe who when cortez showed up with his vagaband bond of spaniards fought him a number of times kept getting killed and then decided to ally with him to overthrow the aztecs.

I know you can write it that doesn't help me. I can read the writing. It doesn't tell me how to say it. I'm literally looking at the word. Here this does not help having it written here spelled the same way. It's not a spelling issue. It's a pronunciation issue so the whole gist of this second half of this chapter is grab girl making an argument and that rather than being over awed by the power of the spaniards or supernaturally suborned by a belief that they were gods or something. That is like often assumed to be the case that that this tribe decided collectively and democratically to ally with cortez and that we and that and they point out that we have records you know from only a few generations later describing the deliberations that went on among a people who were fundamentally governed by democratic. means similar in in most respects at least described to europeans in a way that they recognized as like classic athenian democracy and it is kind of funny that in this book that's supposed to be lauding the virtues of democratic deliberation. that the one example we have so far of a decision that has come to democratically as opposed to a process that might bring about democratic decisions is the decision to ally with the spaniards to essentially destroy pre-columbian mexican civil and mexican civilization that's pretty funny mexico talaxia gluckon all right.

I'm gonna avoid saying it. That's the way I'm gonna get around this. Like the whole thing is like look these guys. They didn't have a king. They weren't on they were they were self-contained democratic agents who came together in a in a spirit of equality to come to democratic conclusions about questions of state. They weren't. They didn't have anybody tell them what to do and in in that process they decided to help literal demons like monsters pretty funny and it does raise. Some questions. You know about like. I mean at the end of the day.

What is the benefit of this democratic model is it the outcomes it comes to or is it that even if you make bad decisions that way there are decisions that are broadly understood to have been collectively made and therefore we can deal with the outcome of bad decisions because we're not riven against one of ourselves. The way we are you know in our fake democracies where things keep getting worse and even though we have democratic systems allegedly and a democratic voice we never feel like we have anything to say about why things happen and so therefore we have to search for scapegoats and places to sublimate our impotence and just slowly and steadily just termite like destroy the interior internal like cultural support structures for democracy. So this part of the chapter grab grow. They describe how this civilization carried out a like a public political. deliberative process had um had a political class. People who you know stood for public office but were essentially hazed into it so that it would discourage the glory seekers and the and the prima donnas and the and the cynics and frauds and the sophists from trying to claim power because you'd had to really want to do it for its own sake to put up with the public ritual humiliation that politicians were required to go through and honestly. I gotta say that is a good idea that should come back there should be real like penitential trials that you should have to go through in order to make any attempt to claim governing authority on behalf of anyone else and this is honestly why I really do think that elections in general are wildly overrated and I i think that a functioning a truly functioning democratic polity that of course had abolished class rule.

This is the important thing would not have elections because elections are how what you do to mask class rule elections are a ritual you perform to validate class rule and to confirm its its power over the land and its necessity. I think if that it was abolished if there was not that constant conflict and tension within each person and between each person that is generated by class rule that you would not need. Stupid-ass elections you know you'd have any any position that is technical would be done by someone who had technical expertise in it and any questions where you just basically need somebody to function as a as a decision point like in an algorithm like a having you need somebody to say yes or no to a question sortion baby picking names out of a hat lottery. Somebody says though imagine the selective pressures hazing our political cast would produce today. Marjorie taylor green would end up god queen.

I don't think so I I guess it means what you mean by hazing. I don't mean like people saying. I mean apparently for the talk collins they would like get politicians out in public and everyone would just insult them or insult them and scream at them and call them bad names and and basically read them for filth as the kids say but that would not work now. That's not a effective hazing. Now. When when any attention is like gamma radiation to the hulk it has to it would have to be unpleasant. It would have to be something that a a pleasure seeker a glory hound would not want to experience and the people the thing about the thing that combines basically everybody in our political class now is that they are all doing it because they think it's a good time. They think it's fun and they think that it it's validating. I mean did you guys know about how like both mgt. I don't know about mgt.

But I know that lauren bobert and candace owen and a bunch of other right-wing politicians and influencers. all signed up for like one of those scam mall modeling agency companies that like promises to get you work and modeling if you like paying for head shots or something only for like actors. They just want to be. They want to be famous. They want to be actors but they don't have the talent or the looks to do it. Politics is a cheat code. I can tell you. I was able to carve out a career in the quote. Entertainment industry broadly pursued because I didn't have to rely on my what comedic abilities or my my intellectual bona fides. I was able to ride the wave of a interest in politics and articulate a political perspective and that does so much of the work that would otherwise have to be done by the luck of your birth and then you know residually your talent and so these people they all went through the back door. They went through the people who are like the rest of us just lobotomized by our most basically implanted instincts towards pleasure.

They would flee. They would be horrified. I mean. I don't know what it would have to be. Though like I said insulting them wouldn't work. They love that it's a tension maybe that's it they would have to go like a year without social media or like public appearance before they could apply for to run for anything can you imagine one of these people doing that can you imagine all these people not telling everybody what they a day let alone a year but I gotta say though when it comes when it comes to this description of the talaqaala I have to.

I can't accept fully the grab grow argument about them because they're honestly too sketchy about the political economy of their civilization like they talk about how they have these you know democratic assemblies and stuff. But as they point out the thing. This reminded europeans of was athenian democracy which of course we know is only possible because of slavery. Now we know that these the talkings were basically the only so unsubjugated tribe in this area that was not under some sort of colonial relationship to the aztecs and in fact had to carry out like ritual warfare with the aztecs where they essentially had to sacrifice a number of their warriors every year to their dark rituals in tituan and according to the aztecs of course. That's why they were free is because they were essentially like free-range chickens like it was. It was easier. They were essentially part of the aeros tech polity but it was much less of a hassle to just let them do their own thing and then whenever you needed to go in and pluck out. Some warriors that you need because the thing is runs on human blood literally and of course you know that suggests that since these are you know people who would define themselves in opposition to aztec culture. Very well. Might eschew all elements of aztec domination and I think this gets to an important thing that grab grow point out throughout.

This book is that these models of egalitarianism do not spring up out of nowhere. They don't spring up from nature because they're very clear that they don't think there is a egalitarian state of nature in early early humanity. I would disagree I mean at a certain point. It breaks down but I do think you don't get tribal human society without enforced egalitarianism at some point especially for the simple fact that anything else cannot be enforced really because of the ability of anybody to move and leave the inability to enforce any kind of like real authority over anybody else. But anyway their argument is is that these models of egalitarianism emerge due to contact with hierarchical structures. Society is emerging you know deifying warriors and and creating hierarchies and ritually reaffirming them through violence and those who are disaffected by that life flee to the margins and then reconstruct a social order that is defines itself in opposition to all of those things because as outsiders they see the the repellent features that are laundered by the the cultural scheme.

 the rituals that sanctify it or sometimes you have the opposite like in the last chapter. They talked about how early egalitarian urban centers in mesopotamia had little warrior kingdoms sprout out in their periphery where you have the opposite thing happening people repulsed by the effeteness and and and lack of martial vigor. among settled people sitting in their you know giant warehouse. temples writing in cuneiform about how many you know vials of of olive oil or mud or whatever are. Gonna go from one place to another and not out. There you know red and tooth and claw that other thing that is like you know part of the human animal. The the need to the need to seek and dominate and hunt you know that that needs to be synthesized into a you know a settled relationship to the world around you. But the form that that takes varies greatly on who you grew up around and so their model for how egalitarian structures are created and sustained essentially requires this dialectical relationship with other power structures. Other political economies problem is now though where we live.

There is no alternative. There's no space anywhere else there's no where outside yet anyway. I think the one thing I think by the end of this book one thing that I think we're going. I'm going to agree with with grab grow here is that if we're going to build alternatives to this death spiraling capitalism it's going to be in geographic temporally fixed places outside of it and of course. The bad news though is that the places that are going to be outside of it are only going to be outside of it because of a tactical retreat by capitalism. A a decision to cut off the limb like somebody with diabetes sawing off their feet and creating essentially post-apocalyptic landscapes and if anything is going to emerge contrary to this it's going to be. There the problem is is that it's going to be all those places the people in them. The people who will be in them are people who have still have been shaped by the conflicts and the the categories of that global capitalism and that's a challenge and it has it's going to have to be resolved and the thing that will resolve it. I think like at the truest level will will just be the yeah the the will towards survival because some people are going to come to the realization.

That's that cooperation in such a context is the only real way to secure survival and that that alternative capitalism might never have anything to do with the destruction of capitalism. The overthrowing of capitalism which would collapse from within through its own contradictions until the entire globe is you know. This massive junkyard covered with people sifting through wreckage and trying to build things out of it and then you know a couple of people. A couple of dead bodies with like ethernet cords jammed in the back of their heads because they thought they were downloading their consciousness into a macbook and then like one factory left that just keeps perfecting and releasing like synthetic versions of a spicy crispy chicken sandwich because if you look at capitalism right now the only place of where you see any innovation or any move towards the sort of competitive you know winnowing towards perfection that we're supposed to get out of the out of the competitive capitalist economy is in treats and honestly specifically spicy chicken sandwiches.

There's so many different ones. There's so many ones you can try so it really does feel. Like this is a machine designed to make chicken sandwiches not to not to sustain people. Nutritionally. No no no no just to make the chicken sandwiches so yeah in a situation where the last people after are these These muskite freaks who walled themselves off from humanity and tried to merge with their computers before you know a dog came along and nod the plug out of the wall or whatever and then they just and then just the last expressions of the machine algorithm which has never been able to get beyond the profit motive and and the consumer society that it is premised on and he's just shooting out spicy. Chicken sandwiches well the people left try to scratch something new out of it. I'm seeing as that's to me.

That's that's enough hope to keep going that's enough hope to obviate any argument about what's the point because obviously if you're alive and keep living. You don't really believe that you just have decided to ascribe to you're the most narrowly selfish idea of why you know pile up pleasurable experiences basically Of course you know that doesn't work and it destabilizes over time and you have to you know keep going more extreme in order to get the same experience. but you know for most people if they're in the early in the in their you know adult early adulthood they're definitely. They're not anywhere near that you know they're still very much able to scrape together enough dopamine to keep going. But you know maybe there's more and the to me. The the fact that you know they're always going to be people. They're always going to be trying to live and the the matu.

The grinding gears of material history are going to continually disrupt their relationship to their environment in such a way that settled delusions settled um like mal practices. Social malpractices cannot be sustained and they will eventually be destroyed without any revolution. Like that's the thing you don't have to yeah like there is no revolutionary context in the current moment. There's we don't have revolutionary subjects because the working class is no longer a subject of history as it was in the 20th century that means that someone else some other human formation is going to have to do that work of cobbling all this together of of taking the technological capacity that we've accumulated which is the real. legacy of you know that building of forces of production is is technological capacity and wielding it collectively in dialogue with the natural world rather than in sort of a ritualized denial of its existence okay.

So that's that chapter kind of a short one self-contained the next chapter for next week. Probably friday maybe thursday we'll see is. I think this is going to be a spicy and interesting one chapter 10 why the state has no origin the humble beginnings of sovereignty bureaucracy and politics. Now we're gonna. I think finally gonna get to grab grow making an actual argument for well all right if agriculture didn't cause human hierarchical social relations and property relations and urban life didn't do it. If both those things are compatible with democracy in a real sense well where the did it go why did the why did kings take over. So this will be interesting this because I think now we're finally going to get to a to a claim. We can sink our teeth into dawn of everything by grab. Grow is the book for those asking chapter 10 for next week.

History is happening is the thing folks and when history is happening all of your all of the rosary worrying feel theoretical. That you spend your time with kind of goes away and the question becomes vital. The problem is is that if you're relatively you know like as you said history is happening but of course not evenly not equally distributed. There. The waves are are buckling through the thing but they're they're being felt to different intensities in different places so like we can feel the wave coming. But what do we do with ourselves not in an abstract sense because that can never lead to anything that can always just be avoidance really of the question because there's nothing we can do at that level but we have to do something every day of our goddamn lives and we're all in awareness that our relationship to our material world is not stable and that means we have to act. But the more we phrase this in well. What can.

I do politically to change the trajectory of this. I mean that is really an abdication and I'll admit completely that like I am that's why. I care i. I pay attention to politics certainly. That's why my gaze first cast itself to the political level when I was unsatisfied with my life and the trajectory of everyone's life. As I could see it was well who can I vote for or you know what door can. I knock on to to make this change good. I think what we've found is that well we can still act on that level. We can vote we can could knock on doors. We can do that we sure should should not invoke devote too much time intellectually or especially and even more importantly emotionally to it because the real questions are closer to home. But the answers are close to home too which means that talking about this level of of you know praxis is very difficult in the social media realm because as I've said before like you're constrained you can't talk about political action that might be like meaningful like forget. If it's gonna actually do anything existentially meaningful in a way that voting and rooting for a party just can't be because it's not legal and even the stuff that is political like what election like elections and who to support and what door to knock on the ones.

That matter are happening at the local level at the very grassroots level which means discussion of them. In the social media. Realm will always be flattened to be about questions that are not applicable generalized concepts and abstractions that have nothing to do with the questions that the people actually working on this specific campaign or what have it have you have to answer like the amazon workers who organized their staten island facility. Like they what they pointed to when describing like where they got their ideas for how to organize and and and where they got you know the where they found their priorities.

It was not online. It was stat a warehouse essentially a modern-day logistical factory who aren't allowed to go to the bathroom and can't pick when they work if you're outside of that process. If you're a politically engaged person on the internet. How are you supposed to intervene in those questions you're not having to go to not go to the bathroom you're not having your work determined by others in that specific way. The only thing you can bring to the question are abstractions are our ideas of like abstract principles like I see after the amazon announcement after the vote people were like like. I can't wait for them to be anti-imperialist. You know it's like they very well might end up. You know radicalized until into you know a a anti-imperialist. praxis where they're like doing solidarity strikes with you know people in other countries and stuff. They might have that happen but it'll only be after they get.

Bathroom breaks for christ's sake if you start with anti-imperialism which is what a lot of people want to do because they tell themselves it's the most important thing and in one sense it is but in terms of an individual american citizen's ability to affect it the least important thing which is why it's so fixated and fetishized by some because they have no responsibility over it because there's nothing they can do about it really what's going to determine if they decide to do. Anti-imperialism is not going to be that a lot enough of them read a post about it or saw a meme it'll be because of other conditions occurring it'll because of material conditions. Changing and radicalization occurring in other sectors that they then would connect to and I honestly see a situation where an amazon union decides you know what it's worth it. It's worth challenging the law and our bosses and risking what we have and and the gains we have made through collective bargaining to make this international stand.

I can see them making that decision but it would be because of conditions that I cannot imagine or anticipate conditions created by the rapid deterioration and transit trans. Formation of material conditions and then people might apply some stuff. They saw in in the ether to the question but what's going to decide their answer is not going to be theoretical. It's going to be their recognized self-interest whether or not they adhere it to other people in other lands and I can see that happening because the thing that prevents it from happening is faith that this order can provide something and that faith is being dissolved before our very eyes. What do you think everybody going absolute feral right means. I mean yes.

It's not because we don't have politics. It's nihilistic but it speaks to a greater lack of any faith in any institution and that means that like the calculus that buys off labor traditionally in the united states also changes because like you said like the the context where business unionism overtook the american labor movement. I mean obviously you have you know the the state jihad of the second red scare that like actually put a social and professional cost to adhering to you know radicalism that didn't exist during the popular front era of world war one or world war ii um but also the fact that this american state this you know capitalist behemoth that yes had collapsed under its own contradictions in the 20s. In the late 20s. Early 30s had risen like a phoenix and provided a vision of utopian horizons of course for white workers that goes without saying. But I guess you still gotta say it and that that had a huge impact. But but that's I would say that if you want to understand how why our political tribe our political class is so manifestly incompetent like at their jobs you know like they're doing a bad job of their jobs.

In addition to you know being corrupt and doing because the state does have an interest in maintaining some leverage vis-a-vis private industry you know because from the long term the state is necessary for both so it is in the best interest of the state to provide a certain degree of functionality. But it does not and one of the big reasons is is that even the most sincere people in governance have not and cannot process the real implications of declining living standards over the last four years because they came into politics all of them because they're all million years old in the and their understanding of political institutions where political authority is derived.

All of the like propagandized ideological stuff the the infrastructure of their mental world that define things like their self-interest. Their understanding of their relationship to their country and their party and the governing structures in the state were defined by that post-war bonanza and they of course because they have only gone up and up and up have still have the same relationship to those institutions that they did when they were younger but that an entire generation is now coming. has now lived where those um those systems of legitimacy patterns of legitimate rituals of legitimation have just been drained of everything.

I mean they really did cut the copper out the copper wiring out of the building and they had they don't know that and they can't know that they cannot process it. And that's why the democrats are just watching as the republican party like coalesces into this. counter like this hostile internal regime that has fully assimilated the corruption and insufficiency and worthlessness of our institutions and is fully willing to abolish them and has not done anything even though it is absolutely in their power to minimize. The worst of their you know designs on the institutions because they think everybody sees these things these structures. These rules these symbols and sees them as legitimate because they see them as legitimate and the asymmetry in part comes from the fact that yes most republicans and certainly political class republicans are rich. Just like democrats are and have benefited from 

You know the imperial state at its apogee and are still hanging around on on the fat of it even as it's declining so they shouldn't be alienated materially from from you know the modern state but they have been systematically alienated from it. Culturally in a way. Liberals aren't so they feel like they're losing even though they've been winning their whole lives because in order to stabilize itself in order to integrate the new demographics of capitalism that needed to be brought into its system. The new consumers that needed to be appealed to capitalism had to adopt a a formal structure of tolerance. A culture of tolerance which pleases of like pleases liberals to death liberal elites. These like armenians these little these little descendants of the of pilgrims.

These little freaky calvinists who need to believe themselves to be good people to believe themselves to be worthy of election and and for what good people means acting with charity in the world and acceptance and all these good values in the world they've been working. You know overtime for this for the last 60 years and so they're happy to see it and they're cheering it on and that's why since they're not materially or culturally alienated from the culture and it's superstructures. They still think that everybody around them has the same reference for their institutions meanwhile through the looking glass. The reactionary right ruling class the the old line puritans the real. The true calvinists the ones who the ones who executed john ober felt or whatever the his name was in 1860 or in 16 what 28 21. I think 21 right before the 12 year cease. 12 year truce was ended in the netherlands who believe that you are elect because you are lacked and that therefore hierarchies are naturally created. Therefore god inspired have been steadily alienated from the cultural space for the last 40 50 years and so in alliance with people farther down on the totem pole than them who are both culturally and materially alienated from the system. They will do their best to knock it down all right. I think that's enough for today next week as I said chapter 10.

People are apparently. It's your people are doing a bit when you're asking what the name of the book is dawn of everything. But why are they alienated don't they have it. All. Everyone in a class society is subject to a fundamental alienation like a a split within the self because we relate to strangers through a veil of either and you and not either or in a combination of both resentment and pity guilt basically. We are uneasy with our fellow man and can't be otherwise because we look them in the eye and we know we either know that they that we toil for their benefit or they toil for ours and that has to be that psychic break has to be soothed. Somehow distracted from rationalized and our cultural rituals seek to rationalize them and affirm them and validate them. But it doesn't go away and all of the travails we go through life happen in this context and the pain that we feel the resentment. The alienation that is like processed otherwise you know through interpersonal lens. All is also being reflected through this prism as well and so even the people at the very top of the totem pole are fundamentally miserable and alienated. They'll tell you themselves how unhappy they are. It's just a question of where they put that on happiness liberal rich liberal people are going to look put into themselves. That's why they're all in therapy. That's why they're all fixated on on perfecting the self through acts of charity yes and political virtue but also self cleansing and healing and and Yoga and and unwinds goop exists for these people and so they try to purify themselves of the thing that they feel the that fundamental breach conservatives to write reactionaries blame the other the outsider and seek to punish them and subjugate them. For this feeling.

At least the ones who do politics that's what their politics psychologically is is powered by of course. What it's really powered by is their self-interest which is of course all this stuff but tied to the maintenance of their material position which is what they seek first and foremost to to protect and here's the thing and here's the reason that so here's the situation you've got these two halves of a ruling class right. They're both operating out of these completely distinct reality worlds and so there this is a clash of ideas right and and when we see politics it is this idealist clash. But what is happening well they're legislating and and and speculate while people are legislating and debating and and organizing along these these camps. They're also seeing to their material interests and while the cultural stuff they do is in conflict and in fact that conflict defines politics the stuff they do for their material interests aligns in the same direction at a deep enough level like their sectoral conflict once again whoever you know has more money more influence. Maybe some better lobbyists win there but at the baseline level it's all aligned and there's nothing there to conflict with it.

There's nothing there to challenge it working class used to challenge it. That's why the politics of the 20th century were the way they were. But it's no longer there to provide a challenge and so it goes unchallenged and it as conditions deteriorate and they cannot adapt to those conditions to secure the legitimacy of the systems they just get undermined and destroyed and the people in the political realm fight even harder to try to win to try to resist the the pull towards oblivion or at the very least punish. Those responsible but the whole time their actions are deepening the whole yes and that is why I really do believe that the challenge to this thing will come outside of it will become will come in the realms that have been surrendered to nature by capitalism and that only in that space where even the technological structures of compulsion are no longer running. can people start building something different something that maybe maybe brings together all of the necessary progressive developments both technologically and culturally and ideologically and conceptually and and brings them together and the thing that's going to bind it together is going to be some new spiritual conception. I am very convinced of that what it will be. I don't know zen sunnism who knows a spiritual answer is going to be a cope for material realities well yes but like if material realities get bad enough that you can't depend on.

You know the supply chain to give you your nutrient slurry when you have to live on your own. Then coping becomes surviving coping becomes organizing coping becomes living collectively to literally cope with your conditions. I.e survive them and perhaps thrive in them. It'll be cool whatever it is and it'll probably rule the galaxy. In like ten thousand years. Twenty thousand years hell maybe a hundred thousand years don't get don't you you don't wanna get ahead of yourself hell. Sometimes. I think it's going to be based in juche because like what polity in the world is best suited to deal with like really really bad. Climate change like say climate change is as bad as your worst predictions of it and obviously not like the thing where we turn into venus because but like where it like fundamentally disrupts all of our it ends the world as we know it basically and everything gets resolved. Gets brought down to barbarism what will be the most resilient polity how is it not north korea. I mean where it is. It's probably not going to get the worst of climate change right pretty far north.

It's not like cuba god bless cuba but they're cooked. They're. north korea up there a little armpit snows and they've got this you know This hermit kingdom up there that under like a in a real crisis. I mean hell it's not like those people have a lot of You know addictions to treats to that that could like alienate them from everything as as real hunger sets. In they've survived horrifying famines before including in the early 90s. maybe those emerges like the one of the few areas of human organization to make to sustain itself to emerge from the like equilibrium that eventually is established and then they hook up with other people who have survived individually and those other people are able to You know interact with the north koreans and and their ideas are like changed by relationship and contact with these new people but like their shared interest in cooperating to survive works through the system and basically does the job of resolving political conflicts and so then you know the the human.

 the synthesized human civilization that does conquer you know the biome in the sense of creating a stable technologically mediated equilibrium with it then conquers the stars. I don't know sometimes. I think my money is on cephalopods like it's not even human beings. It's intelligent. it's intelligent octopi but even if it's even if it's octopuses. It's still us okay maybe crows that would also be cool all right next week with chapter 10 bye-bye you.
