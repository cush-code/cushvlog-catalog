It's time to soy face folks. We're so facing are you guys. On let me check always got check the twitch to make sure you're streaming correctly. It looks like it's time looks like it's happening. Oh there we go hi everybody I'm in my name my living room because it is kind of crummy out. Little blow cold a little chilly hanging out on the couch. I'm sewing it up on the couch trying to keep my knees out of you. I don't want to distract everyone with my erotic energies. I don't want everyone to get all riled up when they see my scabs knobby toddler. A sneeze. This is actually not a hot couch at all. It's a very comfortable cool couch. It's not very big but it gets the job done. So today I figured we were gonna take the take the pedal off the metal. A little bit and just groove. Just gonna have a groovy chat sesh no real agenda. Today yeah. I said yesterday if anyone's got any cool questions about history or maybe popular culture. We could chop them up a little bit trying to stay trying to stay grounded trying to knock that wood oh. This is a better angle anyway perfectly.

Kismet gaming is grilling if you don't if the gaming is grilling if you don't get angry while you're doing it. I guess or bored yeah because think about it like if you're gaming if you're not bored. You're emotionally invested to a degree of anger right if you're just zoned out that can't be good but you should be building. Some sort of skill set is the idea you should be actually producing something. That's the whole point presumably I mean I think gaming could like kind of give you a 'but sub mind. But you're gonna have to actually build something. You're gonna have to have contribute to the world even if it's just that the thing of scrimshaw like serving a little wooden man at first whatever it is. I don't know I don't know what the kids do. Whatever it is. It has to be three-dimensional and then eventually you can get so good at like putting putting like meaning into action that you can go back to gaming and it can be part of your practice. But the problem at the beginning is it's too frictionless. Gaming is too frictionless. It's just like it's just like yelling on the Internet. It's frictionless there has to be friction and that and I mean that a literal sense like an item like crafting an item or preparing an item anything but yeah so if you guys have any let's let's chop.

It up on some I'm some fun miss Teresa history and and history stuff and whatnot I got to find out why those little why those little guys exist. I'm assuming those microstates all exist because somebody made some blood oath to the Pope in the Middle Ages or something or they like decided to help to hide the Holy Grail. I don't know I don't know enough. I don't know enough about art to say well. My favorite painter is I'd have to think about it. I was one of those dorks in high school whose favorite painting was Nighthawks because I didn't I didn't have any friends I people that's the the I would like to talk a little bit about this.

The 1619 project thing I I will admit that I haven't read it so I'm not going to talk about what it specifically says I will just make an if-then statement. If the conclusions of that or if the drive and point of the 1969 teen project are to claim that the conditions of American capitalism at the in the present moment are inextricably linked to to racism at the point of leverage that I don't think that that's very helpful and I think it's wrong and it explains why it got. You know all these awards from the Ford Foundation and you know corporate America because if the if the point you're trying to make is that racism and capitalism are inextricably linked at the point of fusion. Then each one is as fixable as the other right the degree to which you fight defeat racism. A concept that doesn't have a material form is the degree to which you defeat capitalism but that doesn't work because racism is in the ideal realm. You can only fight the things that generate racism which are material material like significant concentrated racially coded material distribution disadvantages. That's the only way that you reduce the racism end they they are inextricably bound. They are like a DNA helix but one came first one was generative. One is built on top which and one can be moved and that's always the case with any of these issues and the one that can be moved his capital because it's actually material and you can move it. You cannot move racism because it doesn't exist anywhere but in the minds of men and women and in the reified structures that they create so you have to unreal fie the structures to get rid of the feelings.

So I say about 1916 as if that's the point it's making and a lot of people seem to think it is if they are right. Then I gotta give it the old push mom thumbs down now of course. It's hard to make that argument because all the people who hate it the most are conservatives who just hate it because it applies. America isn't good as this as though that were a concept that made sense in the first place a country being good. That's not possible. It's it's it's it's equality that cannot be imbued on that level of definition.

Any more than a channel change or it can be good or bad. Structures aren't made up of people but they aren't people so they should not be judged morally and so that's why they hate it. It's like no you're getting rid of my beautiful myth of America and of course. The beauty of that is if America is perfect or good and there's this concentrated disadvantage in resources for black people. Then I guess it's not the fault of the country is. It does a good country wouldn't let that happen I wonder whose fault it is. It's literally just that's also deflecting from the material world. Both of them are ricocheting backwards but like I said I don't know if that's what's in there. I have to say the fact that the one of the authors of the thing is on Twitter right now doing like meltdown threads about 10,000 follower like semi anonymous accounts for people who aren't even check marked that indicates like I've said before a lack of confidence in the foundations of your intellectual underpinning. You should not be doing that if you really believe in what you're saying I mean if you think that there's if somebody is being disingenuous you can point out a line of reasoning but like that kind of dragging indicates that at a certain point you're not really you're not really sure of what you're not really sure what you're saying is right. So I have people are asking me specific stuff.

As I have no idea. I just know that that there is a cut that things can be intertwined intertwined at the basic level but there's still a causal relationship between the two. There's a base and superstructure relationship. Even if they're fused. The only thing that breaks them is the change in material conditions. No matter what now that material condition change might because might become because things change enough in the firmament to push them. But that's always started with the material change always.

It's like it seems like a lot of these people who want to incorporate you know the new length the new the new scholarship on American slavery. The challenges the notion that it was somehow in conflict with capitalism. They want to take that as an excuse to reify racism into a social material force which you will never be and that confuses things it makes it harder to fight against the cause of racism. Eric Foner's book is good. I've heard yeah Shelby Foote. Like the guys he was a hell of a writer has there ever been an example of the social of a government stopping or preventing a socialist revolution without implementing some of their policies like yeah. I mean countries have revolutions when the when this when the symmetry between providing needs for the people and being like perceived as the legitimate source of those needs become completely friction completely broken and so a socialist revolution is just pressure of material discontent. Material discontent must be addressed and he can call a social. It can be socialist reforms but it will be addressed but through collapse and war which reduce the amount of capital and therefore redistributed or through a revolutionary or through revolution or through steadiest studies and slow reforms.

The global South is the mirror image of the global north in a lot of ways in that they are materially disadvantaged to such an extent that they can't grow the sort of mobilized base of people who have enough alienated leisure time to effectively push against capitalism. The same way we have an insufficient a number of people who can connect that a number of people or we'd have an insufficient mechanism for connecting those people to everyone else. I think people like Graham she to the degree that Graham sees insights about superstructure have been taken by people who have bad faith and people who are kind of mystified by being on the internet for too long that because that superstructure comes first and that's wrong and so people get angry at Gramsci because they blame him for everyone taking his emphasis on simple structure and turning it around. But it's not necessarily his fault. It's just that we now live in a symbolically rich era of cynical and pseudo ritualization of politics and so it's very easy to take the inside of Gramsci and just immediately frictionlessly move over to be like oh that means the superstructure comes first.

We should be arguing on the plane of ideas and that's where the real thing is no and we should be arguing about culture and Marvel movies do change the world. No no he was describing a reality now you're living in it. That's whatever happens. That's the nightmare of history that we recorded the debt. The history of all dead generations ways like a nightmare in the brains of the living. What that means is that we are all living in the in the dreams and ideas of dead generations so like Gramsci observes the reality of superstructure. The situation changes things shift now we live in us in a society where the economy has become so abstracted into simples and that means that the culture has become so abstracted into symbols that now we have every reason to believe and we have to push against the presumption that politics is subpar and so we put. We put Gramsci's name on that condition. But it's he's not his fault. He just pointed it out we're living in his nightmare.

The respect economy is as strong as ever thank God even in the even in the horrors of the corona. Maelstrom the respect economy stays strong I still respect you guys you respect me the respect economy. The flow continues. We don't need any kind of stimulus over here. It's a bull market well respect from Belfast. Everyone Sofia right accent that's Korea well that just sounded Scottish terrible sorry awful. I realized now I've been terrible teased the whole time you guys were all right. I sucked there's still kind of funny sometimes but ya know terrible at accents. It was absolutely self delusion that I thought it was doing well. He's come town in cahoots with Sam tide to bring Nazism into America. I highly doubt it that's as much as I could say about any anything outside of myself. I highly doubt it oh right yeah. Everyone loves well. I don't know what Jack sent you mean you mean the real one. I think that's why I like doing accents. Even though I'm terrible at them is because I think I have one of the least appealing American accents the high nasal twang of the Upper Midwest. Just everything pushed through the top of the nose awful. The Upton Sinclair episode I recorded on Sunday night and it should be coming out on Thursday. I would say that the Byzantines are a good comparison for us slow steady decline in the face of expanding regional competition. It gets close that my accent gets close to the Canadian accent but because we're not all Scottish we never got the aboot. McIntyre ass country. Just a plaid ass country just a bunch of Highlanders playing hockey.

What am I gonna game I'm not sure maybe we can get the gaming rig going in the office and if we can't I'll do that. But I really don't have the capability in my place to do gaming at all. I don't have a rig or the system. I don't have a I don't even have a thing and we have a really great gaming rig in the office. I just really want to play but it's gonna be up to everyone else because I don't know the specs to set it up. I don't know how I'm gonna play. I've said that I thought that Katamari Damacy would be a good starting point because a game that is a low challenge level so that could be immersive without becoming upsetting allowing for conversation and you know I don't want to just like get too fixated. I've heard of Duncan Trussell if he's good I never I don't listen to his podcast or anything oh yeah.

Somebody's asking about the potatoes I love talking about the potatoes I love talking about the pain is if the peasants are as Marx described a sack of potatoes. How do you explain the hundreds of peasant revolts throughout history well. It's not the act of the revolt. It's the it's the it's the goal of the revolt I mean there been revolts in all socials for gibbous. There's been revolts throughout every strata of social domination in every organized society in history. Revolts are only meaningful if they are effective. They're only effective to which they're coordinated their only coordinated to the degree to which they represent a singular will which is the a class acting for itself on its own. Behalf and peasant revolts tended not to operate that way. They were because the peasant life highly regionalised and they were usually based on the idea of complaining to the king about the excesses of local Lords or vice versa. They were appealing to an authority that they had an inherent belief in if they if there were bad Lords or a bad king. They needed to be replaced by good Lords and a good king that is not a class that could overthrow a a class mode of production. So that's the difference because when they get together they're just a bunch of people who are pissed off at something.

There are not people who are pissed off at specific exploiters of their labor because it's been because it isn't exploited directly and more importantly they don't communicate together. A common experience and like peasant revolts are essentially free quakes of the crisises that are going to break down futile futile ISM or any other social order. They're like the the like you have the friction like you can cut. It's like this isn't this isn't causally true but it is descriptively true that you can take a significant friction a breakpoint in history and you can see the ripples go forward and backward and so peasant society revolts our progressive forces and that they're bringing contradictions to the top but they will not be the basis for a new order that will be anything other than transitional so. That's that's the argument there. I mean Maoism in the United States is hilarious because we are of course reap s enticed we are we've been turned into peasants as I've said but instead of being potatoes in a sack we are now the Pringles because we are now essentially symbolized. Peasants we've been run through the capitalist machine spit out the other end as as as as symbolic peasantry which means that we still have the same degree of discombobulation and lack of ability to coordinate as medieval peasants. But now we have been socially isolated so that we could we can't form the social bonds that make peasant organization possible because what what the class process was according to Marx was a dynamo whereby the the notion of a social self that the peasant class has is pulled by the need for new sustenance to the cities that turns the people in the cities who work in industry into people who are aware of class become. A class cow a class project and then take over because they're trying to impress that notion of a social self on to a capitalist system that doesn't allow for a social self. They're trying to reassert those values. But now we're so far from the peasant world. We got press through the mandolin of you know settler colonialism and capitalism. Now we are physically spread so that we don't have a social baseline to try to get back to through organization. We might want we might say we want Medicare for all we might say we want to end cess. The FASTA. We might say that we want to you know break up the banks or or nationalize Amazon but to what social ends we don't have social ends because our social lives are so atomized. We can only think in terms of capitalist capitalist value systems.

Capitalist reward systems and so something has to intervene but with this dynamic for it to change medieval Catholic heresy. Oh there's a lot of good ones I'm trying to think the Cathars are obviously really fun. Everyone loves the Cathars I like the Lollards just a bunch of guys lollygagging around and you gotta love those Hussites cuz. They were. You we're gonna keep fighting. All heresies. In the middle era are Catholic heresies all heresy before the establishment of Protestantism. His Catholic heresy. What else is it is not having space for serial life and material grievance. Yes. It is because you cannot have a spiritual life and left you unless you have enough unalienable and what this capitalist system is doing now the lay capitalist like late-stage eating the bone sucking the bone out of the marrow stealing the copper wiring stage is doing to everyone at every level is there grinding out unalienable to at different rates and to different people so like right now. As I said we have the people inside and the people outside the people inside are having alienated time out the wazoo where they have nothing to do but worry about stuff that's out of their control and try to distract themselves with zum meetings and Netflix and clapping and making banners or whatever people on the outside. Their alien their time is so alienated by the need to be working that they have no time to be able to be to work towards self in any way in it like any concordance of self with your moment in time in space of course. So yes every spiritual grievance is a material grievance and you have to harness whatever degree combination of things you can to alleviate this the material basis for it.

I'm I'm calm dude kamar than you are the right workweek varies depending on how alienating the labor is. There is no single one in an ideal social order. People would work that a degree that it was rewarding to them and you might say oh that sounds stupid everyone's gonna loll around no they're not not if they are matched to a task that fits them. Everyone has some combination of abilities and self motivation whatever you want to call it to look at a task and complete it without it. Feeling like too much work. Some tasks have high high tolerances for that you know that's why people are willing to eat. Shitty jobs. Those are wildly alienating jobs because even though you could hypothetically find pleasure in cleaning a toilet or something like that it's hard what that means is. You could do it rewarding lis for less time. So a shitty job you should do for less of your time. But more people you might say yeah but would but more people can do that more people together and a job that is that it's not that it's difficult to find rewarding can make that job easy and complete it well jobs that are more rewarding in other ways so that you could do them longer without becoming annoyed with the task. You would have longer work weeks and that funny thing is.

It's like that's the social. That's the central insight of like those kooky like twentieth-century like social credit people. The recognition that not all labor is the same non-elect ivities are the same and therefore they should not be renew marae today in the same forms because like alienated labor that sucks physically it takes a lot of money to make that worthwhile and just so happens to be the work that is rewarded the least materially that is a signal mismatch and like those goofy Social Credit people who like took over Alberta in the 30s I guess with their green shirts. They recognize that but the problem is they didn't have any other part of the puzzle and so they ended up being cranks and that's what cranks really are like every crank movement is somebody who gets some truthful real up thing about the social order that needs to be unkicked but they get fixated and they can't see the forest for the trees like that's every social prank from Lysander Spooner to to Henry George to the sort of the silver shirts. Oh somebody found a xanax while cleaning the room see. The universe rewards is there any so I saying is it better to have a weak Biden as president than Trump to fight them.

I don't know first of all. I don't know how we're gonna fight them that's still to be determined secondly. I don't know if you're fighting them. At that point. I feel like at this point. I mean they're thrown their hands.

Up did you guys see the single most amazing video of the trump presidency in my opinion the one that beats the hamburgers by a factor of a billion. He's in a Honeywell plant pumping out n95 s and some guys a bald security guy or like executive total. Like a guy who looks like one of his flunkies. He look like Keith Schiller is holding up this mask and he's like explaining just how wonderful it is and Trump is standing next to them. Looking about 500 pounds. He looks like a refrigerator in a Joseph a bank suit and he's just looking worse than he's ever did. He oh you can see the lines in the splits spray tan and he's just like pretending to pay attention. This guy and pointing at it like check out this guy and over the speaker is blaring the Guns N'Roses cover of Live and Let Die. It's one of those sublime moments where you realize the totality of the moment you live in like you.

It's a crystallization of every every single factor that has brought us here and it's gonna bring us into the future they've given up on running anything or even pretending that they have the ability to stop people from dying like Trump for his whole presidency. It's like I'm the guy who protects America I make America look at you America's great and just because of me now even he knows. It's not gonna happen at some level. He's like yeah ah you'd expect us to be able to solve anything. No I was there to rile you up one way or the other I was able to keep your Oregon occupied by loving or hating me well. The actual looting of the nation went on underneath my feet so that means that whichever one of these guys is gonna win like the forces that are controlling them are more willing than ever to just display.

Their power naked Lee and give up the fig-leaf of democratic legitimacy and the the gamble. They're gonna be making is that our social atomization has reached a tipping point that can't be recovered from regardless of whether material conditions get terrible enough regardless of how much they give up even attempting to channel our actual concerns and the thing is is that that is a real moment that is the thing like at some point. We will reach a bright a break whereby after that we won't be able to assert any kind of opposition effective opposition to capital that will happen if things don't change the current trajectory that will happen whether we have reached that point or not. I don't know and the only way we're gonna. Know is retroactive Lee when the next big break comes how we respond to.

It will answer the question and so our tasks as little drill pillars or whatever we're doing is to be as ready for that moment as possible when it comes to have developed a daily practice that's as close to the route of responding to that challenge when it appears what should an artist be doing to bring about socialism finding out a way to connect their their art or their abilities. Whatever they have I should never I would never say stop doing art even though the superstructure is meaningless because the fact is you're gonna try. What's gonna realistically happen is you're gonna say Art's not important. Now you're gonna try. Something to do something else that you're not as good at and you're gonna get frustrated and stop you should stay in concordance with your like with where you are. You should challenge yourself though and try to bring your art in alignment with your values to such a degree that you feel the least amount of conflict between them and that's not going to be a huge break. It's this gradual progress process that over time leads to big breaks which is the way that all history works from the micro to the macro but you should but you need to be doing. You need to be recognizing whether your art is having an effect like if you draw a spirograph doodles for example or make really stupid cheesy socialism for the wind buttons or pins for example and you post them online and say look at the little drawing.

I did and you get two likes one of them from your mom. Even if that makes you feel good you probably need to add a little greater. There you need a little throw. A little grit into the works to see what maybe you could be doing. That's a little more effective. A little more reaches people a little more deeply but at every level you start with evaluating what you actually like and then seeing how far you can make that how much you can grind that pleasure against the Wheatstone of like grueling attention to detail yes like the only you have to be at this point.

I don't. I don't think you're a serious analysis of the situation if you have not embraced the whole notion that we are in a terminal crisis but the problem is is that a lot of people don't want to say that because they think it's going to give people an excuse to stop trying and it will like all the black is the excuse for people to give up and what that just means is give up on ever even trying to be happy with themselves on ever trying to be anything other than miserable every moment of their life until they die. That is what they have given up and they want an excuse to do that because they don't know any other way to be and anything that says there's no alternative is giving them excuses just because America has entered a decline phase does not mean as I said the other day that that decline has to be fatally terminal to all institutions and all people it'll be fatal to some combination of institutions and people but it could be arrested and redirected in two different point paths. At any point. It can be intervened with by people acting together so there is no black pill no matter how much you might acknowledge the situation being in a in a crisis moment and so that's the thing that inhibits like that's a perfect example that like a mere fact that inhibits our understanding of the world because some people are gonna use it in bad faith bad faith to others and bad faith to themselves really and then you feel the need to deny that faith that fact no we're not in a decline because you don't want to give you into those bad faith actors. But I'm coming around to the idea that you can only ever defeat bad faith with good faith over time.

Not in a given moment you might get owned you might get owned by somebody who buys your logics you into oblivion. You might lose an argument in some sense that more people think you were wrong than right but over time you will develop the belief in yourself to act with full concentration and conviction. The military aggression question is a good one if America maintains its solvency as a country and this depression is as bad as it looks.

It might be and there is that much material sudden deprivation as there appears to already be oh boy. That's the pressure is gonna have to go somewhere. It's we're either gonna have to go towards our government for letting it happen or some other thing and the Chinese are right there I mean we're totally intertwined with them politically and economically but and technologically but man and they and all of the rare earth metals we use for our missile systems come from them half of our high-tech but you know the European powers of 8 1914 we're worried economically interdependent to I don't know it depends on. It depends on the reaction of the government. It becomes on the degree to which they are. There is a force requiring capital to redistribute if we redistribute us enough that force will be alleviated and and we won't have to go to war with China or like Iran as a proxy for China.

But if that if there is if there is sudden massive deprivation of material conditions in this country there will either be a civil war when we turn that frustration on each other or a war with another country. That is those are the only three options on the table. There's no third there's no third option. There's either dramatic redistribution of resources downward or some breakup of the of the of the political symbolic order at the at the level of the nation state or we all direct that energy on some foreign country. And I think that the set that the Civil War is the least likely because of just how how disparate disparate we are how frankly physically unhealthy. We are we're not in a situation where any of us I mean my god people are losing their. Because they have to have their Buffalo Wild Wings delivered instead of going in to the place to watch eat them in person. How are they going to handle not having any Buffalo Wild Wings.

At all. You know it's funny like dual power. I have kind of scorned dual power notions because it feels so in early to be talking that way. Considering you know the array of power going against us and to call any kind of mutual aid that usually gets tucked away in the category of charity. As anything other than that. I think it could be like categorically unuseful but I'm starting to think that anything that privileges action on the ground is worth supporting even if you might think it's gonna be misdirected. I think people got to do what they think is right as long as it's so like electoral lists stop getting mad at dual power people and let them do their dual power do a power as though stop yelling at electoral lists and calling them suck. Thames mutual laying down of arms and do the thing that you think is right because you think it's right not because you want other people to think that you're the most left or you're. The most correctly left anything that gets you working in the world is worth supporting now that means working in the world that like a lot of people think that to mean like demonstrations no demonstrations are just the first level of symbolic with politics and it's so fair.

It's like better like if it's if. It's just the comparison. If the comparison is just the Internet and a demonstration. The demonstration is better just because it's less abstract and it requires more of your attention and focus. But it's still inferior to anything else and still inferior to anything. That's actually constructive that's why you know things like extinction.

Rebellion are not only dead ends. They're probably entirely. government controlled like there's absolute reason to be totally concerned about like demonstration politics as a model during a crisis like this but anything else that's like getting things to people and building connections is worth trying just so you're in a better position. When material conditions change I read a bunch of derekjjensen when I was in a when I was in like college and he blew my mind yeah. No I read Iran I read a couple of his books and it's like goddamn. This is us its stringent and the thing is is that he's right about a lot. He's right about capitalism like the thing that they're jettison rights assumes is that the current model will just will collapse and lead it to a new Dark Age and that's true and it's like there's no like oh yes but technology will intervene right but technology will also make things more savage and whom it will allow it will allow socially unstable non-viable arrangements to continue beyond their natural life cycle.

But he's also you know of the belief that that that would be preferable to stay there in some sort of barbaric situation and that's not sustainable like the antrum thing no. It's just it's. It's not just that it's wrong to seek it. It's not going to happen people will get annoyed. The human brain will will push against its barriers of ability to create its own environment. So I mean that's one what that is in human nature and the way we know is that there's a Society and they keep building them like everything else. Like they tell they tell you is human nature that's all horseshit.

It's imprinted but but having us having the progress the progressive nature is and you're building on the buildings that were around when you were there you're building in the context of that of that which you existed. When you were. There means that unless you're gonna do some sort of ritualistic communal bring down and maybe you could imprint that at the social level where you like a but Larry in Jihad you're. But I mean if you had a widen if you like if you got enough people to believe at the level of spiritual that they should not build that they should not you know go beyond a certain level of development that would be great that'd be fine if it was if it was stable at that level that would be fine like a lot of systems are like that. That's why there are still undiscovered tribes in the Amazon because they have a social homeostasis.

The problem is that's not everybody so that's why it wouldn't work because you would not be able to keep that because you can say all right everybody at this level of social order. We all have deeply embedded symbolic belief that we can't build stuff but over time even with that things are gonna change. You're gonna have to move ground you're gonna have to give up one well and build a new one and something's gonna develop and time and space are both real and they're gonna imprint on on humans so might as well seek to synthesize technology at a level that can maintain a steady state at the highest point because it contains every energy in the system rather than at a low point which will inevitably lead to instability the accumulation somewhere else and the whole thing explodes again.

See if people are asking about like if a job is useful praxis. If it's doing access useful praxis at that category. No nothing is if you do it. It's all about that question can't be answered. It's whether you're doing it with the right mind. Now that doesn't apply to everything like if you're working for the bush light the Trump White House or CIA or Monsanto. There's no ethical way to be doing what you're doing you know but like at a certain level of abstraction. You can say that about everything is you could say everything is evil but you get to a point where good outweighs evil. Like yeah. You are by being a college professor you are perpetuating a lot of bad systems but you could if you apply yourself with whole harmonies spirit to the job. You could do more good than harm that's impossible at a chop like working at a investment banker or working for the FBI working in any system of like direct control of corporate power because if you concentrate yourself on the job to the best of your abilities you're doing more evil you're just making the evil double of working the job so see if the job you have can possibly be positive in its contribution and then work towards that so that answer is the answer of like canape.

Praxis is is it possible to have praxis there in that in it given its position in the capital structure and can you get it out of it and those are questions that can't be answered by me. What are the odds of an American NDL NDP or Labour Party. I mean it depends on how bad it depends on how bad things get if Biden wins. I think all that energy it goes to some sort of weird hair and folk Republican Party. The big nightmare everyone's been scared of I think that's a real fear and I think it's more likely if Biden wins because unless we're able unless people are able to make them give us enough to prevent a real crisis. The Republicans are gonna respond the only way they can if Trump wins yeah. I think I think the Republic Democratic Party Splinter's in a significant fashion once again. Not sure that's still far away and things will intervene to change the dynamic but that's again if it's not changing but a trump win. I think leads more likely to a splintered Democratic Party. But a Biden win more likely to a a repolarized realigned Republican Party which is worse much worse.

I mean if you feel like your job is worthless. Then you shouldn't do it. If you have the freedom not to I mean if you have to do it because that you don't have alternatives. Then I that's awful and that's the nightmare that we're all trying to avoid and so many of us are caught in and you know you should try your best to take the time you have that's free and like put it to use so that you can counterbalance. The feeling of uselessness you have in your job but if you but I think that doing that will make it give you a better idea of what you could be doing elsewhere and that could be a blue collar job. If you have a white collar one and the thing is you have to shed the inherent belief that that job is better because it's in an office yeah because I mean there probably a lot of people who are working office jobs that they would like less that blue collar jobs that they're doing because they think there's a social stigma to working with their hands and that shouldn't be just as there are people in blue collar jobs who didn't have the educational access to get white-collar jobs that they would find more satisfying than what they're doing a colonial mindset. Wow protesting the DNC yes absolutely I mean what they did is worth protesting and protesting.

I know I just said protesting is symbolic politics but so is a political party in a real sense and so is a political convention. I mean especially a convention my god. That is the most symbolic thing. They don't even have to have them because it's all settled if they've become pure spectacle so of course you know contribute to the spectacle in any way you want. I don't think that's anything wrong with that and if it's directed as at the Democratic Party I think that will be good because they have to be diligent amazed to against the coming crack-up because they're either going to lose to Trump for two straight elections which will cause a huge huge crisis for them. I really think that's gonna happen unless everything gets better and we're not in the hell. A second term of you know a Great Depression in under under the damn cheeto in chief. No that's gonna cause complete breaks or Biden's gonna preside over a austerity. He's gonna be the Bruning of America not Matt the German Chancellor who oversaw the austerity that led to the Nazis taking power either way they need to be dealing to my 'zed for their future D legitimization that they're going to be undertaking. I mean I you know I Bernie trapped out.

I know that it's good to kind of let. This stuff go and I I think people freaked getting really excited about Bernie being put back on the ballot in New York. It's a little sad it's like just give me this one thing and it's like that's all you're getting though and that's pretty. It's it should be sad. It should be a sad moment. But I think we gotta like move past Bernie because he served his purpose. He is marshaled certain forces. He has gotten people arrayed along a certain politics and now that's them to move forward. It's on us to take up Bernie's gotta watch the skies while we watch the neighborhood. But I think that realistically the reason he dropped out is good. They were gonna keep killing people at primaries. I think they were gonna just be like we're gonna keep killing people at these primaries until you drop out and it's like we're not gonna.

Let you win and he started to feel personally responsible like I'm gonna get these people killed but I keep by staying in because that's what the Democrats think like you might think how could these monsters allow this to happen. They blame Bernie you can bring show them all the dead poor workers from Illinois and Florida and Arizona and say how did you let this happen and they say why didn't Bernie drop out. Why did he make us do that and they would have said that about all of it that's them. That's the mind authoritarian mindset. The Mathurin Aryans never take any credit for any violence they do because it's the fault of the victim or someone else. Why did you make this do that let's know that never their fault. So Bernie's just like oh I don't want to be reciting what a few be up at night thinking about people dying because I I stayed in the race and that makes him a mensch and I think he is a mensch but that doesn't mean that we should be unrealistic about where we are Lisa V his chances of being president all right.

If someone's a NEET on quarantine. What kind of job that should they do. I'd say start at something start at whatever you think you could do and it's just shed of like ambition because that's how you defeat yourself. It's like well something that you could get a job doing because like I can't tell you you're not. You have to be the specific NEET in question with the specific life experiences to give them certain interests and abilities to concentrate on certain tasks. You should just try what looks like it could be okay but you have to shed the idea that it has to conform to like well. It's not political enough. I'm not changing the world enough by doing it or it's beneath my educational level or something like that which is what made me for years miserable and I know a lot of other people you need to just start with something. You think you might find something enjoyable about and that you could get a job doing and then you see how that treats you. But you cannot dismiss things because you don't have it can't be anything that you can't if you just made the decision that you've got to get to work. They're like all right I have to leave the house.

Then you cannot make up conditions that require something else. So if that's the conditions then the conditions are what you think you might like and what you can get ah Guns Germs and Steel obviously it's not got. It's not everything it's not correct. But I think it's got a lot of insights and I know that it's something that I've used to put together a lot of my worldview like having read Guns Germs and Steel. The Walter Scheible book that I'm reading feels like you really. They feel like overlapping like historical observations and they click together even if details might be wrong in any level. It's another like building block. It's it's a good book. It's worth. It's worth engaging with as they say now. Hobsbawm is great. Abs ones great but you know ya know. He's good his south korea. The future I mean maybe for some people you know may be on Elysium Wallenstein world systems. You know now that I've now that I'm a like trying to apply. You know these like these concepts to the dialectical concepts to history more world system Syria which used to kind of baffle me a little bit. I kind of got the contours. Now seems very intuitive.

I want to read more about it. I have not heard of the game ultimate general civil war. But that sounds cool socialism is always possible. Socialism is impossible until the last fire burns out because we still have agency the level of socialism will be determined by how much of our material environment has been deemed destroyed. I mean socialism could be two people splitting the last can of Kroger beans or a dying fire the level that was up to us. So when we say oh. We're like yeah we at a certain level. We can't challenge capitalism right now but there will always be a difference a change in circumstances that brings with it a change in our material position to power and that that's something we can we can strive to be ready for that's all. We can do hone our blade and wait and hone and wait and then strike socialism is the deep death of the universe. Yes socialism is. It's likely vision of socialism as a social structure is the end state of like that this is. This is the flash stage before total imminence before the total. The moment when all space and time literally occupy the same area.

What makes something liberal is its presumption of the individual as an untouched prime mover. I would say that's the that's the best definition of liberalism is it started presumption humans as prime movers as rent as opposed to things that are acted upon that would be my definition of liberalism which is what's so funny about combat liberalism. Everyone's favorite mao text because everything in I want to get everybody and I only get people mad at me and there's only a few minutes left before. I sign off but combat liberalism is liberal because it says he's not describing a specific thing. A comrade does he's responding a type of thing that people do that can be applied to anybody in any situation if the reasoning is motivated. It assumes people are operating from first position instead of in a dialectical relationship with reality that starts with reality hate that hate to piss people off but combate liberalism is liberal because it assumes an unmoved mover. It tells people stop doing this instead of changing the material conditions that makes them do the thing. It is liberal combat and it's like there's a reason that Mao is so popular in college campuses because those people were the most liberal subjects to ever exist the Boomers. They were the first most intensified liberal subjects and so of course Mao is gonna make more sense to them than Marx or Lenin. I'm a liberal to some extent yes. I'm a liberal and so at the social level of respecting that there are other people who have equal rights as I do. But at that point I stop I don't take the next step to say that means that they choose their own decisions as I do know they're socially could texted as I am to them because that isn't that like the idea of being the idea of liberalism to the a that is a found that is before liberalism easily even that's literally to even have a social order that is beyond like a clannish like hive that that has strangers in it. Basically a social order in which you engage with strangers requires that degree of liberalism but beyond that it buds off into dialectical and and individualist at least in the West. So yeah combat liberalism is liberal. Black liberals are gonna get blackmailed pirate by conditions.

You're not gonna be able to convince them that that they're going to just use every evidence of awfulness to further their author their set ideas blaming it on Trump blaming it on Russia if Trump doesn't work now maybe even blending it on the Chinese. Some of the liberals are blending with Chinese only exchange in their material conditions and circumstances is going to change the way they apportion blame for their condition. So that's another thing where like I can't you can't own your parents on Facebook or people on Twitter into becoming more black pilled because they're too comfortable right now and they're comfortable channeling their discontent that they do have that is mostly symbolic on to trump on to the Republicans. They have to have so much more material conditions that they have and the thing is that doesn't mean that you then have to carry out things that make that happen because the worse it gets faster to heart. The more likely people are going to react badly to the trauma. That is why you can't bring about the collapse you have to work within the existing collapse alright guys I'm done for the day.

I think this was a good one had fun. I'm sorry that the chat is lame as. But I have little control over that talk to you guys tomorrow peace and I'd like to talk about the Taiping rebellion. Maybe tomorrow. It's British really interesting. Someone mentioned it but we forgot but anyway peace and chicken grease.
