I am the man who will fight for your honor. I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of let me forever make me eat leather and do awesome sandwich fighting with you what the  oh wait a minute. There. It is like a nice shining armor from a long time ago oh. No. I thought. I had the mute on didn't now. I do muted is on are you ready for some debates thursday night party. We got frank and l and steve it's gonna be a big party. I am so excited about this debate honestly specifically how trump is going to respond to being coveted ruined and gacked up and also clearly in a death spiral where he is at some level aware of his position. Even though he denies it which means he might be completely buck wild in this thing and apparently they're going to try to actually mute him very interested to see how that actually plays out and if there's any willingness or or on the part of the moderators to really try to rein him in if he doesn't want to be reign in but maybe they put him on the rhino tracks to preserve the senate. They're like oh god. We can't let him go out here. Like this they just  take him down and he like gets to half speed and he's doing like chopped and screwed trump which is at least you know.

They could point to and say see he's not quite as erratic and manic and wild and seemingly uh on the verge of tears as he has been in every recent public appearance. We'll see. I mean after that 60 minutes interview. I mean my god the gan. The man is just a whiny. It's kind of it's kind of amazing but of course it doesn't matter. It's all just a fun fun uh spectacle. I think that race was probably decided on the fundamentals. I'm pogging folks. I'm pogging and don't we love to pog that we love pogging but anyway because I think it might be fun and because honestly I didn't feel like our contribution to the first debate really made it any funnier or more interesting because of just how how language broke down.

And it was just this symphony and it was like we were talking during a symphony uh. I'm going to we're not going to be doing a chapo podcast related stream of the debate. I believe alex lowe auction will be uh doing it for fym on here and uh if you want to have like a chill you know friend to watch with alex will be very good but I really just want to enjoy it. I just want to sit now that I haven't had my breakthrough moment with the last debate. I want to sit with this one and just let it wash over me like forget any attempt to to interrogate you know the sentences or words for meaning break them down break them of context turn them into just music and then just let it wave over me which is what I kind of felt like. I did during the town hall when they were competing streams. I was listening to both of them and I was kind of toggling back and forth and creating my own pixie song so that's gonna be fun but then when it's over. I think I and chris and I don't know who else whoever wants to will pop on to do.

Some reacts some hot reacts. I don't think we're gonna get. We never got that son's debate never made up for the lost debate by giving us the sons it's tragic. He does seem to sound bad lately. I mean maybe that's people's wishful thinking but it does seem like covet has taken a little bit out of his sails. He seems to be kind of delirious when he isn't very raspy. I'm not sure all who will be in the post-debate stream. I know I will be and I think chris also I hope chris since he runs the runs the discord thing yeah. The one way you know that trump is either either thrown in the towel or just has lost. His touch is that their big their big psychological move at the last debate which in 2016 was in the face of the planet uh the uh entertainment tonight tapes coming out and the grabbing by the  controversy in the teeth of that mere days later he went out there and put all of a he put a chorus line of bill. Clinton's most prominent uh sexual assault uh accusers in a row. I mean absolute master class. This time.

It's uh some guy named tony baloney. Some guy that is the equivalent of when the democrats would like epically talk about oh my god. You know who left parnis knew that's right if you're thinking it's flirtage. It's flirtash okay and that's the kind of stuff that nobody outside their screen. Their area knew and they would scream across the void during the whole the  energy. These people put into that even the people like the people who did it and the people who watched and cheered about it and cared about it and got wrapped about it. Think of that energy do they not in their heart know that it was completely wasted that it meant nothing that it was just jacking off into an ocean. They don't get that at some point I think some of them do which is why they have to keep shrieking and creating more and more like insane hypothetical universes where their brand of uh of pragmatic idealism is mildly relevant.

So this would be like if if this would honestly be like if say biden was say covet hadn't happened right uh um and the economy like maybe it's maybe we're seeing it start to cool off a little bit which is what the there were fundamentals that seemed to indicate that we were headed towards recession even before covet so. But maybe it's like. It's not a huge drop and then it's you know that is honestly even if it started then that might be too early to really affect the election. Like the reason. George w h bush lost in 1992 is largely because the little recession that happened at this end of his second term was in the exact right moment to just ripple out and and be maximally impacting people's uh minds. Uh the news and uh and their votes which wouldn't necessarily have happened depending on how severe it was. But anyway say we live in that world and in the election.


Nothing's about covet and it's all about you know uh probably about trump being corrupt and probably more russiagate. Stuff and let's and and impeachment stuff and maybe and and like trump is up by five going into election day at the national level and the democrats are going insane because how do people not get it and their big coup de gras would be to bring out like uh stephen parsnip or one of the people that no one outside of the rachel bubble ma rachel maddow bubble knows and put them in the front row to remind people about the ukraine crimes or something that would be as out of touch and ridiculous as him bringing hunter thompson hunter thompson hunter biden's uh what crime buddy no one gives a  and it just goes to show that you know you live by the sword die by the sword in terms of uh. Like that trump. In 2016 ran a campaign that was effective in part because trump knew what the people wanted because it was what he wanted having watched the white having watched obama be president for eight years and having been personally infuriated by obama and by democrats and liberalism in general. As a result of his revulsion of obama he is able to articulate with perfect clarity. The concerns of you know this. This dispossessed lump in bourgeois. We have in this country and they and they were he was able to affix to hillary clinton uh. All of the the horrors of the last 40 years not just social liberalism but economic and neoliberalism. She was the avatar of all of it and he was able to paint her in that way and and her personal corruption was able to be put about her. Her husband's sexual license was able to neutralize any attacks on trump's personal virtue.

This time he's not he spent the last four years not outside of the presidency. He has literally been dictating the news that he's been watching while everyone else is watching him and trying to identify with him and what that means is that he is now no longer able to pitch himself to a broad spectrum of you. Know relatively uncommitted less than partisanly uh identified voters which has a lot of people in which a lot of like the dedicated partisans who make up the consumers of most political media have a hard time imagining. But it's true and those are the people who make the decisions every  four years between one person winning in the other and also who decides to come out and vote who wouldn't have otherwise and none of that is getting none of them care about glorp simpson and flitch doodleberg. Just like they didn't care about the the stuff with uh with trump and the russians. It's the exact same sort of epistemic uh black hole. It's the same uh bubble which goes to show that like there really is no difference between these people like even even trump once he got into hollywood. I mean sorry once he got into the white house just turned into another disconnected holly uh uh hollywood hollywood slash washington sicko he even as he fought against what he saw as a hostile culture. He he subconsciously absorbed all of their priors including that people care about stuff like who hunter thompson's hunter thompson hunter. Biden's uh uh co-criminal is as though as though like the hillary clinton thing had anything to do with the content of the case.

Like the emails themselves it was that represented about hillary clinton and he could do that because he was challenging an incumbent and now he is. He's the incumbent and it just he never learned how to realize. He was in power because he's just been watching the presidency for the past four years I'm very interested to see what the turnout ends up being because you're seeing crazy numbers in early turnout in states like texas and georgia. Now of course that doesn't necessarily mean anything we have no idea how many of these people are banking or how many of these are banked votes that would otherwise have come on election day. We have no way of knowing but when you see how big it is compared to the number of votes that like were the in the last election. It's hard not to imagine that you know even if it's just an effect that because fewer people vote on election day it's easier to vote on election day and more people who might be on the fence about voting will do it because it's less of a hassle like even if that's the amount of effect it has it could be a significant in terms of moving something from you know a a a clear elector uh uh popular vote victory.

But then you know the the the nightmare of litigation and all the swing states uh and a relatively anticlimactic biden victory who knows it's interesting. I keep saying hunter thompson. I think it's because there's uh. He seems like the kind of guy who has read hunter thompson and taken some of the wrong lessons from it. And I would say that the numbers of people voting is the thing that's more at this point interesting and dispositive than um the polls because obviously you can say the polls are wrong because they were wrong last time you know. I mean. I do think that that biden has a bigger more durable lead than hillary did at the same point. I'm pretty sure that's true uh but even if you say they're still  up and the methodology's still wrong and even if you assume it's in the same direction. Uh. I think just the trend of the polling plus the reality of holly's early voting. I mean if there it's just if there's a hot there's two models. Here. There's a high turnout model and a low turnout model trump could win a low turnout model. In fact a low turnout model probably favors a trump victory over a biden one but trump basically cannot win a high high turnout election because we know from the last 20 years.

What the gop percentage of the vote is trump did not have any kind of big surge of support over previous republicans. What he did is. He had support in some different areas that were crucial for the uh electoral map because they because of our  electoral college but overall it was basically the same percentage. The thing is that because of the electoral college and because of voter suppression and and uh and you know the explicit policy of the demo republican party wherever it's in power to to make it more difficult to vote as a as a party policy as a as a matter of like platform uh uh importance and that they've been successful at that. Uh you know means that they can win but if there's a lot of people who vote if even with those things people still vote for some reason or another. They're motivated to that would swap it like hillary lost because the share of vote that went away from her in terms of people not voting in the right states and a few of them shifting from obama to trump but mostly just not bothering to show up in the crucial states. Those people likely are not going to come out to vote for trump because those are not really politicized people which means.

I don't think they're looking at the  coronavirus and saying well you know. It's all china's fault and uh fake news because they don't if they accepted his premise. They would already be on board. You know what I mean now. There is a theory that says the q anon style  and like the dissolving nature of reality and the way that we have totally just like stepped through the looking glass in terms of living within a spectacle that maybe all of our understanding of like incentive structure and voting has been annihilated by our collective break. A nervous breakdown in the face of this overwhelming sea of information that cannot be traversed with any kind of certainty that we basically have to drive ourselves insane and create fantastic uh uh like rituals to charge sacred objects with power in order to describe meaning out of the darkness and chaos of online and the world around us and so that means that why people are going to vote for who they do is almost uh quantitatively improbable to predict in which case anything could. Happen and I am not ruling that out as I have said I'm not going to be surprised by any outcome.


Somebody else was papio daniel a precursor to trump. I mean he's part of a tradition. You can trace trump through a line of american political figures and papi or daniel would certainly be one of them. Uh papio. Daniel is of course the name of the uh governor in mrs in a mississippi governor in oh brothertow and he is the guy who has a old-timey radio station that plays ads for his flower. That's the real guy papio daniel but he was not governor of mississippi uh. It was texas uh and the the thing that I think is and he was a guy who who was a had started off as a like door-to-door flower salesman and then become a flower wholesaler and then sponsored a tv show or a radio station. A a radio show a radio program of old-timey of uh folk music and the papio daniel flower hour and he became famous enough in texas that he ran. I believe for governor and then for senator and uh he defeated lyndon johnson in lyndon. Johnson's first run for senate in 1940. Uh was in 1942 or 1940. Uh I think it's 1940.

Um and in that race he lost because both o'daniel and johnson had certain rotten burrows like uh counties in texas where the local uh justice of the peace essentially controlled the votes and could determine how many votes uh the respective candidates got and then just delivered them to the highest bidder basically and they both had these these guys. These votes collected and over the night as the votes came in the legitimate votes and the illegitimate votes they would let them out sort of as needed and there was always a a staring contest about who would like release their votes last because once you once the enemy had had released their last crooked votes. You knew then how many you needed and that meant you could go over the top and that's what happened is that. Johnson released his last counties prematurely because he felt like he had a big enough uh margin that he could just let him all out there to like flood it. But that gave papio daniel's people the number that they had to beat and so they just scrawled it up and posted it and boom they won and so that's the environment that texas politics was like when he ran in 46 when he finally did win the landslide uh the election where he got that nickname for a just absolutely crooked completely stolen.

Uh senatorial primary campaign against coke stevenson that's a wild story. It's very uh that volume of the cairo. He's got there's one uh one of the early carol volumes about. Lbj is just about that means of ascent basically uh and it's fascinating. He's a little too easy on coke stevenson who was an awful just reactionary political figure and would have just been worse in in office than uh johnson. But it's a fascinating like minute by minute telling of it and the funny thing is is what ended up determining the vote after this crooked election that had this hugely disputed outcome and like the.

The texas ranger who killed bonnie and clyde had to have a showdown over the contents of a bank vault in in duval county which is the crooked county that uh that johnson had was part of the johnson fiefdom and it ended up being officiated by the net the democratic party because it was a democratic party. Primary and the democratic party at the end of the day was full of new dealers who wanted to see the new deal wit succeed and coke. Stevenson was anti-new deal so they picked johnson and the funny thing is that's the right decision that's the correct decision if you're there that's the correct decision and if you don't understand that it's because you believe these institutions serve any reason that other than the pursuit of power and that respecting them is going to save you from capital deciding to change the rules whatever it serves them to  you over and the thing is you can't even say oh no you know you're you're defaming the sanctity of the electoral process. Stevenson stole votes.

Too everyone was stealing votes. It was not and there was voter suppression was was systematized. I mean you know texas wasn't as bad as you know the deep south and in texas uh a lot of the times what you had instead of outright voter uh uh repression is that you had like urban machines like in houston. Uh uh like black vote was like a block that could be purchased which in terms of you know actual uh. You know franchise isn't much better than not being able to vote because you know the reason you're up you're being bought well like what's buying you is just pure money in the form of like connections through the uh political machine. Uh not actual benefits to anybody uh who's me who are making the votes not like the old you know tammany draft or at least not as not as a beneficently because you know you can never really vote against the racial apartheid that you live under but anyway that's an interesting story and that's uh yeah it definitely showed uh what johnson was capable of holy.

I mean he was like so there's so many points in his life story where it's he absolutely should not have gone on not just that he grew up super poor. I mean that's the thing that fired him and it was the engine of his his ambition. So he that was necessary that's origin stories yet but throughout his life. Like his uh he took a bunch of insane risks and like like that that senate seat was insanely a huge long shot to begin with because coke stevenson was  beloved. He'd been a former like three-term governor. Everybody loved him in fact and it was like a cincinnati thing where he had gone back to his ranch and they basically had to coax him out of retirement to come save the democratic party in uh texas and he was and and johnson was like some uh you know relatively young.


Fresh relatively inexperienced congressman uh in a giant state like texas who had almost none of the name recognition and he had he like used all this money to do insanely innovative stuff. He had a helicopter he campaigned under with going around uh texas at a  helicopter bought a ton of uh like uh radio ads and like you know just to get his name out there and then had also to just steal a ton of ballots. Just make a bunch of fake votes to get to be able to even compete for it and like that was while he was having some sort of horrible like gallbladder problem like he almost died every big point of of of real stress in johnson's life and like when he felt like it was slipping away he would go into some sort of like bad uh serious health decline. Sometimes related to like gall stones or stomach problems. He had a ton of heart attacks like in in moments of real stress. He would essentially almost die but then he would will himself back to life and end to victory the craziest one for me is that I mean unless it's unless you think he was in on the kennedy assassination uh in which case it makes perfect sense. But if you buy any version of the kennedy assassination that does not involve johnson being aware of it. For him. It was just blind luck. He was on the verge of having a career-ending expose of his corrupt dealings as the majority leader when he'd been in the senate it was going to come out in. I think life magazine the day of or after the kennedy assassin.

Kennedy was assassinated and was going to reveal his relationship to this guy bobby baker who is who is like the head of the uh like the interns in the senate uh and was running just a a massive graft and kickback operation that involved him getting kicking back up to johnson and he had they had him dead to rights and then after kennedy was assassinated they pulled the story and it never came back. I haven't read jfk and the unspeakable I will be because to me this book seems to be the thing that's got like the most important like rallying point. For this new emerging. I've talked about consensus where like kennedy actually was killed by the deep state. The deep state does operate that way and he was that much of a threat to it after being fallow for a while. So I know this is a text. I got to engage with but uh uh. I'm it's on.

It's on the list. I'll read it shortly. I'm interested. I have read the devil's chess board uh which is a fascinating book. And it's great on dulles. But I think it's really interesting that for a book that's like pitch is is that it's. Trying to argue that dulles was personally responsible for the kennedy assassination is that as the book gets closer to the kennedy assassination the figure of dulles recedes from the  story more and more and it becomes much more conjectural which I mean if I'm putting up suspects uh for deep involvement in the kennedy assassination. Like alan dulles is up there with like lee rv oswald. But I'm not sure I'm not convinced is all. I am not convinced by any theories of the kennedy assassination. I would say that including single bullet. I have read legacy of ashes which is very much. You look at it especially now of the stuff that I didn't know when I read league of ashes that I've discovered about the cia sense that isn't in league of l legacy of ashes. It's a jaw-dropping feat of a mission. I mean it's. It's like the definition of a limited hangout.

All the stuff in that's like outrageous in legacy of asses is all selectively. Uh threaded around the premise of greater. Uh organizational incompetence that makes the case that the cia is essentially only able to waste money and shoot itself in the foot and has never been able to effectively do anything which I think is is not an accurate representation of reality at all. And it's a perfect way to like get into the public consciousness real crimes but but always in that notion of well. That's that's was the past we're working harder to serve you better oh uh the carroll book. That's about the 46 election is called means of ascent ooh. If I went on doughboys.


What chain restaurant would I pick that's an interesting question. I'm going to assume that I'm I'm probably not going to be able to do anything for the first time like they've probably been everywhere at least once so. I would have to be bringing them back somewhere. The easy answer would just be culver's because that's wisconsin's contribution to you know regional chain excellence. I think but honestly I think I could probably have a more uh fruitful conversation a more interesting conversation about arby's man. I really want one of those euros. I don't think there's an arby's in new york.

Though the arby's hero not bad somebody asked if uh if if they think that gibbon is right because christianity ended the roman empire and it wasn't gays well. It wasn't gays obviously but I'm not sure it was christianity either. I'm pretty sure it was something more firmly fixed than a religious enthusiasm. I mean a lot of me. I don't know that much honestly about the fall of rome. I think that that uh like climate and uh and uh like agricultural yields have had something to do with it. I mean it wasn't that alone but uh you had that contribution of you know uh of an agricultural of like intensifying agricultural crisis and then you have you know just the unwieldiness of uh of an empire of the type that the roman empire's tried to be uh. It was like it's it's fitting that a lot of the uh reforms of the like late period involved delegating responsibility away from a single emperor because of how unviable it was but yeah. There's a lot of stuff nothing like that can have one cause or even like a handful of causes. It's like a rope. It's like a you know you could pick out the strands. But no one strand is the strand but yeah anyone who says it's any one thing is wrong and certainly gayness is the worst one. I remember francis. I think I saw francis schaefer saying that made like the opposite of the gibbon point but totally incoherently where he said uh like the guy in later hosted who did those 70s evangelical history and culture videos. I think I was propagandized with those in my like uh high school history class when I was going to school in the middle of farm country in wisconsin. But he talked about how the the what doomed those societies was a finite world. View is how he put it. I remember at the time just thinking what do you mean. I mean my main issue with that is that the roman empire fell apart as it became christian. It wouldn't wouldn't that have like prevented the collapse. The emergence of a christian you know uh ideology suffusing the empire baffling so yeah no if anyone's talking about single answers.

Then it's they're just trying to get a rise out of people. The question is how the those strands are entwined you know like that's. It's all just like documenting connections and figuring out how mechanisms work as opposed to uh. You know trying to sell a single patent explanation which is comes out of the sort of entrepreneurial nature of like academia. Sadly like novelty is rewarded you know so there's always a need to create schools of thought that require certain shibboleths and that lead you farther away from truth by pursuing it that way. I don't know it's tough. I mean I'm wrestling myself with how best to try to create narrative history that acknowledges you know the contingency of of chronolog chronological events while still grounding everything all those events in sort of the inevitable context that made them you know if not inevitable sort of predetermined in some way it's tough. But it's worth doing because I think it's the only way to communicate really just like how contingency works in history and therefore like what what what matters now and what needs to be focused.

On yeah. We need a diocletian that's for sure and I don't think we got one. I don't think joe biden is diocletian. Jesse ventura could have been diocletian jesse you. Up you could have been diocletian. I am a shiva left dammit who's the most cucked president. I mean not in terms of uh. I wouldn't say in terms of politics or like sexuality but just in terms of a guy who got owned sort of pathetically. William howard taft has got to be up there so taft never really wanted to be president. He wanted to be a supreme court justice and he is essentially badgered into running for president by teddy. Roosevelt and his wife who really wanted to be first lady and to please both of them he ran for president one almost immediately. His wife was very much looking forward to being first lady uh and living in the white house had a  debilitating stroke and he just the wind went out of his sails and he just sort of went through the motions and then while he's being president. The guy who helped like drag him into it is yelling at him and saying he's not good enough doing enough job and then challenges him for president and then runs against him and gets more votes and gets more electoral votes and becomes the last time one of the two major parties finished out of one or two in the electoral vote count and the popular vote count for that matter that's cucked but he uncut himself by later finally getting the job that he dreamed of when they made him supreme court justice which is a nice little.

Maybe. He got owned so bad that they had to give him a consolation prize and lucky for him. It's what he wanted all along there's some sort of parable there that maybe he just should have you know listened to his heart. No no there's sound to be any acids this evening. No no no. I think I'll just uh. I think I'll just chew a little bit who poops himself during the debate very good question. I got to think that with the covid trump has got to be mr incontinent. Right now will trump have his mojo tonight. This is the question all signs point to no all signs point to his mojo having to pardon him. He seems low energy. His instincts are all off he's talking about stuff. Nobody cares about if he goes up there and talks about hunter bonnie then for an hour he's going to lose and badly but you know the universe has a way of preventing the the shattering of of consensus reality in one motion. Like that we like to just wear away at the edges of reality and not rend and asunder because I don't know that's I'm just trying to explain how in my gut. I have a feeling that it'll be kind of lower energy. He will be less uh disruptive. He won't look like terrible  and it'll kind of come off as a trump win by being uh like low like less of a circus and that's just like that's where my stomach is it's like doesn't that feel right like having it be a real like trump just wheezing like baron harkonnen and like fleming up and yelling at the  about tony polonie in the front row and spewing like gallagher all over the place. I just can't see it happening or biden stroking out as funny as that would be don't see that happening either just some.

I don't know maybe I've just uh. I've run out of things to believe in maybe. I feel like I've gotten to the point of hyper normalization where even if that did happen. I wouldn't perceive it that way. I would perceive it like viscerally as oh just boring because I will have hyper normalized that quickly. I will be more normal than man we'll find out though. I'm looking forward to it.


Someone asked enver hoja cringe or based. I would say that enver hoja is based cringe. I mean the bunkers are  cringe. I'm sorry. I will not be streaming. The debate. Alex will be streaming the debate. I'm going to be watching at home and trying to let it wash over me trying not to feel like. I have to have a response to anything. That's. I think what really trips me up is. I find myself feeling like I need to have a grab point to say something instead and that's going to make it harder for me to just wash over me. So my hope is to just just a a symphony of sound. We will do a post game though at least I and chris will be doing post games. Chris might actually looks like chris might be on the debate as well with alex so there you go. I might pop on who knows we'll see how it goes. I'm gonna start off not on there who's playing football tonight. Somebody asks uh if I feel like chapel in general is more disenchanted with the system than it was in 2016 and I would say absolutely in the sense that we have had after 2016.

I think all of us had a feeling in that aftermath of that race and in the aftermath of trump winning that there was a possibility to take the surprise bounty of the sanders candidacy which arrayed all these forces that were opposed to the clintons for whatever reason good and bad to rally iran and that that could be the baseboard like a counter uh hegemonic like self-consciously class-oriented uh uh political bloc within the democratic party that could seize control of its commanding heights and like reorient the party from there uh and whether or not that is theoretically possible as a strategy. I think some people would say ah peru. I see prove you were wrong. I don't know if that's escaped. I just know that the illusion that we have had been dissed from is the illusion that american politics in this year and the american electorate in this term and their relationship to voting and their relationship to the media and the relationship to the economy and the electorate. The the cultural like relationship of the classes to like the means of production and the means of cultural expression and the means and willingness to participate in electoral processes. They're all askew and they do not add up to a force that can't be harnessed to that end.

At least not now. I mean you could say that the campaign made mistakes and I agree completely people have been very upfront about a lot of tactical and strategic errors that the campaign made bad hires for bad hires to bad strategy to a bunch of stuff but when I look at the results to me it seems like there was an unmovable block of anti-sanders conviction among somewhere around 55 to 60 percent of the broad democratic primary electorate. If you like think of that as a stable grouping and the only way it was going to overcome that was by energizing and engaging non-voters non-participators in the democratic primary system and that failed to happen and you can talk about why but I think fundamentally. It's because there are there are missing belts cultural conveyor belts between the political. The the symbolic and meaning orientation around politics and enough of the people you'd need to reach to switch to swing the demographics of these primary races. So yes. I'd say like but the thing is is that that's constructive because it tells you where you are you know.

It tells you what you what won't work and it tells you what not to do again and you got to move from there and the thing is is that the democratic party now that they have now that now that the command of the neoliberal you know consensus has been has been is no longer challenged within it. They're going to govern as as monsters. It's going to be a a hunger chancellorship and that like any crisis is also an opportunity or it needs to be that's all I can say. I don't know if we'll be able to meet it. I don't know if we have the institutional flexibility or or capacity to meet the moment uh. I'm skeptical but at the same time there's nothing else to do so. If enough people have that conviction then you know that's all you actually need but hitting that number is is so hard because you never know what it is until afterwards.

You'll never know what it was until after it's already happened all right mad or cracked. You know this is funny. Uh I know crack became kind of a a cringy uh radical centrist like lifestyle website. But back in the 90s and 80s. It was a knock off of mad magazine that I think was made by like former writers and editors for mad who left because mad wasn't paying them enough because william gaines was a  cheapskate and so they created an off-brand mad which that's the one that I could subscribe to. I did not subscribe to mad magazine. I subscribed to crack and I honestly can't tell you why. I guess one time. I just picked up cracked and I like I read a thing I maybe. I saw some john severin art because john severin was a guy who wrote for years who who he wrote. He did uh cartoons or he did comics for years for mad and then he left with the crack people to get more money and so he was in cracked and I really liked his drawing style and otherwise. It was basically the same material and I just I went to cracked. I still respected mad magazine but I only had crack delivered to my home. Cracked had a print version. Yes. It was a print magazine. It was originally an arrival for mad.

It was like mad tv too mad hilariously enough. It's like mad tv to mads snl apparently. People didn't know this the children around here don't know this the damn kids today. They don't know yeah. Sean baby was very funny sean baby early internet for the old heads in the chat. The the guys who invented a certain strain of web comedy and of course. That's why you can't really go back and read it without cringing because everyone talks like that. Now. It's you know it's like how joss whedon. For a while it was kind of funny and then it became monstrous but it was good at the time fat. Chicks and party hats is one of the funniest things I ever saw. I just cried reading that when I was a kid thoughts on charles babbage. How are you going to ask a  sketched out. The difference engine the pr. A primitive computer. What opinion of tarot's babbage am. I going to have. I don't understand. You just wanted like see if I knew who he was you people. You're a very wacky answer. You question. Sometimes somebody asked if chapo is based or cringe and I would say again. We are based cringe.


I read somebody asked about neil stephenson. I've only read snow crash and uh his way of writing action kind of annoyed me over time. So I never really read anything else. Someone wants my opinion on the pythagorean theorem. I really don't have one. I'm not even 100 sure what it is a squared a squared plus b squared equals c squared right am.

I voting yes absolutely I vote every time. I can. I've only missed a few times. It's fun. I like it. I like the ritual and I think there is something like in me like at a civil like at a civic level. I actually do think you should vote like. I think as someone who thinks ritual is important to reinforce behavior. So you know obviously. Voting has way way. Way way too much psychic significance for people but it should have a little bit and so it should contribute a little bit. So I i do vote but like the thing is that's a totally separate question then who to vote for and it is a different rubric and like a lot of the undergirding assumptions behind a lot of these browbeating arguments don't apply in my opinion but like.

I said. I think I'm going to be writing in hillary cause. I think that'd be the funniest write-in. I'm going to go into the polls because that's part of the things. I liked I i when I lived briefly in washington state where they do they all mail in and I didn't really like that. I like going to the thing and doing the thing. I'm really annoyed that I've never uh voted on a machine. An old timey machine they used to print the sample ballot in my local newspaper in manitowoc wisconsin. It was a mo. It was a it was a sketch of the machine and it had the different candidates and where they'd be and I remember thinking. It was cool and I wanted to go and do that. But I was too young and then by the time I was able to vote. I lived in a different area where they did scantron bubbles bubble uh sheets and then I moved to new york but right right before or right after they got rid of the old machine. So I've never been able to go on a machine which is a bummer. But I still like filling in the little bubbles and I like most about putting it in the machine and going all right just maybe a couple questions here before. I go thank you talking about those euros got me. Hungry got me feeling euro-rific.

There goes my hero watch it as he goes horror movie suggestions. I said return of the living dead the other day so I gotta pick a different one uh on the zombie tip. It's actually available on you you can just watch it on youtube peter. Jackson's dead alive also known as brain dead that's one of the bloodiest films ever made delightful slap splatter core slapstick not very fun not very scary but very enjoyable. What movie spawned what war spawn the best movies all right well. We can eliminate a few right off the bat revolutionary war what the patriot about it uh war of 1812. I believe there's a movie about the battle of new orleans with charlton heston as andrew jackson. But that's basically it maybe. There's some terrible movie about the writing of the  star spangled banner or something civil war considering how big a part of america's like historic memory it is it's kind of stunning how few really great civil war movies are. I think glory is a really good movie. I think it's a great movie. I'm sorry. I know no no white savior is yes. I understand. There's a lot of issues with what stories get told in hollywood but the way that that story was told. I thought was good um but man. It's in. It's not.

It's a thin rank past that I mean what are we talking birth of a nation. Uh which you know you could say is bad politics. But it's a good movie at the time. I honestly do not get. I can't watch a silent film and like appreciate it. I can't do that. I don't have the film historian thing of going like wow. I can put myself in the head of somebody who is impressed. You know by seeing the train go by on on a screen. I'm sorry. I'm not that person. I'm not that rube. I cannot be impressed by this. But whatever uh gone with the win same deal uh  made uh. It's. It's stunningly. There's like a john houston red badge carriage of the 50s. I think it's crazy how few uh civil war movies. There are especially considering how many crazy good stories. There are you could do about the civil war uh but so that's not on the table for sure uh world war one where you got sergeant york and of course uh all quiet on the western front wings paths of glory that's pretty good so we're getting a little better there uh than world war ii. Of course you know there's a lot of bad world war ii movies obviously but because of just how many world war ii movies. There are. There are also a lot of good ones. There's a lot of good world war. Two movies you know uh  flavor saving private ryan sorry. It's a good movie uh a thin red line. Uh midway not pearl harbor.

That's a bad movie um the  hacksaw ridge. I mean that movie. It was a little sappy but it had some awesome action scenes awesome. Oh some war scenes uh tora toratora yeah guns of navarone. Uh  bridge of the river kwai inglorious bastards come and see okay. I think we got it because vietnam's good too. But I don't think I'm getting anywhere near this list patent bridge too far. The dirty dozen is the good the great escape holy. God. I mean it was it was like that was the big good thing. We did as a civilization even though it was it involved us basically just lancing a boil that our own civilization had created in the form of feral german national and japanese nationalism unleashed by uh like the late application of capitalist uh modes of production to a primitive civilization in many ways. Catch-22 is not bad oh man memphis bell. I saw that movie a million times as a kid. Love it. Uh casablanca people like I've never honestly seen it. I'm sorry so yeah. I gotta go world war. Two ww2 wwii army of shadows. Yes not enemy at the gates. That's not a great movie. I would like to see some more spanish civil war movies. Although smash of war does not have a lot of uh not a lot of pageantry honestly a lot of uh confusion and bungling and and cannibalism. I want to see that uh that bread and freedom movie. I've never seen it duck. You sucker is a very good movie about the mexican revolution which could use way more movies. The mexican revolution come on give me some movies about that holy.
