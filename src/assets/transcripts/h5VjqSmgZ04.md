Hey guys I'm sorry to interrupt that weird thing that's supposed to be on where everyone's singing from their bedrooms or whatever it really looks like a bunch of people just having independent nervous breakdowns kind of seems like a bummer kind of feels like the world's ending honestly watching it. It's like you know all those benefit concerts after a big. All those benefit concerts after a big disaster are reassuring because they're ruled you know we know oh there's a oh look. There's a guy on stage look. It's John Mellencamp be singing and now we've got these people like dressing up in costumes in their starkly undecorated living rooms and just singing and crying. It's just it's disturbing it's not good for her.

It freaks me the eff out so if everybody going to protest to get back to curse or whatever the. They're they're funded by like cokes and like they're made up of small business owners. I mean it is an economically motivated thing like get the business back going up get get things back going so I can make money again if I get the virus anyway. My family gets a virus I'll probably be alright if somebody else gets sick. I don't know those them. So it's not even like they're saying I want to die. They're what they want other people to die so that people will go to their stores or the thing is until these people start dying in any kind of significant numbers. They're gonna keep thinking. It's fake and maybe I mean we'll find out either way right. We'll find out one way or another hey. They didn't invite me on Iran I'm doing my own thing 

 no one bad is gonna. Die I've said this before and I 100% believe it no one bad will die of this because god likes and human suffering God might not be evil. But he loves human evil and you can even imagine like save your gob. You created the universe and I especially if there is some sort of eternal afterlife for every spirit in the universe. Then what any human being does in life is it really doesn't matter you know you only have a few years if you're lucky you're thrown into circumstances beyond your control. Like you know you're probably gonna do more bad than good. Just you know out of out of just because of statistical likelihood. So if that's the case and everyone eventually is redeemed through you know like being put through the rock tumbler of reincarnation or like spiritual scouring and the afterlife or whatever either way. Then god you're gonna have a lot of fun watching. Humans be evil to one another and why would you intervene to stop that why would you intervene to stop human evil from happening when it's so. Funny I mean it's way funnier than people being nice what in most movies make up our movies and entertainment and films and books are they made up of people being good no because that's boring why wouldn't it be boring to God so nobody good will die or don't be.

Good will let me battle that it doesn't wanna but if you know about them and you know they're evil. Then they're doing way much the way that's like canceling a little sparks that's like canceling sweeps week that's like canceling your top show for cheap suit. Especially since things are gonna get real weird real fast. Hey Connor how you doing. I think we're gonna get insanely weird very very quickly. Why wouldn't you want as many evil. People around as possible to just get nutty with. I will probably be doing at some time in the next week because I've got it on board but not yet I gotta have to wait for the weather to die so that's for sure yeah they didn't invite me on their stream. They can off why do I care what they're doing. The real heads are in here with me see. This is a really interesting.

This is sort of like how the stories about how the stories about how like it you know at the politburo or whatever they would start clapping stalin and it would just keep going. We just nobody wanted to be the first one to be seen stopping so they would just keep clapping forever. These people are all they don't want to be the last one to stop this here the last one will stop then woody what can you not respect our first responders. A health care workers Wow Oh God people are singing. Now someone saw some video from Italy and now they're getting inspired much clapping their cheeks oh boy we've seen new york new york by sinatra. The boy oh boy oh boy definitely getting weird. That's only gonna get weirder I thought they were gonna slowly like taper down over the weeks but instead it's gotten more intense. It's like they're doubling down but the really clapping board is that there's still supply lines what they're really clapping for us if they could still turn the lights on their side. They'll flip a switch in the light turns on and that's the Internet and if they flush the toilet at the ship goes away that's their clapping that they don't have to go out there and try to find their own food. You know none of them would be able to I include myself in that number that thing that there's still the TV still works you know I mean and the thing is that's worth noting about because the alternative is not something you want to think about too much if you're this vulnerable if you're this far from any self-sustaining lifestyle.

Oh any more questions here prediction for Abidin cabinets. I'd say clover cars probably the clubhouse leader to be VP because I really do think that they believe that. Like oh she's from the Midwest they like her that we didn't lose. We lost the Midwest so we need one of them which of course ignores the fact that the Midwest is America's Balkans and all of them hate each other over very very small disagreements and differences. Most mostly around sports teams Wisconsin I hate Minnesota and have no interest in their their political figures and in fact if someone's from Minnesota will probably say the other thing honestly just out of spite okay people from Illinois as well. Michiganders of course eight people from Ohio in place versa. Everyone hates Indiana everyone and for good reason. There's no there's no solidarity there at the state beyond the state level. So she oh. She's all she's gonna do is help. You win a state. You already won last time with Hillary by slightly more congratulations. Morons how am I supposed to get to some exactly how is that supposed to work you. Cold ah which state is the worst Iowa's in Indiana is in the running. Indiana's like basically has no redeeming features to it and the funny thing is is amber.

For example who live grew up there would agree with me. There's no question about that Wisconsin I honestly feel like since since Walker got in Wisconsin might have been doomed. Wisconsin might have been ruined root as I say in the dark hour series and I have to say that Minnesota as much as I hate it and have a visceral hatred for my childhood fraud and because it's I resent their hegemonic Lutheranism not spiced in with any fun party Bavarians and and Irish or pole locks. But goddamn it. They're doing better. So I gotta have I put Minnesota above Wisconsin as much as I hate to say it but those two and then a big drop-off. Minnesota has the Coens. But Wisconsin has arson wells and who pray tell is the is the Minnesota Liberace prints.

I don't want the Rona man someone telling me not to get it buddy who are you talking to I've not been licking light bulbs light poles I've been trying to avoid it. There's a chance I had an asymptomatic case earlier this year because we were in Venice. We were in California during the height of the outbreak and we're almost positive. We'll had it after the end of the tour and we were together that whole same time very hard to imagine that we didn't both get it. So I could be a lucky asymptomatic guy. But I'm not gonna find out like by randomly getting getting nutty with it perish the thought all right guys before I'm not just some more questions with some more questions you know I just looked in here what we got but first I'm gonna do another reading from blood meridian.

This I was inspired to read this by David David Brooks who told us the other day that the age of coddling is over then all of you well coddled. Swaddled millennial children are finally going to be have to confront reality and all of its Horrors with all of its sharp fangs and teeth and claws which of course coming from a absolutely soft-boiled egg of a man a vanilla souffle with a comb-over. A man who has never had that work at Davis life that any meaningful job a man who has never produced a man who has never worked by the sweat of his brow for a moment a man who is wildly overcompensated to flatter. The the egos of the wealthiest people in this country is essentially a court jester for concentrated wealth. That's all he is someone who had died in the woods if they were left there overnight and just the thought that he is are like calm. He is our judge holdin a very good wrestler so just imagine David Brooks is saying this instead of the judge in fact.

Maybe. I'll remember to say that instead they grew caught it in like under the white sons of those days and they're hollow burned out. Eyes were the like those of not not ambulance surprised by day knocked ambulance a general okay. They grew gone to did lank under the white sons of those days and they're hollow burned out. Eyes were like those of neck ambulance surprised by day crouched under their hats. They seemed fugitives on some grander scale like beings of whom this for whom the Sun hungered. Even David Brooks grew silence thank you he'd spoken up urging oneself of those things but lay claim to a man that body receiving his remarks counted themselves well done with any claims at all. They wrote on and the wind drove the fine great dust before them and they wrote an army of gray beards. Gray man gray horses the whole mountains to the north Leafs unwise and corrugated folds and the days were cool and the nights were cold and they sat about the fire each in his round of darkness in that round dark.

While the idiot watched from his cage at the edge of the light. David Brooks cracked with the back of an axe. The shin bone of an antelope and the hot marrow dripped smoking on the stones they watched him. The subject was war. The Good Book says that he lives by the sword shall perish by the sword said the black David Brooks my love his face shining with grease what right man would have it any other way. He said the Good Book does indeed count war war and evil said. Irving yet there's many a bloody tale of war inside it. It makes no difference what men think of war said David Brooks war doors as well ask men what they think of stone war was always here before man war waited for him the ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner that is the way it was and will be that way and not some other way. He turned to brown from whom he'd heard some whispered slur or demurrer ah Davy.

He said it's your own trade. We honor here why not rather take a small bow let each acknowledge each my trade. Certainly what is my trade war worries. Your trade is it not and eight yours mine too very much so what about all the notebooks and bows and stuff. All other trades are contained in that of war isn't that why war indoors no your doors because young men love it and old men love it in them. Those that fought those that did not that's your notion David Brooks smile men are born for games nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the words their merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but read the value of that which is put at hazard games of chance require our wager have any meaning at all. Games of sport involve.

The skill and the strength of the opponent's and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inherent the worth of the principle to define them but trial of chance of trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game player all suppose two minute cards with nothing to wager save their lives who has not heard such a tale a turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die or that man's hand or that man and his what more certain validation of a man's worth could. There be this enhancements enhancement of the game to its ultimate state that means no argument concerning the notion of eight. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who can reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one in such games as have for their stake. The annihilation of the defeat of the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification seem so or is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. More is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence.

Wars God Brown study the judge you're crazy Holden crazy. At last then Brooks Myles yeah I have read that in a while that's pretty good McCarthy's pretty good you gotta give it so it's a bummer. I'll never get the Nobel. Once they gave it to Dylan. There was no way I was gonna go to another white male American in the next like 30 years. Yep.

There's a real powerful point there where he says work will never be as noble as play and what that really gets at is the notion of human labor and activity put to one's own end or to the ends of an employer like alienated labor and free existence. Like that is like one of those like end-stage. Marxist concepts that you don't hear in a lot of talk about because it's very speculative metaphysical almost but there really is a notion in Marx's of that. Once you have removed the need to exploit labor away from one's own ends to maintain life through the socialization of the means of production and the sharing of the surplus. A result of that that anything you do is not like any lot anything you've ever done. It's not like anything we do because everything we do is induced induced by coercion and that induced coercion poisons. Every action we take and alienates is from them and slowly poisons us against them and then marks the end state of Marxism. It was this one in which that does is replaced by pure action devoid of coercion purely self-expression and the closest thing we do have in life. To that is play is games where we are doing it of our own free will and within the game's rules we are able to thrive and do what we want and do something to try to achieve victory. Like that is really the gate the goal the goal of communism is to make that the rule rather than a very very rare exception to human life. So there you go drop some theory on you guys.

Boom didn't mean to do that didn't mean to drop my theory on you guys. I should have said some more about that with the debate with Virgil obviously because gaming culture really does poison. Something that really should be powerful like the idea of play games is like the end state. The most noble state and you can argue that a lot of these neat gamers have achieved something similar to that in that they are gaming with their time and they're not induced to do so because they live off their parents. But it's a cruel parody of it because it's bound up an exploitation and it makes it impossible to gain. Basically this simulacra of gaining this cruel mockery of gaming gives us only a haunting wisp of what could be gaming and only instead reifies exploitation and within the industry than the creation of the commodity for gaming as commodity. So there you go boom theory well that's some theory time all right. Let's see what questions we got. These are some good ones. I just say that somebody says was the funniest person who died of the virus obviously. Trump the funniest answer that answer to anything of like who's the funniest is strong which is why it might happen. Scrawling like a HO bag here I can't find anything.

This is an interesting one if the u.s. Loses power the world with other countries step in and do the same. Ah that's a really interesting question because I honestly don't know if it's possible and it really doesn't make me feel like a lot of oh oh. Alright so right now we have a situation where the u.s. Is like long-term. Strategic posture is all about defending keeping America's pre-eminent interests preeminent basically like making America's interest still interests of world institutions right like that's the long-term goal and that's what of like the containing China is for and all that stuff. But the US will such a unique role militarily that I don't know if anyone has the capacity to take it back like we talked about the Chinese military the Chinese military even though it might have more people than us. In it. It might have like a larger number of troops in terms of it's like weapons systems and fraction. We have 11 aircraft carriers. We have 11 aircraft carriers. I think China has two of that check. I think China has China has - I was right. We have an we and we won the currency and the thing is is if China isn't in a position to be us cuz. This because B being obviously there's some there's huge benefits to being like the world currency like the u.s. Is but one thing that it makes the US is. It makes it the consumer of last resort them. You're the reserve currency at the end of the day.

It's up to you to consume everything like the the runoff from everyone's like bilateral interactions like trade interactions and the thing is is that what that does over time is is. It undermines America's like internal chain of internal. My ability is like a producer like that's why you have deindustrialization that's why the big reasons we had the industrialization because because we have to be the consumer unless trade jobs for cheapness. He does once because you can only maintain like the story of like the story of every country that has like become a developed economy starts with protectionism right but everyone agrees with that but thou you have economists to say like well yeah. Maybe that's that was true then but now it isn't and so new countries don't get to do that and and countries that do do it should really stop but as soon as you get rid of that protectionism and here the bill. I mean. That's why we're so horribly exposed now because so much stuff doesn't even come out of here. Stuff stuff doesn't get built here because that's not what we're here for. We're here to consume it.

We're not here to make it and that is in the long-term bad. So whatever anyway it's left us with is this massive military that still has to take a role and like I think the worst thing maybe worst is that like China basically joins in and gets to code aside this. Like instead of the US dictating China gets to like Kove dictate and maybe even lift America's like American when maintaining the figurehead position something like that but with China like a place at the table. I think that's more realistic because they don't want the job that we have no. They wouldn't want to have to blow that much of the GDP on useless trinkets like we do they like to just use ours like the Saudis do so. We're still gonna have a role. It's just. We're going to be less less sexual to the decision making process. So there you go that's why I think would happen.

It would be more like a unipolar thing like guys like Matt Stoller are terrified of the Chinese taking over but like I'm sorry the interests are trans. Their interests are the interests of their ruling elite in both countries. Those interests are intersecting regardless of anything you have to say about Asian states and like how we need a new Cold War or any of this. The interest of those two groups are consonant they're coming together. You see the way that like the Peter Till's of the world are uniting like Chinese style social media surveillance mechanisms bringing them to the US even though they're supposed to be a libertarians because they don't maintaining. Private property is going to require more and more coercive measures against the population to keep them from trying to take their because they're gonna have all of it. Now there's gonna be some point where people realize there's more of us than there are of them. Now that's why these libertarians need these very coercive state institutions and technologies to keep them away from it. And that's that's true whether you're a high you're a bigwig in the Chinese Communist Party or you're interests.

All the same interests home boys and girls well hell yeah tonight guys. Let put this one out on YouTube. People are watching these on YouTube. Let's see that I'm really excited I gotta say I love it big there. My hair is looking really really. Egghead absolute egghead what a freak boy ah so get this guy's I was joking about how I was starting to think about cut shaving my head just out of out of quarantine boredom and the thing is is that I didn't realize that I had had a hair home haircutting kit like you know cutting it yourself cuz. It's more I just hate having to go to the hair cutter II and I it's like oh man. I'm just gonna shave my head. But then I realized oh no I I lost it in the move from the last place to this place damn. Oh I guess I want you to buy it and then while we were rearranging stuff. In this house we found a box from somebody from like before we lived here where had been like misdelivered and this is like years later and it opened it and it was a home clipper.

That's kid that's calm and I I mean I am on the wheel of car. I must often serve the beam so I think at some point I'm gonna get. I'm gonna get suited and I'm going to kiss ate. My head so steer ready for that very disturbing and I guarantee you unpleasant sight. But I can already kind of see what it would look like and it looks like. Oh it looks bad. I'm gonna have to get a hat at the same time that I do it because I'm gonna need a backup plan not good folks. How're you guys living how's everybody doing.

It's trumped the last US president. At this point. I would say maybe there's a 10 to 15 percent chance that yes that's the case if I was Nate Scylla back. We got some real centrifugal forces operating right now that looked like they could genuinely destabilize a lot of long-standing institutions that might be a lot more brittle than we think they are because they were never meant to see. This kind of stress I see compounded crises I feel the likelihood of a military takeover being realistic and the idea of that creating fracture in opposition to it. You know sort of a late medieval you know like crisis of the third century type deal. I don't think it's outside the realms the question then becomes like do. We have a Diocletian does Diocletian show up or does. It just spin out into nothing much to monitor much to consider I don't know laughter talking about that. Somebody wants to know what about the argument about voting blue for the Supreme Court that's just adorable that people think those are the stakes of the moment are we gonna lose five four or six three. Oh God are they gonna close. The one abortion clinic still open in the below the mason-dixon line oh my god. This is like these are the questions of the moment not will our. Systems be able to sustain the pressure on their that they're on the right now and whether there's any alternative. We could proper to just terminal decline which is not out to have the possibility it's happened before what do you secure societies.

The thought they had the world by the balls from themselves very quickly disabused of that notion. It just feels impossible because everything that's going so static our whole lives and honestly. This feels like this feels like it's like one of those movies where the kid has nightmares about like zombies or something and he keeps being keeps waking up and be like oh god. I thought that was real as a dream and then finally the dream is real. That's what this feels like this feels like we're bringing a ticket. We brought this out upon ourselves with our own. We made a collective death wish out of hitting like the cold sack of human possibility like we topped out at like Nietzsche's last man. It's like we worked in escape velocity whatever version of humanity there's going to be others others on this planet others on other planets and other dimensions. There will be others to get it right but we the dog we topped out at like Nietzsche's last man didn't get beyond that and then spiritually and destroyed ourselves and destroyed our environment oh well. There you go maybe that day. Then we gave it our shot right.

We tried we tried but either way I don't think the Supreme Court seat is gonna be decisive. So it's possible that this is the last he is the last president. Yet the last recognize president don't probably be presidents. But they won't be. It'll be like Pope's and anti-popes and it won't be in till way later than any of them get officially designated as having been official. There will be no universally recognized president after Trump. It's a real possibility because I can see them canceling the election.

In November I can see the military stepping in if that happens I could see I could see a disputed ballot. I could see Trump dying. I could see a lot of side could see Biden time. The one thing I just want is give me a debate I want to watch it. Debate I want to see the debate I'm not going to get too cocky and say give me the sons debate because I'm not none of us could ever deserve that in this life that's too perfect. That's too much of a gift. I mean my god oh but just give me a regular debate couple of them. Just the old-timer is dying around on stage. Both of them absolutely like suited to the gills like Trump obviously of like a first base lines worth of adderall before going up there like he does during all debates and I don't know what we do cocktail they've gotta fight back some sort of like medieval poultice that they shove up his ass or like something like some sort of like candy flip like psychedelic thing that activated is like MKULTRA fruit conditioning so you could like you turned into or like a perfect wind-up doll. I don't know either way. Let me see it let me see it yeah doesn't. It look like I literally are being enlightened like don't you guys just feel the enlightenment vibrating and wafting off yeah. They come out with both of them with the adrenalin needle from pulp fiction just sticking out of their chests. They don't even notice it the whole debate but sadly there probably won't be a debate because this is a dark timeline in not necessarily the darkest but one of the darker ones one of the darker toast settings that's for sure oh boy definitely like on the bottom half of the Pluto setting dial.

You know you know I generally like it a little lighter than that. Personally. This is a little too Carboni. I'm not a fan like just click click click give you just a few more a hair hair little like golden brown oh boy alright. Let's see all right here's a good one following up a previous question. If the u.s. Ever gets balkanized what Yuri did what do you want to live in and why okay well.

There are strategic and political considerations to go into here California looks very promising to a lot of people because it looks like they have effective governance that it looks like they have a guy whose thing even if you think he's a creep or Patrick Bateman wannabe he's competent. They have like same political party in charge. They have systems that generally work they have like. They have very similar governments in power in the areas near by them so they don't have to worry about hostility for them. In fact they could join into a Cascadia type deal with with Washington or Oregon but then you think things like well. Where's the water where you get the water from. They're very vulnerable on that score especially Southern California and then you've got the fact that the people who are gonna want that water are gonna be the heavily armed psychos of Arizona. They're gonna need that water too and they're going to be in probably a stronger defense posture than the California militia if by Kurt Schlichter.

Reading is correct anyway that could be bad the Midwest. It's gonna fall. Kanai's instantly because as I said it's the Balkans of America oh I could see somewhere around the Great Lakes because there you got water and there are things that are not totally crazy. I kind of hate to say like where I grew up the problem is is that Wisconsin would immediately develop into a race war. There would be a genocide a race war unless Wisconsin that would be genuinely horrifying and I would not want to have I would not want to involve. Myself in I would not want to go there to kill peak black people which is what would happen in Wisconsin. So that's not good. I think maybe once again maybe Minnesota V Minnesota. Because they got the mid-late they got to Mississippi even if they don't have the leg and they do have a lake up top so alright Minnesota again damn. It's Minnesota might just be the best country in that state and goddamn it yeah maybe they feel.

It's the the Imperium or if we could get. Felix is like one of the tetrarch's in this new crisis of the third century. I'd be happy to I would be happy to tell them the the tow the fields in his domain. Absolutely he would have my axe I I would he would have my sword I would be his vassal hopefully. I could get like a nice fiefdom out of it. Little fiefdom ass like maybe in the North Woods of Wisconsin which is really cool this little fiefdom. When I get out somebody. Like you know the local peasants they bring me. You know a Game Boy. They bring me maybe you know just like some pizzas. A certain number of like big wheels of cheese smoked hams that kind of old timey. You know it's just like a little feudal lord guy so he do that please Felix. That's I may be asked. If I have to go to war. We have to go to war with Wisconsin or fend off Canadians. Then yes we will have to join your militia of course and provide a motion of the form of combat. That's nice. Certainly I would never pick in the north east in any way good lord nightmare region. Awful just the instant die-off would be terrifying oh. I don't think I'm like thinking about it. We love our folks we love to work at the Olive Garden and they'd give the money to the boss loved it. They loved it. They loved working at the Olive Garden I own dead-ass that ass indeed that ass will I be doing these rants live at the FEMA can I certainly hope so presumably if these guys are smart.

If these guys are smart. They're gonna give you like a room for fake dissent so that you could be mollified which is always a like. That's what the Chinese need to learn from us and they will when this cooperation happens. It's gonna thin both ways like we're gonna get more authoritarian. But the Chinese are gonna loosen up because they're gonna see first hand as they cooperate with us oh my god. This First Amendment. It poses no threat. It's a it's a total. It's a steam vent for all their anger and I'll gets pissed away into nothing and then they start building. Little totally arbitrary factions and start fighting each other. Then they don't even notice you're there. It's the best and that's whether there have been gonna be the final resolution of that dialectic. It's gonna be like soon Oh American corporatism. So that's my prediction. So no American corporatism brought to you by Amazon and Alibaba. All right guys I thought that was pretty good.

I think I'm gonna get what Chris to put this one up. Because this was fun. I feel like if you got just an interesting metaphysical questions and stuff. We don't always get the opportunities I feeling a few invited okay with vital. I don't want to right now why don't write something but thank you guys for hanging out with me. I might hang out for a little bit more the food's already having fried chicken smells. Delicious alright guys sleep well get ready to work labor I'm for the glory of the American Republic and the Chinese Communist Party for which it stands b -bye.
