Ah there we go that took a minute took a minute but it worked now we're here. We're here hello hello how you guys doing ah chatting it up chatting it up two days probably not gonna do tomorrow. So I wanted to get one in here beautiful day. The city feeling good my grill isn't here yet but when I get it I'm gonna go to town and as I said I hope you guys are the first to find out you guys will be the first to see the the setup which will be very very elementary. Don't roast me. I'm a virgin driller I don't need a bunch of smart aleck remarks and also maybe show you how I do it. How I cook it up. We'll see not yet though right now. I'm in here. I'm in here looking out the window trying not to get my neighborhood mad at me again although now it would be more than just him because it's it's grilling season. So I got neighbors very close on every side and someone's gonna call the cops if I start if I keep hollering out there. So I'll try to haul her in here keep hollering about the anoobas right here for you people and not get me in trouble with the police or anything.

I definitely don't need a couple of freakin Staten Island NYPD Psychopaths to show up and put me in a chokehold well thank you hell yes. The Snider cut will be released and I gotta say I mean it is absolutely a symbol of great a bankruptcy and it's a symbol of just the lack imeem. They're doing this because one they're out of ideas and two. They literally can't make other movies right now. This is just a way to to take something that they have and had no use for and now can actually get some money from I mean they're plotting the silver. Ayers assignment that the economy is specifically the entertainment economy is in a crisis that it might not recover from it if it does it won't look the same but at the same time god I want to see it if it's really three and a half hours three and a half hours of superhero movies by a guy who hates superheroes. Specifically. Superman god they'll be great. It'll be fun. I can't wait 2021 hope. We make it guys hope you make it BAM hope. We make it so that we can all be in our third quarantine and watch the Snyder cut.

I started watching this the plinky review. But the thing is I didn't watch the show and I don't care I'm on Star Trek. So it's like I can't actually get into this I still like those guys obviously and I like their Star Trek stuff Star Wars stuff. But I'd never check II honestly. Podcasts might be might be one of the few things to survive. I mean not necessarily the ad-supported ones but just because of the overhead compared to other entertainment products. It can be viable in a way that that a lot of these other ones might not be yeah that's the other thing as a podcast. It can be done in quarantine. I mean they can't shoot movies right now. If they wanted to. They wanted to make more money off their investments. Like the the sunk costs of all the debt service for the for all the maintenance of the physical plant they can't do it. Anybody can still be recording podcasts. Everyone of course that means you could get a real because we thought we hit peak podcast but that was before this now podcasting you know becomes one of the only viable entertainment sectors that could reliably produce new material. People say animated movies sure but those turn the turnarounds much much slower and of course barrier for entry is much higher so we might finally get to the Andy Warhol. Everyone has a podcast that spends 15 minutes on the iTunes top hundred. I don't hate Chris Hedges I just think that he is 

He's exactly the kind of guy. You don't want on your side in any kind of argument because he embodies all of the most off-putting elements of of left of political culture. The stiff-necked Puritanism of like the Congregationalist reformers of the 19th century and like those people hat were allies but they should not be shaping arguments on behalf of the left because they're not really pitching towards those people well. I by which I mean regular people. How do I feel about destiny the streamer how why would you ask me that come on people. What am I think of Rhys was Richard Jewell. I've said this before. So I won't to say too much more. But I think it's fantastic. I think it's amazing I feel like for all the missteps and sort of half-assed hit a goddamn home run just not even trying to. I don't even know but where maybe he was. Maybe. He was trying to get something with other projects that he couldn't quite put into words and this is finally the right combination of like true story. Point-of-view character stakes to actually stick it because Eastwood's movies and you can look back and even the really bad one.

This is like American sniper which is a terrible movie that has awful politics. But in addition to that is a shitty fill it is a bad even as an action movie. The action scenes are dog. Of course there's CGI instead of real squibs of course. First shot of the movies had blown somebody away from long distance and of course. It's squib city. It's the CGI city even as an action film. It fails but he's been trying to say something about the crisis of American masculinity which of course people then trying to articulate for decades now and I think he got he's been trying to get at essential quality of it. An essential conflict of the heart of like trying to be a guy in America when the when you're in a transitional state a way for valuing the the sort of male attributes that built the society and the social structure that you were brought into but are now the material conditions are changing but of course they're changing ahead of the change in the culture and that creates this space of vertigo and this is uncertainty and how do we fill it and very few movies talk about that I mean they're too anxious about the subjects. They're just gonna primly like toxic masculinity or if they're you know just. And they're just gonna bat you know going to reaction airily just wallow in toxicity for its own sake without even reflecting on it. I feel like Eastwood is actually not. He's not trying to trigger the lips as funny as much as they pitch that movie Australia to villagers and as much honestly as the logline makes it look like. It's supposed to treated the libs innocent man who's just trying to save the day is harassed by the fake news media academia and the FBI just like it's certain. Someone I know the actual movie itself is not like that the actual movie itself is an incredibly perceptive and nuanced examination of how class intersects with masculinity and whiteness of course also really good and I want to do it.

So I want to do. A I want to do an episode with me and we'll where we just talk talk about it sound streaming now. So I think soon we're gonna. We're gonna watch. It. I don't know what we might do a commentary track but honestly I think we might just do a regular episode. It'll be one of the rare ones where we're talking about a movie.

[09:39](https://youtu.be/8xHGpgkQSik?t=09m39s)

That's actually on argh. An ironic. Lee really really good and not something where you're trying to pick the the like. This is a real gem a cut gem. That's it as it were since these would is a Goya's hell away right. No that's the wrong way I've showered shut up. I didn't see dragged across concrete because I I knew like kiss. Rena has his last two movies almost like a week after they left theaters were on streaming on Amazon. So I just thought I'd wait and then and then should grant across concrete went to Cinemax which I don't have and now I'm honestly just it's spiked. I will not pay money to see it. So. I'm just gonna have to wait for it to eventually because I know that the minute I had smoke coming out of it. I do not know how to do that. I see that I see that wall is on you have it still that's a hell of a coup. I honestly would not want to talk to Jacob wall just because I don't want to pierce the veil.

He's doing something that's operating at such a higher level than most other people in in comedy and it's certainly in political comedy. I mean most importantly like when you consider the the wasteland that is political comedy. In this country. The absolute just nadir the level of quality. I mean my god while the comedy is so bad under Trump that people think we're funny. Our show is funny because compared to everything else. It actually kind of is and I think that Moore's just speaks to the absolute paucity of the of the genre in this age of Trump the inability of anybody to figure an angle that is actually funny for it so with that the case with with comedy so. In politics wall is the king whoa is is absolutely killing it because I don't and I can't even I mean. She and II confidence the comparison but honestly it's I think an even level beyond after Andy Kaufman because I feel like Jacob wall has truly gotten to the point where he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him where he doesn't like his. After his performance is either a subconscious or a conscious performance of total submission to the to the psychology of online to the psychology of Fame in the era of the internet the idea that there is no distinguishing figure there is no distinguishing characteristic between good and bad Fame good and glad notoriety good and bad press.

Any of that that all that being a thing is all that matters being a media thing is the only thing that defines your life. It is what separates you from the people who increasingly are seeing their lives. Not only determined by you know spiritual enemy that comes from working jobs as they don't love compromise. Most people Fight Club era but now actually have the wolf at their door materially Lord Lauren. We're gonna see it and then one thing that is almost a sure guide. Ramp away from that is fame. If you've got a little bit of notoriety you can prime the pump and I mean even if that means like I mean that's going all the way through every level of the economy from you know Tom Cruise to to podcasters to to twitch streamers to people with only fans and ChatterBait. Notoriety is the only surefire or mostly surefire escape hatch from just the banality and and and and immiseration of Modern Life and so the best way to secure that is to not care what the attention is like.

Wall truly doesn't care what people think of him in a way that no no internet prankster no Andy Kaufman could ever say my every twisted same thing with all the outright people. You don't want people to think that you're a cop and of course obviously. It's on the left. It's incredibly important like no matter. What your performance is towards somebody noted your hostility or anything. There is some things you won't say and some things you won't do because you want someone somewhere to think that you're doing a good job. You don't want everyone to think you're an Jacob walls. Stick is ensures that everyone will think that he's an idiot because right-wingers don't I mean come on like his stuff is is embarrassing. No one takes it seriously. It undermines the right wing but she's also too absurd for anybody and he's too good at keeping a poker face for anyone to dare suggesting he might be in on it to the degree that he shouldn't be shunned and then just like as an operator. He looks like a clown because none of his ops work they all blow up in his face. It's pure entertainment value. He's doing it purely to entertain and that entertainment doesn't have to be connected to any feeling about him and that is pure all other entertainment.

There is a ego there's an ego hitching a ride that wants to be seen a certain way by certain people. It might be a very small group. Everyone else but there's someone I want to impress someone I want to recognize what I'm trying to do who catches the wink. Even if it's a very slight wink. They catch the wink wall unlike everyone and then I'm just like I'm saying Sam hide the the Kaufman to everybody. He does not blink and so the I just thought I wouldn't want to talk to him how am I gonna how can I possibly engage with him. I don't want to assume anything about what he really believes and what he really thinks and I certainly can't credit anything. He would tell me is meaning anything.

I mean is he just totally vapid is he a pure product of his environment because his dad is the oath is that as a psycho right-wing media huckster from California an ambulance chaser - I think so and born into this life. I mean maybe he is just that transparent and that's stunted that he has just totally had that worldview impressed upon him to the point that it's translucent even to himself that would be fascinating. But I wouldn't know from his answers if that were the case or if he's on a fifty level irony regression that no one could possibly follow. It's I just don't want to. I don't want to tempt fate. You know I feel like Indiana Jones when they opened the Ark of the Covenant. You close your eyes but if anybody else wants to interview him. I'll probably listen to that yeah but still I'm just curious apparently Brandon Waddell wanted him to named five hot babes that's kind of funny. I won already said Oh Jack Burkman is amazing where the the turtleneck the turtleneck sport jacket combination that it suggests the as Felix said that turtleneck suggests the neck brace that you know he's usually wearing to small claims court fly down at the Muller one. The first big would fly down putting the thing of the MS oh my god I mean he looks like a 90 softcore porn actor. He looks like he was in a movie with Shannon Tweed like yeah hushed encounters or something Tampa. Nice I did not read the tracing angle piece I saw excerpts. If anyone is I mean he's blocked but brace Belden has an account where he went through it and I agree with him.

[18:30](https://youtu.be/8xHGpgkQSik?t=18m30s)

It's just hard not to see it all as a as as part of the score settling because you know yeah. You had the rat libs and you had the and you had those class reductionists and they were all like eye on each other across the across the thoroughfare achter and that whole bernie can't pay him they were keeping their powder dry and now Bernie's gone boom. The guns are back out and it's back to the exact same arguments which is what kind of made me have my moment of realizing oh my god. We're right back where we started like when that whole should people do slurs in DSA thing. It's like how do you not get a just sold drenching horror of deja vu. Knowing that this is the exact same argument which and no one has progressed. All the Bernie campaign did was just give everybody something else to talk about for a while now if he'd won I think over time some of that friction would have resolved itself just through actual engagement with the world. Like Oh.

Bernie's in charge. Now we actually have a project and I think some people would split off and be like no. This I need to maintain my my sanctity but I think a lot of people. A lot of the more good faith people who are there and have to be reckoned with and are ignored by both sides would have come together but sadly it was it was abortive and now a lot of it's just thrown back up the barricades. So it's very disappointing to see. I will say that it's very funny. The trace Michael Tracy is writing this article about how Bernie you know wasn't. He didn't have an American Association a merit because it was too adulterated with the ideas of these radical identitarian Zahn line who he has to please. There was a candidate who had the campaign that Michael Tracy wanted and he recognized that and he supported her and doggedly followed around the place that her name was.

And I saw tells again ever give her stops. Beach I nearly passed out she does exactly what he talked about and flag apple pie blah blah blah that Radley Virgil asked her if she was an anti-imperialist and she said I'm pro-american and of course jaded. Brooklynites rolled her eyes of that but that's exactly the kind of answer. The Michael Tracy would want to a question like that and it got her nowhere and more importantly than it didn't get her door with the art. With the with the voters it got her nowhere with the press and the party either. She was still persona non grata. She was still the craziest sod apologist. She was still someone who no respectable person could engage with so that implies that if Bernie was as indigestion albino party as we all us now know he had to a bend for what they did. He was that indigestion then his gestures towards been rejected and the idea that there are some massive people who aren't paying attention to the media to have that shaped yeah they weren't paying attention. Then they stayed not paying attention. They continued to not pay attention because they are broken off from the political system.

That's what we discovered. During this campaign. Bernie up and no amount of messaging at any minute level of the campaign strategy was gonna change that you needed to change the conveyor belt of ideology to action operating with huge chunks of the working class of this country and the Sanders. Campaign was supposed to help jumpstart the movement but if that was supposed to kick in to create a virtuous cycle and the kicking in never happened and that was and that was because if you're not paying attention you sure. Don't care that he said that he wanted to abolish ice you know if you are not registering these things at the level of political engagement.

So they are essentially useless to you know their information. It's like. SETI tela antenna array or something just a bunch of beeps and Boop's in it on a screen you don't know what they mean because you're not connected to it. It's It's ideal is what it is guys. It's pure fantasy because like I've said this argument is at the level of ideology and it does not engage with the material at all because it's all done online. So that means that all these ideas are purely generated by this fixation on a web conversation that is not being had by the vast majority of people in this country and that there is no not enough connective tissue between whatever the interests might be represented by the hive mind of Twitter or something actually impressing themselves on the part on the political process. More than things that are rooted in I don't know material interest and money with the entire media like the entire to put both parties.

[23:44](https://youtu.be/8xHGpgkQSik?t=23m44s)

It's just like the the task was monumental and they and anyone that wants to talk about campaign strategy at any level being the foundational reason because obviously things were exacerbated by bad decisions in different areas and we can talk about that and I think Tracy and Nagel pointed to one good one which was yet they clearly up South Carolina. Just through the campaigning I don't know anything specifically. But the results speak for themselves in that there was clearly some something whatever they were doing wasn't working and they didn't recognize that time and that birdie should have been campaigning the whole time. He should not have waited until 2000. What mm. Mm 18 I think like the end of 2018 he should have been sort of in the de-facto candidate. The whole time now that would have still been hard because the media has to kind of go along with you on that like by giving you attention and they would not have done so so once again.

A lot of these ended up catching on the question of what where does where do you break these these path dependent cycles between the voters and the media and engage people who are essentially conditioned along certain ways. So but I'm saying those things might have exacerbated it and like I said if and like we always thought the hope was keep the anti Bernie people from uniting until it's too late and that could have worked even with the media against him with a few things with dip things going differently with a smaller Biden victory in South Carolina for one not winning South Carolina that looks like that would never have happened but if they cut that margin down that could have helped that could have changed the contours of the race and then but then let's Corona hits. But you really can't be predicting anything anymore because I think Bernie's still had a chance after Super Tuesday in the conditions of a regular campaign where they're about roughly equal number of Delegates. You don't have the economy collapsing and the giant viral attack and Biden has to campaign regularly. He has to go outside he has to be voters he has to shake hands. He has to give speeches every day like this. The fact that they had were left with the desperate move of going the biten by Bernie that shows that Bernie was a threat and it also left them vulnerable in a longer run.

But of course we never got that for reasons that I don't think anyone could point to as being politically based and certainly not based on. Twitter conversations about abolishing ice legacy of asses has some fun stuff in it and there's plenty of stories. It's true stories of CIA goof ups. But it's got it feels like a limited hangout because it's one of those books where its main put argument is that the CIA is too bad at his job to really be a threat that all of their worst crimes are crimes of incompetence that they then tried to cover up and that's not really true. I mean there were there are a lot of genuine bungles. I mean the way that they got like 500 Eastern Europeans contract agents killed because they kept dropping them into behind the Iron Curtain while Kim Philby is in the room knowing exactly where every one of them went and that they'd never noticed for. It doesn't really talk as much about and it doesn't really talk about MKULTRA to any serious extent or a Kaos operation that went along with COINTELPRO or Gladio and like that which I know is a NATO operation. But the CIA helped set all those organizations up all that post-war Project Paperclip stuff you know it all gets kind of soft soaked but there's still good information in it. Oh man that CIA tweak fuckin'-a Air America don't other Central Intelligence Agency from the Vietnam War creating a heroin Network. Out of nowhere there was opium in Southeast Asia but there was no industrial heroin production until the CIA showed up in the early 60s and turned the Golden Triangle into the world's headquarters for so crack to their own citizens for I mean. They say they saw the heroin in their own servicemen because tongues by the end of the war like a third of the and then they sold crack to their own citizens through a ram contra and and then after Afghanistan was invaded they went from almost eradicating the poppy of crops to becoming now the world and of course as I said Southern Air Transport which was the technical name for air America bought by les Wexner in the 90s used by L brands to ship clothing across the world.

Jesus snow man did mr. Pope. Mr. Conspiracy theory. I gave you all the clues I guess they're just like you know what it masks entirely off. I think we're definitely in the masks off decades.

Cool. Zone decades mask off whatever you want to call home favorite Chris Elliott I really love I love again life. One of my favorite shows seminal comedy influenced as a child but the actual show itself you know you remember as a kid there's bits spew E is the top about a masterpiece. One of the greatest episodes of sitcom television ever Eagle Hearts very good too but goddammit cap cabin boy is such a beautiful little gem 90 minutes. My favorite ice cream is this the stretch it shellye gelato I've had a fancy boy a fancy cheap tastes. It is not Jenny's that is some pizza gay ice cream. No thank you someone saw tremors and says it's perfect thank you correct. It is oh man.

[32:04](https://youtu.be/8xHGpgkQSik?t=32m04s)

I don't know my July 4th I somebody asked about this the magnet protests of the 4th of July. I think everything's gonna be out and about by July 4th and honestly. I'm kind of getting to the point where I think the people who are I mean obviously not the protesters. Those people are buffoons but people who are starting to go out. I think that they honestly as much as people are yelling at them and thinking of them as either selfish which yes very selfish but stupid and ignorant. I kind of think that they have a better grasp of the real dynamics of play here than people who are still a sitting at home and making sure that they don't need to go to their friends houses or something because they mean they might not recognize this but as I have said there is not going to be any cavalry coming there's not gonna be any fixing this in a way that allows us to stay inside indefinitely.

People are gonna have to go back out and as I have said that that's gonna be the attempt to like boost the economy back up and that's why when Trump was saying that thing about how testing is bad given that mindset. It's not stupid to think that because that's gonna undermine consumer confidence now somebody has said after that they've said yeah but it's not gonna work. People aren't gonna come out. I mean economy's still gonna be and so it's still stupid well yeah that is gonna happen. But the thing is the people in charge of us. They are not going to deviate from the courser on this disastrous mutual ruination where you ignore the science and you you you allow the disease to run its riot run riot and try to recreate the retail economy. That is those are incompatible things because people are gonna get too sick to work and people aren't. Gonna want to go outside. They're not. Gonna want to go to the place because it's still dangerous out so that means that it won't work but they're not gonna do anything to change this course until they see that it doesn't work and I'm not saying that in in terms of like being an acceleration assay realistically given the people in charge. Given the constraints given their their rewards given their knowledge and their values and an ideology every vector they will always take well. We could open things back up again and they'll get normal.

It will open things they don't have anything else in the toolbox so they assume this will work. They have to see it not work and when I say not work I mean now we have to do something else because the economy is still collapsed and people are now sicker than ever something. Else has to be done. They will not get to that point until they see it fail. So if that's the case why the hell don't we get it over with see. If somebody says it's it's gonna kill. It wants to kill and nobody's gonna bat an eye yes but people are still gonna stay indoors to avoid getting killed. They're not gonna bat an eye they're not gonna get too mad them government for letting this happen they're not gonna have a revolution but they're also not going to go to the store as much they're not. Gonna go to the bar as much they're not going to go to the restaurants they're not. Gonna spend they're not going to do this spending that has to fill the giant void that got created by demand basically drying up for three months. That reality is going to persist and it's gonna have to be dealt with not in the sense of well shouldn't someone deal with this. In the sense of the thing isn't gonna work anymore like the lights aren't gonna go on. Now. I'm not saying.

It's gonna get to that point. But I'm just going to say that has to be on the table as a possibility to get anything to change to get anything to change. Now what that change is yeah. We could be talking about some nightmare like where we well that's I've talked about this in the past where we hyper police people who are suspected or infected and let everybody else out but honestly the thing that could prevent that is just there's a reason we haven't been able to get together any kind of testing and tracing mechanism even though that would be obviously good for the economy like in the interests of capital getting trusting and tracing together would be in the unn like not in any country. There's no conflict there. There's no like post you know 48 revolution in France. Whoosh whap conflict everybody in charge of everything once testing and tracing because it would allow Commerce and yet we don't have any that means that somewhere along the line there's too many hands out there's too much outsource machinery and infrastructure. There's there's it's too threadbare of a of a of a of an infrastructure that it can't be done. But we can't do it like you say.

The South Korea did it yes. But South Korea has institutions that could be that can be built up and scaled up to handle this. There is nothing that can be scaled anywhere because everything's been auctioned off you would have to go stitch it back together. When what happened to the eurozone did. They get rid of the eurozone. Today I mean that was inevitable. It was an inevitable sin so late honestly it was just gonna be one more push for the Coke machine to fall over I mean. It was inevitable as soon as they created. The EU was doomed as soon as they if as soon as a big enough. Crisis hit it before its political union had like solidified behind it and so since that happened that basically that was the beginning of the end there that was where the tumor was first metastasized. So what happened to it. What happened are they you the eurozone fund got bailed out.

Oh mori austerity for southern Europe that's great ah. Germans man just replace the Panzer with a fountain pen and now goddamn gigabyte him I read folks crazy world's gotta sell tickets. Well somebody says no one's gonna leave the EU because the EU serves the interests of capital that's true but there is a political legitimacy crisis in Europe. Just there is there is us and there are centrifugal forces operating on the EU just as there are the United States and there more intensively at you because the EU identity is much more fragile so there's going to be a conflict between like national level of governing class and the ruling. The ruling you know capital accumulation in Europe and that's that's going to play itself out politically and maybe militarily who knows and that's that same pressures happening in the US. The US it'll take more for the u.s. To have the same fractures. But I think those pressures existed acting like they're not that they can't go anywhere. I think you're all Domecq anyone who says any of that like nothing will happen.

[41:08](https://youtu.be/8xHGpgkQSik?t=41m08s)

After that you are assuming that we recover with a speed and and smoothness that I just don't know is not. I mean I'm not saying. It's definitely not gonna happen. But I'm saying 50/50 I have decided as a way to like clear my head of all these questions of what's gonna happen. Then I'm going to follow the Chuck Klosterman role which is that everything is a 50/50 proposition either can happen or a camps. That's it it's binary so therefore there's a 50/50 chance of anything happening and I know that's glib and it's kind of just jackassery. But I you know. I think it's a good way just for your own mental health to deal with the questions of the future. Both big and small for who's gonna win the presidential election. Do you know will the United States exist in ten years and the thing is is that when those things happen they will look very clearly Oh. Obviously this was yes but from this vantage point.

It's the 50/50 do you do any kind of meditation at all yes ever since my moment in my garden I have been committing to daily daily sittings. I had a really good one today. I'm really really I've been groping around with it. You know trying to see what works for me. But I found I found some really today was really great. I'll just say that I feel I feel centered. So I recommend it to anybody who who feels like they're don't have their their lives are a little too forget. It just is they are finding it hard to find themselves in a presence you know like too reactive or to to wool gathering you know being in in a moment that's a good way to be in a moment to train yourself over time to be more in a moment. I hate mindfulness is awful because it's been like everything else colonized and turned into neoliberal mind warfare. But that's true of everything including Marxism to an extent but it's still good advice. The problem is is that it just it doesn't you don't know what it means because it's just a word. You have to actually like build up an understanding of it over time. That's why it's hard to communicate this kind of stuff to somebody.

You don't know oh man Wisconsin supper clubs whoo grand tradition very that leftover from Prohibition they released. They were prohibition-era speakeasies. It sort of evolved into restaurants their heyday was post-war era of course like it wasn't everything. In America. There are these CD well. They work CD but they were. They're very dark. Great. Darks will fill the cigarette smoke. A huge curved dark leather banquettes almost no direct lighting very very dark and everything is just a giant overpriced hunk of meat and of course. A fish fry on Friday whoa people are bellowing. Tonight is it a full moon forget buck. I don't go outside anymore. I said earlier I don't want. My neighbors get mad at me. I get too excitable sometimes I've been working out lately but problem is I can't really modulate myself oh right at seven o'clock. That's why everyone's going crazy. I totally forgot oh geez.

[46:05](https://youtu.be/8xHGpgkQSik?t=46m05s)

No man fish. Fry is that is that is the inlet that's Third Coast. That's the that's the Catholic. The Catholic Midwestern Heartland Friday fish fry baby have I had crawfish oh god yeah. They're not really worth the work honestly. But I remember one time I was in New Orleans and I had a giant huge just cartoonishly heaping pile of catfish I've eaten of crayfish and just work through them. My fingers got like bright red. It was fun you know what I'm not honoring the boaters cuz. Dam rupture in Michigan that's gonna. Maybe I don't know poison half the state because the owned he refused to do repairs on it that were required or I guess suggested I guess the rules don't apply anymore at all. I just I don't understand it. At no point. Was he just like coerced by the state into disgusting boat sheds who live on the lake and benefit from this artificial lake that was created for a recreation that they that they pay for it and they say no you're making money off. It. You pay for it like all of you pigs should be paying for this and instead they.

Legionnaires disease and goddamn microcephaly and it is an exact historical echo of the Johnstown Flood. In late in robber baron era Pennsylvania. It was a private. Straw boaters on I'm thing exploded and killed the entire town and nobody got in trouble at all. It's good to know that we've progressed so yeah but those boaters are two just disgustingly Pig selfish to conceive of any version of a public good and that they can all respect devoted boaters and now I don't know anymore. I don't know if I could respect these boaters if they don't have any kind of Civic understanding. It's sad - this boats are cool but the kind of things that need to go in you hear. It go on in your life to make you get a boat in this country basically disqualify you from common humanity yeah. If it was Dunkirk. None of those beautiful boaters would cross the channel to save their troops. They would watch TV and they would complain that nobody else is doing it. Not one of them would think to go.

Them somebody wants to know about declining birth rates. I mean that's a consequence of ease of life of us of comfort so soft that'll that dumb mean about the hard times making soft people or whatever the soft by the way things. It's a it's a byproduct of of alien material. An alienation giving way to to spiritual alienation just like there's a there's a sweet spot where people want to have a couple of kids and that keeps you know birth rates going and but you get to a point and you're either too comfortable to really even conceive of a future and you've totally focused on your personal pleasure. So why would you need other people around from the future or what happens in countries like the US as opposed to more you know advanced countries without with higher standards of living is that everybody is so terrified of losing their middle-class status that they can't have a kid. But if you don't have any more of that fear of falling you'll have many more kids the fact you have to have kids. It's you. It's about finding a sweet spot of like assimilation and technology and and and I mean it's not gonna be a problem. Anybody's gonna have in the future I don't think unless of course.

Plastics have really done the number which is of course the scarier idea which is that it's not just you know a social phenomenon or not just not only a social phenomenon. It's the result of the endocrine system and very well could be just decimating sperm counts and like that and making it making us all literally literally infertile like we could be going into children of men territory children and then one of my favorite movies. But it looks like we might beat that to the punch like right now it looks like yeah yeah birthday. Plastic thing we get that but we're probably gonna do something else some something involving climate change and probably this virus. This virus looks like something interesting we could probably work with that but ya know it's good to have in the hip pocket you know down the road if we make it through this good to know that we've got the impending mass sterilization caused by by I'm the presence of with the little arms they extincted us without even trying. Can you believe it those. You know they were animals.

You are an advanced species. You know you're doing and you keep doing it. Anyway you are much stupider than dinosaurs and they killed your ass without even being alive. Apparently. Dinosaurs are natural gas not oil but guess what we're also using that. My favorite dinosaur as a kid was probably the Triceratops because they're at the Milwaukee Public Museum which you go to when you were a kid in Wisconsin. Milwaukee was the pick the field trip location well that front for me. Anyway we went to the Milwaukee yes Museum public. As iam. We have a big thing. It's like a dark chamber into the chamber. There's this plastic t-rex that he's eating the Triceratops. It's on its side and it's got like the guts. In his mouth. I don't know why I mean I guess I a fight with the Triceratops which probably is a great. But what do you do. Brontosaurus is not a real dinosaur. I'm glad somebody enjoys the Triceratops. What do.

I think of the parallel universe discovered by NASA. I'm just sitting over here. We alike yeah no no certainly nothing that I do not that I not anticipate so all coming together. All systems are coming into focus but yes parallel dimensions parallel realities. Those exist there's no question about that. Just the only question is whether they're accessible. This indicates that they're accessible which is who if we can actually access that then we're living in rick and morty world and that would be pretty epic if we have the rick and morty time portal world or the dimensional portal world. We get some dimensional cable up in here I'd appreciate that I'm sure it's not true because I don't know anything about science. But I'm going to choose to believe it's true because it helps reify a worldview and attitude that I think is beneficial for me in the long term.

So I am just going to just choose to believe that that's true that they've discovered parallel dimensions and that one day I will get to go to the America where they never. Firefly and there's 15 seasons of Firefly for me to watch oh that would be so great zip over there get the mind disks and of course a mind disc player don't want to just have one without the other zip over to watch them. All there. Thank you I am having a pretty good dad feeling good oh man if we got to live in sliders that would really redeem a lot of the shitty stuff. It's like yes yes I'm sorry everything's sucked but you get to go to all these different universes check out the version of you that that actually knew how to dump it that could here's the version of you that could dunk a basketball live and get to check out that guy's life for a while. How awesome would that be wicked. Maddie I wish I would love to be with a scientist of that renowned and ability come on what does the ideal slider burger.

Ah you know what I've had fancy ones I've had ones on little plates and at elegant openings and events. I've had them at reclaimed-wood fancy gastro pubs with beer flights available White Castle baby that's right White Castle oh god damn that's good. Oh those greasy little guys just pop them in two bites no one bite bang oh. They're so good when I get a culvert as I get the butter burger. I mean nothing's as good as that butter burger because the butter burger is so much better than other fast food hamburgers where I was like they have a really good chicken sandwich and they also have a pork tenderloin sandwich which you will not not find at most other fast-food restaurants. But the burg is so much better than other birds. It's got the crispness at the edge Oh God when do I have my new grill hopefully next week so just crossed all right. I'm gonna sign off in a minute here. So a couple questions. Then I'm gonna go make my dinner which will not be like acyl. Gotta remind myself.

No White Castle. It's gonna be a regular car charcoal. I don't want to with a grill with a propane tank. I also don't really have room but I did get thank you. The one got the person who recommended the the stove type thing the stovetop. The stovepipe starter I got one of those thank you now. I'm gonna be set. I might have to get what kind of apron would go well maybe a Brewers apron. That'd be fun. I will I will stream. I will stream. I swear it as God is my witness. I shall stream my grillings when I begin them when I commenced the grillings my first vote for my virgin grill voyage before I do anything bigger will be with. You guys how about that. I promise alright guys see you soon.
