Oh I hate these ad brakes I gotta wait forever to find out if I'm actually on the thing stream or not. There's got to be a better way. Oh wait a minute I didn't click on it. Idiot now. It's the commercial there. I am there's me hello I'm on TV on the Internet. How's everybody doing everybody feeling good feeling good whoo all right What's up beautiful day here beautiful day not too hot. The backyard grilling zone is got a nice cool breeze running through it. You got the sink back here. All the trees. It's very nice. But I do think I should get some more plants back here if I sign up if I keep this place for another year. I'll definitely get the trees or get plans for next next spring. It's chill zone and it grows off its true. So I was thinking about continuing on something I was talking about yesterday talked about statues because apparently that's what the protests are now about getting rid of statues. Whether it's good to do that. I think if anybody saw the stream yesterday they'd know where I would they imagine where I would probably be on that and they're correct.

This is another example of people dealing with or refusing to deal with the lack of a structure the lack of any kind of meaningful deliberative body that can create policy and then implement it through people who are dedicated to a cause. It's all we really have is a bunch of people who are sick of. But the problem comes and this is the exact. Same thing that happened with occupy is that because you don't have deliberative processes and you don't have discipline within a movement. People kind of gravitate towards certain things as actions as goals that substitute for the greater goal that is not really pursuable without a structure. Like you need a structure to really pursue the kind of huge radical changes to policing that are being demanded right now. And we don't have that so people point to people gravitate towards things in front of them that have a concrete meaning that occupy that meant eventually the Occupy movement became about staying in the part. It was it was specifically we're gonna stay here nothing more dramatic than that which meant that when when they decided to break it up that was pretty much the end of it and now we're in a similar situation. At least it looks like we'll see like I said everything is changing. Nothing is is fixed but the momentary conditions our that knocking over statues feels really good and so people wanna knock over statues and God bless them go for it. You know as a team-building exercise what could be figuring out how to pull some stupid chintzy.

Confederate factory-made hollow. Easter bunny ass piece of shits sculpture down. That's what funniest thing about all these all those daughters of the arrival of the American Revolution. Confederate monuments that are up there they're all absolute. They're hollow they cost like five bucks. They're mass-produced. It was all part of a propaganda campaign at the time. At the turn of the century. They're not art in any meaningful sense so people are knocking them over and they're having fun and people like hey let's knock over in Columbus. Let's knock over the founding fathers let's knock over a US Grant which I mean I get what today I wouldn't do that I wouldn't knock over I wouldn't knock over a grant statue but I can't really blame anybody for doing whatever they want because like I said all we're doing is determining the moral morality of the action because the question of whether it's an effective or meaningful thing is beside the point because we couldn't stop them if we wanted to nobody can stop anybody from doing anything because nobody is ordering anyone to do anything because there's no structure the hope of this Bernice campaign.

In my mind. The big hope was to give structure to the the burgeoning alienation with with capitalism as it's being practiced in this country and sadly it did not have last long enough and then it ran headlong into the social isolation of Kovan to do that and now people are once again trying to re reimagine. A practice without without a movement and without coordination coordination is the most important part coordination is what takes the numbers the raw numbers and makes them. Effective coordination was what makes it possible for you to do thing like shut down the ports like they did last week in San Francisco. But that's because that's a Union and it's a radical Union. One of the most radical unions in the country still yeah the dockworkers there Gus halls old union communist party hotbed throughout the 20th century. Now we the rest of the country doesn't have that and so something like pulling down a statue feels like it's.

It's it's doing something. But it's not really I mean you could pull down statues as part of celebration of a new power of taking put coming in and changing. You know the the cultural matrix. The cultural value system but pulling down the statues doesn't make that happen. It's a result of the fact that we've totally confused the symbolic illness and the material realms and we really do think because we operate almost exclusively in our lives at the symbolic level that with the symbolic order will somehow filter down to change the material conditions and it don't work that way changes changes that appear that that occur purely at the symbolic and cultural level will be recuperated always by the material conditions if they don't change so. That's why it's always a bummer to see something like okay. Now we're all going to talk about statues and who should pull down and who should go up. I'm actually with Matt bruenig and the idea that there shouldn't really be statues of individuals that's kind of messed up really. I mean you're turning this person into a god. I mean that's what they did isn't they've been a statue of like Caesar or Titus or something.

They were that was part of the beautification of the Emperor's. The only humans. The only humans that should have statues are fictional characters like Robocop and the Fonz or local heroes. Like some guy who like assembled a really big ball of twine or you know save some babies for a from a from a well or something I mean my god you know do you really think humans make history individually. What are you 12. We are all merely able to operate in the narrow confines given to us by our place and time and births the idea that any the people individuals make history. No they make that individuals make history but not as they please this mark set and but anyway so I don't really care about the statutes either way. I don't care if we get rid of every statue. David Roth is pointing out they're not even good to look at their base. They're almost always the most boring part of any public public art. Installation. Abstract statues tend to be much more interesting than ones of specific people. But the degree to which the moment becomes about defending or condemning. The removal of statues is the degree to which people have given up on changing the actual conditions and turned them into a fight over symbols. A culture war is it worth and I could very well see a world where by November the entirety of this moment of unrest and revolt has been boiled down to a yes/no question about like should we get rid of Mount Rushmore or something like that but it doesn't have to be that way things can change. Things are always changing I'm just saying right now. It's not a good development that I'm not personally terribly thrilled with it.

[09:42](https://youtu.be/TNNps_twJTU?t=09m42s)

And it's it certainly doesn't speak to strength. It speaks to confusion and and powerlessness but that is the defining characteristic of Americans. So it makes sense I will say that the re-litigating the Civil War and what caused it. I'm always up for that because that's one where it's like really a slam dunk like there's no way to argue with it. If there's only the only way you can make it arguable is if you decide to pull some sort of rhetorical trick and change definitions or something the the sectional crisis in America that led to the Civil War was caused by a very one thing above all else that on the continent of the United States the land the ritual a black soil that allowed for mass cultivation of staple cash crops not staple crops. Cash crops like tobacco and cotton was largely confined to the southern states and the thing about cash crops is in a context like America right where you've cleared out the native inhabitants and you have this huge tracts of free real estate as tim heidecker would call it the only way that you can get that you can create an economy of scale there that will make growing something like cotton or tobacco that profitable is if you have basically free or low or incredibly low cost labor and the problem with that from colonial. Like a of the perspective of of the comp of the colonizers was even if they wanted to use colonizers to do that they couldn't have because when you have that kind of abundance that kind of abundance in real estate as it were there's no way in hell that you could pay people enough to do the work because it sucks it's terrible the reason that they were able to put all those rips into the dark.

Satanic Mills is that they did closed all the free pasture lands. Before that. They people had no condition they had nowhere to go all the land was owned. They had nothing to do but work in the factories in a colony. No no colonists could ever be made to work picking cotton at a price that would make picking that cotton worth picking worth worth creating a profit for the investor for the person who the aristocrat who owned the land because they could just leave. They could just go get. They'd say. You. I'll go over the village. I'll go over the thing and I'll just I'll live in the fitnah in the Hills. I'll grow corn and I'll make whiskey just like they did in the north just like the small colonists in the north and in Appalachia.

The person who's doing that that work has to have no choice. They have to have nowhere to go so hey if their skin brands them as part of a class that is unfree labor. Then they don't have any options they have to work for whatever they have to work for for on the terms of their owner as it were because they've been pulled out of there. They're where they're from.

The first generation slaves that no no English language total disorientation across the land and then put into a place where there's nowhere to go because if you're there people know you're not supposed to be and that's the thing that they could never have done to any colonists and that's why indentured servitude kind of went away over time because they say you and that's where it all started from like everyone West Side West. Like oh it was a tariff said whatever it's like well yeah but why did the South not want Terrace because they were an export economy because they were exporting cotton like the fillet that was it because they it was a class. It was a classic a Latta fundus situation where you had these these decadent plantation owners with no interest in seeing development. They didn't care about roads and schools and any of that. They wanted profits for them and that meant low tap tariffs so that they could sell so that they could so that they could pay as little as possible for imports. In the north. They have industry because they didn't have those huge swathes of bottom land that could be turned into slave plantations. People had to work as the yeoman farmers the flinty New England farmers so-called flinty because New England soil is basically rocks so everything that comes out of it all the conflicts.

All the conflicts that you can point to and say wasn't slavery was X it wasn't slavery was Y they all emanate from that structural material reality then assess the necessity of slave labor to make plantation agriculture viable over time that changes is the mechanics change or whatever but at the in the early stages when you screech the structures that then become reapered self-reproducing social orders which the South created very quickly that wasn't the case and so that means that during the Civil War the Union was the progressive side. I mean if you're talking about good guys or bad guys. That's dumb because that doesn't really apply historically that's not really a thing for the most part and in terms of like grants sweep like individuals can behave virtuously but but for the most part states don't they operate from self what they perceive as self-interest and so you have different self-interest between the northern and sort of political class. The hegemonic political class of North in the southern political class hegemonic political class.

This office remember there are tons of white Southerners who didn't want to break away and in fact fought the Confederacy and resisted it being drafted and and in the case of western Virginia literally seceded from it and those places coincidentally where the places where plantation agriculture was least prevalent because it was too hilly was too rocky wherever there were mountains in the south. Eastern Carolina's of the western carolinas eastern tennessee kentucky western virginia northern met northern hmm. Even in the deep deep south there were huge pockets of resistance to the confederacy in northern ie appalachian mississippi and alabama. But the America was the progress of the United States. The union was the progressive force and I think like there's there is this sort of like too clever by half leftist moves. Sometimes to say a lot of this actually you see with like black radicalism and stuff that doesn't want to give the white man any credit which hey I understand not want to give white people any credit for anything. But where it says oh the north was actually just trying to clamp down and impose like its industrial capitalist hell economy on the rest of the country and the thing is is that that didn't really exist.

[17:21](https://youtu.be/TNNps_twJTU?t=17m21s)

Yet. In 1860 it was still in. It's in it was still proto. I mean the vast majority of America of the cotton that was made in the south went to Europe went to England specifically because that's where the industrialization hurt started earliest and that's where it was most intense. That's where the the capacity for turning raw cotton into finished linen whatever was was most advanced. The u.s. Didn't become an industrial economy really until after the Civil War. For the same reason that the British did the war is a capitalist is a war tends to in the modern context accumulate capital in such a way to to to boost all of the the present. But the present conditions the present progressive moves towards industrialization. Not like if you have a process of industrialization. It is radically accelerated by war by the strike by the state investment in industry that comes with fighting a war. We were made into an industrial capitalist society by the Civil War. The same way that the Napoleonic Wars are what made England into the paramount industrial power of the 19th century but nobody knew that at the time guys like Lincoln weren't fighting for industrial hegemony they were fighting for the Whig ideal which was the small holding farmer in equal competition with are in an equal position with all other strata of society with when it comes to rights and abilities and in an equal position with anyone who would hire him because you could get land and of course.

This is all based on expert for exportation of Native American land. It's all based on the the the and that is the foundational difference between the United States and and the European countries were always comparing ourselves to the cultural. All the cultural distinctions come from the reality of a continents worth of land that has been decided is free because the people who are on it aren't really people as they as Tim Robinson would say on. They so I think usually they're not really supposed to be here. It's ok that's what that's what makes America what it isn't.

The Whig idea was like I said if you get rid of slavery and then white man is not competing with slaves and this became eventually the hegemonic belief of of white northerners generally including Democrats which is what led to the Democratic Party breaking up in 1860 is that they would not accept a southern candidate. They would the northern Democrats would not accept the the southern half of the party dictating their candidate which before they would have been fine with. But by 1860 the the sectional crisis and specifically the border war in Kansas had really changed that and and white people white men in the north we're becoming more and more aware of the idea that they were in competition in some way with slavery as a economic institution and so they they were like no. We don't want that the Whig idea that Lincoln ended up taking to the White House was you get rid of slavery and every every man will have the freedom to either engage in profitable work for an employer or if they don't like those conditions.

They can off and be a yeoman farmer because hey look what we just did with Homestead Act I mean that the Homestead Act was America's land reform agenda. The kind of thing that would have been impossible in in any European country without a war and and the thing that led to most of the right-wing coos in Latin America in the night in the 20th century was land reform. We were able to do it because the people we were export braiding land from weren't existing stakeholders like United Fruit or whatever in Central America. In the 50s they were Native American tribes weren't part of what we consider to be the polity and so they could be pushed aside and that gave this that opened these huge expanses and that created this this notion that hey we can have like an egalitarian. The the Jeffersonian model made real but of course over the course of the war to defend that you create this industrial behemoth that pretty much that in the decades after the Civil War swallows everything and then I think what a lot of people do is.

They look backwards through that lens and say this was inevitable and everyone. At the time I knew they were doing this and neither of those is true. I don't I hope nobody was thinking that out. I'm saying that like slaves couldn't resist their enslavement of course. They did but it was sure it was. It was a categorically different thing to try to withhold labor as an enslaved person with with your with your color branding your position as one as a slave. Then a colonist who's like hired who would hypothetically be hired to pick cotton and then could literally just walk off whenever he wanted to if he wasn't getting enough money to make it worthwhile to do and there was no and there was no way that could have worked because the thing about those those large-scale cash crop industries is that the actual work was awful. I mean cotton wasn't even the worst of sugar was honestly one of the most nightmarish existences possible being a slave at a sugar plantation. There's not enough money you could pay a free person to make them do that especially in a condition where they could of material abundance where they could find their own sustenance elsewhere.

I saw this travel stimulus thing god. That's so funny just trip. Here's here's a tax credit to go on a vacation well. I do think a Democrat would have come up with that one oh. It's so good and of course. It's not even a free money. It's a goddamn tax credit which means you have to have four grand that you don't that you cannot see until next year in your tax return wild. As we know the four kovin will have something like half of Americans don't have $500 to go through an emergency situation and yet know. They're gonna do it so that everybody who is four grand to sit to not be in their bank account for a year or more and to go on vacation. When the goddamn virus is still everywhere when it's going like wildfire through all of the red states. As anyone could have predicted the whole time we were sitting sitting tight here in New York and all the rubes were yuk-yuk. In the reply was just wait and now the boom could have predicted except everyone that's what's happening. So you're saying hey you guys go into the heart of a plague outbreak or come from one to a place that doesn't have one one way or another make sure to mix it up make sure to mix it up.

You could just give people the money you could keep into the money which would stimulate local economies and that would even if echt places that have a tourist based economy because people still live there and they still have to live you know buy things. But it's harder because they don't have income well your place. The income how about that with actual money oh dear okay can you imagine can you imagine such a thing but mcsally's cooked. She's gonna go down as like an all-time loser losing losing and elected to a seat losing it then get up pointing to a different seat and then losing that one Scott Brown level loser oh yeah Scott run Scott Brown won election. Mcsalley was just appointed two-time loser I do like the idea of giving people four grand that they can only spend on a vacation. I mean that would be dumb - you should just keep people money without strings attached. You should always just be keep as long as we're in this hell world of Hell economy and you know as long as as long as we're just at the level of demanding you know redistribution rather than of money rather than power for the love of God. Just give people money strings attached but the idea of giving them people four grand but they have to take a vacation.

I would love to just see what people did with it people who'd never taken a vacation before they're not gonna let that because it's like you either use it or you don't get it so it's like whoo you know. It let's do it and people who've never taken like never gotten on an airplane before or whatever are people who would never think to travel are now doing it. Where would you go. I mean yeah like it would be like a Brewster's Millions situation and that would be awesome I mean if we're gonna have we're gonna be wacky have fun. Let's go all the way like the tax. The tax incentive thing is awful cuz yes just. It's just the same rich will go on vacation anyway. Only now they get to do it for free. Make. People spend the money on a vacation. Real money like give it to them in a form of like a out of like a debit card that's only accepted at certain places like it's only accepted by Airlines. You know the same way like a whit card is limited. You can't buy hot food or whatever can only buy airline tickets and hotels and like restaurants in cities that it knows you don't live in. I do love the idea of somebody taking 4 grand to go like just themselves 4 grand to go to Wisconsin Dells and just live like an absolute maniac at the Dells like just tipping tipping tipping the kid at the Tommy Bartlett thrill world when you come in demanding backstage access at Noah's Ark to see where they like skim out all the in whatever.

But I think that's that mean that and that would be such a perfect. Emblematic moment like the country is clearly teetering on the edge of some sort of significant. I don't want to say collapse because that does sound alarmist and institutions. Like these often are more resilient than you think they are the like I've often supported out. The world economy still needs America to be the employer of last of the consumer of last resort. But it we're still clearly in a freefall away from even the meager status. The meagerly satisfying and in fact mostly miserable status quo that we were slowly coming acclimatized to even that's going away and in the meantime just have everybody go on vacation go in a state subsidized vacation like like Russian factory workers going to the Black Sea. I'm like a package deal with everyone else on their shift amazing let's do it yeah.

That'd be funny take for granted Cuba. Then just like give it to the government China has been building counter hegemony has it because it doesn't really seem to me that right now China is basically just at a joined hegemony. I mean they have there's still like geopolitical rivalry between the United States and and the US or the United Sates of China. But it seems to me that it's mainly over who gets to be in charge of the hegemony which is different than like the existential conflict of the Cold War I wouldn't I want to find like the shittiest tourist spot in America a place where no one would. Ever go like oh you know what'd be funny go to awful lame tourist attractions in the entire country. If anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about.

[30:51](https://youtu.be/TNNps_twJTU?t=30m51s)

It's actually a genius of marketing so they're in South Dakota. There's one I forget which one but there's a highway that runs along like the southern track of it that if you're going cross-country is usually I was going. I was driving cross. I was driving halfway across Irish I'm from Wisconsin to Washington State and the way to do that fastest is you just cut through a highway that just goes all the way straight across southern the south quarter of South Dakota. It is the most the most desolate empty stretch of road I have ever encountered in the country and I've driven cross-country. Several times I've been through Kansas. I've been through a lot of very empty up into the high desert. Nothing is as desolate feeling as South Dakota. It is genuinely like empty. You know just fields fields. No animals even feel snow cops. I didn't see a cop on the highway. The whole time I got pulled over five minutes after I got in. Wyoming though so your drive is incredibly featureless and so on the way when you're going east to west there are a bunch of billboards. I I don't know like every 50 miles or hundred miles or so say coming up exit whatever wall drug wall drug and you just see them as you're driving. It's the only thing you see is wall truck exit up coming and you. By the time you go through enough of South Dakota.

You've been broken down mentally so much by the monotony that you've built up while drunk in your head as some sort of paradise. So of course we stopped at waldron even though we didn't have to their whole thing was free ice water. Now we go there and it's just a giant drug store that's like old timey western themed and has like you know the walkways. The thoroughfare walkways with you know the wood and it's got the overhang. It's like an old-timey like a Western set. Only. It's just a giant drug store with like a bunch a shit-ton of a very pedestrian souvenirs for like the Black Hills and like oh look. It's it's refrigerator magnets shaped like all the states and then there's a couple of animatronics sort of like a country Bear Jamboree. Only they do not go on you gotta like press a button and I was in there for maybe 10 minutes and we got out that's like that's. So lame I hate it. I want to take my four thousand dollar check from Donald Trump and go to wall drugged just like give it to them and say can I stay here can I just like sleep here in wall drug for four grand and like just take out a wheel wheelbarrow full of stuff. They probably say yes but no the pimp move I've never driven through its sense. But the pimp move and this is I think what really distinguishes the alpha mindset from the beta and I was a beta at the time. If you drive through South Dakota for the first time. You've not been to wall drive you drive through South Dakota.

You take that whole area then you don't stop. That's the Alpha that's the Chad posture I did I was the Virgin I learned my lesson but sadly I could never prove it because now I know it sucks and you often see bumper stickers because they sell bumper stickers say while drunk. Oh. Then people get them and put them on their car. I think because they have such a deep association now between wild drug and their trip because they spent like a solid day just staring at billboards instead of all drug and they feel like they're now in some way. Their trip and wall drug are the same and they've never left wall drug. They go into the bathroom of wall drug and there's an attendant there going you've always been. Here you've always been with wall drug. Yeah I stayed at a I stayed at a motel in kodoku South Dakota which is by wild coincidence and I didn't even realize this until years later. That's also where where Michael Clarke Duncan's character has to get picked up by the FBI. During the gather the crew montage in Armageddon anyway state of motel. There. It was one motel in an inner sand on an off-ramp no town. It wasn't part of you know where you see like 15 best westerns and La Quinta is or whatever and there's a McDonald's and cinderblock low-slung Motel and that's it and they had a screen. It had a glass sliding door and it smelled like someone had died in it not been murdered but like mummified by time.

Yeah South Dakota Black Hills are nice Mount Rushmore Lane not just because it's a bunch of presidents on sacred Indian land. Although that is disgusting it is also chintzy and shitty stuff like Rock Rushmore really does is the wart. Like because Mount Rushmore was a huge project of the time I mean obviously it took years it was a massive undertaking. It gathered America's imaginations. This is an interesting fact going Gutzon Borglum the non-american who designed Mount Rushmore when he was in the United States. He became very very taken with southern culture as it were and he helped us. He designed Stone Mountain there which is another edging on the side of a bluff of a bunch of lead Davis and Jackson and he joined the KKK but anyway. This is like a symbol of American culture right like like when the anglo-saxon weirdo types like with women. When the deck went when the Western architecture type guys show their pictures of Don Draper and they're like what we what we used to have like their idea of culture. Sucks it's lame. It's really small and it's it's just it's faces on a mountain.

I mean other than like the kind of ghoulish you know Alan Moore style like evil ritual magic of putting that on the land of the sacred land of a people who'd been massacred by the people on those. On that like there's a dark Majesty to that there's like an evil there's kind of an armbar mark. Frye feeling to it that sort of curdled curdled sarcasm and cynicism that's at the heart of authoritarianism. The culture is and I literally love to see some tanks well you know what I would like to see if somebody's gonna destroy Mount Rushmore and someone's gonna destroy Stone Mountain I would love it but if it's like some corporate PR move you know like coca-cola presents Stone Mountain and they just like put Donald Glover there next to them to balance it out or something. An outcast that will suck what would be awesome is if those things got destroyed with some good old-fashioned tanker house role. In some Abrams tanks set up the shop and just blow them up like that old newsreel shot of that out well that big swastika I think in Nuremberg getting blown up by a cannon. You know why that would be cool because if you've got tanks that means you have control of the state and you are instituting a new rule at the material level and you're blowing up those old monuments to a dead Society because you are building a new one that is the iconoclasm that I'm would love to see and and the the current one just feels like a very honestly kind of sad substitution yeah. All got strafing run of a-10 warthogs with the Stonewall Jackson's head. But you need to get the tanks first so next time you imagine me.

I really want to get rid of that statue. It's like you really want to get rid of it if you really want to get rid of it. You'll do it from a position of authority so that your your your you are enshrining a new order. A new just order you're not painting over the mossad of a rotten old order which is all we're trying to do right now see. That's why I don't like that like that. That's always been the thing that's annoyed me or I guess not even ignore.

[40:22](https://youtu.be/TNNps_twJTU?t=40m22s)

Me. Hume used me about the content of word tanki either as something that people use as a term of abuse or is something that people solve described with were the tanks. What tanks are you referring to. There's no tanks 1956. The so they were talking about Soviet tanks rolling into her Budapest. New tanks are you talking about. Now I mean. Some people would say like Assad or maybe like the Chinese or something like that and I guess like that's an argument I don't buy it. But it's an argument but unless you have that belief that like no. It's the PRC that's an actual like socialist counter hegemony with billionaires that's doing actual colonialism but never mind. They're all secret communists. If you want to believe that that's fine at least there's a tank in your mind that exists in the world world that somebody could drive somewhere for anyone else. It's like there's no tanks you're assuming a tank so that means that you're like operating from the assumption of a party in power. Ie the Communist Party of the Soviet Union controlling a state and a geo geo strategic sphere of influence and managing it like in the game Twilight Struggle. Your ideology is from the position of maintaining that position that is not the current position of the left in this country or the West or anywhere I would argue except for blue.

Maybe maybe you can argue Cuba and I think I mean they have power within their own country. But it's so constrained by us you know but they were able to kick the South Africans out of Namibia so maybe I'll say can't Cuba but like they can't really. It's there aren't unrealistic. They're at Bastion but they cannot be a counter hegemon cuz. They're so small they're too. Tiny. Well guys their tanks aren't gonna be able to roll up on our tanks.

For example we have to take over the tanks. We got to get on the tanks somehow tearing down statues. Somebody's asking tearing down statues is something I would say it can be something if it does what the what's the person writing suggested which is give people a sense of possibility changing to give them a sense that things can be different. But if it's just a sense of that once again we're not anywhere it has to arise. It has to that feeling that feeling if things are possible has to be channeled into some sort of container something that imply that that where decisions can be where a class of at where a plan of action where an actual strategy can be deliberated agreed to and then carried out that has to exist that has to be made so pulling down statues gets people thinking. This is worth enough time and energy and investment into into making those structures but then it's useful if it says hey we pull down. These statues. Maybe that means we can pull down these other bigger statues. Hey we pull down the statute of these Confederates. Maybe that means we can pull down the statues of these unions our generals because they were racist too and they killed a lot of Indians as well and and America is bad and then maybe we can pull down you know and then you got Shawn King saying hey let's also start destroying images of white. Jesus Shawn King is not right by the way if you think Shawn. Penis Shawn King is right you were either a or you are like him a cop.

I'm sorry sorry nope. I mean you can argue why that's theoretically right all day. But once again you are building the world's stupidest and most pointless ship in the world's most fragile bottle you're in the real world. What is what is advanced how would you go about doing that and what would be advanced by doing it you answer me someone in here who thinks that's a good idea answer me one of those two questions. The thing is is that people justify that these weird libidinal indulgences by saying yeah but they deserve it and I got. It wrote Sean Penn. Here deserves not got nothing to do with it. Nobody deserves anything none of us have free will to each other. Like I said we all have free will our selves because we are ignorant of what is making us do what we're doing but from outside of ourselves looking at everyone else. No one else has free will because we can determine why they're doing what they're doing so getting mad at everybody in talking about deserve and vengeance on a personal level.

Just reifies this all as a culture war because where else can you fight out these sort of battles about about points of etiquette. Essentially social etiquette you can say that they're important than they are but they boil down to ways of acting in public which is etiquette. How do you adjudicate that at any level other than the cultural that's the only place you'll ever be able to negotiate those those those arguments and they won't filter down because anything the challenge is from the from the culture gets recuperated until it can't by cus of overspill that comes because because people channel it people create a collective will out of out of a class consciousness and affect change by confronting capital by denying it the ability to extract profit and requiring it to change the conditions in which capitalism operates to either the point of a reform or to the point of abolition. But the thing that people shouldn't do and then I see too.

Many people do is just decide to write everything off because of these facts as though we don't live in a highly mediated society as though this isn't always. The hardest problem isn't always going to be to read socialize people who have been D socialized by their entire lives and that this is exactly how things would be be challenged like the rejoinder about the protest that is always most baffling to me as when people say look look at all these corporations that like it and look at all. These brands and celebrities and famous rich people who are co-opting it that's like they're trying to recuperate it. That's what capitalism does do all challenges to it.

In any way they might succeed but pointing out that they're trying isn't saying anything Oh God and that's the other thing it's like someone says maybe this makes people feel like you know things are possible but look where the movement is happening like now we've literally gone to another level of abstraction away from actual statues in real physical space to now television shows and not even new ones doing a Cultural Revolution about 20-year old programs that ain't good that's not progress that is more flight from the lack of accountability. You factor not none of us are accountable to each other because we've not we have not invested any any symbols or people or institutions with authority over us which we're gonna have to do at some point. We're all going to have to if if you've left coalesce isn't anything meaningful this country. At some point we are all going to have to submit in that we are going to have to give up some control over our lives.

Some control over of what we do some control over when we do it. Some control over ourselves to someone else in the form of a organization that will have central discipline because that's the only way you get to do kinky. You you can apply force. It's through coordination otherwise it. Just no directed force is is destroyed in piecemeal. Only unified coordinated force can push through you guys. Never see you guys ever see finding dory my most moving scenes in Finnish cinema history in my opinion. It's when towards the end when dory and the Albert Brooks are swimming in a big sea of dumbass fish that are just all going lip-lip and they get caught in a one of those big ol industrial fishing nets and they're getting pulled up and they're all gonna. Get Oh God. We're gonna get turned into fish sticks and all the fish are swimming crazily wildly and against the the net but by their own instinct and then Dory and Albert Brooks get them to stop freaking out and they go in one direction. They all swim down at this in this appointment in the same way and the rope that is that is the labor movement. That is the left that's the modern left and when it succeeds anyway. And that's the goal. That's the entire thing Finding Nemo whatever if you're not pushing in the same direction it's just gonna get.

It's just your your. Individual effort will eventually be refused see and that's the thing we can't communicate to each other. But the thing is we are. I really think a big part of it is. It's not just. It isn't just that we're all isolated physically and that we don't have like. We don't have hegemonic institutions of communication that we can like invest enough belief into to credit what they're saying so that we can build like a ideology that or a building class. Consciousness like simultaneously by listening the same thing because not enough of us are listening to the same thing with the same amount of credulity that is a problem. But I'd say another problem is that we have been too turned into such individuals. We we fetishize our individual desires so much we have been had it rained into us. So much that freedom is our ability to indulge our desires. Like that's why you see a lot of people correctly. Say capitalism isn't freedom because you are forced to work you know and and you'd be freer if you had more vacation and you had more control of your workplace. Also that's true but it only begs the question of what freedom means and the unexamined answer is what I want to do but of course you don't want to do it.

You want to do. Navas want to do what we want to do. We don't we do what we have been taught to want to do and that means that we bound up with our notion of the casaya. T we want a lot of things that are coping mechanisms for the society. We have things that wouldn't be necessary in a new society we're building and that we can let go of in the immediate moment if we're reorienting ourselves around a project. An actual project that we wanted to see executed. We can kind of let drop those things but nobody wants to drop it. Nobody wants to drop it because we don't have anything that we really believe in enough to invest that much faith into to give up something that till this point has really been helping us just helping us live with the horror of the world around us not realizing that if we drop that the work will fill the hole the submission will be the freedom because you will feel fulfilled. You will feel the sort of satisfaction that what the other thing you used to fetishize only gave you a fate a very faint echo of but you have to have faith to make the first jump and nobody believes in anything enough to make the first job. So that's a problem that we I deal with the problem we all live with it's Norman Rockwell said the name that's the name of his mom that's the name of his famous painting of the was her name. The girl who the desegregated I think the New Orleans School District I'm actually drinking chocolate milk favorite kind of french.

Fried I have yet to encounter in a French fry that's better than the McDonald's french. Fry I consider that sui generis and a piping-hot McDonald's french fry is genuinely delicious Rubi Bridget's that's the right name one of the most chaotic things about amber is that she likes like room-temperature McDonald's french fries which is blows my mind. The hot ones and I know yeah I probably had better like individually but just as a category. My experience with them as better than my experience with any other discrete category of fry I do kind of like the string. The shoe strings I like them shoe string II. I like the crispy I don't like the thick. I don't like steak fries. I don't like aware. It's got like the Pappy potatoey flavor in the middle. I like it when it's I like it when it is crisp. I never get fries at Popeye's because I don't like the fact because I only get the because Popeyes why would you get anything as aside. But the mashed potatoes man. He ready for tryouts what of his fit whatever the few moments he had fun in his presidency. Handsome handsome handsome quarterback hamburger party the truck when he got to ride the truck when they put him on the aircraft carrier and he wore the uniform and when he gave the medal to the hero dog. Those were those were moments that were nice. But the thing is he hasn't thought about him. Since they happened he was happy for a second and then he was thinking about how unfair Greta Van Susteren was to him that's and then it's gone so like he doesn't even remember. Those days I love Culver Culver is a great Wisconsin excellence right. There butter burgers you know it. Oh put the fries in the mashed potatoes okay. Now you're getting interesting get an extra side. All right. I might do it.

I definitely pity trunk-trucks miserable. I mean you should you should have like some sort of you should try to extend empathy to every human being because every single person is only where they are through the happenstance of their life. What who what and when they encountered people in places and things and because their their response to those that might seem to be self. Generated was really just a reaction that is soaked that is that was bubbled up in the subconscious that has never even thought of that was beyond thought so even though it's totally determined with but within the psyche. It's completely invisible and mysterious so nobody's nobody's where they are for any malevolence within them. I mean the malevolence builds over time the level of cistern thwarts. But it's all in the in the in the context of where and when they they existed. So yeah.

I emphasize with Hitler I empathize with everybody a little bit but the thing is because no one because within Hitler if you're imagine you're Hitler you imagine you're Trump you don't know you don't know how determined you are you can choose to break out of that you can choose war to turn towards good turn towards the truth. Work turns towards universal humanity turned towards an awareness of like what is what is to be good what the good represents. As in like the the fundamental union of all beings the fundamental oneness of all the universe you can turn towards that at any minute and if you don't you up and so you should be sanctioned and stopped from doing bad things and punished maybe you learn and if you don't at least you've been kept away from other people. But it doesn't mean that you have to hate personally. It doesn't mean that you have to deny someone anyone the benefit of trying to extend your mind into theirs with their experience and try to piece it together. I mean Trump's very easy to piece together his dad. His parents were monsters because his parents were essentially the the father and mother from the people under the stairs anybody seen that movie. Shh the suit blown away bone holes in the walls just complete Psychopaths who treated their children with monstrous abusive disdain the oh and he had a brother.

He had an older brother Fred. Jr. Who who could not take it who couldn't take the pressure and because he was honestly I think a better person than Trump in that he responded better to the traumas of his birth and his business. His childhood left the family ended up becoming a pilot died of alcoholism but that was because he couldn't take what they had done to him. Whereas Donald just became like the whipped dog and now his entire life has been trying to get this fantasy monster. This this ghoul and if anyone has seen a picture of Fred Trump he is an actual walk living. Ski was a living skeleton to tell him he's good which will never happen and so he's been miserable every moment of his life. He's never been happy that sucks the thought of that somebody who can never have a moment who can never just exist for a second and not be beset by demons by by by insecurities by loathing and fear of others awful. Yeah and French Trump's father did the same to him awful. Bavarians just want a party. Bavaria just want to wear leather shorts and drink comically. Large Stein's of beer Russians want to take over the world alright guys I'm done for today. This is a good one. Hitler was a Bavarian. He was Austrian. He didn't start in Munich yes but he never the Nazis never got the majority of the vote in Bavaria or any of the Catholic parts of Germany. Because of the center party which was explicitly Catholic. He ran up all of his big margins and Protestant parts of Germany anyway. We'll talk more about that maybe in a different episode because it's very fascinating the like. The electoral map of why Mr Germany very interesting. Wow bye bye.
