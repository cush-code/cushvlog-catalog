Lift a good job in the city working on a man in Midnight indie but I ever saw the good inside of the city until I took them right on the Riverboat Queen with me brown. Maybe hit them rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling on the river rolling on the river. Seeing a lot of pains in Memphis humped a lot of things down in New Orleans. But I never saw a goose out of a city till I hit the right on the Riverboat Queen big wheel keep on turning it ah proud American and we're rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling on the river rolling on the river.

Hey everybody ah so I just got over covid. I don't know if I ever had it before because I never tested positive for it. But you know who knows uh. But I had a cough like last week a pretty deep cough and I took one of those home tests and it immediately turned bright blue like it was the question so I'm gonna assume that that is correct and I took it a few more times over the course of the week and uh you know it faded away and yesterday I took it and uh and it was gone so. I'm I'm through The Crucible and I gotta say I understand that log covet is a thing. There's no question that it is a phenomenon who knows exactly what it is. But I think short covet also has to be a thing because I definitely had that uh I had a cough for like two days. Uh that was really kind of it in terms of symptoms a little bit of a stuffy nose and uh I'm fine like I feel exactly the same as I did before like I feel fine. Now my immune system might be trashed by this because it does look like there is some sort of significant uh immune compromising Factor here with this stuff when we're looking at this explosion of um uh RSV and and influenza and stuff and I might very well be just owned but right now I feel pretty fortunate I feel like uh I kicked the  out of coven but it did make me think so there's all these people.


All these uh conspiracy theories about where coven comes from right and what's really interesting is that all of them uh like and it. It shows the the deficiency in a lot of ways of the conspiratorial mindset the way that when what you're doing is you are looking for something to make sense of the world in a way that you want it to make sense and that uh subconscious yearning is going to shape anything that you encounter like if you want to talk about the idea that that covet is some sort of manufactured thing. If you want to do a basic Q Bono. The answer is not oh uh the world. Economic Forum made covid so that people would be okay with working from home uh and you know not owning a house or whatever great reset. That is happening anyway that we are all saving to already because what is the alternative we're all gonna do this stuff anyway.

These forces are way larger than any specific phenomenon and our ability to resist them is non-existent so why this extra push what does it do oh. It makes money oh I think they're going to make money no matter. What that's the whole deal is that the system exists to make money for these people. The uh explanation that makes sense though is you got guys like Bill Gates who genuinely do talk a lot about how concerned. They are about the long-term viability of the planet specifically because of climate change which they of course connect not to the fossil fuel regime as such which they are enmeshed in and cannot extricate themselves from but overpopulation. And we know that guys like Bill Gates love going to Africa and giving everybody uh circumcisions you know uh and also uh birth control uh a much more plausible just if you're blue skying it which we're all doing when we're conspiracizing.

YouTube videos and connecting uh things to different uh rich people have said into a mosaic. It's not evidence of anything if you're but if you're starting from a basic premise. The real meaningful basic premise the one that like actually would make sense is uh covet released as a uh as a population reducer. You know not something that is going to kill off a bunch of people very quickly because that would undermine the economic structures that these people depend on but something that over time will just start churning out kicking killing a lot of people earlier than they might. Otherwise have died uh in the in the in the fat. Imperial core too where you know there's a lot of people who are gonna right now the prospect of them sitting in retirement for 20 years sucking off. Uh Social Security is that just horrifies and puts into cold sweats our Elite uh and something that like once you get it will over time destroy your immune system so that everyone's not dying at once but people are gonna die earlier than they otherwise would have that is an actual solution for climate change and for all the other uh uh long-term problems that our system is incapable of addressing without the systemic change.

The people in power do not want and cannot even contemplate and it certainly makes the the uh Bill Gates's refusal to allow uh. Co vaccine technology to the third world make more sense that's one that never ever made sense for the people who are like oh no covet is made up. But the vaccine is going to kill you well. Then why the hell aren't people like why the hell weren't people like uh Bill Gates dying to put as many vaccines into the people who we already know they want to call as possible why are they saying no keep the vaccines from them. If that's what they want. It never made sense why not because what they wanted was to not have to do anything what they wanted was to keep going to Applebee's to keep their freedom whatever the  that meant and their conspiracy. Their brilliant conspiracy theory that sees through the lies is at the end of the day just the recapitulation of the programming that they've gotten from the  consumer uh economy in the first place. In fact I can imagine a world economic Forum uh uh Davos meeting you know in underneath a mountain in Switzerland when they've got Bill Gates and all the other Legion of evil and they're like okay we're going to release the covid. It's going to spread endemically through the population in 18 months and then you've got you know maybe um. One of those minions raises their hand and they go.

I don't know what if there's a containment and they're like no we have we can depend that the freedom-loving people of the West will reject any meaningful uh anti-pandemic measures guaranteeing full penetration so the people who are think they're fighting. The conspiracy are actually carrying out its its will which is to spread the thing as much as possible so that collectively our immune systems. Get Wrecked and uh we start over time becoming less of a drag on the economy and of course. I don't think that's true either. I don't  know at the end of the day. None of us can but at least that has an internal coherence. The problem is the reason none of these conspiracy. People talk like that is because that means covet is actually a big deal that you should try to avoid and that goes against their freedom that goes against their identity of themselves which they think is real and authentic. Not a very a product of the very system that is yes trying to kill all of us so who knows we'll see we'll see how badly my immune system got wrecked.

I feel pretty good right. Now I have to say. But I do think it's very funny to uh yeah to imagine like instead of the conspiracy. Mindset being The Last Hope of you know Western uh freedom and Independence in the face of global homo uh uh conspiracy. It's actually that reaction is key to the Fulfillment of the conspiracy. I'm not saying this is true. I don't  know but I'm saying to me that is more internal consistency than this childish idea. That covert was made up to make us Ascent to stuff that we are going to set to anyway because what else are we gonna do it's tiptoeing around the Unspeakable reality that there is no resistance. There can be no resistance because what what can you even do in your um. Greatest hope is vote for one of the two major parties who will uh condescend to your cultural fixations.


We'll see though I mean in the in the in the next couple years. We'll see exactly uh how this plays out. But I don't know I'm now I now have skin in the game if I didn't before because I've got those little guys in me now and they've they're doing their work on my on my white blood cells and everything else ah China trying to track China. It's being revealed now that for all of our hopes and a lot of us had put hopes in China as like an alternative system that had more capacity than the the Western capitalist structures. They were limited uh we could either we did not have the capacity to to full vaccinations uh and mitigating uh regiments. Neither did they it turns out because they did not vaccinate people while they were have been doing uh. Uh the zero covet stuff which is one of the reasons it's gonna go. It's now going to just go crazy through the population now that they're uh they've let they've reached the limit of their populations willingness to a seed which you need for this stuff to work foreign that's going to affect Supply change in in the very near future yeah covet. Zero is as impossible as social in one country as is impossible uh as socialism is one country. Indeed very much the case yeah uh well speaking of China I did read the first uh part of uh the three body problem and a few chapters of the next part uh so all the stuff in the cultural revolution.

So the aliens haven't shown up yet which I'm assuming they will at some point uh but I am enjoying it. The prose isn't that great but you know what are you going to expect out of a translation of a foreign language. Especially one that says idiomatically distinct from English is Chinese uh but the ideas are very interesting and you know the cultural revolution is a way to start I mean that that's a hell of a uh introduction you know uh because that was wild wasn't it the uh the cultural revolution and if you take it the cultural revolution and you do what you have to do with anything which is any phenomenon which is connected to what's going on globally at that time which is one of the great failings of our uh way of understanding our own history. Uh you can see.

This Global mental breakdown basically of the educated classes everywhere in the world uh in the face of uh the technology the bringing into imminence of global capitalism because the the cultural revolution is part of this revolt against the incoming. Uh dehumanization that everyone could feel was in the air uh everyone from yeah. The the the crazy multitudes of of uh students in Revolutionary China. All the way up to the absolutely insane presidents that the United States had during that period uh Richard Nixon and uh uh Lyndon Johnson uh at every level people were finding the limit of what they thought of as their own. Uh human will their ability to assert a human will on the world uh and finding that that limitation was uh that the border of that limitation was this new. The technological structure and people resisted tried to punch through it in any way they could and that varied from culture to culture uh parenthetically by the way uh to this end.

I think oh I should say that one of the books that I uh was most useful to me personally in uh doing the 30 Years War podcast. Uh research is a book by a historian Jeffrey Parker called Global crisis which is a a history of the mid 17th century that covers every part of the globe to some extent or another where there is sufficient records for a narrative to be uh to be sussed and thinking that way shows the degree to which yeah ecological factors shape what we think of as our autonomy and also the way that our response to crisis generates mechanisms of of coping that have impacts far beyond anything that we can conceive of and that the world that we're making is one that is going to be alien to ourselves uh and that the people who are going to be there who we think of as you know are.

Our. Descendants are going to be alien to us in a way that is terrifying and we respond to that Terror with uh are with an attempt to take matters into our own hands at least those of us who are arrayed in a certain place uh poised between the full oppression and inertia of of the at this point by the lit. By the mid 60s. The still real uh like Rural Life and the uh the urban existence which gives people a sense that is largely illusory of their own power over their Destinies and of the of the world around them and you can see throughout the world. The 60s as this as this crisis of recognition of of the limitations that we have and our ability to control what's going on around us and in the three body problem. I thought um that's well Illustrated.


They do a good. She does a good job with that uh and Silent Spring the the racial Carson's book which is featured in that uh section uh when the the young student who has sent out sent to log uh the countryside after her father's uh beaten to death during a struggle session for being a revisionist uh reactionary. Because he believes in relativity Theory uh is given a copy of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson uh and you know the the gist of that book is how uh the pursuit of Mastery undermines our ability to uh to make a world that we can know because it is undermining structures that we are assuming taking for granted uh to build on top of and uh for those of you who haven't read it. She ends up after uh writing a letter on behalf of a journalist who wants to tell the local political authorities hey stop logging this this is you know we're destroying our own environment uh he frames her for it and then she gets uh uh sent up to the countryside. First I'm sorry she gets taken to jail but then uh because she is a physicist. A physics student sent to a mysterious uh mountain top military installation where they've got a big antenna that's doing something. And we don't know what it is uh and then they cut to the Future 40 years later and uh physicistic scientists are killing themselves.

Uh and no one knows why so that's where I am now. That's as far as I got and I gotta say like I said the the pros isn't that great. But the ideas are very uh interesting and I'm gonna keep reading it certainly but right now. I don't really I don't know what to make of it really I'm waiting for the aliens to show up uh.

But there's a line in it where they're talking about the one of the scientists who's killed himself and they uh they run their suicide. Note physics is not real and it can never be real and that that hits because I've been thinking more and more about about the the unreality of the world. Uh I think I've talked on here before about the Nobel prize winning work on uh physics the Nobel Prize for physics. So after I talked about that uh how there's no local reality I haven't been able to get that out of my head since I read about it. There is no uh independent existence to objects outside of their observation and uh if there is no remote control over the world that we live in uh and that makes me think of you know the as they there's a reference of the book to how the quantum wave collapses upon. Observation like you go from the the matter is both particle and wave until it is observed at which point it collapses into a particle. This stuff is all designed to drive you crazy because we do feel fully controlled by a system right like we've talked about before like the 60s was this revolt against this controlling mechanism that we were defeated by uh. But it's not real like none of it is real uh what makes it real is our belief in the consequences of it.

If we did stop believing in the consequences of the system that that as it presents itself and as we're constituted of they would no longer have power over us and that's why you know we have to we all are inevitably forced to find some sort of extra scientific narrative to place ourselves in but which one right that's the challenge which  one the more people believe in it the more people the more real it is. That's just that that's just a fact and a cult can have the same power for the members of it. That'll that a established religion can uh. Because the intensity of belief isn't is uh proportional to how committed the people within it are to maintaining that reality. But we are in bodies that's the problem we are in bodies and it is the illusory Persistence of the physical that prevents us from transcending it but like the spirit that animates the life of a uh of a body is by definition. Eternal right and the physicality is Limited it's getting attached to the body that makes us enslaved really to A system that is dependent upon manipulating our sensory preferences foreign. But the real joke is is that we don't really have to do anything. We don't have to move like this thing moves through us and it's only when we understand that that we do not have to do anything that we are actually free to act meaningfully because as long as we are acting to validate a religious conception of the good.


Some other that's going to decide we did the right thing uh which is implicitly premised on a matrix of punishment and reward. Then we are slave to the same mechanisms that uh that the material world uses to keep us compliant because those systems of reward and Punishment are generated by class Society. Uh only with the understanding of that. We are universally uh saved whatever that means we can't know but one way or another. It is nothing to fear. This is the important part. The transit to the transition of states is not one of judgment and Punishment. It is a it is being brought into a knowledge and an understanding of something faster than an individual.

Contained. Human perspective can conceive of and the fear that that will involve punishment and that will involve your choices being your bad choices being brought back to you in some form that is an artifact of religions inextricable link to the mode of production under which they're reproduced because as I said before that is the ultimate justification for social structures is that they can provide salvation as though there is an alternative to Salvation if there is no alternative if there is no other state some state of damnation whatever however we conceive of it. Even if you're an easterner uh you know you believe in reincarnation reincarnation into a veil of misery. Then these systems are Justified. Then the miseries that they create are. Justified the division. The internal and division within a person and between people is is Justified in any act you perform even if you are fully embracing a religious conception that transcends the physical will be re-instituting and recapitulating the imperative of a class Society to separate the uh the sheep from the goats. The only meaningful act can come after you've dispensed with that after that fear has been eliminated if there is no reward for good action and no punishment for bad action well. Then what do you do now of course.

Traditional religion says if you get to that point you'll just do bad stuff but people do bad things to soothe the whole to soothe the pain to sue the fear to soothe the separation that they sense that that cannot be uh uh transcended by the reality of life in the black Iron prison from the trauma that has been inflicted upon them to use an overused word the desire to to inflict what has been inflicted upon but that desire is embedded in a sense of Injustice that one has suffered in one's only life and that that suffering will constitute one's Eternal experience. If that's not the case. If that suffering is part of a universal process of information gathering basically like all the things that happen to everyone and Every Act everyone can performs in the world is building a knowledge that is processed not here. But elsewhere in that ninety percent of the universe that is on observable ninety percent of the universe is unobservable what's going on in there what I think is that the actions the these. If these the subjective experiences of life are turned into a uh a greater understanding.

This is some people like to talk about simulation Theory but that is to me just begging the question because you're always assuming some simulate or and we. I think there are Gods out there that we have created and they have real power because we believe in them that includes the simulation robot and roku's basilisk and all this  that uh rational people have used to try to recreate god without spirituality. They're all real to some extent but they are just faces just uh mirrors of our own understanding that we as grounded and limited and finite beings cannot transcend in life and cannot communicate to ourselves or between one another but that process is occurring and our actions are accruing towards knowledge which means that we are that the there's no punishment why what would be the point that everything that is happening has to happen every act has to occur.

It's all part of a necessary process and with that as a base action can be based on love and not fear. It's the only way I can really be based on love and not fear at this point when we have killed the sacred and we cannot ritually reinscribe our felt understanding of this stuff where we're sort of left to try to individually re rebuild it in ourselves which is which is very difficult and which has led us to a species-wide despair. It's also why as I said before trying to resurrect old religious Notions oh we just all need to be Catholic yeah. Okay good luck we just we just need a a extinct form of social structure and control that related to an extinct uh mode of production. The whole point here is that you cannot go backward and the question of what is to be done can only be answered when you know why you're acting and if it is to make if it is to save the world it's not going to work if it's to save yourself that's not going to work. Those categories are bound up in in a fear-based compulsion Matrix a Skinner box made by uh the fictional finitude that dominates our minds. That's why I think that whatever religious conception is going to alloy to you know.

Humanities attempt to survive. The coming and currently existing crisis is not going to be some. Concepts that we already have they're going to be fully new. They're going to have to be because they're going to be describing new ways of being that are going to be people acting out of necessity and love not. That's not all people are going to be acting out of of course. There's going to be the the terror is going to drive horrifying violence but there will always be alloyed within that the desire to save not oneself but to save others others not as reflections of you but as their own end and there's going to have to be a vocabulary to make sense of why you would do that and it can't be Christianity because that will so easily be co-opted by structures of uh of warlordism and domination. Just as all other religious structures will existing ones you know and besides the only live d spiritually vibrant monotheistic religion. Left is Islam as I've said but it's wired into the same things like uh. I think shishik really had had it pegged when he uh in the old in the war on terror era. When he pointed out that the Muslim fundamentalism was not some sort of uh. Medieval uh reaction to the modern but was in fact modernity itself coming to places that had uh until that point avoided it ah maybe. Some uh maybe Sufism maybe the sufis will will be able to uh construct something out of the rubble that can uh. They can speak to love that can accept universal salvation as the first premise and move.


From there. Like we are a simulation but we are part. We are one simulation among infinite simulations all of which generated just by life by the fact that zero can only persist for so long before the one pops up and it keeps popping up and it keeps popping up and life continues and there is a residual accumulation that is accumulated here and then but in a process of creation and destruction and then there is a residue collected elsewhere. I guess that's where my religious belief like my thing that I cannot uh put a rational mind because I can talk you know vaguely about oh. You know Quantum this and blah blah and you know uh uh relativity and you know Consciousness as circling a black hole. You know I think that's all true. But it's also facile and it's not anything that can be proved anyway. But I my intuition points to uh something beyond the black hole that is pulling us all towards it. Uh and that emerges from the other side and I think that is what life is is. Consciousness is a a pin prick in the fabric of reality and your birth and your death are these to win twin pinpoints and then that life force is pulled from one to the other sort of twined around a pillar of gravity and as you get closer to it.

It elongates the the the subjective experience elongates and we're scared of that. We're all terrified of what that means because we think of it now that in the modern era we think of it as a a horrified movement towards Extinction like being in an airplane that's crashing uh. But you know. It's not like in the era of age of like meaningful belief and religious uh uh Vibrance uh that those people weren't terrified because they were all afraid. They were going to hell modernity. Uh creates this Terror or I mean uh of the unknown and even if you are religious there is that doubt because there's that divide that unbridgeable divide between you and God something that is only can only persist under certain regimes of accumulated class. Rule and technological class rule that's very important too.

But if that if this is all part of one process then there can be no permanent alienation of any conscious being uh from anything else and that and that the extinguishment of a a finite body is the experience of the subjective experience of being reunited and then reconstituted elsewhere and with that as like a Baseline you can ask the question what should I do and not try to answer not try to get an answer get out of the Apocalypse avoid Annihilation avoid death uh avoid one or other bad outcome. Because those bad outcomes are baked in they've already happened in a sense what we have control of is. Uh is how we relate to other people that's it and this is all a bunch of you know new age sounding. But all I can speak from is my own experience and how badly I treated people when I was fully in denial of uh the existence of spirituality and terrified every moment in my life of dying but spending all of my energy trying to ignore the fear. But it did not stay ignored. It came out it came out in the moment uh cyclical panic attacks and it came out in uh depression and it came out in a cycle of sort of casual cruelty.

Then of course I never intended I spent a lot of time trying to thinking about how I wanted to be a good person how I wanted to be good. How I tried to contrast myself from people that I thought were bad which is just that is secular. Calvinism and staying alive is being elect and now I have to deal with you know my residual guilt for that behavior in that time and what I did but what I can't do is act from an assumption that there has to be some sort of one for one atonement because that that's a selfish desire to deny the reality of Unity and and that the subjective uh finite life that I'm living is a part of a process trying to imagine. Full. Restitution is trying to deny that and trying to create that eternal self and the Eternal self really is the thing that's the the dream of the Eternal self the the the belief in the Eternal self first it was uh spiritual and then became uh now. It's technological. Uh is is what is going to damn.


This. Uh particular iteration of humanity to annihilation uh because it started off as a survival mechanism. Uh you had the first great expansion of settled societies along the Eurasian belt and then the places where life was most fecund. You had religious conceptions that accepted the cyclical nature of life but out in the the Eurasian Hinterland where smaller groups were in constant conflict with one another survival dictated bending out and breaking off that. Circle into a staircase and that had the effect it worked it. It motivated people to defeat to fight to to hold their own uh uh uh social structures together the face of uh opponents. But once it becomes overalling and dominating then we have surrendered our control to technology.

We surrender our souls really to a fantasy uh of being ourselves forever in heaven and then in the  Singularity or whatever the hell foreign in one sense because we're living through it. But it's just it's like a barber pole. You know you got the White and the red stripes and they turn and for a while it looks like the world is just one color and then it turns and it looks like. It's the other one. But it's the whole time. It's all there and that is a that exists the perception of life through that prism and and people moving through it. Moving grasping towards things that they can't even comprehend that's that's the uh that's the engine of the universe and but what it's building is something that none of us will ever be able to as we under as we exist now uh encounter. But that does not mean we are not part of it and that whatever it becomes will not include maybe not us as we want to be but us as uh we need to be our.

Systems are our our systems of belief our Transcendent systems of belief that like the things that actually try to grasp Beyond and make sense of of of the imminent. Uh are of course uh at the mercy of our systems of uh economy of our modes of production of of the class societies that allow for religious ideas to become universalized. Like. It's not a coincidence that uh the first like set systems of belief that we still live with now that are not considered uh you know mythology start to emerge around individual thinkers and writers as the flow of construction and destruction of social structures becomes fixed around certain permanent features of exploitation Buddhism Confucianism first where there is the greatest fecundity and I think what what what all those are and then the later ones you know Christ Muhammad. It's that some people uh due to when there are emerged on Earth and specifically the the architecture of their brains are able to Channel an energy that most people including myself uh are forced to for the most part suppress because to not do so would to be over would be to become overwhelmed by it and to have our ability to be functioning people annihilated but some people just have brains have structures in their minds that can contain and uh process this energy consciously and to be able to do that is to be able to apply a a symbolic lens to that experience and that people can understand but of course what those people are understanding as subjects of class societies takes class society as a given as a constant just like they take their own you know uh lives is a constant their own subjective. Consciousness is a constant and that strips from these Messengers the deeper knowledge that they all contain but they cannot be communicated. At least it cannot be communicated. Over time. It might be communicated to individuals in their lifetime but it cannot be communicated and uh and structured over time which is that Universal uh Salvation I talked about like take take Jesus Christ.

For example I am I do believe that that Christ was real and that Christ was a member of a uh political milieu that sought to defend uh the Jewish conception of humanity which you know uh of a chosen people connected by a shared conception of a a god not a God that you uh you know sacrifice to and if you don't get what you want well you find another God a God who is always there and that who you can fail but who cannot fail you because they are eternal that this was when they were. The the Jewish people were you know subjects of a Roman Empire that was uh persistently dominating them and how to get over that how how to how to meaningfully resist this Roman domination uh and for Christ. The answer became uh I am the gate. Uh I I am the I am the way to connect to a God who is otherwise inscrutable and whose desires and will is unknowable to you and who therefore you can always be in danger of uh letting down some way. I I absolve you. I uh have come to clear the path with the goal that people that the Jewish people would take that and and run with it and would uh would take that knowledge and use it to resist to to repel the to Romans and to find to maintain their uh their uh their their holiness. But most the the most powerful members of uh.

The community were largely happy with how things were because they were uh privileged within it and I kind of think that when Jesus was brought before uh pilate uh he he probably thought that he wasn't going to go on uh to the hill. He wasn't. Gonna get nailed to the cross. I don't think I think he thought that God in the form of the collective belief that he had Unleashed would transform into got like uh an intervention they would say no and then they didn't and then he went up on the hill and then he went to the hill and he got. He got scoured. He got nailed to the cross uh why have you forsaken me. He says to God and then after his death he becomes a symbol for those uh seeking some coping mechanism for life in a Roman Empire that was uh miserable. You know that was only the God's favor shined only on those who uh had succeeded who had been born into privilege and Christianity becomes a very popular option both for Elites who want to launder their sense of implication and for the poor and enslaved whose lot in life seems uh unchangeable. But it becomes no longer a uh actionable belief system. It becomes just something that is used to uh to put up with an existing way of being an existing Injustice.

But it's the particular uh time and place that Christ emerges as one of these guys with this brain that makes Christianity such a weird uh hybrid deal and why early Christianity once it's adopted by the Empire splits into all these fighting tribes because the Trinity God's son how it is not intuitive uh. It is in a real sense perfected by another guy who shows up a little bit later in a different position Muhammad. But what allows for the synthesis. There is that uh unlike Judaism or unlike Christianity which is merges as this attempt to for of Jews to deal with their Domination by the Romans. Uh Islam becomes a faith of uh universalism in the uh in a condition where those Imperial forms of rule are collapsing. By the time Muhammad shows up the sonnet Empire and uh the Eastern uh Empire are fighting each other to exhaustion and this is a a vacuum. A real vacuum has emerged and it can be filled by people who share a belief who share a certainty and they're able to do absolutely almost Supernatural Feats of domination very quickly oh but over time they all get poisoned. Christianity gets poisoned. Islam gets poisoned because they exist to perpetuate domination of one person over the other in exact contravention of the deeper understanding that all of these like holy truths are wrapped around which is the universal Oneness of everything and that is why uh socialism is the is the concrete materialization of that uh of that uh religious insight somebody says Matt if you heard of the diggers of course.


Uh we're writing the last uh we're finishing writing the last 30 Years War podcast episode the 10th episode which is about uh the and the Commonwealth. The English Commonwealth and the Glorious Revolution which is where it all ends spoiler alert uh 1688 and the diggers are fascinating because in with win Stanley Gerard winstanley who is the leading uh Digger uh who wrote uh the pamphlet that is like there most important uh document uh. He actually anticipates Marx's analysis of class Society. By 200 years he writes in his in his pamphlet whose name is. Is it called it's called the new law of righteousness that's it uh and in it. He says yeah all these uh Cromwell the Puritans all these Calvinists they're trying to create a Godly world. They're trying to create Godly institutions but they cannot succeed because property ownership alienates man from God in such a way that it guarantees that human relations are filled with Strife violence lies domination. Now he uses the religious language but his his uh diagnosis of of uh Society is essentially Marx's. I mean obviously Marx is going to use uh different a different heuristic to get there because he has arrived at a point where belief in God. The way that win Stanley had is no longer accessible to a educated man like Marx uh. But when Stanley saw the same essential flaw to all uh religious political movements that sought to maintain the social structure as it existed from Lutheran because Luther insists yes the princes are are wicked but people are more wicked and we have to uh. We need uh strong princely hands to maintain structures that can allow uh for the word to be propagated and for people to be saved. But when Stanley says the word that is being propagated is a Lie. The word that's being propagated exists to maintain this sinful arrangement of ownership of property uh and he nobody listened to him. So he took about 19 followers and went to a vacant lot in Surrey and tried to live there in common uh as an example you know which is what happens when uh great religious movements hit the rocks of of uh of entropy and some uh local landowners. Goons drove him off the land of course and then he ended up becoming a Quaker and the Quakers emerged out of the same period. The Quakers are also a product of the religious efflorescence of the um of the uh English Civil War and they come to similar conclusions but because of the overwhelming power of Institutions except a quietest uh religion that denies the possibility of living Godly in a class Society but that then attempts to find Fellowship within it and you know that's where we all have to start.

That's where we all have to start and it's hor and there's a I know that I have an instinctive resistance to that because it means oh you're just saying don't fight but you know what are you fighting for again. If you're fighting to change the world. You're fighting for a egotistic fantasy of your own ability to understand and uh overpower the entire the uh. Collective the collected forces of History you have to act for other people first. Any meaningful action is going to come from that and you know. The problem with the hippies is that they try that too. But they were emerging in a period when people who went to college like they did were given the world who had they they were uh able to and basically guarantee themselves lifetime of material security so that means any idealism is going to curdle in the face of that certainty. What we have now is something completely different. We have the end of security. We have the end of certainty we have the end of material satisfaction what that means for us. I have no idea but it's important I think it's very important yeah.

This is from uh I just Googled it to remember the title. But this is from the I didn't use this quote uh in the uh script but uh I'll read it. Now this is from the new law of righteousness uh by win Stanley in the beginning of time the great Creator reason made the Earth to be a common treasury to preserve beasts. Birds fishes and man the Lord that was to govern this creation for man had domination given to him over the beasts birds and fishes. But not one word was spoken in the beginning that one branch of mankind should rule over another and the reason is this every single man. Male and female is a perfect creature of himself and the same spirit that made the globe dwells in man to govern the globe so that the Flesh of man being subject to reason his maker hath him to be his teacher and ruler within himself. Therefore needs not run abroad after Any teacher and ruler without him for he needs not that any man should teach him for the same anointing that ruled in the son of man teaches him all things and so selfish imaginations taking possession of the five senses and ruling as King. In the room of reason. They're in and working with covetousness did set up one man to teach and rule over another and thereby the spirit was killed and man was brought into bondage and became a greater slave to such as his own kind than the beasts of the field were to him. He is he is finding in uh the isolated egotistical enshrinement of in of reason of One's Own reason of One's Own perception as the root of class Society I am not of I am embodied by self as opposed to the reality which is I am not anything. I am not I am a chimera. I'm a fantasy. I am a I am a straw dog. All is I am not but because we perceive as individuals. It is that individual perception that eventually forces us to reify the world in that image and break apart our connections to one another and dominate one another because my if I am all and I am uh eternal if God is really only my own reflection. Then my my pleasures become the only end to seek and the only way to seek pleasure is to alienate labor from oneself onto someone else. There's another quote from that that I actually did use in the script that I want to say just because it's like you read that you're like damn this.

This is 1650s. This is uh capitalism is literally just being born and he is saying stuff that it would take uh that it would take another 200 years to be articulated uh in different language. He said so long as such as rulers call the land theirs upholding this particular property as Mine and Dine. The Common People shall never have their Liberty nor the land ever freed from troubles oppressions and complainings. He also part of this he had like a theory of cultural superstructure because he says the ins the the universities and churches that we have can only be poisoned and can only bring forth a poisoned religious belief because they are dependent upon these property relations for their own existence. So even though people could see what was happening at that point. Capitalism still emerged unfazed unscathed un unchallenged really by any pull force that could like fundamentally uh threaten it because every effort even with this knowledge. Everything you could do only pushed forward that was capitalism in its uh ascendant phase. Everything everyone did one way or another pushed capitalism's institutions forward. Dug their talons deeper into the land pushed people into a more marketized relationship with one another like the Puritans who fled America who fled Europe England were doing so because this new marketized world was. With them they couldn't handle it. They were the most sensitive uh. The most delicate flowers in the garden were the ones who said I can't hack. This I cannot Square Godly World a Godly world with life under Charles the first and so they went to uh. They've went across the ocean. They risked their lives to try to create a world uh in North America that would allow them to actually live in a Godly way and in so doing they  put into North America. The seeds of capitalism's ultimate fluorescence ultimate domination of the entire globe because anything less than total resistance to the state and annihilation of the self is going to fulfill capitalism's dictate unless you're willing to go to Munster and be starved out by the the prince Bishop until they  came in and cut your cut your gizzards open and hung you in gibbits. Next to the cathedral you were going to build capitalism. Now we are at the end of this cycle. Now everything the capitalists do everything everybody is doing to try to either. Thrive under capitalism or survive. Its dictates is undermining uh its ability to persist as a technological supply. Chain has a structure of institutions that reproduce capitalism that's terrifying because what is else is there there is nothing else built. Gramshi's quote you know this is the time for Monsters. We got a lot of monsters. It's  Monster Mash right around now just like it was in the 1600s but we are building something somewhere.

The reason I believe that is because I believe that Consciousness is all. There is like our the material world that we think of is like real is is not any is not the real thing the real thing the Eternal thing is is consciousness that we are part of and the definition of Consciousness is that it is retrospective. Consciousness is not uh a response to stimuli. Consciousness is the building of a narrative building of a story around stimuli that can only happen after the stimuli has already happened and this is what I think happens during that swirling towards the black hole. That elongation of time and space is connection to the culmination that has happened somewhere that has always happened that generates everything else around it. Like he says it's confusing. The communism is directly connected to atheism. Yet it seems more. Godly this is the kind of contradiction that you have to deal with and that makes that that kind of that. Dooms most of us you know. Dooms are simulations to failure because to really embrace uh a collective Destiny for mankind. You have to break with the old structures that only reinforced class Society but along with that is a vocabulary of of transcendence that has to be uh claimed and has to be carried forward and that challenge is is difficult to say the least and it's that Gap. It's that vacuum that leads that led so many uh socialist projects into spiritual wilderness and made uh the building of like the new man impossible. Like the Stalin didn't build a new man Mao couldn't build a new man with his cultural revolution. Uh because there was they gave up a horizon by trying to do it in one country but again what else are you supposed to do to survive. But why do you want to survive once again. It is that lack of faith that pulls us back from the full confrontation with that which is that that needs to become universalized or far more universalized than it ever has to truly challenge things as they are Okay.

So uh next week I will have read more of three body problem. We'll get to the aliens that'll be fun yeah Cuba oh man Cuba Cuba. It's gonna be very tragic. It's already been a tragedy but we're gonna. We're going to. We're gonna. Destroy them but man they held out for so long like a little monster uh just hanging out in the Caribbean without descending into madness and like the fact that they ever did to me validates. Every belief. I have the fact that they ever made it work for any amount of time because you cannot use any of the uh sophistic capitalist. Uh uh liberal arguments to deny uh the Cuban Revolution. Oh wow I went for an hour and 15. Nice all right. Let's talk to everybody next week love you all God bless you.
