Down down okay look at this youngish man all right halfway off with his pants. He's doing something weird with his hands. He's got a multitude of outrageous plans and he's still trying to cough up that what you choked on in the churches look at him out running and running off a vacant storefront building. Nba deck an army surplus and why start giving as. I want everybody telling you it's full of it and then it gets suppressed obsessed and depressed and which one came first in this crazy mess and then he's taking too much or not enough and which one is the worst one with this sort of stuff and he's sewing thought of being ignored with that and really ignoring. But I know it's nothing more than just being bored. I know it's a lot more than just being bored. Hi guys my phone died yesterday. I didn't think I'd be able to stream. It wasn't charging. It wouldn't take a charge but today I put it in. I said my prayers and it worked so. I'm able to bring myself to you once again How is everyone doing. I guess. I want to say today.

R.i.p. To david graber who died in venice. I guess jesus people are dropping man and it's a lot of good people and of course none of the bad um and I just want to say that like. I didn't really know him. I never really interacted with him. I know he had a prickly reputation online and being a guy who argued a lot but but and of course. I didn't agree with him on everything because he's an anarchist. But I did read debt and I thought debt was in aggregate grape. You can quibble all you want with some of the historical stuff but because you know he's not a historian. He's an anthropologist but the anthropological work is really really important because I think the central the central element of of debt that I carry with me. The most is his annihilation of the presiding myth of the rise of of currency of money. The rise of of like a denominated debt in so through into society and the adam smith neoliberal you know standard model that we all absorb at the level of our dna by the time we're two.

 says that that arose because you had a situation where once societies got bigger. Once social orders became larger you had a situation where some people had stuff that other people needed had more stuff than they needed and there were other people who had stuff that they needed was it coincide coinciding deficiencies or something. I don't remember but it was a way to represent exchange that had previously been barter because that's how you do it. If you have like a low level social complication is. I have five chickens that equals three goats or something and that money came to represent that exchange and I think graber pretty ably dismantles that and says that is a that's a fiction that is that is a story that they tell themselves. I mean it's as much of a it's as much a fiction as like the garden of eden. It's like a parable that they made up to justify their ideology their like religious. their religious faith which is capitalism capitalism is in their minds where religion is in who had been in previous generations and it is in most of ours. We've replaced god with capital in one way or another and that's what they worship and the story. The the the the adam and eve story of of that faith is I got all these chickens but no goats and I got all these goats but no chickens. It's not true at all gaber points out at 

Pretty ably shows that in tribal social orders if there is a incongruity of of resources like somebody has stuff that other people don't. They don't need a medium of they don't need a neutral medium of exchange or even an exchange of any kind. There is a social obligation understanding that is beyond the level of the transaction that is beyond the level of individual acts because labor hasn't been alienated. Labor is done for oneself and for others in equal amount which means there's no alienation. Alienation is when you are doing less for you and more for someone else someone else and it's usually owners or slave drivers or someone other than you. That's when people become separate from one another. That's when social obligations dissolve in the face of pain in the face of the desire for people to gain some sort of some sort of opiate. Some sort of self for the wounds of having their labor alienated and that's where you need to have a market transaction to exchange because what's in it for me becomes the only question and so you have to have a neutral exchange. You can't have barter you go straight to representation. Because representation is all. We have we have to representation a social obligation that's been lost because of alienation if you don't have that alienation that social alienation resource distribution is handled by ritualized a almost biologically frictionless act of equalization.

The way that like a cell will equalize across its own membranes in order to maintain integrity and like the actual ritual mechanisms or those are different from society to society. But a lot of them are represented by things like the potlatch which is the origin of our concept of a potluck which is a ritual of of of of the ex. The distribution and annihilation of surplus so that it doesn't build up because it can only build up if it's not being evenly distributed and so all this stuff. The homo economicus view of humans is rational economic seekers. That's all that is a myth that's a religious tradition and it has a founding it has a founding mythology. It has it has its own olympian tragedy its own olympian tales and epic sagas and and birthing scenes and primal scenes and one of them is that first time that somebody needed to give a goat for a chicken.

But if they knew each other why would they have to have that exchange one thing that graber points out really eloquently is that in in traditional societies it's actually rude to repay someone's debt entirely. Every exchange should leave a little remainder because that implies that there will be a continuing obligation between you paying off a debt is closing that door and saying you are a stranger to me and how could we have started like that how could any civilization have existed for any viable amount of time. If we really started off treating each other that way it's impossible. The only thing you can argue is that that the only way to create the complex nodes that allow us to have a technological society that allow us to do things like have language or dang iphones or longer life spans that are less animalistic that allow us to develop culture to allow us to create things that give us the chance to reflect on ourselves and make ourselves aware of our moment and our place in time in space and our relationship to other people in a way that that we can't do even within the tribal society because then there is an outside to fear always can we not find that and they say we get that way by by having a market by the engine of capitalism and that's what builds this that's what we get to live in. no that's not true at all. Capitalism is the last manifestation of different regimes of resource extraction that come about because you have this un distributed sense of social solidarity. People don't see other people as themselves so they have to find out what to think they are and that can only be achieved through continued conflict by continued interaction and by continued domination of one over the other because if they are not you you can do what you want to them. If you want it bad enough and people wanted things like the pyramids bad enough and they wanted southern cotton to be a profitable world market commodity. Enough. The english wanted tea enough from the indians so they build this market to satisfy and that's the last representation you have to build a market after you've destroyed social bonds through exploitation if you can't exploit people anymore if the religious if the religious um world that you have been able to exploit from the top to maintain social cohe cohesion and social ascendance to power if that wears away which it will over time as as as social bonds are slowly and steadily and always pushed away from one another by accumulated trauma of class conflict. You will eventually snap the social bonds entirely and you have to replace them with something and you replace them with the liberal sense of self. We are individuals. We are equal which means we can't just dominate and take from each other. We have to negotiate across that equal plane but we are different and distinct and separate and always will be and so the only way that we can organize a social intercourse is through a neutral medium of exchange and that's true if you think that is immutable. If you think that's the only way we can.

We can relate to one another and I don't think so. I think there's another turn of the screw. I think there's a turn of the screw where we are able to master enough the the technology that we have at our disposal to connect and we utilize that to bring about through time it wouldn't be easy. It wouldn't take it would be none of us. Will see it. No one's children will see it it might not be us. It might be cephalopods but there will be a big enough movement of working-class people whose experience of exploitation has bent them towards the same vision of justice broadly enough to allow them to contin to fight on the same side and in so doing overthrow the regime of exploitation. The world system that is rep that is con currently controlled by by the ruling class and I know that these are all slippery terms and that in the heat of the battle they will break one way or the other. But that's what history is for to grind that the kernels spilling forth and I think that through that process we can gain social awareness that is as powerful a self-regulator of behavior as tribal intimacy but in the context of total technological control of nature meaning that we would no longer destroy and defile nature. We would enter self-aware homeostasis with nature and then the work of history. The real work of history could begin the work of the human race as a conscious consciousness could begin. People have dinged me for saying that the dialect ends with the end of capitalism if I got that if I said that I'm wrong. I didn't mean that what I meant was is that the process of class conflict resolves and that level of dialectical exchange is abolished over time. But that doesn't mean the dialectic ends. That's how we are going to figure out what to do. Once we think we realize we're a success.

We're a social organ and we have the ability to communicate off the across the whole of the planet through through the technology that we've occurred and we were able to distribute. The labor inputs necessary to maintain the system as evenly as possible so they fall as lightly on the shoulders of as many as possible. Then we will we will have to to manage this system. This steady-state system and extend and create things to do with it. What are we going to do with these powers. That's that's but that process will also be a dialectical resolution. It will just not be through conflict. It will not be through social violence because it will be one organism. But it's still a dialectical process and that's when we begin to make a history. We are able to make history and the only way a human really could as part of one species because individually we fight against one another we clam and bat and so much of our potential is wasted and annihilated in these matter anti-modern conflicts because we do not see the hole for the sum of its parts.

Whew does that make sense anyway all right peter david graber and his book debt deals very very skillfully and persuasively on that topic people keep. people keep asking me to engage sterner more because they say that that actually he I did don't disagree with it and honestly it's like well if sterner is what I think it is and I don't like it. But if sterner is what you're insisting it is then. I like it and I guess. I don't know why I got to read it. It's not like. I can pass a verdict on max sterner. One way or the other. He is beyond my ability to judge or control. I certainly can't influence even his reputation oh what have I been grilling.

 grilled a few things. I grilled some bergs. Recently. did some elotes got those charred up. corn corns finally good august. You get the night august early september. The corn is big earlier this when I started grilling the summer corn was mad. Tiny now got some thick corn I'm hoping to do beyond burgers. This weekend gonna have small friendly get together and have and not The patties. Someone told me that the best beyond thing is the ground meat like the ground beef so. I'm gonna pack up. Some burgs throw them on the grill that's the plan maybe do some seafood if I can find anything good if sternerite if sterner makes people and prim then then. I'm afraid everything.

I think of him is correct because of course am prim. If you're abolishing all these structures these spooks because nothing can be trusted with the ego you are ignoring the central truth that the ego has to be annihilated through cooperation because we can only get to the answer to these questions by resolving them amongst ourselves. There's no one else to answer to there's no one else that's going to have answers but us everything in the book is dead. Everything in it written in a book is dead but if the person's not here it's all dead because we're just reckoning with the shadow of those ideas that we have to deal with because it emanates from the culture. We we absorb them into so we're already dealing with shadows. So we cannot get it from a book. We cannot get it from anyone else in singularity. We have to get it from an aggregate we have to get it. We have to descen to get the thread of of of of of harmony through through a crescendo of of clashing notes and we need structures to accommodate that which means. I'm sorry we cannot bust all the ghosts we have to use the ghosts to our control so that we can abolish finally our own ghost. The only ghost worth busting the ego mankind is so smart and stupid at the same time because we can never know what we don't know.

It's frustrating to me that the dunning-kruger effect gets thrown around by redditors so much as like one of those dumb things. That's that dumb guys can say to sound smart oh classic dunning-kruger effective because I think that and I think that's because people don't really grasp what it means. They think oh yeah those guys they got that dunning-kruger effect they don't realize that it is universally applicable that no one by definition can be exempt from it. Everyone doesn't know what they don't know but somebody else might and if you stack enough of them along the right questions by facilitating social interaction by allowing people to to collaborate which cannot happen in a capitalist framework that is zero sum. Especially now they might say it's not but they're lying. Someone's labor is being extracted for someone else's benefit and even if somebody gets to use somebody else's labor because they were able to buy like a cheap product on the market and they contributed to an exploitation they're still also being exploited. There's there's wrong everywhere and they all reflect off of each other and and echo out until they create a social order that is becomes more and more frayed and threadbare and unviable. So the dunning-kruger effect is universal no man no woman. No anyone is spared and the application the implication there is clear to me. It means that no political project no religious project no human project. No human social project forget about politics but also politics. No project of those kind can can and and social and political project culminating in a political project because that is politics is the culmination of social projects.

I would I would I would not want to be part of anyone and I would not want to pursue anyone that took as its principle winnowing reducing to some core group the beneficence of our technological society because you are dooming yourself. The only hope we have as a race is if the as if the the the aperture of potential human interconnection is as wide as possible. That's our only only hope anything less and we will spin off into into annihilation. Inevitably we will not manage the the crises of the moment it will not be an apocalypse. It will be a slow dying of the ember. It will be heat death until the last campfire winks out and the people around that campfire. They don't think that they're at a campfire at the end of the world. They think it's thursday and that they're they're at the corporate like hr training they're doing the diversity workshop. They're reading white frail to each other around the campfire and they think it's their job. They don't think it's. It's the nightmare apocalypse that everyone has always been waiting to happen because we will normalize ourselves into annihilation and we will never turn away from self-obliterating hostility to others that will then inevitably destroy us. So it's got to be as big as possible man and and it's like there's people and right now. One of the really annoying things about and why the online left is not the left and it is. It's actually deleterious to the left is that these arguments I keep talking about the arguments that are that exist just to be had online. It's like there's two things you have fun having the argument like is looting. Good have that argument all day you have fun having the argument but then you also get to split people into good and bad categories who's on your side for the revolution and right now this fundamental reality as I keep hammering at because it's the only thing worth saying to me is that the left needs to actually consider its non-existence and move from that point instead of assuming a structure and a center of gravity that would necessitate winnowing towards like the reason. Everyone seems to think we need to like know the good for the bad as echo what if they get in a position of power they'll never get in a position of power. There's no positions of power to be accrued and you really are afraid of every like 300 follower. Corridors of power like stalin when we're talking about a glacial process they need we need bodies warm revolutionary vanguard party or or what government agency like you're arguing about like oh is dom chomsky going to be secretary of state. I mean who the and I mean and that means and the thing is any one on either side of the questions.

I'm talking about will their spine will stiffen and they say okay but if we let anybody in then I'm going to be kicked out by the other guy like that's that's the democratic. that's the democratic dilemma right. It's like. I can't let the other guy win an election because then when he's in power. I will just be kicked out of the group. I will be denied. My rights you know because I'm the one backing down and they're not and that's kind of what voting is. And that's a trap of all democracies is that you're saying. I will accede to rule by my enemy on the idea that they will if we if we vote. If I win I get to be in charge. That's the that's the thing that makes it possible um and so they worry. They don't. They won't want to be the first one to back down and the thing is someone has to be the first. That's the leap of faith. Someone has to be first. It doesn't have to be one person on one side. It could be multiple people but it's going to have to be a draw down. Someone is going to have to risk taking the hit of being the first they're going to have to believe enough in the project to have that belief in the project make them willing to risk their own personal comfort by getting cancelled by their side. They're going to have to do it and then the thing is you don't know what happens next the other side might not back down. It might just they might use it as a moment to destroy you and that might happen you have to take the risk that's why it requires faith. But if they draw down too you have a potential to disengage from this stalemate and you have someone has to believe enough and the reason we're in so much trouble is that nobody believes enough. That's why there's no left at the end of the day. It's because no one believes and I'm including myself here because what's to believe in. It's there's nothing. It's a field of pottage but we have to build faith. We have to build faith in it so that we can care enough about the project care enough about the vision. We have to be willing to sacrifice not just our reputations but even our safety and lives and of course twitter makes it worse because if the stakes are low it's easy to step down right like if you're having an argument with a friend.

Even if you really do disagree. It's easier to step down than between you and a stranger and then even harder if there's people watching because you're less sure of the other party you can trust them less and that's so if the stakes are higher. It's harder to trust and if the stakes are always reputations within a subgroup jobs sometimes when you're talking about real significant like brigading attempts and cancelings. Livelihoods like ability to continue of course people aren't going to be able to back down so the and people say well what's going to happen. Then what is the solution and this is what a part of what is tough for me is I have to be honest and say the solution will come at the precise moment when enough people have had enough of this to take to to either quit caring or recommit themselves and like grind their their ego against the wheat stone of the of their understanding of the crisis we're in and the imperatives of it all of which is driven by love love. We're gonna have to risk to to be willing to do a thing that we don't know is. Gonna work because that's the only way we can convince people now to sacrifice is that it'll do something because that's what then they can satisfy their ego their libido. The only way they're going to do something that won't work is if they know that in the long run it's something someone has to do first even if it isn't going to work like john brown people fixate on john brown but no one can be him.

Even though that is what we need. He loved so much john brown that the enormity of the crime that he saw in front of him over overwhelmed his sense of propriety because he didn't what he was going to die what did that mean what was his life to this. What was his life compared to this considering how deeply he loved how much his love like. I've said is ego directed outward and attached to others and removed from the self how could he ever value his mortal life for a soul because that's what we're talking about is. The human soul is the degree to which your love reaches out beyond yourself and he has and his and that means it doesn't just reach out it empties. It empties out and john brown. He had enough soul that he didn't. He wasn't afraid to die.

We're afraid to get dragged for an afternoon and it's not our fault our ability to have faith has been ground out of us. By the alienating brutality of the lives we've been thrust into but at some point we're all gonna take enough and and the old solutions aren't gonna work and we're gonna have to break through and I'm saying that the thing I'm saying is how do we make this happen. We don't make this happen. It happens because people get to the point where nothing else works and what I say works you can keep doing something that doesn't work forever. If it's getting you off and for some people it'll always get them off. You know the people. I'm talking about perpetual motion machine people who just live in the internet and they're entirely consumed by the hedonic treadmill of owns and counter owns and they love it and they're addicted to it.

They are the people who would fight you with a cave. k flame shadows you can't deal with them. I'm saying is that there will be a time when enough people see the failure of what they're doing to help and seeing the things get worse and seeing their lives get worse and seeing the lives of the people. They love getting worse and they will react by instead of pulling inward and a lot of people are going to react by pulling inward and saying well. If this is. This is the doomsday scenario. I need to hoard as much pleasure for myself as I can I cannot afford. I have to do self-care because it's coming to an end and that thing is that's the rational response if we act like libertarians think humans act that will be where we end up crouching into ourselves and then fighting over the last mcnugget in the after spear. But not all of us are going to do that and and the hope is is that enough of people exist like that who make that choice at the right moment to start reversing this trend and I don't know if it'll happen. That's where we get like and people say well now where's your dialectic now wow where's your historical materialism now man. This is essentially the quantum level of politics.

This is the quantum level of history. This is where history happens. This is where events are kindled because in every moment every human being decides to do something because they don't know why they're doing anything and they can make a choice in any moment and if enough of them decide to do something it happens. The social existence is predicated on that you see it working and you keep doing it. But it's harder to see things as society gets more complicated. So you have to create symbolic systems to represent that to represent the sense of security. The sense that advancing the aims of others advances your aims but that runs against the current of accumulating social structures requiring labor and labor being distributed down on the bottom side of the curve towards control over resources control over symbols ability to manipulate symbols.

The priestly classes and you can look at the arc of history and after it happens you can look back and see in perfect amber why everything happened but in the moment anything can happen. It really is true and that's the quantum moment of history and we're living in it and that is the problem with dialectical materialism is that it eventually runs into a quickness of moment. A hugeness of probabilities that are so much more than can be managed by the the equipment of human rationality compared to the like shadow fragmented model train version of the past that we look at like when we've examined the past dialectically and materially we're looking at a little tiny train set like a lionel guy going around even the most dip even our most even our most small grain you know like social history at the at the ground level. The grassroots this kind of stuff that they got into in like the 90s when history turned away from big questions and towards micro histories even if you were able to get that entirely bullet train going from the shanghai airport to downtown with a nuclear weapon at the tip and so we can only just grab on and pray and see what happens whoo once again.

I hope that made sense and somebody says well isn't that just accelerationism isn't that just quietism no sir. It means you got to throw theory away. It means you got to stop arguing these points. It means you have to stop spending time tending your opinions your precious little opinions building your little ship and a bottle of opinions. Oh look at my little opinion bottle. Oh it'll go oh. It'll go across the sea to thomas morris utopia. You gotta smash that consciousnesses to signal boost our ability to examine the moment and coordinate action. That means we have to throw it away. We got to throw it all away and I'm not saying do it right now because it's impossible but you have to smash the idol you could do it.

While you're on the toilet you can do it blow off steam but you have to throw it down and then you have to ask yourself with this hole now with my my anima home. My orgone hall my. My throbbing libido hole now empty what am I gonna fill it with am I to convince myself. That self-care is revolutionary or am. I going to try to fill it with action that seems like it's moving me towards something because I can see it with other people. I can compare notes. All this stuff feels like black pill if you have completely consigned the idea that you can derive any soul satisfaction any tending to the garden of love for others politically other than the internet or that the internet can provide even even a little potted plant. It can't. It's salted earth and that doesn't mean you can't do it. But it means you have to consign it to the re to the realm of recreation and you'll find you can't do it as much because you're not getting the other out of it. You're not getting the sense of of you're sad you're not satisfying in some part of your mind that the imperative to try to make things better in the world. You know you're not you got to just be man. You gotta go out there and you gotta try something and and now it breaks down again because once again. We've tunneled beyond my sight. We've tunneled to the quantum level the individual level.

I don't know what your life is I don't know what your capacities are. I don't know your abilities are and I don't know what your social situation is. I don't know where you are what your job is. I don't know what your family situation is. I don't know where you are vis-a-vis capital or or anything other questions you know that you don't know all about it. But you know more than me and other people around. You know more than me too and on that quantum question. We can only know by asking and that's scary and it potentially makes us have a bad time and when we're self-directed when we're evo ego and id directed. We are only going between good and bad times. We're slaloming between good and bad times because all we have are our moments of pleasure and we know that and they're going away and they're under and at some point they're gone. It's going on a business sale being a human at every moment your supermarket sweep every moment of your life as a human is grabbing as much pile. It up.

People say why do they need so much because they know it's going away and so that boils down to even like a nice afternoon like posting online versus phone banking which one would be more fun in terms of satisfying the the libido that's an easy question if you can answer falsely to yourself well posting is just as good that's where the self-deception at the heart of of of sin is. It's not that's why we're forgiven for sin because we don't even know we're doing it. Our brain is doing it for us. It's below the level of our understanding that's why we should be able to forgive ourselves not like people do anything and have people have to show a track record to be trusted because trust has to be reinforced. It can't be stripped out. It's the only way to reinforce the the positive feedback loops that will get someone to this point that will get enough people that will kick start the motor so and the thing is. I probably am not going to do that because I can probably convince myself that what I'm doing now matters more than like doing something that is less libidinally satisfying because I've got a brain capable of that.

 what's going to bring me down to earth will be my interactions with the world and other people and it will either allow me to sit there or bring me down. And I don't know where I will end up because I don't know what the answer is. I can't because I don't know only interacting with other people will drag me down and what the reason I say that more than anything is is that if your answer to this is easy for you to say podcast man. My answer is yes easy for me to say literally I'm sitting here in front of you as part of like a media career being reinforced with a constant stream of of of positive reinforcement. It's like a I might as well be in a matrix vat sucking in nutrients and that might be true but it doesn't mean what I said isn't true and you've got to ask yourself am. I saying look at him easy for him to say because that answers the question that he's posing or am. I doing that instead of really really asking because I don't want to know the answer and that's another question like the question of what to do that.

I can't know and so I got to do shruggy emoji man ah oh man. That was wow that's over an hour isn't it. Ah well tomorrow we're gonna try to do an office stream. We're going to see if we can get it to work. I'm very excited about it because me and chris are going to be in the lab in the beat laboratory. Soon it's going to be a lot of fun and like. I said this will still exist. I will never not doing stream of consciousness madness into your face but then afterwards maybe we have some q a maybe. We have a guest. Maybe. We play some video games so your favorite your favorite jabbering madness will continue until morale improves if anybody 

It's only been 40 minutes oh. I started at five. I lost. I usually start at six and then at the end of that. I looked on I forgot. I started at five today never mind. That's why I was kind of like shocked because it didn't feel that long now I know why who will I watch the last episode of the simpsons yes. I haven't seen the simpsons. I haven't seen a new simpsons episode in years. I think I generally try to watch the treehouse of horror. I honestly think I might be a couple years behind though check hulu or I guess. It's fx now But I will definitely watch the last one if I'm alive for it which is a big. If I mean I could definitely die before the simpsons ends for any number of reasons yeah.

Apparently somebody on twitter said that that a dude who works teaches an ivy was stealing my bars to spit at a lady. That's I don't know what to think of that. Honestly. It does make me imagine a alternative world where I was a mystery style pickup artist which I think could have been fun but no not for me not for me. That life covet is definitely exacerbating the posting issue. But we also see how there is like there's a flip side to that right because people get more into posting but also the more that they are kept away from like what they used to consider normal because you know things are normalizing but not completely and not evenly the longer they feel that way the more tense they feel and the less computer can like satisfy them it. It exacerbates the personal stress that leads to the explosion because like everyone's gonna have to come to a point where their personal stress and their perception of social stress are over is larger than the amount of pleasure that they can convince themselves. They can get out of posting um and obviously that's going to be unevenly distributed and they're going to be people who are going. The people are going to be hardest to fight. The ones that are going to hold on the longest are the ones who have basically no personal angst in their life because then they get to play like a game because yes yes they care about other people and they put a lot of their heart into it.

But it's a very light touch like it's not a religious devotion. It's not. It's not. It doesn't come from a spiritual sense. It's just. It's like. It's utilitarianism which is what liberalism is liberalism is just look. It's inefficient to misuse all this human capital because everyone's not me they're abstractly good why because if people are nice to each other they can cooperate and cooperation is better for human progress than the alternative that's really what they believe and it's like. They don't think that they think themselves as having deep moral beliefs but at a level that they aren't even aware of their liberal conception of the self is such that they have no mooring for their conviction that other people believe equally like that's the heart. That's the true thing that people say about about liberals of godless liberalism like the the notion of a secular society that is the true indictment. it doesn't mean anything because that you need that for like we live in a liberal world. We need that as a basis we can't have a religious sectarian in in a world where religion is sectional. We cannot have sectarian ethics. It is not sustainable it has to be secular. It has to be liberal because that's everyone is somebody else and we have to negotiate living here.

That's the real principle of place. Those people are living with old ideas those people are literally in pre-modern notions of of of good and evil and of humanity and one idea where like if one is not redeemed within one religious tradition. One is one is someone that things can be done too that is the condition to be in a pre-modern religion when we hadn't had the technological development to create a exchange to necessitate exchange across enough areas of distrust that we had to put our weapons down to not destroy one another and you could just take anything you wanted if you were more powerful than the other person and where your social belief like the intensity of your social belief determined in part your or maybe even in total. I mean relative to your material conditions of course your strength and your ability to control things and therefore your ability to save the world and redeem it against something. That is someone that you can do things too and that's also where you can then offload social tension and pressure by destroying and conquering another liberalism.

When that's not sustainable because we have a global communications and we have a technological level that allows us to destroy one another completely in war. It's not like a you know. It's not cyclical like old wars. It's cumulative. It's not like the flower wars. It might be bloody and horrible but that don't wreck the ability of the people there who live within them to sustain themselves. Modern warfare creates even even even early modern warfare is is far too dangerous to human flourishing to be allowed to go unchecked and the in the liberal model allows us to do that. But there's no religious foundation to it. There is no there's no connection from one to the other in it. The connection is severed because now we're in a market and we're separate people and we are not connected and that has to be replaced and and it's replaced by our ability to create ourselves through consumption. That's where we build our souls. But at the level of ethics.

It really does come down to viewing them as utilitarianism because. It's the it is the ideology of capitalism which means it's the ideology of profit a surplus profit consumption or extraction and so therefore it's guiding moral principle. It's programming is efficiency to get the most off the bone and the process of capitalizing a society and capitalizing a world market is to create a efficient system for extraction. Now. It's not going to be fully efficient because society is like the gunk in the filter and it's in it and it reduces the amount you can do. But you work against that you grind against that too to create premium efficiency and so liberalism is religious. It's religious worship is efficiency efficiency of exchange between others because we are all only ourselves.

We are not each other and the end result of that is an ethic that says oh is an ethic that says I care about other people but really at heart. It's because it's most efficient to love them and when that's and that could be good. People can act in sincere good will out of that desire problem is if it comes under pressure if it comes under pressure especially since there's no felt personal discomfort that their lives are comfortable that all of their pain associated with the condition is theoretical and felt and imagined in their head and imagine the connection to people who aren't them. Then. It's fragile and it can come cramming down crumbling down grambling. Crumbling down.

If the only thing being served is the self because you can decide that well you know oh well or you could say you know what posting is doing the work even though you never see it rewarded or you know what those guys don't actually deserve it and these ones don't too and oh yeah you know what and by the way none of it's ever going to happen anyway we'll never have socialism. We just need to punish people right now for the crimes they've committed that's the only justice we're going to have is like as the ship's going down like shooting the captain for running into the iceberg. That's our only justices vengeance with just nihilistic vengeance and we can just post post posts or You know refuse to step down no matter what happens on the other end. You have people who feel intense personal angst and pressure and pain whose family conditions are very very bad. Now there's fewer of them because people like that generally don't have the ability or time to post as much so they can't even get anything out of it. But the ones who are their distress can cause them to privilege their the relief of their own suffering and there's no way you can blame them for that because it's their suffering and everyone else's is imaginary.

The way that you coordinate a class awakening into itself is bringing those ideas together acosta chasm bringing bringing together a felt sense of the right and of good to a social sense of the right and the good that are in alignment and that flow across one another because over time that will make suffering not your own and and the suffering of others will replace that because you're suffering less because your personal suffering has been been relieved to an extent because you're not fighting your conditions and it's like that sucks because it's asking people to to sacrifice the way. Other people don't have to and that's unfair but sadly that's also unavoidable what we need. The idea is that there are enough people in the middle. There are enough people who suffer a good deal but still have a social connection because they have a spirituality and enough people who don't have much spirituality because it's been eroded away by pleasure but do have a social sense and connect them. That's the only future that's the only engine and basically what I just described those two sectors of people.

The top sector. I'm mostly describing the dreaded pmc who make up pretty much everybody arguing on twitter in some way or another including people who hate them including people who fight them all day they're on the top half of that distribution of pain. The bottom half are disengaged from politics for the most part and the one who aren't are often oriented along reactionary mindsets because they are filled with justified anger at the way that their life is going and right and and historically what happens is that you have enough you essentially have enough of an elite overproduction. Like 1848 is a good example of this the the 1848 elect. rebellions were kicked off because you had an elite overproduction of college graduates who were just hanging around these cities and just getting antsy because they weren't getting the condition they weren't. Their lives weren't what they wanted them to be. But they were not the misery of the lives of you know the spinners and the weavers and the early proletarians or or as back breaking and isolated as they were as they working in the peasant in peasant agriculture and the land and they had enough time to sit around and and talk between themselves and to other people including those workers about what was going on and they formulated an understanding of what was actually happening and they communicated across this narrow social chasm because remember this is pre-modern.

I mean this is pre-capitalism really. It's still like it's capitalism but it's embedded still within feudalism. Feudalism has not been annihilated by any stretch. Yet. Its remnants are still the structure. The thing is embedded in it meaning there's a there's a social basis for interaction that is that has still not been dissolved by the market completely and that means crossing that chasm is easier. There's less mistrust. There's more social commingling.

We're in a situation now where that conveyor belt between those two classes has been broken and I don't know how to mend it this is where we're at the quantum point like if the fan belt is busted and it's snapped and you can't get another one you just. Gotta glue that motor. I know that sounds like a bunch of mystical hogwash and it probably is and it's not really worth thinking about from day to day and I'll probably not talk about it more in the future. But um it's how I think of the question in front of us. It's like when I talk about it. I try not to get that woo-woo about it. But this is the this is the shape of the question how to repair that belt oh man. I don't know if we'll do another call of cthulhu for a while. The call of cthulhu games are a lot of work and I think virgil is is. He's operating at a very high and intense frequency right now. I don't he's got a little honest. He's got a lot on his plate creatively but I would it might happen. There's just nothing planned oh.

I've never tried to pick anyone up. Someone asked some picking lines. I've never tried to pick anyone up seems like an incredibly awkward moment with soup praxis oh yes certainly eating. It is anyway if you get a nice stone soup. Going you know everybody brings one ingredient and boom you have a stew. Someone's people are really mad at this mug. I think we got it at target. It was just it's a nice design.

I guess this is kind of like for some people. This is basically the confederate flag and that's a strong argument. It's I'm not trying to make a message. This is not a spacey message. I'm not trying to indicate that I'm like. I'm an mi68 asset. I'm here from the I'm here on the mission of the queen to sow disinformation on american airwaves to defend to protect the queen against accusations of epstein-related crimes. We did a reading series today. Someone asked what happened to reading series I guess there just haven't been a lot. The takes during a presidential election are generally pretty repetitive and boring you've got to have sort of a slack political environment for people to start just riffing. So you generally have less during a political. I think during the during the meet of a political especially this one since such. It's trump again and it's a lot of the same stuff. It's a lot of the same exact arguments and idea anxieties. But we have one today and I think it's pretty good. It's it's maddie g or maddie y maddie yg maddie iglesias man. The man is his heart pump kool-aid. As they say for you are neither hot nor cold but lukewarm and I should spew you out of my mouth. He is he is nietzs. Che's last man. I don't know what the belden program is. Brace has not shared it with me yet but I wholeheartedly endorse it. I'm not kidding if if brace is serious about running for president of the left I have he has my full support. I will. I would absolute happily be trotsky to his lenin or maybe. I could be stalin. We'll see how it goes. But I think maybe liz is stalin honestly but yes no he's. I have never seen a. I've never seen a brace take on politics that I disagreed with like his. He he gets the terms he gets the problems he gets the set of issues. He understands the bad actors. He understands the pathologies he knows where the material intersects with the cultural he knows which way the flow goes if he wants to tell everyone what to do. I would help him and in fact I wouldn't even have to help him. I would just happily live under his reign or and help move towards the upholding of belden thought yeah. Liz is stalin. I'm trotsky yeah and lennon is 

No brace is my boy. He's vi lining all over the place. I don't know when we're going to do the george w bush episode. It might it might be a bit. There you got to get warned that we often will say we should do an episode and then it ends up not getting done because you kind of need to have like a hole in your calendar to fill to go to the back catalog and sometimes you go a while without having one. But I think maybe in the next month or two. Anyone that requires any kind of work is always harder but I think now that felix has read fortunate son. I think it was or family of secrets. I think we'll I think we'll get it done. Pretty soon we're also going to me and will and felix are also going to do the richard jewell movie episode which I'm looking forward to because. I think that movie. I thought that movie was genius when I saw it and since I've been thinking in the years since it's only more on point. I don't think fina. Felix finished the canals guard guys. I know he left one canal scourge book on like a public transit in europe or something. I don't think he finished it. I think he really appreciated the idea of it and then he didn't need to read it if you know what I mean.

I said the year since. Someone's saying the years since. I saw it said years since if you've heard years. That's a yp not an mp. I lost my religion there for a second but why these trolls are just so chillish why must you insist on being so disagreeable on such a fine day. It is a fine september day indeed and I do not see the need for being quite so argumentative in the comment section. But I understand it is my responsibility to rise above the fray and provide a bit of elegance and and maturity frankly. So I i bid you your day sir people keep talking about a realignment. I don't want to get this is going to maybe. I shouldn't say it honestly. I don't get in trouble but let me just say this. I won't elaborate but it feels like if people say that there's going to be. There might be if biden wins especially a a realignment politically I mean the last couple of polls have shown that biden's lead among hispanics and and blacks is reducing going below historic norms for the party which of course makes people incredulous because the one thing they've been attacking trump on for his entire candidacy has been how racist. He is that's been the number one issue for liberals. The people who dominate the discourse and this sticks and have the the farthest tendril extension into the minds of the popular potential voting base in this country But if biden wins it will be because if these trends are real and who knows but it has been a few polls. It's not just one if he wins. This way it'll be because a big chunk of suburban affluent whites go democrat which is what they're pitching their whole campaign. Around that has been the entire point is to do that that dynamic under the pressure of a means-tested horse piss that's going to be that pressure is going to be exacerbated and if q if the pressure of living in in like under a democrat with this kind of social conditions. Exacerbates even not even evenly but just somewhat near a a equilibrium of distribution between democratic voters and the republican voters you could see queue swell just in time to like break off from the barnacle-like holding restraints of the democratic or the republican party machinery and connect blob-like to the alienated democratic working-class base and then coming together leaving the two shards of of ruling class and and like upper middle class comprador class whatever you want to call it a separate that's the dream. I don't think that will happen.

I don't think that there's any reason or way honestly to act like that's going to happen and what I'm saying like right now the premise has to be action so that means if it's not actionable. It's sort of just forget about it. It's interesting to think about but it shouldn't drive your thinking. I don't think we're there yet but if it does happen. I think that's the only way it happens is if like rfk rfk. Jr is the synthesis character like if rfk. Jr. I know sean. Mccarthy said this on twitter and I think that is dead-on if this were to happen. Rfk junior would be the napoleon the napoleon the third of course who like brings together this like dis aggregated alienation and becomes the figurehead representation of it. But I think as you hear me describe this that doesn't seem terribly plausible. Now that doesn't mean it's not going to happen. We've seen a lot of implausible things happen recently. But I think those are the conditions that as you work through your life on other things look out for it and see if that comes and comes more or less likely over time because it'll be interesting to see. I think it's a whole different ballgame if trump wins though if trump wins you could see q become like a hardened almost paramilitary extension of the republican party and like the greater like white like white lumpin bourgeois that they represent and like small producers at the top like not the high levels of capital but like local levels the the modern equivalents of the guys who made up the early the people who picked taft in 52 and got and got and had the nomination stolen by the eastern bankers in eisenhower and then then they become like the ones. Then they become. I would think you'd see more organized violence from cue because they would feel they would have the imperture of state because the state would turn to them to help help their power be consolidated in a moment of prolonged crisis because we're for talking trump's second term. We're talking siren crisis at every moment an intensification a cranking an upward cranking only no downward cranking biden. We might see some slack in the line for a little bit trump stays in because that's his thing is is antagonizing the contradictions he's banging. The dinner bell every single day so it can only get worse and that means there'll be more dissatisfaction more discontent more violence and then that violence will be organized along who's in power. Now. The question then becomes will. The left in that situation be constrained by the democratic party or finally provide become like the guiding force of a movement a larger working-class movement to shatter and destroy the democratic party and replace it and send its its ruling elite scattering back to the democrat scattering that the republicans are more likely to the private sect sector and then those those connections to global finance being shifted of course over to the conservatives to the republicans to mega that's the apocalyptic confrontation and that seems more likely in the trump version of this of course. All of this is assuming that conditions don't change like a vaccine could radically. There's too many butterflies flapping too many wings to say definitively one way or the other. I'm just sort of gaming it out in my head and just once again emphasizing that that that level of abstraction you really don't have to concern yourself when you're asking the question. What did. I do today with myself you can talk about. You can think about it and talk about it as a recreation when you're done doing what you think you needed to do that day but you got to do that first and that doesn't really connect to that that's still mostly a question. An argument you have just to have an argument which is what I said is the driving force for all this stuff that we turn into real meaningful points of discussion and and difference in separation.

It's very funny because trump's clearly going to lie about the vaccine thing but they're not going to get a vaccine like what's he going to do is. He going to do like some pilot program like a photo op with somebody getting a saline vaccine in in like in in in like dallas. Somewhere like that that the voodoo like the demon seed lady is is injecting some guy with a like a hydrochloroquine vaccinated. Cocktail that's actually diet fanta that would be diabolical because there's no way they would actually be able to get it out to people to actually have in time and honestly. I feel like trump at this point who's going to buy that who's going to go who's going to be on the fence. I guess. This is my question who is going to be on the fence in late october who's going to hear trump saying there's going to be a vaccine and go well. I think he might have a vaccine. I'm not sure but I think he will and then voting for him because oh we might have a vaccine if at that point if you if by late october you've probably decided trump is full of than the democrats which hey when you have biden as your opponent when you have nancy pelosi when you have nancy pelosi going getting. At the salon come on. It's it's plausible but you still don't believe him. You don't think he's got a vaccine come on and so it's not going to be why you pick is what I'm saying so no one's going to pick on that. But they don't know that they're just bitting every button. They can carl barker style trying to get the last money out of the rubes before they realize that the that the spinning wheel is rigged.

I will end with this I said something that seemed like maybe might feel kind of spiritual blah blah blah about how everyone it's going to come down to whether or not people do a thing well. It ends with them like snapping too but the first step is an action. It's action always comes first because the unmoved moving action is the one that is induced by you convincing yourself of something of you having enough faith to move forward and that comes before. But that's not real. It can't be analyzed. It's gossamer so the action has to come first always so enough people are going to act enough to start the snowballing effect or they're not. I'm not saying the process will stop it'll just there won't be enough in time as conditions as the conditions of social deterioration render impossible any unity and I don't think that's going to happen guys. I really don't I'm not going to get into why now. But I really. I really don't think so so. I think that we all know it to ourselves to push to push forward in any way. We can bye guys.
