Wasn't it says it wasn't god damn. It turned it off and turned it back on again no okay boomer. That's why well that will never affect me because d of course. I'm a boomer that's like saying okay mammal. I do not have any kind of sense of insecurity about my generational cohort. I am I am old for a millennial and I am old for a millennial. Like I'm I'm one of the oldest millennials and also I've always been like at the very far edge of the whole scene you know one of those people stopped listening to new music once. I turned like 22. Although I do think it's funny that now. I'm gonna try to around with my phone before. I turned it off and turned it back on again.

So I've already impeached my credibility as a interlocutor before we've even begun so that's always a good way to start. But I'm all about transparency as a way to undermine judgment and protect oneself. It's very good move. It's a smart move oh the insta stream was. I thought it was the twitch deal and I thought twitch was having problems and so I just tried to do it on instagram. But then it was turn. It off and turn it back on again because I'm pretty sure what is happening is that even though I was connected according to the computer with the wi-fi that it wasn't really there like because whatever happens when you haven't turned the phone off and on again recently enough and so I literally just blew in the cartridge. So it could have been muncher that scamp that mischievous scamp. It just occurred to me.

I can't believe how long it took to think about this with muncher being this avatar of our like joyless consumption at the end of history like 40 years of being slimer just consuming consuming as a hungry ghost with no anima no reason for being because we've been stripped of our of our control over our lives and become beings of just pure consumer hedonic examination of spirit like just the the hungry ghost of buddhism literally after 40 years. We're we're now blue and pained and in misery and what does muncher munch what is depicted behind him. In that horrific 3d tableau they unveiled corn he munches. Monsanto franken diet that we all eat corn in the sh corn in everything thanks to high fructose corn syrups corn in a gas tank as I said on the iowa state fair dock that we did you could build not you could build the twin towers out of corn and crash them into 747s made of corn every day and you would not run out of corn. It's in plastic. It's everything and that's mud shirt that's us sucking the corn anyway.

That's not what I was coming to talk today about. I have an actual point here. That's why. I call this one a vote ball sequel because I feel like I'm getting another piece of the puzzle together that has made me pretty confident that I can now really start to try as people have asked me to to put something down on paper because I feel like there's been a missing piece a way to talk about things a way to approach the subject that's made it hard for me to imagine a coherent thing out of it that I could move forward with now. I think I have it but first let me say that the other day.

I said that I knew how the what the ending of trading places was and I explained it and I asked if that was correct and most people said it was right but I did get a dm from someone who pointed out that there's one detail. I missed which is that they did not take dennholm elliott the butler's money to chicago to buy. The frozen concentrated orange juice because this is a futures market as the guy pointed out to me. These are commodity futures what they were doing is they were taking his money to act as collateral to make a margin to and then like basically taking on the assumed debt. Implicit in that arrangement selling their future contracts as in saying I will buy. I will deliver you frozen concentrated orange juice at this date for this price and they sold those at the height of the frenzy and then after the real crop report came out. We were like oh no there's not going to be that much demand for oranges because we're going to have a glut of oranges it collapsed and then they bought those contracts at that point and pocketed the difference by just literally being the middleman and that comes down the reason. I didn't know that is because I didn't really understand that I really hadn't fully internalized that that's what a futures market is like you're literally just. It's just time. It's not the commodities themselves so that's a man culpa.

I didn't get that part right but what I come here today to try to do is take us from where we were talking about like the social base of this baronial revolt. We're seeing now the beautiful boaters against global capitalism and we talked about their democr. Their like demographic and geographic distribution. Their politics and all that stuff and how that is the actual like power structure that is resisting capitalism not the people not because because yes we are all being alienated by it. But our alienation is being gathered around the cultural. Concepts generated by that culture that those regional baronies basically and and as such like we're not actually um. We're not actually seeing any real combat. About. You know the underlying system of economic exploitation undergirding both flavors of capitalism both essentially it's essentially a battle of time. It's it's the future versus the past of capitalism and then and then the present is like the crucible of their conflict and we are subject to this dispute and we can pick sides but that's because we're being. We don't live as as as workers. We live as as consumers as of spectacle and of everything munchers as it were and that's as far as good as far as it goes. But the one other thing that I have kind of been gnawing at and trying to understand and I've used the college thing a lot that people are sick of me talking about college as like a way to try to get at understanding the dynamic here. But it and it all felt clumsy. I felt like. I was onto something but it felt clumsy and this is what really made it click for me is that forget about college necessarily. What we're talking about is so we've got two political wings right. We've got the two battles the two the two super structural battles or the super structural battle between the two.

[08:40](https://youtu.be/vcFSPIYR_vg?t=08m40s)

 types of capitalism as reflected by the political parties that they are represented by right the democrats and the republicans and so we talked about the voters and that's the social base of of the republicans we haven't talked as much about the social base of the democrats but as you can imagine. It is the white people who instead of being local barons instead of controlling capital in fixed positions like franchises or oil extraction industries or anything else. They work. They work their way through the credentialing process to apply their minds to gain high status relatively. High paid work in the professional managerial class that's the voters like obviously at the top the billionaires. But these are the voters because disproportionately the vote people who vote vote most frequently vote in primaries and therefore shape the re like the political environment that we we live in and are just absorb. Every day are older wealthier versions of the voters of both sides. So we are talking here unitedly. Even if you say oh they might not technically be capitalists. They have capitalist interests and most of them. Even these pmc people. They have investments in the market beyond even a 401k in a house like they have they are invested in the market. They are capitalists the way that the petty bourgeois often are where it's not a universe. It's it's not a unrestrained position of you know of capital ownership. But it is their wealth is and their position is inflected with it.

So those are the voters but the politics that we're seeing and the politics that we care about and the politics that we imagine the politics represented not by cable news but by the internet i.e politics as it's understood by the younger people who don't make up the voting base of politics but make up the activist base that online and in the real world creates what we call. A political like movements momentum the left and right as represented not on television but online these people are the ones that we all are and these people are the ones that we are all arguing against and who who we spend time just dissecting the motives of and and things like that because this is the self-consciously political level who are they they are for the most part not working class in the sense of being directly exploited. As employees you know for their labor as a you know not even getting all of the the the cultural. That comes when you're dealing with you know a high status jobs you know like your your. Your retail workers your your doordash whatever they largely don't vote and don't participate in politics necessarily because they see it as false because they live too close to the reality of its fraud which people in the middle are and when they're kids and most ex most susceptible to creating structures that dominate the thinking that goes on the rest of their life where they are programmed. They're too comfortable to have that they have to be disillusioned.

No one at the bottom gets illusioned in the first place and so that means that we're not talking about the working class in general and we're definitely not talking about the poor and more than that. We are not talking about the generationally poor yes. Some of the people in this middle that we're going to be talking about are money poor from poor money families but they likely have a college degree and at one point generated had ideas of like um um upward mobility and probably more than likely more than that. Most likely they came up in that middle section of like a pmc or a small business small bourgeois or that remaining slice of labor aristocracy that does exist. There's still a labor aristocracy folks it's small and shrinking but it's still there the public sector in in trades. It's there these are generationally poor like if they went to college.

They were the first members of their family to go something like that who were talking about who actually not only votes but creates the space of online argumentation. The space of political self-conception. The kind of thing that gets somebody to put on a hawaiian shirt and walk outside during a riot with a gun or just to make somebody decide to go out and throw a brick and a cop. Like these things are not created by our social relationships near so much as they are created by our pseudo relationships between the internet and ourselves because where else are we getting anything where that is where we live. We all know it who these people are are the children of those people at the top. They are the downwardly mobile children. They are the children who went to college with the expectation. That life would be something like their parents lives if and if they did the things that their parents told them to do and not just their parents. Everything around them told them to do. They had a social contract in their hand and then they graduated from college and it got rescinded. These are the people maybe they fail son into their parents basement and became pepes maybe.

They became a abyss which no one had prepared you for and that's that feeling that fall that's what's powering politics at the level of activism activism remember because if it's not if it's passive spectacle observation it's just tv and it will just be continue with being what it is any anything any illusion. We have that we can shape the system away from total annihilation. It assumes active political participation not voting and not imagining oneself to have a identity so that means what we have since. We don't have a social order and we don't live class and we don't for the most part have class struggle. In our lives. We have a spectacle and we have consumption our our activism is inflected with that. Our activism is spectacular and it is more than anything libidinal because we are not activating. We are not being um being activists on behalf of any sort of universal love self-abnegating submission to a cause greater than ourselves because that requires a faith in one another an emotional connection to other people both intimately and abstractly that persists beyond one's self-gratifying impulses that's been scrubbed out of us that has been bleached out of us we aren't those people we live in the culture that they created for a long time and we see what they what their lives were like and we used the language that they used. We use the vocabulary and the ideas and the symbols that they use. But they are hollow and empty. But we don't know that there is nothing that isn't there's nothing to contrast it with so everything is ashes. I don't care how religious you are if you're a our spaghetti monster moderator and that means that when we become active and the politics we create and the politics we've created until now what we are creating is a politics of aggrieved customers because we at a level deeper than thought are operating are being driven forward by pure self. The desire for pure self um self satisfaction with no conception that self is infused with others because we have that drilled out of us our entire lives.

I don't blame anybody for acting that way and that is why when I say this. I'm saying. I'm not saying. I'm not accusing anyone of anything. I'm not saying anything bad about anybody. I'm including everyone who is listening to this myself.

[18:20](https://youtu.be/vcFSPIYR_vg?t=18m20s)

The entire politically active second generation dispossessed downwardly mobile americans who make up the political class. Now the active political class they don't have any other way to be. This is the only way that you have to be now people who have politics that they think are good like to think that they work thought themselves to those politics and that what made them not selfish made them like act for socialism and fight for socialism. It's because they had some sort of conversion. Something about them was different and special and it really isn't that it's really which shoot which demographic um corn shoot you get pushed down by through basically almost entirely chance and that's what sorts you not any virtue on your heart. It's like. Plinko you can end up in a shoot thanks to banging into things that are based on your race gender. Class where geography everything injury disability. These things are shaping things not some universal drive towards transcendental you know politics which you need to have to power a meaningful left. But no one knows that because they don't have anything to contrast it with the anybody else's lives and so if all we know is our lives as consumers in this society and we relate to this new retraction of the social contract. As consumers our desire will be to speak to the. People are so pissed is because the customer is no longer right. If he ever was. It was a con that was run and now at the end of the line. The reality has been revealed and how are we going to play deal with it and so our politics which we think are activists and we think are moving us towards a better world and are generated by you know real human solidarity and they are at some level because once you start acting that way you start realizing oh the world. There is this thing better than me oh my god.

There is sacrifices that mean something and that changes you but you're still embedding. All those experiences on top of this rickety structure that's created because you think that politics is complaining to someone else until they fix it for you because we have no understanding of ourselves as social coordinated actors. We are only individual. Isolated actors and consumption is our expression of autonomy and action. It's the only thing we can do and so we do it and so if you want to talk about every the rise of fascism and the question of is it fascism and the question of who's oh well you know what what could you say slurs at a tsa mean. All of these things are pseudo controversies. This arguments to be had that are being indulged by people who think they're acting out of altruistic you know socialist instincts but are truly just trying to get their rocks off. All of it is yelling at someone who you can imagine is responsible for your pain that's it and it's disguised as leftism. It's disguised as rightism. Obvious all of it is fake. It's a masquerade to re to hide from ourselves the reality that they were just yelling at a customer service rep what is twitter what is social media but an unmoderated customer service chat room to the united states of america where we say fascists in the streets fix. This wow record-setting global warming excuse me anybody that's it and no one is paying attention. No one is recording any of this your call is not important to us.

You will not be held after for a quiz on your happiness with the interaction you get nothing you have to make do and so we make a politics of sadism of punishing people that we can imagine are responsible because we are cut off from even imagining productive politics that challenges capitalism from a position of strength and solidarity that transcends race transcends. Gender transcends generation but is unified around an understanding of humanity that insists that there is more to the human experience than can be expressed in numbers which is the drive of the capitalist algorithm ex pulling the soul out of humanity like kalima pulling out. Indiana jones heart and so take something like the woke versus unwoke question on the left you know ooh slurs oh should we say slurs to when we're doing socialism or is that you know alienating you're talking on behalf of people who aren't there and you're only making it an issue you're making an issue preemptively. These things are not emerging from like real connection or real events. They are all people hypothetically creating situations to then get mad about. That's it before they even come up if they came up in the subject of struggle. A lot of this like a meeting to unionize a workplace or a meeting with an activist group why would they care about their if they can say slurs and why would anybody else care slurs were said incidentally.

You know they would have bigger to worry about everything flies off into neurotic flights of fancy because we're not looking to fix anything we can't even imagine committing ourselves enough for body and soul and heart to do that we are looking for someone in our vicinity to blame and scream. At I remember. The dsa convention I went to this is in 2017. This is right after dsa blew up after the trump election and we all went there as like press. I tried to actually go there as a as a delegate for the cincinnati dsa but I ended up not doing that and there in the lead up to it. There was a big controversy because a lot of the delegates said that they weren't getting enough money from national to pay for travel to since chicago and like and that the the stuff that was there which was like there was discounted like living arrangements provided and there were meals and stuff but and it was like subsidized but it wasn't free and so people got insanely angry about that and started like yelling about how this was you know classist and it was.

It was showing you know that that the poor couldn't involve themselves in this and you know in the moment. Those sides seem to be very like that seemed to be a meaningful debate about you know how do we extend democracy out and how do we recognize things like you know class privilege and access to resources. How do we allow the subaltern to speak but the whole time. I couldn't help thinking that if there was real stakes here people would figure it out instead of making it an argument and making it a conflict with the in within the organization which is never a good thing if you want. An organization that is effective like you might have been right in the narrow way that there could have been more done to provide but making it public and making a big argument about it by definition weakens the organization like the idea that it's all good like I'm sorry like the idea that you're going to do public struggle sessions in an organization. That's trying to recruit people which means that you're involving people who are just looking up from afar. You're demanding that they take a position on arcane. Note matters like this before they can even enter the tent why would that not scare people away and for what benefit you could figure this out and it doesn't take people being cops and it doesn't take people being wreckers. All it takes is everybody looking for an outlet looking for a manager to yell at and it's not their fault. They're captured by this as much as anybody and nobody's gonna think or argue their way out of these conflicts because they're serving a deeper need than anything rational.

So you cannot break off from them unless you find another place to find that meaning and energy something outside of that loop that loop of of of hedonic exaltation and then despair and that heightened and that ever heightening need to intensify the cycle in order to make up for the fact that it's wearing off. It always wears off and you have to seek something else and then that that is why the questions that occupy the minds of people day and night day in and day out baffle me sometimes because the movement that's going to come is going to have a religious not in a sectarian sense but in a sense of a articulated spiritual dimension because it will be arriving alongside and embedded in real struggles between people where bonds are formed emotional connections that transcend the rational accurate symbolic representation for relations that we have to console ourselves with because we build so much of our emotional lives around fake con interactions and that will create when I say religious. I just mean that like if you get into a meeting and you have a conflict with somebody instead of flying into a rage so that you can make a scene and be a martyr and get people on your side in your conflict with the other people in the organization who you've decided are actually the reason. We don't have socialism because you're mad at them if that you could kind of like work things out more easily if the hair trigger. If the if that hair trigger wasn't there waiting to spring on someone else because that's what we're really there for if you're really there for something else then conflicts holy. You can resolve them. You can agree to formats for resolution of issues and go through channels instead of creating dramas that reinforce your sensual relationship to politics and the reason. For the reason that this is the dominant form is because the people doing this they grew up as consumers.

[30:34](https://youtu.be/vcFSPIYR_vg?t=30m34s)

They did not grow up alienated from this system. Like. I was on minion death cult the other night last night and they asked me like a lot of these people who are like you might. Not the robin hood deal. It might not cause a revolution through you know the mech the manipulation of stocks and stuff. But it's gonna alienate a lot of people. It's to disillusion a lot of people away from um away from believing that the the capitalism is you know anything other than predation. But I said that we already have a critical mass of americans who know that already who don't need to be disillusioned the poor and it does not make them into a weapon of political activism because being poor is not a relationship that builds durable self-sustaining conflict with the state. The way that labor does. It's got to be from the point of view of labor. That's the only way it's happening. That's the only way that a spark's going to be lit that isn't going to be consumed by this inferno of idiocy. But these middle-class kids like I said not necessarily from the families of the beautiful boating. Small bourgeois ownership class not necessarily even high level pmcs but like if we're talking about the last generation to get any of that good juice from the. Post-war bubble nurses school teachers even those labor aristocrats. Those few remaining you know union factory workers but also like skilled laborers like hvac guys and plumbers and um electricians like those those guys still exist the building trades. Those guys still exist and they make middle-class lives for their kids.

Lives of comfort lies where when you're growing up you do not see the world as alienating. It is alienated as as like the tendrils of trauma. Many of them like induced by your own body changing on you and others from externally externally bend you towards like trying to seek understanding and like the more costed you are the less you see capitalism as it is and you see the system as it is the later you come to that moment of alienation the harder it is to undo your own programming so that's why the move this this coming tide. This rising that may or may not that will come but may or may not come in time. That's the only open question is going to come from the real pros but not that doesn't mean that people who grew up that way and now find themselves like really struggling and therefore resent being said that they're the pmc hey am. I like I'm not I under yes but you are falling and it's a different relationship to politics. If you can drop that karen in your head you can join man.

You can find it come on in the water's fine. It's not here yet. Obviously it well in tendrils and in in grass fire conflagrations that exist. But I'm not there. I don't know where they are sure as hell isn't around me but wherever it is and when it starts coming together like the the drums that's that started the haitian revolution. I was trying to remember where it started boy cain or something. I think we're going to do black reconstruction. I don't have a copy yet so it might not be right now. But I think we're going to do black reconstruction. Next boy came on that's it drums and you can.

[35:00](https://youtu.be/vcFSPIYR_vg?t=35m00s)

Ass gives you and it gives me like. I said this is all me. I'm literally yelling at myself every time. I talk about this off yes. I am projecting I am projecting 100 percent. The question is am I projecting out towards something that exists like yeah everyone's projecting that's literally what you do. That's all that that's all that like thinking is you're the only point of reference. You are the only point of reference. I'm sorry doesn't matter how many master's thesis like everyone's projecting. The only question is like who and who makes sense and who doesn't is does it sound like they're projecting accurately does it sound like they're describing a universalized experience or are they being bent by neuroses and self-interest into saying something else. No. It's not solipsism because you recognize that what makes truth is not anything in your head. What makes truth is what you can reflect through others because everybody that thing about you're the only one that applies to everybody so comparing notes laying experiences on top of each other and seeing what makes what connects that's it. That's the only real generator of meaning and fact and truth. That's it nothing can come from within.

It can only be reflected backwards yeah. I finally realized that that's like really really what I'm really all about. I'm a feminologist. What's it called a phenomenologist yeah that really is me a phenomenologist amateur phenomenologist. I'll put that on my because everything else it's like. It's all good. I love it history economics. Politics love talking about it but at a certain level you have to start um you have to start playing with tools that I don't really handle very well numbers. For example there my fingers are very clumsy so if I can stay up here. That's where I really feel like I'm snapping things together but then once. I try to like come from the other end. I gotta use numbers. It's not so good okay that felt really good so. I'm gonna. I'm gonna put together some stuff and I'm gonna start writing soon so look forward to something soon. I'm very excited and it'll all and then the beauty thing is is that I will preface the thing by saying look There you can look like the statements. I make in this book. I am not going to cite myself. I am not going to. I'm not going to back it up. I'm not going to have stats. I'm not going to have numbers they exist and I believe that everything I say will be built on a nice structure of you know well integrated. You know empirical understanding but they will mostly be take or leave concepts and if you if you if you accept them. I think they really will they will all hold together but if you reject any of them.

That's fine and you may have your reasons. But it's up to you to decide are my reasons good or are they bad do. I really disagree with this because there's something wrong here or am I looking for something because I don't want it to be right. Now now people can find their own research people can people can. I don't the whole point is to is to reject that like that's that's the thing that gets you locked in here the idea that if you can know to a fine enough degree why something is happening if you can get a swiss enough a well timed enough. Little swiss watch of every phenomenon in within like the political system that that will help you find the right thing to do and that's that line will never appear because if you don't want to cross it you will figure out a way not to cross it the line of risk. The line of self-sacrifice you will if it's always going to be a question of empirical understanding you will always be able to xenos paradox your way from ever crossing the line you have to ask yourself deeper questions and if you want to try to like pull things towards you know more grounded observation to back it up or say oh yeah. The whole premise of this is wrong fine but that's going to be on you knowing when to quit knowing your limitations in a world where you can convince yourself that you know everything that's one of the only ways that you can really be productively intellectual because that's what allows you to sort of you know showcase your best cut of meat and not the thing. I will not be held accountable. Can't do.

It can't be done can't be held accountable sorry not going to happen can't be held accountable but but now. I find him bro simply unaccountable accountable boy. They all said can't be done can't be held accountable and like I make fun of that phrase but look at it. When they say someone needs to be held accountable. They are writing a comment card because they're not gonna do it what they're gonna post about it. They're gonna do the if everyone did the same thing. They did to hold the person accountable what would change about their life. So if that's not it clearly the implication is someone else is gonna do something. I think the real hope the real thing that drives everyone participating in the political project unconsciously or not is that the way the world changes is that you say things enough. You find the right phrases and the right words and everything clicks and then everyone just changes their view simultaneously and then acts differently because of that and that's not that is my friend's idealism. That's not what doesn't it is conflict. It's forces in conflict right. Now we are in the middle of a class war. It's turning into a class genocide and a lot of that reason for that is that the actual working class is not fighting it. They're essentially just getting murked without putting up a duke because they are not self-conscious and organized as a working class. That project has not even really begun there's embers of it from the burned structures that have been met destroyed especially since the 70s. All over the world.

Not just in the united states or even in europe and now we have to live in the move things not just not people all complaining in unison to some imagined power that will address our grievances. They're in power to ignore our grievances and to only address them in a way that helps them maintain their power. As soon as the power is threatened by your unified demands. Those demands will be ignored which is why people saying that cancel culture is why like discord could get away with cancer. With suspending the wall street beats the page like oh if you guys hadn't created this idea and and precedent that it's okay for tech companies to sense their speech. They wouldn't use speeches and excuse no they would use something else as an excuse they're in charge. They do what they want and because they are just telling us how it is and we have nothing to say about it when they figure out a justification. All they have to do is figure out what the room tone of the cultural moment is and then use that language if they had to do it. During the bush administration. They would have said it was about terrorism now because the cultural tenor has changed. The cultural hegemony is different. They'll tell you that it's because it's racist or nazi or something. They'll use the tools that are there but they get to pick them up and the reason nobody can accept that even if they believe it intellectually is because if you really understand that that's the case no amount of this do that because it looks hopeless and nobody wants to suffer unnecessarily and the only thing that breaks you through that lets you do the indie. Anna jones leap of.

Faith into the goddamn hole is if you have a thing beyond reason driving you an emotion an emotion that is generated by a feeling that transcends language and rationality otherwise known as faith not in anything specifically it's all arbitrary. It's all symbology. It's all the things that work. It's the simplest. It is. The most religion is basically getting the these symbols that can con that can hold the most emotional meaning in the fewest characters or lines.

That's what it is john brown yourself indeed not about the killing and this is a perfect example. John brown has become the idea fix of the like online left since 19 since 2016. Correct no one can argue against that why is he fetishized because he killed slave owners because he cut the heads off of some. Head off it's fetishizing violent retribution again against our aggrieved individuality. Our the contract has been breached and someone needs to pay. That's what we're dreaming about. But we still do need john brown. But we need john brown because what drove him to do that a thing that violated his christian sensibilities and also made him a marked man for the rest of his life was fate. He saw the moment the context of that of the of the ostawatomy.

Massacre was that a big confrontation had just arisen a final big like apocalyptic confrontation between the free state forces and the slave authorities in missouri and there was essentially a siege of lawrence. A bunch of butternut crackers were were huddled around lawrence threatening to sack it and and like the the free state governor and government were inside of it and they backed down the free state side back down because nobody wanted to spill any blood certainly not their own and from that moment brown knew it was going to happen if it was if there was not an intervention if he didn't do something to change the contours of the conflict. What would happen is missouri would end up becoming a slave state and this was the fear of the antebellum abolitionist and nobody talks about it anymore but it is actually absolutely I think what would have happened missouri comes. This is a slave state unbalancing the order of the um unbalancing the senate so that now there's a majority of slave state senators and the northern states would have seceded. The northern states would have just said you know what by which the federalists threatened to do during the war of 1812 at the hartford convention which is one of the things that helped drive a stake through the heart of the federalist project and then slavery would have persisted because the south would let him go good. You guys go.

We're gonna have our little shitty and that was going to be what happened unless the stakes changed and so they went and found. Some heads off and overnight that changed the stakes of the conflict. So it was not someone's going to pay for this situation that can't change now some manager is going to get talked to so. I can feel better about my grievance. This is going to materially change the conditions and drive us towards a conflict which happened after bleeding at people talk about the europe like riding into pro-slavery settlements and just rustling cattle and having shootouts with us cavalry and fight and that's what galvanized northern sentiment to make the democratic compromise that had allowed the the democracy to hold together in the face of the wigs splitting up and the you know their opposition becoming hegemonically anti-slavery that was the last that was the digest and as soon as as soon as the question of bringing in kansas became central to the party platforms It was no longer the democratic party was no longer viable and honestly it might not even matter because lincoln swept the north even more because it's not like. There were a lot of votes for breckenridge or bell anywhere in the northern states even where it was a two-man race lincoln cleaned douglas's clock and the thing that changed that dynamic and of course there's other stuff and there's no way to say that if he hadn't done oscillatory creek that like we wouldn't had a civil war like obviously.

But he he acted out of a sense of the terrain. He was not acting out of a desire to see vengeance done and to see himself his bloodthirst slated. I was in his 50s at that point if he wanted that he would have done it earlier oh man chinese new year. They're gonna rub our asses into it and we have it coming so when you they see somebody fetishizing. John brown asked like what are you really into this for and hopefully. People will get that but like it means more than just symbolizing it. You have to interrogate yourself and you have to find you have to log off and not just like not go on the internet. Not have anything around you at all but yourself to second of the day. We're like in harrison bergeron. We don't even know we're doing it. We gotta sit with it and then you got to act to the people around you and you got to build those relationships through experience that let you carry through and do things that are against your immediate self-interest because you're carrying with you a warmth. That's always there.

It's always renewing that's cool all right. There. You go so yeah something's gonna be. It's gonna be some stuff like that in whatever I end up writing. I do try to meditate. I've been bad at it lately but I do like it and I hope to get better at it and you know it all sounds like a like a retreat to the self which is exactly what happened after the 60s but that's inevitable like. I said this experience does not for. Most people generate anything differently and even among people who it does generate something into their experience might not allow them to activate their new beliefs and they might end up getting just beaten out of them by life. You know like it is this it only generates bad d you know it only generates this. This empty hollow depressed life. It doesn't it it. It suppresses the spark of you know of of something beyond that that the awareness that you are actually connected to something other than yourself that you're not cut off and so most people aren't going to be able to do anything effective their whole lives. It's unlikely the only the things that make it more likely are things like class struggle being articulated as such which I think is going to happen but like. I said you know we're just. We're on a timed time level situation. But we're mostly going to continue to like the majority of all of us. We have to remember this no matter what we individually have whatever one of you whoever you are when you're hearing this whatever you decide to do with your life.

There's no there's no likelihood that the that anything like the majority of people is going to have some sort of shocking change of recognition that's not going to happen. They're going to they're going to be. They're going to go towards their demographic cohort as long as they are experiencing life through the lenses of the consumer and that's why the 60s fell to that because it was it was a consumer revolt in the same frame. In the same way. Only it was about it was the high expectations were even higher they were already getting stuff that objectively we would be drooling for but because of that they had higher expectations than the culture could give them and so that was a that was a consumer revolt too and now we're having another one. The difference is that there is no big bucket of gravy at the end of the rainbow to drown these. There's nothing in the cupboard full proletarization and deep neopetization is all we can look forward to and that terminal crisis the the the lack of a realistically conceivable alternative to full of miseration. If nothing changes that that's the thing that changes the conditions and spins the cane mixes the paint can and as long as we're our eyes are open and our hearts are open. We can maybe participate in that but everything else is for entertainment purposes only. It is not real politics. It is it is a big argument of people trying to trying to to find someone to yell at about why and the left and right are divided demographically once again not everyone but for the most part white male grew up in the suburbs especially if the parents are like middle class but not college educated oh you are going to be blaming the blacks you are going to be blaming the blacks and if you go to college where you learn all about empiricism and about how god is dead and that we are what fill the void and that therefore we have to rebuild the world you know out of dead. Sticks well you'll learn about things like like the bell curve and you'll learn about iq and you'll learn about survival of the fittest and stuff like that and genetics and that gives you a reason to do that oh look at that. That's so nice thank you if you grew up in like an inner ring suburb if you went to if you were went to college and if you aspired to because of your middle class upbringing you aspired to a knowledge economy job.

You're probably on the left somewhere like this and then the split depends on like the specific conditions of that. So if you if you are one of those you know one of those children who got a job in like the pmc strata. Even though it's precarious and like you have a ton of student loan debt. It is like a status job relative to you know working at mcdonald's or driving an uber but you don't have a lot of money or I mean. But you do have like a decent amount of money and an expectation of more like you have that and so you can see yourself as precarious. You can definitely feel aggrieved that you didn't get the deal you signed up for but you are still feeling like you're on a you're on a track you're probably for warren. If you went through that the whole treadmill and ended up falling you're probably for bernie so once again. I'm explaining these things. I'm talking about myself and reasonable extrapolations. From that experience. Y'all can tell me if this sounds familiar all right cool. I'm glad that makes sense all right.

I'm feeling like I'm ready because like the college thing. I felt like that's a good that is the experience that like demi delimits this because we're talking about we're talking about people who basically all went to college. They almost all did but their response to what the hegemonic college like manners of aspiring managerial you know because there is no more there is no more dignity in labor. There's only dignity in clickity-clac work um. Everybody goes into college expecting that that's the experience that like generates everything and that's the experience that everybody who makes culture does and the people who are moving towards what they think that they should do which is multiculturalism which is progressivism which is materially grounded for ones who are successful because it means that they have to keep affirming these values in order to maintain their job positions because it is imposed.

It is an imposed thing and those areas so that's a reason that they have to hold. These views. You know the reason that they have to be woke because there's a like a prod on them to do it um and then there's the people who say this and become conservative. The thing that distributes them is not necessarily class. Because among these people we can be talking about beautiful boaters kids. We can be talking about professors kids doctors kids cops kids construction workers kids anybody's kids really as long as they went to college expecting their life to be as good as it was when they were in high school. That's the experience and what distinguishes it is basically geography rural and exurban and white conservative inner ring suburb and urban and white and other politically active minority liberal and the college is just the shoot that they all go through that's it and now and that's what I was not really able to articulate and why a lot of people got caught off and caught up on me talking about college that it's not really about college. It's about geography. It's about whether you grew up around a hegemonic culture that was generated by the global neo-liberalized spectacle or in a more. More socially embedded um regional culture and then they all go to college and then they get sorted into republicans and democrats out of that.

And I'm not saying that it's destiny for any individual person. I'm not and I'm not saying that this is this describes everybody. I am saying that if you get a bunch of people and they have these experiences it is these experiences of whiteness in a rural or ex-urban area. Versus you know whiteness in a diversifying inner ring. A wealthy suburb experiences produce different like general reactions and general like ideological formations and those are the things that are dictating like the political scheme but that it is sterile it is not. It is not because it's detached from class politics and class power. In this moment of total immigration.

It is sterile and can only spin its wings and cannot effectively oppose the full boot of neoliberal globalized finance capital because it's only it's being fought on behalf of these retrograde reactionary elements that by their very constru nature and structure cannot allow for working class solidarity because they make exclusions on cultural lines which the liberal ones do too. But they do it on behalf of global capital and the conservative does it on behalf of this. This these barons this archipelago of baronial feudal power but they're but none of them are doing it on behalf of themselves as a through class interested as a class project a class operating as itself and for itself operating for other classes for the pmc finance oligarchy and from the local boat ownership class and what will break that is the emergence from below the orthogonal release of a working glass energy. The drums that boys can aim that's what'll do it and the only and that this is not should not blackpill. Anyone would be like oh politics is useless it should free you. These things that feel intractable conflicts between sides that are dread.

Like this is the western front and you can just bypass it. You can just say oh that's not for me. You can be like that drill tweet where he gets the bill from the waitress and he goes no thank you. I don't believe in that you can liberate yourself from caring which is what is oppressive anxiety as I have said that is the electric prod on the nuts that keeps you in line anxiety because we're too well off to fear. We have anxiety and then and that and anything that loads you up with more of it paralyzes you further is not good for you so you can off kill the karen in your head. That's it all right.
