I'll let the waitress put the chairs up. Let the glasses that you broke form a picture of our leader with a Halo made of smoke let the golden oldies station. Crackle and come through with a final benediction will hum along to before we say good night okay well. Let me talk about the ball game and the weather show we care like a sound. We didn't notice until it stopped and left us there with the traffic and our heartbeats beating in straight time. Let our hatred and affection marching the same line before we say good night oh protect our secret handshake. Once more with feeling let the toe stabs and members push through the ceiling before we say good night before we say good night and let our King wrecking ball complain I hate Winnipeg oh Howdy Folks. I'm back. It's been a few weeks I've been here and there and everywhere was in Canada for a bit which was nice never been to the eastern half of Canada before so that was fun Toronto. Eh fine um the the definition of mediocrity and that's cool. It's better than being the definition of crap. But Montreal muy bien trap. Yen I hate to give it to the frogs but it's definitely It still feels like a city in a way that most American ones just have stopped feeling like because of you know just the endless.

March of capital and whatnot ah I did see Barbie and I don't want to be a bro about it but pretty bad not a good film. Thank you. It's no thank you if you're gonna if you're. Gonna sell out right like and just Embrace. The realities of having to do IP and SQL based films to have a career in Hollywood. Do it. The way Ben Wheatley did it when he just said sure I'll make the Meg too whatever instead of being like no. We're going to turn this into a statement about something about what I don't know but yeah. Maybe. It's just because I'm a guy and it wasn't for me you know it was for ladies and so I respect women when all women are beautiful whatever they thought of the movie sure that's my opinion I don't care. I haven't seen the Meg too though yet I didn't like the first one that much big problem with the Meg thing is the Mega so big. Its mouth is so big that it doesn't like chew people up in a cool way. He just swallows them which is less cinematic. You know less visceral if only there's a way for like the Meg to like eat a bunch of people at once.

Maybe you know get in there and just start chomping through you know a wave pool or something. I don't know I'll probably see it now and in a airplane or something mug shot iconic or not well. I mean it is definitely going to be one of the more famous images of the 21st century. First time a former president you know put in front of the the bill like that so in that sense. Of course. It's going to be iconic as opposed to the separate question of did. He slay. I don't know I mean as with almost everything with Trump. That answer is predetermined by your pre-existing relationship with Trump. I don't. I think that there's a dream though on the right and on the left or the Liberals I guess I mean there's Democrats and Republicans. At the end of the day. You just one team or the other regardless of however how you wanna Guild your political Lily and platter yourself with radical ideology. There's Democrats and Republicans because those are the two things you can actually those are the two projects you can actually participate in democratically everything else you want to participate in is if not illegal at least in some sort of friction with the state or with capital. The only frictionless political engagement point is voting and participating in Party politics and that means Democrats are Republicans so let's just get rid of left and right and say Democrats and Republicans for a lot of Republicans. They think this is going to make him look badass and a lot of people who maybe were on the fence are now going to like him. Democrats say no this is going to finally like reveal him he's in Stark terms as the criminal. He is everyone has made up their decision about trump.

It doesn't matter God. It's so annoying that they didn't weigh them. This is this is what a two-tier people Trump supporters are complaining about a true tiered justice system. It's a two-tiered justice system when you get to show up for court and just say yeah. I'm 215 crowns just trust me and they just go okay. But it could be real. I mean ozempic is out there now you could imagine Trump getting on it. He does look meltier lately which is a really bad move for him. Aesthetically. Because those epic people don't really look that good you know you just kind of look like a melted candle. But yeah they can 

There's gonna be 500 court cases and whatnot and there's going to be trials. Some of them are going to be televised and you know what it's still going to come down to basically a coin flip that will be determined more than anything by like The first quarter of 2024 is economic output although maybe not even that anymore maybe inflation in the first quarter 2024 because it's very clear that attitudes towards the government towards Biden are fully detached from conventional understandings of a good economy GDP all that stuff unemployment. These have been on paper the kind of things that should lead you to have a you know around 50 approval rating whereas Biden is stuck around 40. And it really was the Afghanistan. If you look at the numbers. It was Afghanistan where he dropped and the thing is we stopped thinking and talking about Afghanistan within a month which was obviously predictable but because the ambient temperature I guess is just as miserable as it was before that nobody felt the opinion if they had nobody felt the need when they're getting pulled who had decided. Biden after Afghanistan never got the urge to be like well look at this GDP growth look at this employment I'm going to change back to being pro-biden.

They never switched back because inflation is high. Purchasing power is down and that is for a country that is made up yes of workers and owners and capitalists and laborers objectively but subjectively by consumers where politics is organized around a consumer choice and where American flourishing is defined by consumer choices a world where you're more your mortgage is more expensive and your dollar buys. Less is a bad economy regardless of anything else and now the the Biden Administration is making. This insane attempt to like basically make Americans eat their spinach with this bionomics push. They're like no no you idiots. The economy is good. Don't you understand that and then trying to connect it to him which just completely ignores the way that political opinions are formed. You can't you cannot set the terms by which people are evaluating you as president you can only um you can't set the terms you can respond to changing situations and the way that the Biden Administration if they wanted to like not lose well. One thing is get rid of the nine million year old crook who is at the top of the ticket but then to talk about abortion and cultural issues which have seemed to have affected a persistent shift among college-educated voters away from the GOP and that means important swing. Suburbs are now much more likely to just be reflexively Democratic than they were before Dobbs but they don't want that world. They want one where they can point to what they've actually accomplished you know and and say this is why you need me. You don't want to. Although the only real case for the Democrats is a negative one which is also true for Republicans. They only have a negative case for their voters stop the worst people from getting in that is the only real case but they don't want to consciously pitch on that because it disempowers them and part of it. I think really does come down to the fact that I'm surrounded by a bunch of people who lived in a different time. They lived in a different with in a different Democratic party with a different media. A media that could like operate around central agreed upon premises that would permeate every level of American news consumer regardless of party.

[12:36](https://youtu.be/lfx2jd2Fa-8?t=12m36s)

That's gone we now have niche We have niches and that's it and the economy is is politically perceived through a consumption lens because yes people also are losing and getting jobs. All that that is supposed to you know power our understanding of the economy but those are not seen. I don't think as political outcomes. If you get a job or lose a job. It is up to the face it's up to Nature. It's up to God because that's what we've done to the market. We've turned it into God but only of course the part of the market where we are disempowered laborers so that our disempowered labor can be. Can be our disempowered labor can be perpetuated without accumulating any like real residual class-based alienation but how much things cost at the pump in the grocery store where you are making the active choice to consume those are places where politics still lives so you can see those as political choices made by somebody that why they had those stickers with Biden pointing at the gas readout. Saying I did that there was a time when things like employment were considered political but we have surpassed that time we don't live there anymore but these politicians especially.

Democratic ones who are in their 80s still do that's the world they grew up with. That's the Democratic party the bread and butter economy stupid James Carville Democratic party. These people grew up with but the very people who rang that Bell for so long dismantled the political control over markets and then had to adjust what the political was away from things like employment. So now wherever um we are we experience the economy as workers our alienation whether it's getting a job whether it's losing a job not being able to find a job having bad conditions at work. Those things are felt natural. They're naturalized there might be causes for them but they are particular causes within a a political reality. Everything that we do economically that comes from a position of empowered consumption reflects our perceptions of ourselves as empowered political subjects empowered political consumers.

I should say of media and then of who of choices in The Ballot Box and in the voting booth and so now you're you. This is a different world where there where there is no way that you can run on low unemployment if things cost more because low unemployment you're just taking credit for something that everyone understands is not in your purview. You've spent 40 years trying to convince people of that fact that politics is limited in its ability to interact with the economy if you try to have your cake and eat it too. But over time that capacity erodes as like the reality of American life where no voting changes any of the underlying social stuff underlying class relationships. Politics then has to become something else. It moves where to the to the its own level it Finds. Its level and its level is that consumption and spectacle. But even with that they probably thanks to honestly now thanks to the shift in the center of gravity of the of the suburbs as long as Even with like this situation we're in now with inflation that is lower than it was but still higher than it was relatively recently which is a relevant metric and just no accompanying like ryzen in income there's going to be like a general.

This about the Biden Administration and a a republican could win in that environment but not Trump and honestly. It's funny the Republican who could win in 2024 easily probably Mitt Romney because culture War issues that had helped the Republicans equalize among certain voting groups and neutralize their disadvantages is now flipped on them and it is now hurting them but all they have now are people who are either I mean. Honestly Trump is an interesting case because in some ways he's the worst possible person to run against Biden but in others he's the best because of the current Republicans who might like become president or presidential candidate. He is the one who has the most instinctive understanding that social issues are a double-edged sword. The problem is he can only make the election about himself he can only ever do that and that worked in 2016 with an un pre-dobbs sort of uninitiated into what Trump means electorate now eight years later. It's a different story but like any other Republican is going to have to run on social issues and that's gonna hurt them.

They're gonna gain in some places but places that are electorally less important like the border on Texas the Rio Grande Valley. The Rio Grande counties in southern Texas where you're seeing a big shift among Hispanics non-college educated Hispanics to Trump but that matters way less than what's happening in white suburbs and college towns in the Midwest. But it's a coin toss either way. It is a hundred percent coin toss nothing that happens between now and election day save some sort of catastrophic economic collapse and definitely not including Trump. Getting convicted of anything is going to change it from being basically a 50 50 Race. But it is the funniest thing right now is just watching the Democrats try to insist no no this is what a good economy looks like like it did. Traditionally it did in the in the post 70s zero effectively zero inflation economy where things like you know price at the pump and stuff.

We're weighed against things like employment to now like an end stage where in order to maintain our sanity and prevent us from like violently opposing the state and preserving our illusion of political subjectivity. We reorient our understanding of what is political to where we feel empowered and since we feel completely disempowered in at work lowest rates of unionization. Ever since we feel most disempowered at work. That's the place we're going to be least likely to process our life experience through a political lens and therefore give credit to Joe Biden if we get a job or whatever but with the price of the pump the price of the grocery store where you're exercising your true franchise that is the closest thing to the Mandate of Heaven. An American president can try to claim in Biden. Right now is losing the Mandate of Heaven but Trump has already lost it.

[22:06](https://youtu.be/lfx2jd2Fa-8?t=22m06s)

This is why we're in this fascinating 50 50 loser shootout foreign bombed according to post-debate polls. This is interesting to me because I saw ramaswamy out there you could absolutely tell what his strategy was and given his position. It's the smartest thing he could have done honestly. The only thing he could have done like maximal confrontation maximal setting aside setting a a distance from everyone else running the maximum attention. That's the move that's the only move for a person in that position. Who's not going to get like people compare them to Pete bootage. But Buddhist was lifted on the wings of the mainstream media. A mainstream media that is credulously believed and listened to by the Democrats in a way that Vivek cannot really count on because well because there is obviously a conservative infrastructure media infrastructure that has influence on its voters. It's more divided. It's it's loyalty is split and Trump dominates the majority of it In 2020 since Biden was considered a sadden acronym and Bernie was beyond the pale by Buddhists seemed like the Natural Choice the gay Obama to the majority of the media class and so they they didn't need the CIA to tell them to do it. They self unconsciously gravitated towards him like iron filings and that helped the fact that this no Charisma dollar to have really had nothing to say was able to stand out. Vivid can't do that he's got to pull the vet suicide vest and he did but as I'm watching it. I'm like I guess I could see this working.

But I could also see it wildly alienating the older suburbanites who vote for Trump all right who vote in Republican primaries yeah. They love that Trump is like a big rude. Vivek is never going to be able to hold that level of personal relationship that personification so he just looks kind of like a whiny little prick y'all with like raising his hand like a nerd but he is preserving his vice presidential. Bona fides because he's by being the most Trump ass kissing one. He's making Trump most likely to let bygones be bygones and nominate him. I still doubt that Trump nominate picks anybody who ran against him though there's plenty of other people that he can pick who did not run against him like Kerry Lake and I know she's on the outs because she took it too much for granted and Trump got worried that he was she was going to upstage her. But I still think he picked somebody who did not actually run against him because that's always a difficult. Circle. The square to be like I love Trump. He's the best president we've ever had but also he can't be president again yeah. See I can't this is good he was talking about how he liked Vivek but he said I can't believe this guy is running against me.

I don't think he's going to be able to let that go but in a long game a long-term goal effort to try to secure a position in the post-trump GOP. It's a smart move. I still think he's probably going to end up getting swamped by somebody some Black Swan that we can't even predict the way that Trump was very difficult to predict in 2015. Because the 2016 Democrats going into that election Republicans rather were completely rudderless and bush they just they lost any kind of credibility with anybody including right Wingers because of their pathetic failure to defeat Theo bungler and their weddedness. Their their religious weddings to conservative Orthodoxy which was no longer stirring the loins in a post-obungler era and you're like what's gonna happen with this party and then. Trump just cannonballs into the race and changes the complexion of the whole thing. And I think that that that hole gets filled one way or another and that means someone is going to fill that hole for the Republicans. I don't know who it is though and I don't think you can really predict. I don't think it's going to be physic.

Though I think he's going to be like a that's more like a Yvonne schlier style character just sort of oozing in the background and eventually probably getting his wings clipped someone asking about fetterman succeeding Bernie. I mean we have to assume that the left wing standard holder within the Democratic party post Bernie is going to be in every respect a step down because it's it is the recession of a movement. It's sort of like the the falling away of a of a formation something else will emerge later as I have said many times but it probably will not be at the national Democratic level but you're still going to have these emerging polls. Around you know the remnants of that and I think fetterman would have been the guy if he was not so physically shaky I mean. After getting that stroke he went from five points in a republican-leaning swing state. At that point. One Trump counties I mean just being a big beefy guy. It just makes so much of the cultural Garb of the Democrats as a bunch of weak. Not adhere it's just that simple simple symbolism but like if a Fed if if he were to get better ment gets better man and really recover from the stroke and like maintain some sort of fire in the belly and desire to like push forward politically I think he would have a better chance of getting the nomination than Bernie did but consequently his nomination would be less have less like radical implications than Bernie's would have. Someone says Doug. Burgum said he would not support he would not support a federal ban on abortion or policing teachers you know about about trans groomering or whatever the because of states rights which are both conservative and general election. Friendly. You'd think so and yes hypothetically conservative friendly. But no no longer Republican friendly no longer friendly in the eyes of these sort of Republicans who for whom conflict and and maximal hostility is the mark of political virtue now and there's no amount of like logical consistency that's going to change that you can't say oh but you support states rights.

They don't give a never really did yeah. I'm sorry you get what you get. Sometimes we talk about about the mysteries of existence. Sometimes we talk about the Senate. H I do think that the hostility to public up to public school teachers is another one of those things that does really well among the childless weirdos who go to school to school board meetings and yell at everybody but not so well against those suburbanites. Most of whom are relatively happy with their Public Schools who do the voting yeah. That's a very good point is like what what Republican pisses off Democrats the most and it will always have to be Trump. He's number one so that's the guy you have to support because if you don't support him you are essentially giving in to them which is of course the opposite of how Democrats have traditionally worked like look. 2000 look at 2004 when they were so terrified of pissing off Republicans that they fled and Mass from the anti-war standard Bearer who was leading in the polls to a Iraq war vet or a Vietnam War veteran who had voted for the war in Iraq because they were scared of Republicans. They would did not want to make them mad. They wanted to kind of sneak in the back door. That's because they had been generationally traumatized by 9 11 as everyone was in one way or another. Nikki Haley is hilarious. She's the funniest one because she so clearly just wants to will it back to being 2004. Like she she just wants that old cons like Pence does too but you know he's mostly just daughtering on. She seems to have this genuine jihadist mindset to try to get us back to National greatness foreign policy.

 supply side nostrums politic economically free trade It's like yeah sure if you have a time machine. I think yeah a lot of people probably don't like teachers though because you know it's the experience of teach of being taught sucks and it gets worse every year because the experience and the experience of being a teacher also gets worse okay teacher leave. Those kids alone not for Teacher very good all right. Let's do a pack of cards. Here maybe a existential Insight will occur while I'm doing this.

[34:47](https://youtu.be/lfx2jd2Fa-8?t=34m47s)

We'll see I do think Munich is a good movie. I think Spielberg was cooking with that one for sure all right. Here we go. We've got a military asset. The AMX 30 tank look at these bad. Boys look at these hunks of metal. H we love our we love our tanks don't we. We love our armor. The AMX 30 main battle tank made by the French oh and was used by both Coalition and Iraqi forces during Operation Desert Storm weird again how that happens how the Iraqis gonna hold all this Western technology. Odd it. It's weird how Hitler too got a hold of all this Western military technology I'm sure he stole it or something. He carries a crew of four and has an infrared light system for light operations designed for the in the late 1960s. It has a 105 millimeter gun and a turret mounted 7.62 millimeter machine gun. It's French so it's probably bad at fighting am I right manufacturer Atelier speed 40.4 miles per hour range. 373 miles armaments 105 millimeter main gun 20 millimeter Coastal Cannon cool Coastal Cannon. Nice I had a 7.62 millimeter machine gun with a screw of six hanging out in there eating.

Brie we've got a military skill collect and Report information. This is very important. Obviously this is very important collecting and Reporting information when soldiers are on patrol. They are to report anything of interest to their leader U.S Army. Rangers remember how and what to report by using the letters of the word salute S size the number of personnel of size of sub or size of subject or object two or a activity. What they were doing L location. Grid coordinates or reference point. U unit clothing patches symbols or ID numbers. T time when the activity occurred e-e equipment all equipment associated with the activity. Oh that's nice. They gave him a little mnemonic device that's adorable we got Personnel. We got the narx of the police or the we got the narcs of the army. The military police the Jack reachers if you will whether it is the Shore Patrol in the US Navy I am the Jack Nicholson. The airport police the U.S Air Force or the. Military police in the US Army Air police sounds way cooler than I bet. It actually is each of the jurisdictions to enforce the uniform code of regulations on all service member Personnel off Military Reservation. Civilian jurisdiction takes precedence but major crimes committed on. Military reservations are investigated by the military police. The judge Advocates office and the Federal Bureau of Investigations like Jag like NCIS. Here's a guy here's a leader yeah. They're going to be a space police for the space force.

We got Mikhail Gorbachev one of the biggest Chumps in the 20th century. Not a bad guy I really don't think I think a well-intentioned person but fundamentally a chump. He thought okay. We're gonna. We're gonna end communism and as a reward you the West are going to help us transition into a Social Democratic economy integrated like the rest of Europe into the American system and the United States said oh that's adorable. No you are outside of the Imperial sphere. You are being encountered by the mothership and you will be broken and turned into scrap like everybody else and he didn't see that one coming off who is known for his Innovative improvements and new ideas. That's for sure became the youngest member of the politburo in 1980 and General Secretary of the Communist Party head of the USSR in 1985. He instituted the policies of glasnos and perestroika openness and rebuilding and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. During Operation Desert Storm. He tried to negotiate Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. How'd that go Mikhail born prison obially near Strava pole USSR stavropol birthday March 2nd 1931 mosque education Moscow State University Moscow USSR yeah R.I.P to that guy he didn't get that the only reason that we had built that beautiful Social Democratic Citadel in Western Europe was to contain and undermine the Communist Russians as soon as communism is demobilized.

There is no incentive to do anything other than piece by piece break down every piece of public goods in existence starting where the resistance will be lightest and of course that's outside of the machine itself so countries being integrated into it. Like Russia get to be liquidated and then of course they leave in power. This structure hundreds millions of people thousands of nuclear missiles and a modern military and says to them. Yeah now enjoy vassal status. What are they going to do. They're going to see if the buttons work astounding lack of foresight by the us but again no blowback is actually blowback because the even if the results are unintended. They are always then turned into opportunities because of the commanding position because the ability to act that is monopolized by the United States at the global level that means every situation can be turned to your best interests which is one of the reasons that people who reason backwards about every social Revolt in the world as having to be an American op because as it unfolds the United States ends up benefiting from it is ridiculous. It is child. It's childlike thinking America dominates because any spontaneous and and meaning and um sincere social con um resistance is going to be unorganized and probably defeated but the on the pressure on the state that it creates will persist and can be exploited by the one power that can act the United States. Sometimes the United States orchestrates things when it has to but for the most part it doesn't have to and that's that's one of the things that like super black pill conspiracy people who think they're telling you like. Departures are actually being incredibly naive because they assume that the United States has to have that level of conspiratorial interference going on in order to benefit from everything not that its role is. Imperial hegemon makes that the default State everywhere and we can't blame gorby too much though because the USSR really was french fried and by that point and there was going to be some sort of Crisis.

Some sort of challenge you know. But the way he went about it not the right way. This is Iceland. Here I don't know again. I all the Scandinavian countries run together. I don't know if we have this one before I don't think so lying on the North Atlantic Iceland is located on Islands built of recent volcanic activity the Icelandic Parliament. The outing is the oldest surviving government of its type in the world dating from about 9 30. Since Iceland was neutral during World War II it was not allowed to join the United Nations until 1946.

For Operation Desert Storm Iceland supplied economic support geographic area 39 789 square miles population 250 000 language Icelandic predominant religious Evangelical Lutheranism. Everyone's favorite kind the capital Reykjavik government type constitutional republic head of government prime minister Stein Grimmer. Hermansen. I don't know what economic support Herring did they send him some fish. They send them some cod that they won in the Cod war with England. The icelanders are interesting. They did have a a very Advanced early form of democracy as you can imagine in a situation where there's just no pre-existing hierarchy because you know that's how we get like the transition from feudalism to democracy taking as long as it does is because you have this slave society that its political Authority collapses. But the disparities in control of resources persists and so those become classes that persist and then bear skins but they have I know in in in Iceland. You there's a big book that shows how everyone is related to one another. So you can make sure that you're not dating a first cousin or something you need to do like some sort of midsummar style genetic diversity program because otherwise it's going to be a problem all right. We've got another piece of equipment.

[45:35](https://youtu.be/lfx2jd2Fa-8?t=45m35s)

We've got the old ch46c night look at this bad boy. We got the C Knight I see a knight right here that's for sure whether transporting combat ready. Marines ashore during amphibious assault transporting cargo and Munitions are bringing 15 litters of wounded aboard a hospital ship. The sea Knight has served both the U.S Navy and the US Marines for almost three decades from Vietnam to the Persian Gulf. This versatile twin rotor helicopter has proven its durability. It played a vital role in Operation Desert Storm including sea rescue of downed Allied Pilots manufacturer. Boeing helicopter speed 167 miles per hour range 75 miles armamental 250 caliber machine guns or 6.7.62 millimeter machine guns crew of three 25 troops. I like the guys with the two rotors they're cool they're big. They're big fat boys. We love them all right. We've got the Newport glass tank. Landing ship otherwise known as an LST larger and faster than the classic LST workhorses of World War II. Amphibious Landings lsts are the Newport s are the of the Newport. Class are the first to depart from the drop bow door and use a 112 foot ramp to land tanks and cargo vehicles onto beaches a gate at the stern enables offloading amphibious vehicles into the water. The Newport lst-1179 and the Fairfax County lst-1193 both out of Norfolk Virginia were part of Operation Desert Storm displacement. 8450 tons fully outloaded length of 522 feet. Speed 22 knots Armament one 450 caliber machine guns and one Phalanx ciws crew 250 with 400 troops. It can carry we love to land an amphibious group. In the littoral region. We love a good littoral region.

There's so many good words related to Two Rivers and estuaries brackish. One of the best ones brackish that is water that is a mixture of salty and fresh brackish often found at the intersections of rivers and oceans. Brackish is a good one littoral riparian come on folks. You there are very few words better than riparian oh some other ones that are related to water benthic water-based words. Some of the best nautical terminology. Some of the best we've got certainly the more um poetic the way of water boat. Swain boats or coxswain coxin Boson poop deck stygian. There you go stygian's a great word and it is water related. Got a boson and a cousin we've got intelligence.

File. Conserving energy come on folks. Let's do it. Let's consider energy. Let's do it please light bulb on dependence on oil for the Persian Gulf can be reduced by conserving energy. You some simple energy saving steps include keeping tires inflated to recommended pressure shutting fireplace vents closing curtains during summer and opening them during winter and changing or cleaning furnace air conditioner litters regularly. This is the wef bug eating agenda right.

[49:44](https://youtu.be/lfx2jd2Fa-8?t=49m44s)

Here. This is agenda 21. This is the 15-minute City. This is global homo right here in card form how dare you tell me to keep my tires. Inflated I will set fire to your home. How do you like that how do you like that. For conserving energy. There was actually a miniature There was like a two-day news cycle during the 2008 campaign when the old bungler was talking about energy conservation and he said the thing about inflating your tires. He said the thing about hey you know if you're worried about gas prices you can save gas by keeping your tires inflated more efficient and McCain went absolutely sicko mode on him. He was like inflate your tire what and then he actually had a little moment where they were holding up Tire gauges at McCain rallies to just try to Mock and belittle Obama.

It didn't really work most people kind of ignored it. But it was definitely a thing that triggered conservatives telling them to keep their tires inflated because you know you're claiming that like what liberals don't get is that when they say something that is just reasonable common sense like they are appealing to an authority that they are constituent of like people who are alienated from the cultural Zeitgeist the way conservatives are they start they happen since the since the 60s. Since the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Things like Common Sense things things like General consensus scientific ideas become tools of an alien of an enemy a power really that that wields those things over you so when you tell them to do something they go insane. Like there. There's a there are stories in California. I don't know if they still do this. But for a while they would send you and they may be a stop. For this reason. They send you if you um consumed less than like the average consumer during a given period less energy. They would send you a card congratulating it that say you you were alone. You use less energy than the average.

Californian. In the third quarter thank you very much the record people who got that and then self-consciously used more energy which is a thing that liberal could never conceive of getting a pat on the back from an objective Observer about how good you are that's crack the head. Pat from teacher. Conservatives now think the teacher is full of took over the schools. After the 60s and 70s. They couldn't take over the institution so they took over the schools and said and that whole time they just thought they were continuing a liberal consensus tradition that had been established by World War II and they were but what they didn't realize is that the entire time that that liberal consensus was being was persisting throughout the world throughout the um the country and being metabolized by its citizens. There was always a thread of like vituperative alienation from it like starting even before the social revolution of the 60s and 70s. Like around like John Birch Society figures around small American manufacturers and like hard-pressed small business owners in the midwest or specifically Ohio of course the home of Robert Taft being like the Beating Heart of this reaction this Main Street Republican hostility to the New Deal State and cultural apparatus.

The thing was though for most of the the 20th century it was a fringe group. It wasn't even a majority of Republicans and they occasionally were able to do things like hustle their way to inflicting Barry Goldwater on the Republican party in 1964. But that was like a a anomaly and an expression of like a concentrated organizing capacity that events hadn't caught up to yet but then the 70s hits which is a crisis not just culturally but also economically that bursts out of it. A new disempowered working class that has had its back effectively broken its ability to negotiate politically for gains permanently removed and a new cultural reality based on the racial and gender ideas that the rebellious youth had proposed in the 60s and 70s when you have that now a movement that had been restricted to a specific class strata medium-sized owners from you know shopkeepers to factory owners now Encompass not only a bigger chunk of of the rich but a who are now invested in a political program that would enrich them but also among workers who were no longer able to assert political power as workers but could interact with politics Politics as just an American subject shorn of of class. Interests who was alienated for cultural Reasons from the consensus that emerged out of the 60s and 70s.

The the cultural Politics on top of the new neoliberal economic machinery and now we're in a situation where a solid 40 percent of Americans of all different races and specifically classes have a fundamental alienation from not just liberal values but all the institutions that they associate with liberal values which is now basically all of them and again. The John Birch Society was there in 1952 but that was a bunch of cranky like chocolate candy manufacturers. It was just it was a network of cranks stewing in their offices and thinking about how how their employees were all gold bricking on them and who were not getting the real benefits or at least could not imagine themselves receiving the real benefits That Wall Street got from opening up Europe after World War II. Now that's a generalized and hostility and that means that you can no longer assert any apolitical objective.

 judgment towards people they will take it politically so you cannot tell them to not to blow up their tires or to conserve energy or do anything else that just makes sense including of course take a vaccine don't want to talk about that. Vaccine for it. We did it really quickly so that we could get it out there as fast as possible would have been accepted by 90 of the population not saying it would have been right or wrong. I don't care shut up not doing my own research. I refuse I'm saying that that sequence of events would have been unquestioned by most people. All right. We got a leader here oh very crucial to the war effort. Very important.

We've got Brian Mulroney prime minister of Canada Brian moroney the PM of Canada the conservative party or I'm sorry. They were the progressive conservative party. My favorite and most Canadian political party name the progressive conservative party. It really makes them sound like a post-colonial government in like Africa or the Middle East where you have those kind of goofy named parties like the Like the the radical liberals or whatever or no like well. Here's a good example in Jamaica. I think it is the labor party is the right wing party after being a lawyer in Montreal. Mulroney became an executive at iron Oracle in Canada in 1976 president in 1977. A literal oil executive that's so funny that you guys just honestly had the the the Daniel plain view of Alberta just be the president like whatever he was elected to Parliament as the leader of the progressive conservative party in 1984-83. When the ruling party changed. He was promoted to prime minister in 1984.

Birth date March 20th 1939 educational science Francis Xavier University Antigone Canada Laval University Quebec Quebec Canada. So this is very interesting. He got a guy moroney moroney presumably an Anglo from Quebec. What's going on The United States is not the only Western Hemisphere country to get a lot of Irish Catholic immigrants. During the 19th and early 20th centuries Canada got him too but thanks to the religious divide. In Canada they largely settled in Quebec because it was Catholic and place like say. For example Toronto was literally run by the Orange Order until the 1960s and in fact Ireland and Montreal Ireland and Quebec were actually very similar political and economic units. They were both stagnant backward economies whose educational system welfare system and in the large sense economy was dominated by the Catholic Church which of course is allergic to the sort of dynamism that Bourgeois Protestant capitalism inculcates in an area and so you had a situation where Quebec was one poorest part of Canada much poorer than the white.

The white part sorry it's sounding like I'm of an orangeman there the the English speaking part. The orange part and you had the situation where they were a total Backwater in Ireland. They were like good that's fine Anglo monster and so they felt the need to compete and so they were. Jump started into a competitive economic relationship to the rest of Canada to Anglo Canada by what is known as the quiet Revolution by the way who is the Laval that everything in Quebec is named after the like the university I saw street named after it. It's not Pierre Laval. The prime minister of the Vichy Republic is it's it's got to be some Canadian but I don't know which one I don't know them. I'm not my Canadian history especially before the 20th century is not that great like Louis real and all that stuff I don't really know that much about it. So the quiet Revolution is this process by which the the hands of the Catholic Church are slowly released from like the main concurrence of French Canadian Society.

Like their control over education is removed their control over welfare systems and there is this injection of dynamism into the Quebec economy. They create a hydroelectric company Quebec Hydro that is like the basis for like a new sort of provincial economy and of course. By doing this they jump start a bourgeoification of their society and what happens you get Bourgeois nationalism. So almost the same moment you're getting the quiet Revolution you're getting the front deliberation. The Quebec emerge to do like a IRA style ETA style terrorist attack on the French the Canadian state and then a the broader move towards a a separatist politics around the figure of Renee Levesque who's sort of a French Rush Limbaugh Style guy who becomes the premier in the 70s. But this process this bourgeoisification.

It happens everywhere but only when it is forced into being. I think that's the only way to understand capitalist development. It will not emerge independently because social wherever social forces can assert themselves they will and in a place like Quebec in a place like Ireland where you are sort of a you are able to stagnate in a way that advanced capitalist societies and also post-colonial dominated societies can't and that's that's the result of being strong enough as an independent polity to resist full colonization the Irish by literally having a War in the early 20th century and the French just by being so goddamn French all the time oh and either way. Though these are these are Catholic polities in a way that is now literally anachronistic. Like nobody else was Spain.

It's being of this process was in the same situation in the late 19th century but its position as one of the like main competitor States in Europe as opposed to a peripheral region like Ireland or Quebec was forced into a like a pelmel Sprint towards modernity that broke the country in half Ireland and Montreal were gifted the ability to sort of do it at their own pace and of course. Quebec does it first because they have more of a direct cultural and economic conflict. With this greater Canadian polity they're part of which the Irish didn't have to worry about but they still by the end of the 20th century were pushed in that direction inevitably just by among other things. The fear of brain drain people are just gonna all leave again because what is considered the good life is no longer defined by the church in a globalized world. It's defined by consumption and the ability to do that and a a traditional catholic Society cannot provide as much of an opportunity for that to happen and so it has to be broken up and it will be broken up from within to persistence so that it is national identity which supersedes everything post. 19th century honestly since was failure can dominate like just the fact that the French curse words are all religious blasphemies from the 1700s tells you what's going on like France was the same time that that some French people essentially pressed eject on the collapsing French State and were able to create a little pocket France in the wilderness where the fact that it's Wilderness and the fact that it's expropriated from others means that those social ferments are alade for a bit and so people can just keep being French in France itself that cannot be by the late 19th. By the late 1700s you have social social ferment explode into up outright Revolution spurred by economic collapse why because France could no longer spend at the same level that England could because it lost its colonies in the Seven Years War. Someone says I have bad Ireland takes please tell me what I got wrong all right last card geography Baghdad oh boy Baghdad.

A relatively young City. You think oh it's the Middle East. It must be super ancient. No. It's a it's one of the first real like um. Early modern project cities was the Abyssinian Empire the opposite of dynasty. A Boston Dynasty building that Baghdad as a ready-made capital built by Khalif al-mansour in 1762 in the design of three concentric circular walls for another surrounding the palace armed guards and the city. Baghdad became one of the major Trade Centers of the Muslim world of being captured by British forces from Turkey in 1917. Baghdad became the capital of the New Kingdom of Iraq in 1921. During Operation Desert Storm Baghdad was attacked by air almost every day you're goddamn right your goddamn right it was. Mongols did okay. The Mongols went Ham on Baghdad to a degree that is genuinely World historical. It all started because the caliph made the terrible decision to execute some of the Mongol diplomats who came to talk to them and demand their fealty always the wrong thing to do.

It never works out for you so they decided to go in there and just kill everybody they killed. They stacked the bodies 200 000 people perhaps and man. Then they destroyed the library of this Center of Muslim learning they say that the Tigris River was not red with blood. It was black from the ink of all the volumes that were thrown into it. Not good folks. So we didn't do that right. We're all right just because we let all of their great Treasures get looted and destroy their infrastructure armed and trained a bunch of psychotic death squads. Population 4.65 million founded in 8th Century 80. Location central Iraq on the Tigris River 330 miles from the Persian Gulf significance Capital.

It's the capital folks. It's the capital tell you right. Now. I am always swearing fealty to the Mongols when they show up always 100 of the time. There's a 50 50 chance that they're just on a scouting Mission and they'll just leave anyway unless you're in China and you're in China. They're here to stay you just need to accept that but like if you're you know like how many the Russians or the polls or anybody else you go out there and you pick these fights and it's like you could have just stayed home and just giving them some fealty and you probably never would have seen them again. There wasn't enough goddamn grass to feed other horses in Europe and yeah. Like they they were checked in the Middle East. They were famously defeated by the mamaluk army in the the I don't think it was in Egypt. I think it was in what is now Israel.

They they beat him so who's to say that they ever would have even stuck around the. Stand up for yourself and then get annihilated pledge allegiance to the great Khan okay. If I if I'm your unic advisor I'm going to wear a t-shirt with that on it every day just in case that you heard tale that the Khan's forces are near. We love the con don't. We folks the great Khan they call him great for a reason really tremendous. I mean he might kill you anyway but you're definitely going down if he decides to make you a project. Let's not forget Kublai Kublai Khan Kublai why did Norm speaking of Canada why did Norman Bethune do all the crazy. Five-star pimp the answer to that question and the thing is you can't judge yourself to those standards because there are very few of them. They're there their apples in the rough and he was one of them apples in the rough. That's not an expression. How are you gonna for example just example how are you going to say no to a group called The Golden horde come on. It's literally golden all right good to be back should be back next week talk to you. Then folks take it sleazy.
