You got the best of my love out in the cooler. I swear to god. I used to know the lyrics to more songs. I think they got pushed out of my head or that part of my brain died. I think that's more likely. I think that's statistically more likely to be the case but you know what I'm just gonna go with this like finite amount of brain room and some of it got popped out in favor of others and you know what I'll take what I've got.

It's working for me so far. We'll see one thing is when I was a kid. I used to like try to set about memorizing song lyrics like I didn't even do it passively. I would write them out and stuff now. I don't listen to enough music to have it happen to have the reinforcement even though the old stuff that I used to remember. I don't know. I stopped. I don't listen to as much music as I used to. I probably should fix that I i need to like get away from my whole deal which is like. I couldn't really enjoy a song unless I could sing along to it like I have to be singing. I have to be producing you know some sort of part of it and a verbal part like. I've realized over the years that I'm my brain is incredibly unbalanced in you know like intuitive stuff like things that make sense things that things that are like relatively easy to grasp. They are all connected very specifically to to the english language which is incredibly narrow plank to build your life around But I've managed the rest of my brain is just very bad. I mean it's not just that it's bad. It's that I'm also a lazy fat. American swine who was never forced to you know get better get more in touch with certain things. I was able to kind of float and so here I am with just an ossified brain. It's just getting smaller by the day it's doing the anti-rich piana oh well. But this is just a way to say that like pure music by itself. I don't know because I i stopped listening to music and I started listening to podcasts but now. I don't even really listen to that many podcasts like two or three at the most and really only when I'm exercising maybe. I should listen to some more classical like the opposite of what. I'm used to just pure moods as they say okay. So today we're going to talk about the par third part.

I believe of making a global capitalism which is all about the crisis of the 70s and how it starts to break up. This. Internationalized new deal structure that had built the post-war economy because that is really how they describe it and I think it is an effective way to imagine. It is is that the that the post-war western sort of labor peace that defined the politics of that generation was a internationalization of the new deal because the united states thanks to its specific balance of class forces and resources was able to synthesize the contradictions of capitalism. Much more effectively than the european powers were or japan. For that matter. They were too they were playing catch-up in a lot of ways with the united states in the fascists in the case of the fascists. Literally I mean world war. Ii was the tale of capitalist development in western europe and japan which you know by the late 1800s has caught up to europe I in like the capitalist race. The tail the last ones to get it the last ones to create a geographically like extended sphere of influence not just a capitalist economy. Crucially a sphere of influence. They were the last ones which means they were sucking hind tit and they were banging up against established spheres of influence so boom they went to. They went they had to their internal contradictions pushed them outward to war and that made them not a viable host for capitalism not stable enough. It's the way that viruses don't really want to be deadly that's not genetically advantageous to a virus to kill a lot of the people. It infects because that limits the amount of transmission that the host can do by its death and the death of the viruses is within it like so if you have like a virus just rampaging through a body like ebola that's capitalism ripping through the societies of germany and japan the losers of world war one the economic. Not even the like actual battle losers the economic losers of world war one because that's the thing with italy italy was technically on the on the on the winning side of world war one. But they didn't get that much out of it and that defined their you know crisis-ridden economy after the war. So by the time you get the big crisis of capitalism the internal structures of these fascist nationalist states that could not resolve socially the contradictions at its heart right because the premise here is to maintain the nation.

As like this. Axis of identity as opposed to class interest which means you keep embedded in this structure. This class antagonism defining your society which like is what drives it to its extremes of violence but that violence. Although yes there is a domestic regime of terror. It has to be exceeded by a campaign of external violence because someone is everyone is hurting in these structures. Everyone is being massively alienated in these structures and yes spain's another good example. They didn't even fight in the war but they were still way behind the pack economically by the by the time the real crisis of capitalism in the 30s hits so yeah so capitalism running through these rampaging through these systems right where these nationalist structures are being forced to dump off the alienation through economic regimes that are capitalism wedded to a state project of expansion like they keep capitalism but with this overarching nationalist agenda that is income in direct conflict with the interests of capitalism which is international trade which is the extension across the entire globe of a single common market space which is the opposite of the sort of defined geographic zones of influence and power and domination that these these late comers to the imperial race are producing so they've got ebola the western democracies that can't really defend themselves they've got they've got like maybe smallpox or how what's something typhoid cholera and then we have got the common cold. The united states got the common gold. Now capitalism is traveling through our system at light speed because it has synthesized those contradictions because that violence is being carried out by someone who can't speak up for themselves somebody who isn't part of the integrated global system. Someone who cannot add their like resistance to the cost-benefit ledgers of capitalism. The explorative native americans and and and enslaved africans that's the secret sauce so you've created now a mer american polity where everybody has this sense of themselves as citizens of a country that has its their best interests at heart where the thing that what's best for the government is best for the economy is best for me.

These are all the same things that's a thing you can believe in only in this context though of american development where the people feeling the really sharp edge of the shtick of alienation are not part of the assimilated into the european society german society since napoleon or at least since 1848 you know there's still discrimination but it is not systematic. Then they have to go in and throughout this body politic pick. A scapegoat and jews were an acceptable scapegoat. They were unsympathetic to many germans because their survival strategy in this maelstrom had been to grab on to those things that will help you advance through the the the struggle of in the marketplace. In america. We never had to have that ritualized finding of a scapegoat because there was this seamless in this pure conception of american americanism that like wasn't universally held like there's racism discrimination at all levels but that reproduced a generalized sense of american identity that transcended their self conception as members of a class. This didn't happen in germany at least not initially because capitalism was explorating and alienating the people who were part of the general german or french or english people. They could only be so so dehumanized and I gotta say we always wonder well why why england of all the countries of europe why did why did.

It start there a big part. I believe is that they by having a colonial relationship with ireland that prefigure the american colonial relationship. Was able to like vent social gases basically and build machinery of domination and of you know marketization in these explorated spaces. So the new deal is what this looks like in terms of a a treaty basically between america's working class as part of a greater category of non-capital owning americans which goes from like artisans. Proletarians even like I would say yeoman farmers who are self-sufficient compared to those people who like have massive concentrations of capital like that that group of people who understood themselves to be part of one policy making a deal with capital and with government that's like these the state and capital. The two faces of one greater thing that hegemony allows us only to interact with across this like through this janus screen right like we are only allowed as americans to see capital as either the market or the state. At one time we could only ever address one or the other at one time which masks the fact that they're the same thing at a deeper more fundamental level that determines their relationship to each other and their relationship to you. So crisis of capitalism that causes genocide and world war in europe and asia kills a third of the world's population or whatever not that much it kills a bunch of people and in america. You get this thing that can fight that war win that war and then come out basically unscathed. So this project we're talking about making global capitalism at first is taking that administrative new deal state and applying its structures to the economies of these. Recently traumatized countries and the peripheral and of course as they come into the market the post-colonial periphery as they're being like offloaded by their colonial overseers who can no longer afford them.

The direct empire is no longer affordable. It has to be made efficient and it is made efficient by the introduction of american market structures to replace formal regimes of power and that means allowing europe to be basically a little sandbox. A little fantasy fake political economy where people got to pretend that they were fighting over. You know control of means of production that we're actually controlled in washington and they can carry out those politics because this machine we're building is dumping capital into these countries europe specifically more than anybody dumping capital into it through these new structures that are extensions of the new deal state and that allows them to rebuild this social democratic consensus that is more more advanced and more civilized than ours but only because the exploitation at its heart has been abstracted away to the imperial core that's actually carrying out the final decision making that set the term for all the other politics that happens in europe and anywhere else and so by the mid 60s you're seeing the first shutters of this machine because it's packed with contradictions and those contradictions are going to work themselves out over time which means different conditions are going to a condition of entropy is going to enter into to this new system that has been established. Entropy starts as soon as you establish bretton woods and it drives through the system all through this boom period that builds this robust global capitalist nexus with these social democratic or social democratic trending democracies at their center against like a a totalitarian soviet opposition even though that soviet system is still subordinate to the global capitalist order and it's just a part of it and this is not set its own independent economic. First mover. The first mover is the united states at this point. So by the mid 60s these contradictions start kicking in so.

That's why this chapter is called contradictions of success so the u.s helps build up. This robust manufacturing economy in europe starts trading with it. What that means is. Eventually the european manufacturing industry stood up on its own is able to adapt all of america's efficiencies. Is able to get all the technological things that help like improve increase productivity and increase efficiency to maximize profit. They could. They get all that stuff america has a head start but once but since the u.s is not advancing faster than the europe is catching up pretty. Soon that's putting huge pressure on the dollar dollars getting sucked out of the country you go from a situation where in the in the mid 50s there's barely any dollars in the european economy that's and that that most of that ends up being marshall fun marshall plan money. By the mid 60s it's reversed and there's this huge dollar glut in europe and a lot of it is fueled by the fact that that private sector investment that direct finance foreign investment that the us cap private capital was not sending to europe right. After the war they were sending it to latin america by the early 60s it completely shifts. Part of that is because in 1958 there's a recession in the united states and that capital starts going looking for better returns elsewhere and they find them in this robust growing european manufacturing trade network. But all of this was putting huge pressure on the system of fixed exchange rates that define the bretton woods structure saying like we're not gonna like the way it is now you can go every day. There's a new exchange rate between different currencies like the lira just keeps going up you know and the us during the the boom period is able to impose this. It's not the dollar. It's basically a global gold standard because even though you know the us doesn't have the same relationship with gold in it that it had like before fdr. There's still a gold peg to the dollar which means they are available to impose a global global gold standard which is what limits inflation which is that you know that kind that that inflation is the is the like the result of the friction of class conflict within a society like given off within their economy. Like that is that is the that is the economic manifestation of class conflict within a society the more smooth the gears of social organ. There are like you know we're fighting a war or we're having a really cool booming post-war era where everything's fat happy and you know the biggest conflict socially is about. What do we do with these people who were not part of the human or the you know american social structure. These people whose domination allowed capitalism to flourish what are we going to do now that they have the ability to assert themselves because now they do have you know been turned into citizens and all but name and that they have been turned into capitalist subjects and that means that they are able to assert their own interests and that creates this conflict but within the like the greater cocoon of you know american identity. The 50s are this era of humming social concord profits go up for businesses that means our profits go for corporations that means benefits go up for workers but in the 60s oh my god. This conflict is now heating up because the complacent whites are giving birth to a bunch of kids who aren't complacent they don't take. They take for granted the conditions that that generation the greatest generation took as a miracle that that that that levitt town house with the quarter acre that the veterans of world war ii got up the white veterans of world war. Ii got after getting out of the military was literally a social valhalla a realized imminentized valhalla for the people who had suffered through the great depression in world war ii nobody who fought in world war. Ii had not experienced the great depression which meant that many of them had been had grown up in conditions of just apocalyptic poverty and and and similarly apocalyptic social crisis and then they fought a war. They went somewhere. They shot someone they saw people shot you get up. You come home and it's like no more violence. No more destabilization now you can consume your way to heaven now of course. None of them would be able to they'd all be miserable eventually but at the time it is a incredibly persuasive offer and it's a social lubricant europe needed way more because their society had been more deeply traumatized by the war than ours. But by the mid 60s this social concord is breaking down because the racial basis that it required is breaking down and this is happening socially the same time that those european and pretty soon now.

Japanese economies are manufacturing at a level equal to the united states pulling down the rate of profit that everything had depended on. So that's where inflation push starts kicking into the system. This is the smoke turning into flames like a five. A five like inflation is always just like. It's it's this kindle right because it's it's the inevitable and constant class conflict that defines society. But it's Its expression can be like a low manageable level or it can be spikes of like significant social violence and and and this is very important at this point. Not now anymore. But I mean increasingly labor activity strikes militant militant unionism because while this is happening profits are going down oh. What's this they can't take it out of labor because everybody's got a union and nobody's going to sign off on having their pay checks cut because they're still working for a living and they want to be compensated for it. And that is why the tru this the vision that I think people like keynes and. Fdr had is that the eventually it would be unarguable to anyone who is rational that the only way to bring about a stable social order. The thing that we all purport to want and the kind of social advancement that we all purport to want is to what do it. Cain said and euthanize the rentier class right. Eventually reform take over capitalism from within have so have government organs controlled by like a democratic system slowly but surely eat the heart out of capitalism without having to go through with a cataclysmic class war and of course like it was very persuasive when you're you know sitting in an office when you aren't a worker when every day is not alienated from you. It's very easy to say. This is the best possible option because it discounts the real daily alienation of being a worker and what that and how it compounds through your social life.

It's imagined from a position of bourgeois complacency but again you can't blame people everyone who's going to rise to a position within these systems is going to have that belief if they didn't they wouldn't be there and that belief is self-motivated. But all of ours are so you have this full employment economy that empowers workers. Full employment creates inflation and then the empowered workers deny the ability of capital to take that inflation out of the hide of labor which it has to do or. Otherwise it takes it out of capital because there's only two places for it to go. Inflation enters the system to keep profit in under capitalism to keep profits up is a like a defense mechanism of the profit sector because what I think guys like fdr and keynes would have hoped is is that by the 70s by the 60s and 70s. By this point the leaders of the advanced countries would have been so rational so committed to reality that they would have recognized that the only way to deal with this crisis. This fundamental contradiction at the heart of global capitalism is to effect a slow and steady climb down of capital personified by something like the minor plan in sweden and of course sweden. Like one of the most advanced of the social democracies generates the closest thing to an actual policy that could have been an alternative to what we got in the 70s and that is this plan to by have by law a certain percentage of shares of all public stock to be held by the government or no not the government. The labor union. I'm sorry the union would be guaranteed as part of their compensation and you know their treaty with with capital a a certain percentage of stock that would increase over years. So eventually they would have a majority stake and therefore administrative control of the means of production.

This is this is the fantasy they had and the closest we got was an articulation of it in the minor plan. Also the british labour party which was still very radical in the early 70s had as they saw this coming developed a alternative which we'll talk about about the next chapter in the next chapter but in the real heart of hearts in america where it mattered. There was nobody to be found who had that kind of vision. The closest thing you'd have is like a nixon but the problem with nixon is at the end of the day he was more than anything middle class if you wanted to find nixon's essential character. It is not even as an american. It is as a middle class a middle class driver that is what defined him and so his ambitions were the ambitions of the middle class so he could never have effectively allied or affected a working-class-led march towards socialism. He would have smashed this thing up before that when we saw even in the conditions that he did have where he was really battling only against capital and not against labor really. They'd been neutralized. He still got owned because like what what nixon really wanted to do was like step down but on american terms which is only ever going to lead even if he wouldn't have thought so only ever going to lead to fascism again because you can't have a national capitalism. Not at this stage of development you cannot have a national capitalism under conditions of this much accumulated technological power. This much force multiplying of like human kinetic energy in a nuclear age you cannot have national capitalism certainly not at the scale of consumption that the united states requires even if it was like in barracks conditions. I mean you look at nixon's upbringing the son of a bitter a guy a failed farmer somebody who had tried to grasp the yomian dream had it taken from him and then forced to do the shadow version.

The pathetic play version of yeoman self-sufficiency a business owner like now our our business owners. They can only they associate you know their yeoman autonomy only like through the lens of history. It's all it's all just on their terms but a guy like nixon's dad I forgot his first name. Somebody tell me his first name but a guy like nixon's dad had had it and seen it go seen it fall through his fingers. Then he had a he owned a grocery store but it's like okay great you know he doesn't have a boss but now he's selling other people's food. He cannot. He's not making his own. He's not sustaining himself france francis. He is dependent on the market he's dependent on suppliers. He's he has a relationship with employees.

He's on this knife edge at all times and then nixon grew up with that and then he shows up as one of the bright boys at the exact moment. All the other best and brightest emerge right the people the generation who would cause the vietnam war and then build the neoliberal engine of death that we all live with these guys. They all had that moment right going to college get turning into men just as world war ii happens and he can't go to an ivy league school. He has to go to his local college whittier and it's very funny because he is in many ways like a mirror image of johnson and they are very in a lot of they are the mo. They're the two most interesting in my mind psychologically presidents. We've had they're two of the most erratic psychos we've ever had be president. The fact that we survived them both being in charge of the nuclear. Button is honestly a miracle and they both came from backgrounds where their land-owning father had lost it all and and then had the struggle for something else. The difference is is that francis nixon's milieu was business and johnson's was government because his dad had been a prominent member of the state senate state legislature and so there was a certain government becomes like this. This trusted institution from a young age and a viable ladder of of advancement. Nixon comes to politics like because he's a megalomaniac but from the outside having been alienated from it his whole life but anyway what this the gist of all.

This is that the people in the rooms making these decisions now capitalism has so fully determined every one of the the subsequent like rungs of control that they might be in charge of that there is no longer any jenga tiles. They can pull without causing a huge rupture in the global capitalist political economy because if you did excorporate capital to deal with this crisis they would fight back everywhere and the thing is is that even the labour party politicians who are in charge in the social democratic parties of europe and even the euro communists. They fundamentally have a aligned class interest with capitalism to avoid a final rupture and that is the problem that's why really you have to have a political organization you have to build structures of power. It's in. It's you cannot not do it. It's the only way to have people organize sufficiently to address crisis and provoke moments of rupture. But at those grasps those grass roots had been killed. They had been killed by the the the roundup of post-war post-war imperial capital surplus and the mass x corporation and admiseration of the global south you can't unring that bell in 1974. Right you can't say hey we're from the middle of the of capitalism and we it's all not working. So we're gonna. We're gonna get rid of it. Hey no hard feelings you guys right. No there's now this in this this fundamental alienation between periphery and center at every level. This guilt and resentment and and shame that can't be addressed and that and that social peace in the middle of the in the core is built on I'm looking at the chat when I look yes so I've this has been a long I'm still barely getting into introducing into this stupid chapter.

[37:30](https://youtu.be/oG5MGtHhN2Y?t=37m30s)

But okay you have this inflation. Crisis begin in the mid 50s. At the exact peak of profits. You have this inflation start to kick in and then profits start to collapse and that drives this. This new crisis at the that eventually manifests in the The monetary system. There aren't enough us dollars anymore to go around if they keep printing more of them. Inflation will increase so they have to once again. They don't have to do this they could excorporate banks. They could nationalize. They just cannot realistically do it so that means there has to be a reef restructuring of this thing but how is it going to go where is it going to come from and and and panditch say once again. It begins in the halls of american state power where you first see this addressing the the beginning of like an articulation of a new way forward that then gets pushed through the whole global system to break up that global new deal order and turn it into something liberalized One of the first big things that does that is that one of the contributors to volatility in the global market is that ethnic is that economic nationalism in the former colonial world is at its all-time high and that means excorporation of a foreign investment is at an all-time high and the world bank emerges as an institution devoted to arbitrating at a allegedly like impersonal. Like disinterest it basically it introduces itself as a global court for disputes between states and private or foreign investors and of course. This is a sham you know. This is like international law in any other instance. This is a thing weighted towards the interests of the foreign investors. It's designed to help them. It's designed only to pacify the the given state if it's not powerful enough to assert its will and this is the model that is going to be used to break up and destroy these little nodes of economic nationalism. In the 80s and 90s. It's like when they use the the it's when they use the sound waves to break up.

Kidney stones they're going to use these informal institutions of adjudication like the world bank to impose new liberalized financial and capital markets on these countries in the face of popular demands for nationalization. This is all about preventing actual democracy from ever act or from ever threatening the system. That's what this entire process is and part of this is keeping the damn brits happy so the u.s allows through a loophole. This back door in the bank of london which you know we have a special relationship with england given what happened to their economy. After the war they honestly should have been completely destroyed. But we kept them up because of the special relationship because of the necessity of the old structures of global finance that the bank that the british had built and part of that is the pound bloody pound sterling which we kept along limping along as a strong currency. It didn't get devalued like the lira or something even though it probably should have um and and another thing we gave them to help prop them up is this. This clearinghouse for us dollars that that circumvents the fixed exchange system called the euro dollar market and what this does is. It allows american banks to avoid the regulations limiting interest rates that were imposed after the great crash 29 by put going out and get and exchanging on this dollar in this dollar market and at the same time this view it makes u.s. Bonds very attractive so a ton of capital. Us capital floods into europe. Commercial banks are offering securities like cds. So you're no longer just having your money invested in some sort of thing you're purchasing financial instruments which is that's that's a new that's that's blurring.

The lines that class stegall were supposed to build between finance institutions and you know commercial banks for regular people to put their money in and that money is getting added at this point by pensions because one of the things that these militant workers are able to ring out of capital is these huge pension contributions that then have to get put somewhere and they get invested into these markets too so workers are getting becoming part of the capital market and benefiting from it. This is the kind of stuff. These are the jenga pieces that can't be pulled away once the crisis gets deeper because you have these institutions that are that are disconnected fundamentally from from militancy like because that militancy has been diffused and redirected and and abstracted and alienated by all of the realities of society in a context of class conflict being sublimated into consumption that increases the importance of culture. It makes culture bigger and more powerful and a bigger factor in sustaining capitalism than it had been before because one of the key things keeping people from acting like workers is that they have so much of their time invested in these pursuits of identity formation that are outside of their their conditions as workers but are in fact instead defined as their positions as consumers. A consumer-based economy means people are going to consume more. They're going to spend more of their time consuming and is going to do more to fill to shape their conscious sense of self than the hours they spend working are and when that so that means that when the crisis happens people are they're trusting of their labor union. They're trusting of their vote maybe they're losing that trust but not enough to do anything effectively because those social bonds that would have allowed them to do something else they're gone. There is this big strike wave during this period. There's a big mass in the early 70s rather. As this is getting worse. There's a huge strike wave in the united states that rivals in numbers. The strike wave of the late 40s after world war ii but this is like a rear guard action.

This is like the the dying flash of like the remaining class solidarity that existed among workers who as I said didn't take for granted consumption in exchange for exploitation because they didn't live through world war one or world war two in the great depression. They took for granted that level of that social conflict compact they wanted to push beyond it. Everyone wants to push beyond every human wants to push beyond. It's. It's absurd not to want to what the capitalism had given them is 20 years where they got to push around and now a time when crisis had emerged and we could no longer sustain the fantasy of reform. The revolutionary impulse has been totally abs diffused culturally culturally defused not diffused defused. Part of this by the way is a generation of regulators and bankers who fill these institutions who are not wedded to the keynesian deal and and the the administrative state they don't feel like. They don't imagine it as they don't have the relationship of like this is the life raft that saved humanity like we were going to be swallowed. By darkness. The globe was going to be a charnel house and this thing this this structure this american capitalist. Keynesian state saved us so they had a had a real like existential loyalty to it that younger people at every level like the young rebels who actually did want to fight the state but had no class vocabulary to organize their discontent and therefore saw it defused so this strike wave is part of that but it's wild and it's largely wildcat strikes in opposition to complacent management that was willing to sign the death treaty or the death certificate of the working class in america because it meant they get to stay in a union office instead of on the line. It comes down to that I believe they take for granted at every level. The labor union organizers the politicians at every level at this point that their personal interest and the best interests of all are identical and you can't disappear some of that because it is it is a motivated reasoning that goes beyond rationality which is why we never got. The fdr keynesian fantasy of the this being the moment when okay capital give it up because if capital gives it up. Then the imperial core has to give it up again not all at once and not catastrophically because the whole idea is you you you adjust as things change you know you build as the the ground shifts you don't force anything but in a way that takes tells people who have lost their class solidarity lost their understanding of themselves as any kind of international project to give up control of their lives. The prospect of like continued material advancement but doesn't give up but doesn't immediately alleviate alienation and exploitation. Either. That's a tall order and the thing is that it was so thoroughly tall that by the time the moment came there was almost nobody there to really articulate it. The alternative never materialized all we got was this internal reform towards terminal capitalism. Like this is late capitalism in the sense that it is locking in a political economy that is in self-conscious conflict. Like the people building it know with the resources that sustain it like the previous generation could believe that eternal growth was possible. Now you can say that silly it doesn't make sense mathematically but look what they had seen.

In their lifetime it's that trajectory it's the experience of a trajectory that gives it that feeling. Then it's stalled out though and these guys knew they all knew what was coming and that is why what we're going to be talking about about these chapters is this system is basically readjusted so that all of the capital can just let her rip and that is every one of these guys will know you know going to destabilize all of the structures that had sustained it until this point. But the reason they do it. More than anything is because they don't believe that there is an alternative because in their mind there isn't that area has been foreclosed. The alternative is a apocalypse because they cannot conceive of a utopia that's what's that's the part of their brain that's been soldered off by their exposure. Their day-to-day exposure as a like prime mover in a capitalist. Organ that there is that this is the only world that it can be that we are not enforcing a a democratic coordination of resources we are enforcing a transcendent law. I think that's what it boils down to these people had emerged by this point convinced at an atomic level to the point that the only thing that was ever going to beat them was a revolutionary confrontation with people who did not have that programming which we didn't get and you might say well that's good because that would have been a nuclear war and it's like yeah. You could argue that as soon as the atomic bomb is developed that the class war is over and it's just like you could say. Skynet went self-aware at the trinity test because there can be no real confrontation between capital and labor of the of the size sufficient to reorientate this machine away from inevitable extinction that will not trigger an instantaneous extinction. The activation of the death drive that lies dormant in the heart of capitalism under any conditions and then goes into overdrive in terminal conditions like the fascist states of of mid of the 30s in europe in japan so first 

Lbj tries to deal with this inflationary crisis by imposing limits on capital outflows in 1968 and then even and nixon gets elected. He doesn't change that he keeps that in force showing his that he said as he said we're all keynesians now and then in 1971 they closed the gold window. They say the us dollar is no longer convertible to gold and that means no more fixed exchange rates. Now and ever since the exchange rate floats you go to the board and there's a different. You're gonna get a different number depending on how their markets are doing depending on how much capital is flowing into versus out of their economies and this is wildly destabilizing obviously. But it allows the united states to keep foreign capital coming in which it needs to for to activate one end of the global supply circuit while also exporting capital which it still has to do so. The only way to do that is to unpack the gold standard and basically print more money gonna have to do it but that means that to stop that inflation we were talking about without gold. There. The u.s dollar is going to have to be kept below a certain level of inflation. More most importantly inflation on the dollar has to stay lower than other countries that we're trading with. They're allowed to flow to higher inflation. The us can't because we are the we're the the stone weighing the whole thing down like and that that's imposed by that's an artificial imposition. Like that's.

What I'm saying these people think that that is god they're serving. They think that that that like that that vestigial relationship between value and like and and a natural object is their residual belief in the transcendental nature of capitalism transcendental nature of capitalism because you want to know why the cold war didn't end in a nuclear war. Because the soviets would never have done it we would have done it. The soviets would never have started a nuclear war when you read about how. Khrushchev was reacted to the news that the the comment that the the ussr had launched had tested their first nuke successfully. He was he was he got drunk for like a week. I believe is what happened like he was horrified by the the prospect of that sort of global apocalypse just wiping out the entire project of human you know civilization and that's why when the soviet system came into terminal crisis did they launch the nukes no. But if this system goes into a similar crisis will will there be a launching of nukes absolutely and so the question becomes and it's going to only be answered by the end of the 70s by the volcker interest rate.

Hike at the fed. The us is going to break labor to make this happen and that's the project that's the federal government's project of this. During this crisis period starting specifically in the 70s. Is to break labor domestically and abroad through all of its levers of power over you know military espionage and deep state intelligence structures politics and monetary and fiscal policy. So that's that's what's happening here is that this the 70s is a long buck breaking and these chapters talk about the the buck breaking of the the international left and then the next one will be about the the final buck breaking of the american left and I mean broadly electoral left which you know your combination of of students and radicals and but also the the the closest thing to a social democratic party that exists and the organs of the trade unions of of the working class so um okay so that's chapter five. So. This is what's happening how are you going to buck break the left the working class and chapter. Six structural power through crisis shows how this is starting to come into focus so we've got this situation here where the contradictions of managing an a inherently in and immovably in egalitarian social order are just multiplying the third world they're excorporating profit.

This is the important part. This is the thing profit on manufacturing in the united states declines 40 from 1965 to 70. This is after it had just been going up up up and then had had just a supernova in the mid 60s to just collapse pretty much overnight. And this is this starts all the bells and whistles. This starts the whole machine to start to shutter in every institution in every level of the political economy. Now companies respond by investing like that's what you're supposed to do oh. We're not making this much money well we need to be more productive so how do you be more productive. Will you invest in ways to increase efficiency and they did the thing but the product. The the investment did not produce a rise in productivity that could reverse this trend and one of the things that stood in the way.

This is one of these contradictions these fundamental contradictions. It's in the best interest of the workers for the profits to rise right because then they get more of the profits but in the face in a situation of declining profits. A company is going to try to increase productivity by increasing efficiency but increasing efficiency increases alienation and exploitation of workers which have been said at a certain tolerable level under certain conditions of consumption. Now those conditions of consumption thanks to inflation are being destabilized and now the companies are asking them to self-explain and they because they have militancy because they have strong unions resist part of this wave of wildcats you got and also the other thing you can do. If you want to reclaim profits. If you can't get more efficiency is you reclaim it from labor but that also is prevented by the unions. So the the companies are basically stuck now in this situation and it's often blamed on the workers right. Like that's the right wing argument. About this is it was the greedy workers who led to this.

It's like no. The workers were just doing what they were. Was in their best interest their self-interest in any way that you can express it. They were looking after their position within the company. In the their relationship. To capital. It was a labor union movement was doing what it was supposed to it. Just wasn't. It wasn't doing it with sufficient militancy to you know maybe win a confrontation. Instead.

It negotiated its way to annihilation so you start to see bank failures. Now and and big companies start going under there's this pen central corporation. One sixth biggest company in america it. Collapses the us nixon tries to back it out back to bail it out and congress says no dice because that would be interfering in the economy and this is when the fed in the face of this inflation instead of cutting rates are instead of increasing rates cuts them and a lot of people blame fdr or blame nixon for doing this to try to get reelected cynically in 1972 but it was really about pumping liquidity into the economy to prevent that collapse from triggering a general crisis. So this is when the fed starts its policy of injecting liquidity to prevent a domino of bankruptcies and this becomes their remit. This is what they do for the rest of until now like that's been their only button to press That is why we were having such an interesting crisis now because you know by that token. They should be. You know tamping on interest tamping on the interest rate thing. But if they do it too hard they really do risk triggering something that they have no other response to a terminal crisis and they don't want that either so that's why it just seems like nobody has any idea what the to do and this there was a similar feeling during this period because nobody could conceive of doing what ended up happening to the working class of this country.

[62:53](https://youtu.be/oG5MGtHhN2Y?t=62m53s)

But what they didn't realize is how it would happen how the pain would be disproportionately felt by people who lived in urban areas. People who did not access the homeowning bonanza of the post-war world who did not get a chuck of equity and therefore an interest in capitalism and in markets who got no equity in the american project. Basically they were not stockholders now of course. Disproportionately. Racial minorities which means their pain is filtered only you know kind of peripherally into the political structure. A political body is happy to kind of sacrifice. These people which they did to the war on drugs and that meant that and then you've got within you know the the the white racial category you still have You might have people who are you know all homeowners. But some of them are going to be members of professions that are going to keep expanding in. Income and stuff and others are going to totally stultify and then over time they're going to be owned by it. But they're going to be owned by themselves. They're going to be owned in isolation.

They're not going to feel it as as the state as the capitalist order dominating them. It's going to feel like a collection of small personal failures because that's how the only way that they have been told to understand their lives. They are not a part of anything. They are an individual and they are rising and falling as their own responsibility and so this stuff that like taken as one hammer blow is inconceivable becomes over time possible as these reforms just sink into the system and allow each crisis to more disproportionately. Send its greatest misery to its most disempowered portions and of course like yeah. Inflation is bad but it's made much worse by the fact that it's the only way to talk about the economy like in a grand structural sense and it's in inherently invested with a reactionary framework because remember this is this the the inflation of money right this is the real fire of class conflict. This is the the friction turning into flame and we can only see from the shadow in plato's cave. The words inflation as there as though there is a economy that is separate from our will which is the grand mystification of capitalism and the reason it can never be reformed from within. But the real way that they try to get nixon re-elected is to dump a ton of money into the mortgage system.

So they there's this crisis of of of wages. They can't really give any more money to workers directly. But they can get more of them into houses ones who are missed by the first the last waves of of home ownership. But of course they can't just be directly given the way that gi bill had given like college educations and and government mortgages. They had to put it out into this new burgeoning finance. Capital market fannie mae starts selling mortgage-backed securities. This is where mortgage-backed securities begin and it is a way to dump liquidity at the bottom of the u.s consumer pyramid near the bottom anyway nearer to the bottom than before to get some more consumption into the goddamn thing and this begins the the paradigm we're stuck with now which is liquidity being pumped in. Only now it only gets pumped in at the top. We've even lost post 2008 the ability to pump it in at the bottom at all. The closest thing we had were the with the very measly stimulus checks of the late trump and biden early biting years which did you know help salvage things but you know also contributed in some way to this new new normal of inflation which I really think is best understood as just this expression of a a class system that is screaming under pressure. But of course we can't talk about it in those terms we have to talk about it in terms of this.

This this god that has to be appeased with sacrifice which is this is that is the religion that we're being fed. This is a mesoamerican noble class structure basically being imposed on us people are going to have to be sacrificed literally to the god of inflation because it is immoral to explorate from capital because unlike every other part of life every other human relationship the relationship between a owner of capital and his capital a totally fictitious arrangement transcends all human values now part of the reason that we're stuck with. This is because one there was one last trick that the keynesians could pull. Here there was one glass keynesian button to press and in 1971 nixon pressed it which were wage and price controls. This is it just the government's saying you're not getting any more money but things aren't going to cost anymore because one of the big things driving increased. Pay packets for workers is that they had to keep ahead of inflation but of course that helped drive inflation.

I know that the mm tears are screaming. No no no that didn't do anything. I get it you're talking about what is in some metaphysical world. Yes we hypothetically could do anything with anything. But as I was saying by this point we have reified institutions that hold real power and they cannot just be assumed away magically. So your analysis is essentially beside the point.

It's very same thing is true of georgism with the single tax yeah you're right but who cares the rightness of it will not make it win. That was the dream of keynes and all these liberals and it's the last dream of the socialist liberal which is a pure strained breed of like american goody goody god bless them. They're they're in. In many cases they're allies of the working class hell I'd probably count as one in some respect but at the end of the day they want to come. They want to avoid the class conflict because it seems to them more traumatic than the status quo which is of course. That's that's the lie right is that the pain and misery and horror of this system is somehow acceptable that this is okay because it is regrettable sad shouldn't we should do something about it but as a baseline it's something that we can live with and we do we literally do and one of the reasons we do is because everybody else does and we can't really do anything about that. But what we can do is not pretend like our. Politics should reflect that like even just the way we frame things. I don't know again like I get wanting to like try to clear people's minds of the mystifications. But if you accept that this sus this system can be democratically administered which is what mmt's presupposes then you are assuming a fundamentally contradictory.

[72:14](https://youtu.be/oG5MGtHhN2Y?t=72m14s)

Being you are you're summoning a um an oxymoron into being and at first business actually welcomes raising price controls labor does too although they start pointing out hey you know those those wages they're. They're getting clamped down a lot. A lot harder by the regulators than those prices are and of course that was true but eventually it just became too unwieldy as as the need to speed. Things up increased. They had to jack more into this. They had to keep the circulation speeding up to compensate for the general. The stall they had to start commercializing non-commercial parts of the economy. They had to start basically de-democratizing economy in order to get it to run faster and more efficiently while also eating away at the necessary organs that keep capitalism going. So we got a floating exchange right here embraced by washington but they had to pitch it to the rest of the world. People were terrified of getting off goal because these are all capitalists. They all want to maintain capitalism and they're all terrified of losing that organizing principle of the global company that that regulator and part of the part of the job of pushing it is telling them like. This is going to come with greater freedom of your financial markets and that becomes the the carrot that gets them to go along with it. Meanwhile this is like restructuring all of the global markets and it's also doing so well reinforcing u.s. Power because now it's it's just straight our currency that is going to be determining like these global trends and technol.

The tech sector is. A big part of that like the us has a huge leaps forward in computer technology in the 70s and the reason. It's the united states is because the us built a military industrial state. After the war they didn't spend their money on social housing and making sure people had 30-day work weeks. They spent it on a military-industrial machine that spent a incredible amount of money on pure research that had huge that we could not have been produced in the private sector because of the need to make money in the immediate future and that meant that you had these huge government-funded innovations that occurred in the 70s. Once again. This is all stuff that could have been taken by a socialist governing structure and put to the job of networking the global economy and getting rid of the need for the private sector. Getting rid of the need for the the capitalist class to organize the social order getting get away for the need for class exploitation and this is the kind of thing that chile was was experimenting with with cyber sin. Of course. We made sure that pinochet's guys goons went in there and machine gun the whole thing in the us.

We made these huge advancements but they were put to private use. They were put to the use of bolstering the the the private economy. There's an interesting part in this chapter where bill casey who conspiracy heads might recognize as reagan's cia chief. The guy who did all who created like a completely unaccountable shadow government that did iran contra and the october surprise basically reacted to the church committee and watergate by just building a secondary layer of distance from accountability from like the real arm of state policy. In this period he is an under secretary of state and he writes about how to people who are skittish about this new reality that is going to mean you know this new reality. That's oh we're opening up the global economy. We're putting the u.s. We're going to float the dollar at the same time that our manufacturing profits are just skidding down a hill. Casey writes it's going to be okay. This is going to strengthen america because america it doesn't have to export goods anymore. It can export securities. We can take this huge finance. This huge capital market in the u.s and throughout every level of it securitize it by getting rid of those new deal era regulations that prevent that kind of speculative work and this is this is literally speeding up the economy to make up for its longitudinal decline. We're going okay. We can't circulate at the level of products. We can circulate at the level of these fictitious derivatives that are referring to value in the future and this means that the sec gets buck broken and turned its ability to actually oversee. You know any real with any with any real You know power. That's gone and banks start sending out cds. So they're turning into us. They're securitizing. We got these mortgage-backed securities. I just talked about. We have this new thing we can sell a new way to circulate the currency and of course.

It's not based on real value. It's based on speculative value. We're we are multiplying. We're creating multipliers for a real economy that is no longer profitable in the long term. Now that should tell you you have to readjust things maybe get rid of profit maybe socially determine so that you're going to have conflict you're going to have violence you're going to have probably state by state warfare but you're going to have a general trend towards an equilibrium being reached where you get rid of the downward spiral of capitalist cyclical crisis. But as I said there's nobody there to argue for that. So instead what we get is this newly securitized economy that can that makes value out of thin air and in the mid 70s you see bank collapses. There's a san diego bank that collapses there's a big german bank that collapses and this is when the government starts stepping in without really anybody knowing it certainly not with any deliberation in in public and starts stepping in to backstop these collapses and this is the real pact of neoliberalism. The only only half of this gets told we get told that oh yeah the 70s was this neoliberalization period period when all these regulatory structures were relieved and the government's hand in the market was reduced and that's half the story. But the other side is that at the very same time because of the way that the the central banks respond to these bank collapses you're seeing a pattern established where this new order that's going to be less publicly regulated is going to be subject to more frequent and more responsive state intervention in the form of bailouts in the form of liquidity. So the only way to sustain this newly volatile speculative economy is to guarantee that none of the crisis that prov provoked by it terminally cascade through the system. It's a fail save but it is government intervention so the government is still there which is why most of the discussions of neoliberalism that sort of make it about making. The state invisible are telling only the public facing story. The story that these guys tell themselves in reality. It is just refiguring the state to be less democratically accountable. It is getting rid of any actual public influence on what this state which is capital and this and the the government is going to do and the real showcase for this new regime that is going to redefine the 

The political economy of every country along these new lines is in britain which is the first european country to get the the ned baity network treatment which is totally makes sense because no country in europe had a more delusional relationship with its own economy than the uk did and that's for very good reasons like. I said they were our our older uncle. They're they are. They that's that's our uncle that's our and the uncle magic between the us and britain is un challenged in the world. Even though he fought early on you know we took over their global economic order. You know we have an intermesh ruling class so that means that we're not going to let them turn into like greece after world war. Two. We're not gonna let them languish and of course because they're a super industrialized state. Their working class won't let them languish. The working class would have organized politically to prevent that because they were this is the first working class in the world.

Yes they've been pacified by you know britain's imperial plunder and it's the legends it tells itself. But they still had much a lot of capacity in the 50s or and so the sterling got buoyed by the us. They got to have their overvalued currency and pretend to be one of the big boy economies. Now they had to go and even then they had to do austerity in the 50s but then they got to go along. They got to get the tail rot tail end of of the 60s boom but by the early 70s it's already falling apart because as soon as the u.s can no longer hold that center with the gold standard. The whole and you get that floating exchange rate sterling is doomed because the the economy cannot the economy is not productive enough to pay in the capitalist sense to pay for the level of social expenditure that they had settled on after the war can't do it. So now you have a a labor government which had a meidner plan ask radical plan. It's that its delegates supported tony ben initiated to take control of the banking sector to to do it to do the thing that the that the labor parties of europe had always implicitly promised to do at the day of at the on the day of judgment. Okay we're here this is it. It's us or them. We're going to take control of this thing and that's how they got elected but then cal again. He gets his net baby speech and the u.s leans on him hard and the mechanism they used to do. It is an ifm law an imf loan. Now this is going to be how they break the rest of the world and it starts in britain the imf. This ins this instrument of us capital offers a loan to deal with the massive currency crisis occurring in britain because of their balance of trade. Because of their deficit they will offer them a sweetheart loan that gets them off the hook economically in exchange for austerity in exchange for changing the social contract between the british public and their government and that labor government. They fought it a little bit their delegates pitched to fit but at the end of the day they took the deal because to them the alternative and this is it. They honestly believe the alternative was an economic collapse that would have destroyed britain because they could not imagine that kind of crisis resulting in the working class taking power they couldn't imagine it. It was outside of their minds that lobe that utopian lobe had been spot welded shut by the experience of being a labor politician and buying by being a top labor union guys and this is exactly what ends up happening in greece when shariza gets elected to say to tell the germans to. Show of affirmation. In in the referendum and then the germans don't blink and then they have to they have to shut up pitch. They have to they have to shut up shop. They have to just pitch the tents they have to piss on the fire and call in the dogs in the face of what the people were telling them to do. Because they did not have it. They didn't have a plan. Verifakas claims he had a plan but none of them had the will to carry it out because they were too scared of rupture. They were too frightened of apocalypse but the fact is is that if if you are a utopian which all socialists should be because it is the social consummation of the christian.

[86:28](https://youtu.be/oG5MGtHhN2Y?t=86m28s)

 teleos then you should say that we something can come out of this that com because I'm not saying oh this would have been like a nuclear war some demo or like oh yeah. This would have been epic red terror in the streets and they all would have been like living in a miserable maoist or no they would have like basically been. It would have been turning britain into the khmer rouge cambodia but that's okay because it's based and they killed all those pedophile ruling class scumbags. It's based not saying that the conflict would not necessarily have been totally destructive but it sure as downing street in his little car or any of the people in in throughout the bureaucratic and political structures of the british state. No matter what party they were alleged to serve they wouldn't be able to stay there. Yeah like. I always think that with vera fakas like he had an idea but that's all it was and it's like you needed to have way more planning and a way more of a network and way more institutional.

 buy-in to make that happen and you really do have to say that like if that was the case then there should have been some attempt by somebody to tie the referendum to a specific course of action. Not just know and then see what happens because what shariza was doing was again how this is a mirror of the first time. This happens in in the 70s with the british. Callahan got this imf deal and it's a horrible deal. They were they turned white. At the prospect of this. They were horrified because they had this like remit to you know keep doing parliamentary socialism. Their people they won a majority with a promise to do the do so they went to their So they went to the party and they said okay. What do you guys think and they said no we have this alternative. This bennite socialist program where we're going to literally just take over these banking institutions and then callahan just went back to the u.s with that and said look. This is what these guys want. This is crazy look at these guys and this is they were hoping they could get a better deal. They were hoping. They could get better terms but what they didn't realize is that this was the condition. Like this was this relationship had to be established. This new reality had to be established there's no cutting the corners. On this.

This is an existential question same thing for the germans. The germans getting paid back was existentially necessary so it's like they were willing and the reason they were willing to hold the line there in both cases is because they knew that they could not have the the bluff could not be called because what's jim callahan gonna do call a general strike would the thoroughly bourgeoisified working class of britain have done a general strike on james callahan's command maybe but if he had and it worked they probably they would have killed him pretty much immediately and maybe that leads to a shooting war maybe that leads to a cuba style situation where the like in the like the last flight out of out of the buckingham palace. But he doesn't survive that probably not anybody that high profile so in both cases and what and what was sure is it going to do. They didn't even they call bring back the draka and then what and so in both cases. They just called called the bluff and so this labor government started the pro program. That thatcher finished and thatcher was able to say truthfully when she took office that she was not doing anything radical. She was completing the labor project or maybe you get here's the other thing and here's the thing that callahan was probably thinking of if anybody's ever read a very british coup or seen the show the movie he was probably thinking of chile or indonesia. Before that he's thinking like a caravan of death of the queen's own westminster guards. Capitalism by the 70s had had the upper hand and everybody at every level had to come to that question of do.

I existentially confront the state and my own position relative to it or do. I go along and plenty of people said no. I won't go along but they tended to be at the bottom of the power distribution and at the top of the alienation and misery distribution which meant that their resistance could and was neutralized. I mean like whatever verifakas was planning. There's no way that the us is going to go along with it. That's for sure we had germany's back that whole time. So. I asked did the business plot win and you know just you think about like the most radical class warriors in america in the 30s you got you know your communist party. Usa guys people who went to spain and and then you've got your business plotters and they're like the people who just could not accept this condition the reality of class war in america. As it played out in the public sphere. In the 30s they couldn't accept it. The business planners couldn't couldn't. They could not they could not. It didn't matter oh. It's first capitalism's best interest shut up.

I can't my skin burns. It's i. It was a religious violation. They felt it that way I was talking about like. These are the most true believers. People really believe as opposed to having their belief levened by self-interest. Like everybody is a combination of self-interest like material self-interest and then their self-conception but for guys like this at either end their self-conception so depended on their like belief that they were willing to see the whole thing collapse they were willing to see like in the street. Class war happen even if it sacrificed their lives but they weren't that many of them most people throughout the political spectrum were one way or another convinced to wait wait and see so there's going to be something that's going to happen and I know you're saying well that's what you're telling us to do. It's like yeah. But this is a different time. We're at the spent end of this and they both waited and then first. We have the big conflict spoil up of world war ii and this one this. This obvious everything okay everybody's interest is in suppressing this like explosion in the global capitalist machinery. Like these guys are these are some bad gaskets that got to be removed one way or the other because you know if they win. It's. It's it's all over civilization. The idea of the dream of it is over including the wealth of american capital um and then the big. The conflict comes in in the late 40s.

That's that's that's what everyone was waiting for and the through not fault through contingencies of history. The way events played out the spontaneous stuff the stuff that might be fully determined but which we can't know as it's happening and therefore can't assign blame for leave it so that when that moment comes the power the organization the capacity is disproportionately aligned with capital which means that by the time we get to this point in the in in capitalism's development. This the 60s 70s crisis point this terminal trajectory It's it's a totally one-sided affair all right so next week. I'll probably do a chill out stream on wednesday but no no book. I'm gonna be out of town on starting thursday but next friday friday. After that we'll do the next part which I believe is part four right. Let me check part four which is called yes the realization of global capitalism. So this is when we get to the real thing when when the american working classes relationship to the state is fundamentally ruptured and changed throughout the reforms of the 70s and then how that then ripples out. I think we'll probably be talking some volcker. Chris already made appearances like a grubby little. He wasn't literally his huge entity moving through all this stuff. He's a real zelig like figure for this whole period and then that's all gonna culminate with his given the economy. The shocker in the late 70s so we'll be talking about that two weeks bye was this gizmo.
