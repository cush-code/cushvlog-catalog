Hmm are we on are we going this is happening. It's happening yay. We're here. We're on we're broadcasting live how you guys doing beautiful day a little bit of nice low humidity for the day. we'll see how long that lasts probably not too long but I'll take it while I can get. It just went for a walk at the park. It was very nice for an old stroll appreciate. The work of good old calvert vox and his buddy frederick law olmsted did a good job. Is this barry look right yes. I generally prefer black cherry. I think that's the goat seltzer flavor that's number one but a lot of the time. It's not in my bodenga or my kitchen. I'm my my grocery store. So I get what's available yes. I would say top. Three are black cherry watermelon and berry polar is very good. That's usually what I get. But they didn't have any parcharian. I really like that one not a fan of the of grapefruit.

So. I wanted to start today talking about something that popped up in the old discourse. Once again. I apologize for referencing the internet. It's it's it's tough but at the same time trying to talk about things and given my limited little space. There's very little. I could report on in my life. That's very relevant so I kind of have to stay at that level for now. I don't think forever but right now. I'm feeling still kind of you know. We're still you know loose quarantine but in one that sees me not really interacting that much with the world certainly in a political sense. But damn it. There's always something to talk about on that internet and I like to think that for the most part I just use it as a entryway to talk about something that's more abstract and applicable beyond that narrow aperture. So there was an article in jackman about how the us has incredibly draconian open container laws and it's stupid and people should be able to drink in public like adults like we do in most other countries and to me that seems like very very obvious very self-evident thing I mean and if you wanted to be super woke about it. If you wanted to be 16 19 project about it. You could talk about how wow why is america have such more stringent open container laws than say europe it's because they're another way to police minority communities and there's something to that and yet there was a backlash to that article about people getting mad and saying look at these. bourgeois gentrifiers just complaining because they want to be pretend like they're in berlin and be able to drink outside ooh. That have the cops tase them so that I don't have to see their frat antics now part of that. Now. That's a baffling.

That's a baffling response and once again I hate to talk about the internet. But I think that the the nature of that response which seems on its face to be so shocking reveals a lot of things not just about the dynamic online but about the dynamic of the american left in general and first of all you've got the fact that for some people it is they hate jacobin because they have an esoteric problem with it as a project and they're going to hate everything and they just pull something out of a hat. So that's one group you don't really have to consider them too. Much another group are people on the left for whom being on the left means. It's if I'm on the left and I'm have a stride enough voice and certainly if I press the identity politics buttons in the right direction people have to talk to me people have to acknowledge. Me. People have to be my friend and that's a big thing on. The left is a lot of a lot of the discourse especially about interpersonal stuff within organizations. Dsa for example boils down to it's problematic or it's reactionary to not be my friend and for those people. Especially the ones who have been so successful at having friends seeing people talk about things like public drinking gets them furious because it reminds them all the fun they don't have and there and they want to remind people. No this is the left this is where you listen to me because it's the only social situation where anyone would listen to me by their own volition because they've convinced themselves that I have something to say but in reality. I am just a wildly unpleasant person to be around and has decided that that's actually the world's fault and exert that by getting angry at anyone who would raise an issue that would only apply to people who are you know aren't neurodegenerative you know problematic you know having enough spoons having the spoons to drink like some people have the spoons to drink and you're ignoring all of us spoonless people which that's just personal invective. This is just personality disorder described this dis masters politics and then there's this last group which I think is kind of the most interesting and that is people who they read that and they don't think about the obvious person that this is This is referring to in terms of you know talking about real um talking about real social oppression to talk about this as something that makes society less free less just something that makes it harder to be a minority harder to be poor in this country. But that's not who they think of when they read that they immediately think of the people who write it wrote it and the people who are reading it and the people who wrote it and the people who are reading. It are all members of that same downwardly mobile urban pmc. That is that is generally in my opinion. The constitutive body of the self-conscious left in america not necessarily everyone who has leftist beliefs but I'm talking about the self-identified identified left and so they read that and think oh you you and the thing is is that seems insane hey who are you talking. We're talking about the real people who are suffer from this are mostly working-class urban minorities but since that's not who that's not who wrote it and that's not who's reading it including the people who are bad the people who hated the article.

None of them are they're all the same group. They're all the same group and they're end up fighting a battle. I mean it's not. It's trivial but like it creates battle lines that are generated by just this stew of personal personality-based resentments. And that's why politics is a dead letter because you have a perfectly good policy that could be something that could unite people in across urban neighborhoods from the gentrified areas to the to the yet not yet to be against police authority in their lives. But people got to get self-conscious about the cultural implications of it because only one group is being talked about and that creates anxiety. Everyone knows that there's no like diversity in this movement that it doesn't include basically any poor people of any kind. Very few poor minorities almost no poor white people and once again when I talk about the self-consciously identified left which as I'm saying is also mostly a online phenomenon and so this thing just spins off on its own with no connection that would ground it and make this question irrelevant to anybody who even thought about it for a second because all that personal would just dissolve in the reality. But there is no reality because this is not a genuine working class emanation and I understand actually why people want to fight on the cultural ground not just because it's something they can do but you know. Gramsci had a real real meaningful contribution to marxism when he noted the the function of hegemony in the culture because there's a certain sterility to the base superstructure dynamic because if it's just that right if it's just you've got an economic base that determines the the presiding cultural values and and ideas of a society that then filters through all institutions. How can anything ever change like even if things get worse that worstness is going to be diffused and transformed by culture into its opposite and then society will maintain its structures and the answer is well. Gramsci identified as counter hegemony whereby working class people create their own dense social network that is essentially resistant to the overall hegemony and over time can can defeat it in in the battle for the majority of people's mind space. The war positions he called it and that's real that's a real thing and that's a real phenomenon and certainly in like the post-capitalist west that's the reality of the terrain of social struggle considering how few people self-identify as leftists But the problem there is that in that analysis you to look at the culture as is and specifically the culture of something like. I don't know the online left and you see that as a p as an emanation of counter hegemony But it's not it's not part of a counter hegemony. It is part of the ruling hegemony because it is not a working-class movement. It's not a working-class cultural movement the way that the social democrats in germany built species especially the way that the communist party of italy did after world war ii like that was genuine. Those were genuine counter-hegemonic movements because what the what marx theorized to happen what you saw happen in the in the satanic mill. Towns of of post industrial revolution europe is that the density and the in the social and the similarity of social conditions and the geographic the geographic closeness of working-class communities meant that there was like as as society emanated trickled as as hegemonic concepts trickled down through social institutions to the working class counter-hegemonic notions were rising up from the connection between people on the work in the workplace which over which be because they were closer to the ground have more power and over time can create institutions and enduring cultural structures that are counter-hegemonic and that is not what we have right. Now what we have right now is a left that is specific segment of the broader. You couldn't even call it working class. It's not. It's it's partial because the thing is the job is is less significant than the cultural framework because it's self-limiting what it means is that this is not an phenomenon that expresses a counter-hegemonic working-class american culture. It represents a very specific subcultural emanation within a broader social media cultural hegemony not conor hegemony working-class culture on the other hand is basic. A broad one is essentially a dead letter because of the because of the way that geography and and the workplace and and labor in america has broken up relations turned us from potatoes in the sack to pringles in a tube and the challenge is to actually build genuine working-class cultural institutions and that's very difficult because everyone who is self-consciously in the matrix of opinions and actions that form you know the left are almost inherently broken away from it and I mean. This is another one where I don't really know the answer.

But I just know that that the holes we've been. We've been trying to draw water from are. Dry. I've actually been watching not old snl episodes. But I've got youtube on my tv and sometimes I'll just for a little bit put on random old sketches not that old recent ones because you know. I only see them once the older sketches. I sort of have emblazoned in my head from watching him on comedy central as a kid a bunch of times. But the more recent ones I watch because they just go in one eye or not the other and I've just kind of reappraised them and go wow yeah. I know it's bad. It's bad. It's as bad as it's ever been it's the same thing as ever and yet somehow worse than it's ever been isn't that what felix says about america and isn't it. The most true thing that's ever been said about everything you could say. This is basically what it's always been quality wise and yet somehow worse and that is snl do. I identify as based carbon based nice. I should get that for a t-shirt I I'm gonna get. I gotta get a she shirt that says yes I based carbon-based and just do the biggest soy face in human history. Put it all over the internet ah. I think. I've given my opinions on anarchism in here before that it's essentially like hyperliberalism. It's liberalism taken to its most socially radical or like. It's most. It's it's liberalism taken to its most radical conclusions but that the end of those conclusions and there that's still just that's still just the end of liberalism. Whereas what you need is something other than liberalism yeah. There must be a deeper meaning behind organ ironic soy facing. I think that's interesting because I have seen I remember after the right wing guys after the alt-right guys invented soy face and people started doing it. Ironically. They get really mad they'd be like just because you're doing. It ironically doesn't mean you're not really one and you're actually doing it ironically because you know deep down that you're soy and the thing is. It's like. I mean. It's a it's a tautology. It's like they've just said everything. I don't like is soy. What's like well. I don't care if you don't like me you suck sure. I'm sorry whatever. I don't care like you. I don't your values are bad. I i. I'm glad that I don't adhere to them. But it's just fun. I gotta say. I give. I gotta give them that why aren't. I vegan give me a break give me a time. I'm on a process here okay. I've been. I've been a I've been a hedonic. slug my entire life.

It's not gonna be a 180. I'm not gonna. I'm not going to turn on a dime. If I tried. It would break. I'd snap in half like a twig. But I think I'm on a good path. I think I will get there someday.

Why is the k hive so psycho. That's a good question. I was thinking about that today because so friends and I were talking about the vp. Switch veeps the veep stakes and about how you know oh fiden's really. He painted herself into the corner with this black woman thing and you know it's probably bad that he doesn't feel like he has more variety and then somebody said it would be hilarious if he picked mitt. Romney and the thing is is that he's not really restrained to pick a black woman because according to the vast majority of these people who will really care like obviously for most people. Vp picks are meaningless. This is really just about like shaping narrative and keeping your motive most motivated volunteer type people and like leading-edge voters excited It's not gonna matter to the general public but all these people who say who who are now like he's gotta pick a black woman and all that if he doesn't they are on record without any thing to do because they have said explicitly that they will not abandon him because of the importance of beating trump which means that they he could pick anybody he could pick. Chris dodd guy who's basically a clone of him he could pick hunter he could pick mitt romney and what are they going to do about it.

What are you going to do get out of here. Get your shine box and I think that's true of most of these people but it is not true of the k-hive. I think the k-hive would actually not only not vote for biden but some of them might try to take a shot at him because they are the people who have essentially become identity politics wahhabists where they have they have gathered all of their political meaning like the the good and evil and their personal investment in politics their identity as a political agent as someone trying to shape their lives and destinies and the future of their fam. Their families and their species around a very specific ideological matrix around which with with with brittle to non-existent ideology under underlying it and as such they're not going to take that's that's the one thing that will make them the thing they. I mean they might have told everyone else hey suck it up. You know this but beating trump is too important. But I think for a small group of them. They would actually do some puma. If she didn't get it but from the point of view if I'm biden.

 these are an insignificant number of people and harris. I think honestly would be a bad pick. I mean not only I think it'd be funny if he didn't pick her. But I also think he could do better like that karen bass or something I honestly now. I'm kind of now the opinion that like a relatively unknown black female congresswoman would be the best pick because it would be something. People could talk about that wasn't trump or biden because they're stuck in a thing where you know you want to be able to define yourself. You need to have some sort of positive. You know shape to your campaign. You can't completely rely on your opponent. The bed I mean you can mostly do it but and you can try to do it. But there are I think people assume there are limits and I think people are going to act with the assumption that there are limits to that and so you want to have something positive to talk about your campaign and like if they roll out hey meet this person and it's somebody who basically nobody heard about a week ago becoming bait an overnight celebrity. That's the kind of thing that could actually hold a news cycle or two. You know I mean.

I don't think it will given how the cuisinart of of sensory overload we live in but it could certainly more than him picking. Kamala harris old news she ran boo. It's all immediately they go to oh what about the time of the debate they they fought and all that tedious and what about her making a cop blah blah you don't gain anything. It's just another. It's this somebody's already out has been in the deck brought back out oh yeah. We know that boo you got to bring in someone new someone flashy somebody get people going get the people moving and like with trump being the nominee with biden being the avatar of of wall street. experience if not competence. Since sure people know that his brain's melting but at least they don't think that he's not you know that that he doesn't know how the where the bathroom is and that kind of thing just unless he's forgotten. So. I don't think there's any real danger of people being like oh. She's she's not very qualified. I mean who's president for christ's sake. I think it immediately becomes here's a new person and so many people can form beliefs around people. They can make memes over a way to sort of launder.

This dog. It karen bass go for it val. Denning somebody like that whoever you think is like going to get whoever's get them in front of a focus group and whoever lights up the dials most pick just something to talk about that isn't biden that isn't biden's man. I mean my god you guys saw. I hope everyone saw him today the best one of his best moments yet of the campaign where he had everything in him everything in it that is bad everything that is that is evidence of his manifest mental incompetence in one minute long segment. Let me play it right now if anybody hasn't heard it. This is genuinely amazing vice president your opponent in this election. President trump has made your mental state a campaign topic and when asked in june if you've been tested um for cognitive decline. You've responded that you're constantly tested and constantly. He's got guys are coming at him. He's got to do judo chops. He's got to evade attackers. We've got to do mine with combat. Here we go why the hell would. I take a test come on come on man. That's like saying you before you got in this program if you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not. What do you think h ah hell god damn it oh if he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion. I don't know what the hell he's talking about did you watch that look come on man I i know you're trying to goad me but I mean I'm so forward-looking to have. I'm so forward to looking to sit with the president sit down or stand with the either one. Why would.

I want to do it by the way here it is. This is my favorite part you know i. I shouldn't say it. I'm going to say nah never mind. I probably should have said. Here we are I am 

I am very willing to let the american public judge my physical mental filter my physical as well as my mental fitness. He botches physical and metal fitness twice in a row. Like he's a studebaker you tried to start you couldn't write it better. He is funnier than trump at this point because trump would kind of get. It get him in there get get the new funniest possible thing but felix is once again correct. He truly is a shaman he just feels the vibrations. I'm out here trying to piece this. Together with like these stupid specific concepts and and symbolic orders and he's just like he's reading the wind. He's like his his kneecap starts twitching and he understands the the direction of the cosmic winds but yeah funniest outcome because we're in a period of disruption and comedy comes from surprise from the unexpected and we are living in an era of extrapolating and compounding shocks to the system. So of course it's gonna be funny.

Now this is who we get to be as president for anywhere from I'm gonna say 18 to I think he might make it. I think the over under on should be should. He make it past the midterms. Although maybe he'll keep living maybe. He is going to be one of those old guys whose br lights go out. But he stays alive for for years. God that'd be a nightmare but also in its own horrifying way. Kind of funny come on man if physical mental physical mental filth fitness god damn beyond everything that tom god damn beyond everything well. I mean they worship senility because they're senile the electorate is old people. They want to see themselves represented like trump is them so is biden just different versions the ones who are accepting their decline and the ones who are raging against the dying of the light.

But it's still the same group same old people watch tv and they're picking which type of which one of these old. They relate to more someone asked if nixon in 60 if he'd won if it would have changed the It would have prevented the the southern realignment the racial realignment on civil rights and I gotta say I don't think so Nixon wasn't like a ter well certainly wasn't a civil rights like fire brand in any way The real interesting thing is that the interesting question about civil rights is how to what to what's such a mat to what a massive degree. The assassination of jfk broke a log jam there that might otherwise have not been defeated and it raises a question of like absent that how do you because the. Kennedys had no idea how to deal with those old crackers in congress who were bottling it up using all the procedural tricks they learned from generations at the cracker barrel. You're you're howard smith's and your richard. Russell's they were eating their. They hated him they they had all the harvard degrees so they they knew it was better and they were just absolutely buffaloed and it was the assassination of kennedy that kind of broke the log jam on civil rights.

Of course you wouldn't I mean if nixon's president you still have the southerners resisting. I don't know. I don't know how you get out of the log jam. I I had a fun idea for a counter factual history there where kennedy nixon wins right and um when the human miss when the bay of pigs happens see the thing with kennedy was. Kennedy was essentially in the dark about about the bay of pigs when he came in. They said we've got an operation to defeat to go in and knock over. Castro easy peasy with a with an army like we did in guatemala.

It'll be no sweat and kennedy basically said all right go for it and the planners created a a plan that really could only have any chance of working with us military air intervention. It was not going to be feasible for them to actually I mean in in in the delusion halls of power. Some of these guys some of these guys maybe even wisener. I'm not sure believe oh as soon as they show up. The masses will rise up and overthrow castro. But the more hard-headed realists knew that that the cuban you know the response was robust enough that without air support to stop the moving in of heavy weapons to repel the invasion they were not going to make it and but they didn't tell kennedy that because they didn't want him to say no they were operating off the better to ask for forgiveness than permission model thinking that well. If we start this thing and it goes south he's going to be pot committed and he's going to say go for it which of course that's a bad way to go about planning a thing and sure enough. When it came time for the invasion. It was getting repelled and they say hey so we could really could use some air support and kennedy said.

No what was air support. I thought this was going to be easy and deniable and then he made the the laudable choice to just cut bait then and there of course some could say that's where his death warrant was signed depending on your view on it. As I said. I have at this point after reading about it a lot. I am agnostic. it just feels good. I feel I like floating in that that liminal jfk space just like in a jacuzzi of what-ifs possibilities and conjectures without any kind of solidified consensus. I like just knowing all that stuff and just letting it flow around me instead of hardening into press prepositions and suppositions.

But nixon on the other hand was the person at the white house who was the point man for the planning for the bay of pigs invasion which had started under eisenhower. Bay. Pigs were already under was already being planned before the election and nixon as vp was directing it. It's easy to imagine a counterfactual where nixon's president and is more invested in bay of pigs at an operational level and more committed to the concept of it so that if he was in charge when the invasion happens not only does he authorize airstrikes. They're already baked into the plan because he's he's signed off on the concept or even if not that when they ask him he gives the green light because he's just he believes he has ownership more of it. He feels like it's his thing. I mean a big part of it with kennedy. Is they just stuff that in his face and he said what I'm on the hook for something that. I didn't even authorize and that's one of the big reasons he didn't want to commit too much. This was nixon's baby and so what if there's a successful incursion that you know gets past the beach head at the bahati cochino and it stalls out and now the next step is an investment of u.s.

 boots on the ground and instead of vietnam and late 60s. You have cuba in the early 60s and with a hardening of social of a social conflict accelerating in the absence of a civil rights resolution. You have a more violent and more chaotic and dis and and polarizing even than in reality civil rights movement and anti-war movement. I don't know just messing around with a little bit. I have no idea but the other thing is is that nixon was also you know a triangulator and he was a pragmatist. So there's a question of you know he would he have been the guy who tamped down cold war tensions. After all he was the guy who I mean kennedy ran to his right on china and on missiles but the thing is. I think guys like kent nixon kind of view the great power. Like the stuff between the big guys on a different level than things like knocking over some tin pot dictator and at that point remember. Castro had just taken power. He was not this fixture in his human society. He was a revised knocking that guy off. I don't think he necessarily would have considered it like terribly especially in our own backyard. I don't think he necessarily would have considered it a a huge provocation to the soviets just keeping your house in order but yeah. I always imagine then like so nixon's term is just like this reactionary turn and then he has george wallace as his running mate in 1966 64.

Why somebody keeps asking about the social network and I gotta say that's a movie that I have very few opinions on. I never really got it. I watched it in the theater at the time it came out and I thought okay and it's never. It's never been a favorite of mine. But it's got stuff that's okay in it. I don't know the fixation on it. Either is either really good or really bad. I don't really get someone says oliver stone's w is good. I I have to disagree on that one that isn't that is a terrible film in my opinion. It's essentially a bunch of a bunch of filmed daily cost articles from 2004. I have I guess. I have one question. I guess people are asking if someone asked me about the about the uyghur deal and I know a lot of people say like the whole thing is an op. It's all like a cia operation to provoke a new cold war. I certainly buy the logic like the political logic anyway of a new cold war but as I understand you know as. I said. I I think that the real conflict between the united states and china is is due to short-sightedness and just a a in a an inability to to kind of smooth out. Some of the Some of the inherent bumps in transitioning to like a globalized supply chain and and are kind of from a market perspective not terribly rational but in the short term there's in both countries. There's I think significant political capital being garnered from an escalating cold war. The thing I don't get is at this late date.

I mean who the cares about human rights. I mean I get yeah iraq war right yeah. Like that was the big liberal intervention right that was the big that that was saving iraq and the poor kurds from the from the from poison and stuff. I mean trump ran on the rest of the world. We'll shoot whoever we want built like everyone's been freaking out about cages of the border for four years. Nothing's been done about them why the who's who what vanishingly small percentage of people gives a fellow citizens and I get oh. It's for the it's for the ngo crowd. It's for the ngo crowd. It's for the journalists. I'm sorry if you still think those people are shaping opinions. I mean if it is an op. It's a it's. It's one of the lowest return ops. I can imagine that's all. I don't know. I mean trump's on the record when when she explained to him what they were doing with the uyghurs. He said that's a great idea. That's what you should be doing.

Somebody asked an interesting question. Somebody said what about film under communism. Obviously. This is an absurd question because I mean talk about missing the force for the trees you know we're pretty far away from anything other than galloping disaster in every direction silly to talk about something as pie in the sky as that but I think it's an interesting idea just because I talk a lot about you know how art is warped over time by capitalism and what would that look like in its absence and part of me thinks. I mean so you've got the simple fact that technology is accelerated to such an extent that the ability to like make something a film specifically will be democratized presumably because the technology to the the actual capacity. The actual material necessary to detect to make to make a movie is distributed but the thing is if anybody can make a movie then which one should I see and like that's where the market comes in. As like these the creator of a gatekeeping effect which people hate gatekeepers. But I'm sorry certain things especially certainly aesthetics require gatekeeping or else people are never going to be able to engage with any kind of art form productively because they're not going to be able to seek things out because how are they supposed to know what even starts being good you know and that's where the market used to stand in like what people could get money for is what was good and of course. That's bad that's a bad rubric and it's distorting. But it also does create the capacity to make large scale entertainments that are genuinely engaging and it's hard to imagine the app something in the absence of that and i.

I kind of think there would be sort of a two-tiered filmmaking the way there is now but instead of around high and low budget it would be like local like. I could honestly imagine like movie making becoming a regional production like a collaborative thing from like communities or or or areas you know where people come together to do something and then they all watch it together and then like that's where and and then the the selection process becomes who you actually made the movie with you know. And it's not just seeing the thing. It's making. The thing like see it like local theater exactly But you know there's still a limit there to scale and grand grandiosity that who would want to lose that you know and then I would imagine it would have to be some you'd need. Some sort of gatekeeping operation to accumulate and coordinate action really and and accumulate the material the the capital to make it not capital. But whatever with the human and material resources maybe it'd be democratic.

Maybe people would like pitch their ideas. People would vote on them once upon a time in hollywood was the last great movie someone says I will say this. I'd say once upon a time in hollywood was the last movie. It was a great movie and I think it's it. But I think you could even say it might be like the last movie we'll see. But it might mark the end of an entire type of filmmaking which considering its subject matter is just so perfect that I kind of want it to be true even if it's not because it's so tidy someone's asking for sound drops. I think we might be able to get that in the future if we move to the studio like I'm hoping we can do soon. I would like to get some sound drops and maybe a sound board of some kind yellow zoo crew oh. someone says people will put sound drops in nothing that anyone and none of you people can do no no no no. I will control them. No no no no no no no surely you can't be serious allowing allowing the groundlings. No no no no just the sound board for me where I get to press buttons and make funny noises um so ah geoguesser. That's a good idea. I would do it to your guest or stream. I'm not very good at that game but it could be fun. I'm usually not that good at it because my computer was kind of slow and it was take too long to like get to the identifying stuff when I would lose patience but maybe.

I could take more seriously children men's great one of the best movies of the 21st century. For sure morats or clerics. I actually say morats moderates is a solid movie all around. It's an actual kind of movie movie. I like clerks a lot honestly. I mean it was formational as a kid but I think my rats was really good. Wow you know.

I'm noticing a lot of you. People ask me for my takes on things but you're you you put the you put it in a very leading way where you clearly want me to confirm your take on something that's very clever. I see you doing it though don't think. I don't see it. Cheeky. Monkeys thoughts on how. I'm cool.

I don't smoke someone's asking if I've smoked cigarettes. I've never smoked come from a family of smokers. Hardcore smokers never liked it sir all right the sarah cooper thing so there was an article today in mick about or mike. I don't know about how boomers love the sarah cooper lipstick videos but millennials and zoomers think that it's it's. It's laundering fascism or something and I i didn't read it but just the fact that it was phrased that way it just. It was disheartening because it reminded me of how how because culture because politics is so fully fused with popular culture and entertainment that you can't not like anything now for non-political reasons. Like if the thing is bad. It has to be politically bad it can't just suck and this lips the game theory tweet get retweeted by a bunch of people. Fawning over it have I been more baffled by seeing people including some people that I have somewhat some kind of respect for going. This is so funny. I was just like what what where does that come from and the thing is.

It's not. It's not because it launders oh. It's like it makes it makes trump's fascism clownish like I'm sorry. If you can't see the clownishness of this situation or the degree to which clownishness is inherent in fascism and you can't really be teased out and also like what's the best what's the bad part about this. Like you see her do the lip syncing and you're like oh. I was going to overthrow capitalism or whatever but now. I'm I'm just going to laugh at this video. What is the thought here. It's a lady doing a lip sync of trump. That's all it is. It's lame what why. I don't know anything about hassan being called by the nsa. What do you want me to say please. Don't yell at me in the chat until I have someone reading these. I'm I have to like do it myself. But it just. It's it's enervating to be assaulted with in news and demands for takes in in large print over and over again. I mean.

I think if people want obviously all the up but god damn it. It would be easier to fight it if fewer people acted like that was a real thing too and act like antifa is real like that. It's an actual group of people and it has leadership and that any of that what happened with antifa. It really clarifies the whole like power of nightmare's thesis about al qaeda that it was essentially made up by the bush administration that it never really existed in any form that people popularly understood it to according to what they saw in the media and and you know it took while for people to realize that because they didn't have the context of you know middle eastern politics and terrorism and stuff to realize oh this guy was basically just giving out grants like there was no real internal organization. Here it wasn't like spectre or something and like with anapha. That's the thing that I you know is hap is something people have understanding of and has happens like they've seen it. They've seen the the phenomenon their lives and they know it's not real and yet some people like al qaeda like being called real. Like al qaeda they they got off when when when bush turned them into this this evil organization and I think there's a similar impulse to be like yeah. We are this thing like because that's going to raise you up but then what look what it's used to do. It's used to justify spurious federal investigations and crackdowns. Jake paul having his mansion rated man hell of a day that was that was a whole squad. Is he is he starting a militia I think that would really be cool if he was starting a militia.

Someone wants me to tell them if bismarck or metternich were worse. That's a bad word to use when you're talking about historical figures that that axis of moral judgment applies to them internally but is relatively irrelevant to my analysis of them from history from the from the from decades away. I mean bismarck did help unify germany more directly and unified. Germany was a very bad idea but at the same time nobody really knew what it was. Gonna lead to nobody knew what all those compound words were doing to their heads. I mean I guess it's just I what what trait are you trying to examine like personal morality or immorality. I think that's kind of irrelevant like what effects are you trying to determine and and then like the question should be built around that because I just don't know how to answer like good or bad for bad like evil people honestly even when they talk about like an evilest dictator or whatever. It's like oh he killed 20 million people. He killed 30 million people.

It's like well yeah but if you'd switch them it probably would have been different numbers. This is one of the big reasons. I've never been down on the idea that james buchanan is the worst president because if you had switched him in franklin pierce they would have had the exact same presidencies basically because they came from the exact same do-faced conciliatory northern democratic tradition. They were upholding the same at that point no longer sustainable but still delusionally held by people at the highest levels of government democratic. Northern bargain of giving the south whatever they want to keep keep the peace and that's what buchanan was doing. I mean we look back on it and people call him a traitor for just giving up all those armories and forts to to the insurgents but pierce would have done it too that was giving. Southerners to keep them quiet was what northern democrats did to keep power so to me. They're interchangeable same thing with all the evil dictators like it's the the resources and the populations that they control dictated how many people they killed yeah and if you want to talk about like competent.

I mean mernick got driven out of give driven out of vienna by by a mob and bismarck. Never had that happen why did. I say that my fans betrayed me. I don't. I don't think I did if I did that might have been a joke. I don't think. I ever said that seriously it'd be a weird thing to say if I said that that would disturb me because it means. I'm in some sort of a megalomaniacal fugue.

I think omar will win. I I honestly. I don't know. I think people are just kind of flinching so much like. I think people thought that rashida was in more trouble than she probably ever was because they're just They're used to getting their asses kicked but the thing about like high-profile congressmen is they tend to be popular unless they get unless they're popular for unless they get in trouble for like specific stuff that is antithetical to the base. The party base that they have like having name recognition is a huge percentage of the battle for any congressman as soon as you have a certain amount of of like real estate and people know you in a in a district. You don't really lose ever and getting a high profile early is a good way to have that get have that process accelerate and the stuff that people think is like awful for omar or whatever. I don't think actual people in that district give a kind of just got put in without being considered and now the people are actually directly challenging it.

They have to defend it on the merits and try to provoke conflict on the issues themselves which basically bail down to allowing israel to do whatever it wants in its nightmare. Apartheid state and americans don't care enough to like do anything to stop us from contributing to that. But they also don't care enough to vote for somebody who's opposed to it and I think that's what the um that's what's being slowly and horrifyingly understood in the halls of power said oh. Like if if this is if this is no longer just a situation where there's an exercise minority who love israel and everyone else kind of doesn't care If there's even you know a residual support for confronting israel. It's going to be hard to dislodge because how the hell do you argue that as its own discrete issue yeah exactly apathy works. Both ways like apathy is why we're not going to get a change to u.s policy in israel. But albany is also why if you have a few brave congress people who are willing to not toe the line on israel. It's harder for israel to if they don't have anything else that's controversial pin that on them as a reason for them to be voted out by their own. constituents who they other who otherwise might like and respect them wow all right.

I'm gonna ask I'm gonna log off in a second here. One more question guys I'm gonna. I'm gonna crack another lacroix all right. This is a good question best snl. Weekend update anchor. The obvious hipster answer is norm mcdonald. So. I'm not even gonna say that because it's too odd on the nose I'm just gonna go with my my childhood gut with a guy. I used to really really like and not because he was funny because he used to make me feel smart because if I got the reference I felt like a little good boy because I was a miller respect respect to the god colin quinn. Pro got to be worst him and charles rocket probably but oh my god colin quinn was terrible just the worst person they could have picked for that job. They clearly like panicked after norm got fired and just it's almost like they grabbed him from like drinking like a short dog with fingerless gloves in front of the 30 rock and put him on put him. On the set it was kind of amazing just muttering his way stumbling through every joke. It was amazing all right guys. I'm peacing out see you tomorrow hopefully.
