That couple won't be having any family. Hey billy songwriter are you. Now. Don't you know what you need you know. They are tattelli old telltale. Where are billy bones resting now what. I'm still streaming had the israelis in his sights with a rat tata they ran like shiites. Hey billy don't you know that we need your nose where are billy bones resting now. One night. Billy had a rare old time laughing and singing on the level online came in a camp not looking too pretty. Never even got to see the holy city now billy's out there in the desert sun and his mother cries when the morning comes and there's mothers crying all over this world for the poor little darling boys and girls here in the summer. You know don't you know that between you now with the rattata now the rata town. The old town where are billy bones god damn it. Why is it doing this. I unhosted you why do I unhost and then it hosts again. Rehosts stop calling me a boomer so that song billy's bones is a very interesting one that pogue song that I was singing. It's inspired by actual events which was in the 1980s.

After the israel israeli invasion of lebanon there are was a u.n peacekeeping force that was deployed to basically keep the israelis away from the palestinians. In the wake of sabre and shatila. I believe and part of that un deployment was irish troops and I believe this is in. This is covered extensively in pity the nation by robert fisk. A irish u.n lad u.n troop was kidnapped and murdered by most likely the lebanese forces christian militia. The one that peter dow was a member of in collusion with the israelis and it became a big scandal. Like oh my god did israel kill an irish soldier and I remember reading a like liner notes or something for that album run sorry in the lash that described that song as surreal and it's like no it isn't. It's literally a song about an irish guy going to the going to un getting killed by the israelis. I think it's because nobody knew that story outside of ireland I know I never did before I read about it but it is funny because ireland's non-terror non-insurgent-based military. Roll call of like the 20th century stuff. That was not you know the ira or the civil war or being being neutral during world war ii my dad used to say the only two neutral countries in world war. Ii were the friendly swedes and the cowardly irish. Their only big military events of any kind were part of mill of u.n operations. There was a famous event during the congo civil war that saw the death of patrice lumumba and daghammershall where european mercenaries. I believe allied with the belgian-backed breakaway. Katanga province ruled by moses zombae attacked a irish-held u.n. Base in giadafield. There's a kind of boring netflix movie about it. That's really it. The irish army didn't do much although they got their asses shot the hell during world war one as part of the british expeditionary force.

I really wish. I had that mixtape of me rapping. It's I still remember some of the things. I like I remember those those lyrics but it was mostly just me pretending to shoot drug dealers like hey can I buy some drugs sure undercover cop you're under arrest. Don't do drugs. That was it and I never the weird thing is that I never really had any idea what I was going to do with it. I wasn't imagining. I was gonna. I never played it for anybody. I didn't go to school. I wasn't that much of a dork to go to school and like hey guys so. I don't know what the hell. I thought he was even gonna do with it. I guess. I just had this like creative urge that needed to be expressed and at that moment. Hating drugs was the most emotionally like the most powerful symbolic. Like narrative that I could get my mind around at the time.

I did get the johnson. Johnson vaccine so. I and the funny thing is that I've had zero side effects at all like. I didn't get anything after having it. I didn't even get a little like achy nauseous anything. It didn't even really hit my heart hurt my arm that much which makes me wonder if I even got anything. Maybe it was just maybe. It was just sugar water honestly though. I wouldn't be surprised if they were half placebos because as I have said the point of all of this is not to stop the spread of any virus.

It is to get us to a point where we're okay with the status quo enough to shop and act like normal people and get rid of this. This noose around the economy's neck. The service economy's neck the retail economy stack otherwise known as the american consumer economy's. Neck I mean my god. This is ben. This has been a targeted a strike at the heart of the global capitalist system which is dependent on american consumption. That's what we're for. And this is why. I really think we might be on our way to falling backwards into a neoliberal ubi because we are functionally as an american economy. Not here to make things yes we do make things we grow things we manufacture things but most of the growth of manufacture is done at the heart of empire. The way mark's assumed it would be by the greatest degree of technological innovation or that technological intensity. The most the most mechanized process mechanized process. What the rest of us do is hang around and buy stuff from the rest of the world equalize the global supply so that we don't have a crisis of over accumulation which is what caused the great depression which is what has caused historically economic crises. The u.s exists at the end of the global supply chain to catch all of the remainder to get all the leftovers off of all the plates at the at the um at the all-you-can-eat restaurant. But we're still operating off of a labor paradigm which means we have to work for the money.

We get to consume that's totally unnecessary that is a social ritual. At this point. It is not productive like all of our. The labor we're doing is ritualized because we cannot accept the reality that we have traded away our political subjectivity for unlimited consumption and that means that the only way to square this and to keep the thing going is to just put a funnel of money into people to do to allow them to consume not related but not conditionally upon their income. Because the profits are going down there is no room on the balance sheet for more money through employment because these aren't real jobs so there's no pressure to get a bigger labor share of income because there's no leverage because it's not real work of course that doesn't mean that real work doesn't get done but the real work is domestic reproductive and infrastructural. It's the stuff that allows us to sit around and consume that's real labor and yeah being a working in the retail sector being the person to give the food and the stuff to people and running up the purchases that's real labor but it is all around consumption. It is not around production and yes nursing and like keeping people alive. All of those things are infrastructural but it is not productive productive.

Economics occur elsewhere because and this is the thing. The the the capitalism was going to is going to in his closed system is going to be pushed towards automation but when you have a global an unequal development of global capitalism and you have huge numbers of people who are only recently been introduced into market relationships from rural feudalism. Then you can turn them into incredibly cheap labor which will not put pressure at the local level to industrialize and that's what we have now so in the places where like in europe where labor power was able to extract better conditions there's still industrial economics happening and But here there is. There is there is none. There is no productive economy in the united states. The productive economy is elsewhere either with other with the people who got a better deal in europe or people working with their hands in the cheap zones of the world economy which have not been developed yet now theoretically over time you would get a system where you had full equal development of capitalism as it spread around the world but that requires infinite inputs. It requires infinite resources infinite externalities. We don't have those oh. I'm sorry yes there is one thing there are two things we actually export as part of this system but there are things to keep this thing going they're the things that keep all these things all these part. All these polities. All these countries all these social formations. This is what keeps them all on the team. This is what keeps that flow coming to the united states because it's not just there to consume. It's there to consume at the expense of other social orders because we what do we export intellectual property and weapons those are the things that enforce a cl and and currency the world global reserve currency. Those things create the actual structures of control within the global economic order but our social role within it as individual americans is to consume not have any participation in the actual political structure or the political economic structure. It is to consume we traded away our political subjectivity and now we fake politics. Now we have a phony politics carrying out that we do a potemkin politics to make up for it.

Now this is not on purpose. This is the problem that a lot of your americanist like third worldest types your people who just like get off on being the most radical in the most american get off is. They think that this is all some sort of cynical operation on behalf of the disgusting american labor aristocrat. No this is a pro. This is what happens when you are at a disadvantage like america's working class has been because we were where capitalism was able to solve temporarily the input question in a way european capitalism because it couldn't it left the american working class at a critical disadvantage relative to capital and we look to europe and we see the the emergence of socialist parties and social revolution and we go what do we do wrong. We didn't really do anything wrong. What happened is that the the territory the material base was different. The free real estate of the west allowed all social conflicts to be resolved away from so the a moment of truth in europe. Those closed national um social orders those those net those competitive national bourgeois all competing against each other instead of cooperating instead of subsuming their differences because it drives away from any kind of coordination when unsynthesized into like a larger form of state authority. Like the united states did to the confederacy it blows up into some sort of social crisis. Cop you get communism you get fascism. You get a real class conflict that gets subsumed into politics. Here all politics is drained away from conflict because there's always somebody to buy off at somebody else's expense but that somebody else's expense can always be born because they got nobody else to turn to and the american and america's history is since the civil war has been the and before that too has been the process slowly of bringing in more and more people into the umbrella of like civic citizenship.

But while that's happening the the definition of citizenship is changing and being drained of its political um its political content and political power and that is the the horrible joke of the whole thing is that when blacks were finally brought into full political quality in the united states it was at a point where the political ground had shifted and political questions that could actually address the systemic horrors of racism were no longer accessible and that's where we are now and that's what we have to bring a new politics into being. But it doesn't change any of the questions in front of us. It should just change our approach to them. It should it should clear us of some illusions that we might hold that make it harder for us to see the moment clearly like the bessemer thing. I think people got way more excited for that and put way more folk emotional energy into that than it warranted given the real condition of labor in this country. Visa via company like amazon and the reason for that is because people have certain expectations around politics around what they think they can contribute and we can contribute in the moment to challenging capitalism and that leads us to be more likely disappointed by something like bessemer disengaged demoralized by it and that's why remembering this stuff remembering where we are in.

This structure can make these things less wounding and and allow us to keep our powder dry for anything that might emerge in our lives. And I know that that isn't much. It's very thin gruel. But I really do think listening to this and hearing this message and kind of getting sort of those buddhist cones in your head. That bring you back always to the real conditions that we find ourselves in It's better than winding yourself up. It's not better than other stuff to do but it's definitely better than winding yourself up and that does seem like the only other option because the arguments that are premised on we're gonna get somewhere from here. By arguing about this.

I think are for our are false. I mean amazon cheated but that hadn't been taken. If you didn't take that for granted then you weren't ready for the campaign. You weren't ready for the reality and the likelihood of defeat if you really thought oh. I didn't know amazon was gonna cheat. They always cheat because it's always in their interest to cheat you can. Break the law and inhibit a a union vote and then even if you're caught red-handed. The process is so long and involved and then the punishment is so poultry that it will always be in your incentive to put the stick in the spokes of the wheel every time because even if they even if what happens is that the nlrb says you have to have another election. You just do it again and you're buying time and all you're ever doing in business is buying time anyway so you get to just keep putting a goddamn stick. In the spokes. There is a smith's field smithfield ham. The big plant there had a 16 year union drive. That's how long it took them to get a clean election where smithfield didn't cheat or be able to overcome the cheating that they did so if you're going if you're surprised by the cheating or thought that that could have been avoided with any strategy.

 then you were not ready for what was likely to happen and I think that's true of a lot of people can we hijack state governments to change this. I kind of have the of the opinion that barring the ubi barring like say we invented sent something to make climate change a little better we break we make some breakthroughs assuming like the technological fix to the crisis occurs the way it has. Traditionally you know like how the green revolution in the 70s precluded the sort of mass starvation that people are worried about happening now with global warming that was on the agenda in the 70s before the green revolution which was a revolution in among other things wheat genomes where they created something called dwarf wheat that allowed for more wheat to be processed per stock which will greatly increase the amount of calories that could be produced per acre of land so you need another thing like that a second green revolution and that buys us time from crisis and then they do give us the ubi if we have that out. I don't even know. I was talking about that but I'm saying that's like the best case. Scenario oh right and and politics continues but in like a slightly improved material condition. 

I think that you're going to see a steady centrifugal force between the state governments and the federal government depending on who's in charge. Now that's the thing it's not like the antebellum era when it was always the south polling for secession after the north pulled for secession under the federalists by the way but that's because in the early republic the center of political gravity was in the south and that is why during the war of 1812 it was federalists in new england who threatened to secede from the union. By the even the civil war. The the economic power is in the north which meant that the s and the center of gravity was in the north so that means that the south had to pull away um. Now. We are having a situation where the poll the the the federal. The the states rights. Successionist poll is going to come from the whatever the opposite of the party in the white house is so under biden. We're going to see big time. I think nullification style threats from hell. We saw it from south carolina. I think desantis in florida has a real chance to emerge as like the 2024 candidate by standing up by embodying like the state-based resistance to the biden federal government. Texas of course and always but like say that biden gets four years loses re-election which I think is possible always. At this point we might be done with two two-term presidents at this point depending on how fast things accelerate um and that means that say desantis wins or trump comes back during that presidency. You're going to see states right. Emerge on among the big blue states like new york and california.

They're going to try to defy federal edicts on things like immigration on things like health care and so there's going to be this constant ratchet of sectional conflict and that means that there is always going to be work to do at the state level to build the capacity to participate no matter what those conditions might be certainly more so than the federal government. I would say at this point that the federal government is a lost cause. The federal government is beyond any conceivable political influence from any group of organized voters that we could call the left that would be my main argument. About the federal government. You can say things are good or bad. You can say that the biden stimulus is better than you expected either even though honestly. I think the argument that this is a better. Stimulus than obama's is simply predicated on the fact that it's a bigger crisis. It's we're further down the road from the crisis. We never fixed in 2008.

So of course we're gonna have a bigger. Rescue package. We're deeper in the hole that doesn't really mean anything but whatever we're not participating in it. At the grassroots. It is a full spectacle state and local races. I think are different because the the organizing capacity at a state level and certainly at a local level is different relative to the amount of power that concentrates at that level. So I would say yes i. I mean I honestly could see a situation where like california if they embark on like a if political crisis like does push that sort of bernie coalition that won the primary into power which is a possibility that you see a continued brinksmanship especially if there's a republican presidency between california and the federal government. I do think that the whole thing will break up before. I don't think that the united states will collapse overnight. I think it will break up at some point but that I mean I honestly don't think that that is much of a prediction especially if you caveat that we're not talking in the near future. We're not even talking 50 years. But I do think once you get past 50. I don't think it's real reasonable to say that it's not that it's not that it's ridiculous.

That's all I've said not necessarily to happen but I gotta say the odds the odds go up every year so what do people think about the idea that bernie would have been assassinated if he'd gotten the nomination because I have noticed that post bernie one of the big intellectual currents has been this resurgence in interest in the kennedy assassination and specifically conviction that the kennedy assassination was in fact the cia operation and I really do feel like. Although there is plenty of interesting evidence for that. I mean I gotta say sean mccarthy on twitter has posted some stuff that I had never heard about and I was a very big cia. A big jfk assassination head in high school and college as because I was cool. I mean. I I literally printed out the skeleton key to the gemstone file and would read it in class that's how cool. I was and I had never heard some of the. But I do think that whatever you want to argue about the merits of that and I think that they're fully arguable. I'd say that I am a c. I am a jfk agnostic on every question of it and I really do feel like because I can't know more. There's nothing I'm going to learn that is going to change that it's only about whether I decide to like put enough focus on trying to convince myself of one or another. It really is about like okay which one of these should I just stare at until I believe in it because that is really where I feel like it. I'm at and. I don't feel like there's any point to me doing that. I don't feel like there's any advantage to finding that now other people they don't have to look so hard. They can look for a second and be like no. That's it. I can't do it. I it would require me to focus more on it. I think than would be worthwhile because I really do feel like.

We're the world we're living in can be explained under any one of those frameworks. Any one of the jfk assassination frameworks can be made sense of materially with where we are now. But I do think that the emphasis on the assassination as a government operation is partially to give yourself the reassurance that we never really had a chance and the thing is. I think that's true. I think the bernie campaign in retrospect never really had a chance. Now the question is what was it that gave it not a chance was it the atomization of the social order was it. The translate transformation of the american from a worker to a consumer was that it or was it the result of the deep state. The para government structure that is beyond government oversight and popular understanding to shaping and determining the levels of our political horizon and the thing is both of those can be explained through marxist terms. Both of them accord to us materialist understanding of history because you've got the one that emphasizes suburbanization and and racial segregation and media saturation and the changes in conditions of work. You can emphasize that and get to there from here or you can emphasize the way that within a competitive capitalist economic structure functional bourgeois democratic organs require the abstracting away from the individuals to a secondary sense source of power. Because individual capitalist firms can only operate out of self-interest. They cannot coordinate effectively without abstracting away something to a government. That's what that's how the bourgeois dictatorship operates and it is all directed through democratic means in order to maintain its legitimacy. Like we have elections so that the people don't revolt and you don't need to spend money keeping them working.

They'll work on their own because they think they voted for it. They think that they're participating in these questions and that keeps them on. Board that is manufacturing consent and that's way cheaper to do that by having a democracy than by having to use the technology of control. I think that's changing now. I think we're getting to a point where technology has is advancing to the point where we can just get rid of the democracy even formally because we will have a sufficiently technologicalized consent mechanism. But before that you really needed if you wanted to be efficient. If you wanted to be an efficient capitalist system you needed democracy because it's cheaper but that means that there has to be a non- politic. There has to be a power that transcends democratic accountability because you're not really a democracy that's what the constitution exists to do that's what institutions like the presidency the supreme court. The fed exists to do to abstract power and mystify it and have it be contained beyond accountability and the once you get to the post-war era and we go from headquartering a a state bourgeois dictatorship to presiding over a world capitalist empire that required a sophistication of operation and maneuverability and articulation of power that could never be democratically accountable by definition could not be democratically accountable and so therefore had to be abstracted away beyond control and that means creating a a brain in the deep state in the permanent intelligence intelligence state which would act at every point to prevent the democratic.

 role play the carnival from breaking containment that makes sense too. Both of those things are true which one of them is the determiner of events. I don't know and and I don't think that my analysis of the moment depends on either one. I will be reading jfk and the unspeakable for a project. I know that that now is the one everyone points to I mean before that it was the devil's chess board and I have to say that while that's a great book and I very much enjoy all the stuff about dulles career as one of the most evil demons of the 20th century. It is interesting that as the book gets closer to the kennedy assassination dulles as a character disappears from the pages and the narrative. It really does become a a echo chamber of you know testimony and and and intimation. He never really makes a case that that dulles was the mind of the kennedy assassination beyond saying that he is the one figure who was in power that kennedy dispossessed of power like whatever you want to say about kennedy and like to vietnam did he really care about ending the war there. Like was he really having this dove turn that a lot of people now think he was and I think there's more evidence than I used to think that that might be the case one way or the other dulles is still literally still hot fired dulles still got fired. Kennedy still said. I'm gonna smash the intelligence the cia into a million pieces and with those two things being true. It really does point to dulles in defense of the intelligence community's prerogative more than specific goals in vietnam or cuba to be the motivation for the assassination and I'd say that is very persuasive but again.

I don't know. I don't know enough and I can't focus on it enough to make an appointment. I my main making it a a sense because I'm trying to ground my now in history and specifically how history can tell us how contingency and materiality can hit each other. How contingency and consequence hit each other because we really do live in a world made by our material reality made by our material relations of life and our modes of production but that are lived through a culture through a superstructure that shapes us literally at a at the level of our consciousness and so that means that the interplay between these things is not some simplistic arrow that goes from base to superstructure. It is a fully unified thing it. It is. It is as non-dualistic as the universe the basin superstructure and so that's why with a thing like the kennedy assassination I would much rather talk around it and talk about the contingencies and the consequential moments that shaped the world were in and and how they would have been reflected in these arguments than trying to argue whether one specific thing happened or not because that to me kind of misses the point which is that we're here either way so what is the constant. One thing we can say is that I think contingency is much greater than we would assume if we do operate for materialist principles but that in retrospect when you look at it as like a diagram of human activity it becomes inexorable. It looks on paper like it couldn't have been any other way.

I do. I do think it's interesting the people who want like the files open and who want the cia to give up what they have or think that there's some investigation that can come to a final conclusion. I would say that the smarter of them that I know would probably admit that if it all came out tomorrow cia killed kennedy it wouldn't matter. I mean we had an afghan. We had an afghanistan pentagon. Papers come out last year that no one cared about. It said yeah longest war in american history that's still going on all lies. The whole way nobody cares because nobody's fighting it because it's a bunch of poor kids and rotc freaks presiding over a war that isn't meant to be won. So it doesn't matter we all know. Everybody knows as leonard. Cohen said that the dice are loaded. Everybody knows that the good guys lost but they would might argue but you know knowing is worth it and I can see that but I also kind of wonder isn't it just demoralizing wouldn't it just be demoralizing wouldn't it be.

Demoralizing to have that happen to just have it all unveiled and then for no one to the mystery. Even the mystery like that the little thing in your gut of like the spark that that jim garrison moment from the end of the movie where he goes don't forget you're dying king open. The files don't you want that and not have it just totally extinguished just so that you can know but i. I mean obviously. I would like to know who am I kidding open. The files for the love of god 

Somebody says am I more of a pete bondurant a kemper boy or a ward little. I think you could guess. I think. I mean I'm pretty tall. But I'm definitely not a pete and I'm obviously not kemper boyd come on. I am. I did a tweet once. I said take the buzzfeed american tabloid test are you a pete award or a kemper and I said spoiler alert if you're on twitter you're a ward.

I do think though that you know how they say 70 of americans think that the kennedy assassination was a conspiracy. I think that that's true regardless of where you are like. I think that runs that that number is is distributed everywhere in society. So I feel like even if kennedy was killed by oswald all those problems. The intelligence community was having solved themselves in the form of this wacko shooting the president or another one. I like trying to kill connolly and missing which is one theory or him taking a shot missing and then the dumb ass secret service agent behind kennedy's car standing up too fast with an ar-15 and shooting him in the head which is another theory. If all that was true nobody knows for sure. Most people don't aren't convinced by the explanation there's big questions hanging over it. So. I think like people in government are presidents and all those guys and not even forget the presidents people in congress in the senate governors. They mostly probably think that there was an assassination that was carried out by a conspiracy and what that does is. It lets them know what they're in for if they. With anybody they know they could get got or you know could because maybe they're out there. Maybe they got kennedy and if they could then then maybe they could get me and it's just one more little bit of of rebar in the the ideological structures that make up the political mind and that and that discipline political action.

I don't somebody says how long until we let corporations vote. I don't think we'll have to. I mean. They already effectively vote their votes matter in a way that the our votes don't. But the actual voting is the whole point of corporate power is that it's outside of the voting structure. It doesn't require participation at the level of the ballot so they'll never need to vote. It'll just all fall fall apart. It'll all drain off politics. The voting rights all that ritual stuff will be drained away. It's not going to be injected into. It's not going to be validated.

It's going to be undermined how long until cities get autonomous zones. Corporations get autonomous zones within cities where they can make their own laws. They already do that dan gilbert and and quicken loans in detroit. They've turned it into ocp. They have it's robocop in detroit. The downtown has been brought out by dan gilbert's company. They run it as a corporate campus and it has private security that's the center of the city that's literally robocop. He's dick jones and there is now a effort in nevada to incorporate corporate cities in the middle of nowhere that are going to be able to write their own laws and have their own tax structures. It's inevitable company towns. I mean people call it neo-feudalism but it's not really it is just more capitalism. It's capitalism undefeated. It's capitalism unchallenged. It's capitalism at the state of decline away from away from like state capacity and towards total like technological independence. But the social structure is neo-feudal in that you've replaced the liberal order of of of rights to contract and individual citizenship with bilateral contractual relationships.

Where all human relationships are are mutual obligations instead of a or an era where you're bargaining as an individual. Because that is the point where technology exists to not require your consent. You don't we don't need you to consent to this so we don't have any reason to humor your ass with individual rights and market choices. I don't understand how someone calls me a dsa and democrat defender. I guess. There is now a thing where if you are not explicitly endorsing the republicans that makes you a democrat and I kind of get what that they mean because like if we're talking about this the spectaclized political politics of identity and there's two sides you can only really break with the one dominant form by endorsing the other one I understand that and there is logic to it if you insist on maintaining investment in this identity formation. But I do not agree because then you're just a republican and how the hell here's the one thing. I really don't get and I'm so apparently.

This is not the person. The person wasn't talking about me but I've heard this before that's why I responded to it um. What I do not get is if you see the way the capital dominates the democratic party and and defeats any attempt to make it an articulation or a a vehicle for class power. What would make you think that the republicans would not have similar structures. I guess the argument is as well well. Democrats use wokeness but yeah that republicans use anti-wokeness in the exact same way. It's just that because you're in the milieu either because you live in a city or you're spending on time online with left wingers and and and the mainstream culture you're seeing them through this like glass over there in the in the parts of the country that are dominated by republican local capital. They use anti-wokeness to make demand to destroy any kind of class politics. In the exact same way. There is no way for it to articulate itself out of this structure. Both parties are irredeemable. The thing is though you still might have to support democrat right when they run for office sometimes at the local level. This is what I'm talking about how it's all about where you can actually focus energy and power.

It might be a ballot line. It might be a different party but the determiner is not either of those. It's what the power is at the base that can affect the the vote and to shape the agenda as a participant. As just a passive voter. You don't have any obligation to vote for anybody. You can jam your vote up your ass because individual votes don't mean anything morally.

I fully believe that like the main problem with dsa has been the same problem tsa has had since its explosion. It's a middle-class movement of of computer people and when I say middle class I mean people who are identifying themselves as consumers and whose lived experience of labor is not what is not organized and coherent and does not structure their relationship to politics. Even though they might think it does what they're actually responding to is an idea of class. They picked up in a book and that's not everybody. But it's the majority and that's not and the other thing is is.

There's no alternative to that because the only people who are politically engaged in this country are people who have been propagandized sufficiently to think politics matters and for them to think that they had to have got it somewhere and the way they get. It is largely through the ritual acculturation of politics in college and so you go to college to learn about exploitation and class you come out either deciding the class is a thing and that you need to organize around it or that it isn't and you need to organize against it. And then you apply those politics to your life but they are not lived. It's not a lived experience for americans which is why it's very funny to hear people talk about lived experience and how we have to honor lived experience. If we honor lived experience. We will never be able to organize socialism because class is not a lived experience. We live class in our in our relationships to capital but we process it through our understanding of ourselves as consumer identities which include things like race and gender and politics and so you come out of college thinking that voting and caring who's in charge and is a meaningful activity and that you are going to meaningfully impact politics by engaging in it. If you have only experienced the blunt end of the stick of life. In this country. You're less like and you have not been told through a process of cultural um assimilation that this is true you're gonna. All this and mainly by not being political at all. But if things get worse and worse and politics becomes more strenuously part of culture and harder to avoid and more s more entertaining the way. It has a lot of those people are going to enter politics and the only framework they're going to have is the stupid framework and that is a bad that's bad news for everybody.

But it wouldn't be much better news if it was the other way around because neither one of them can articulate a positive vision and a vision to challenge which would have to be a vision that challenges capitalism. I'm not criticize. I'm not really criticizing the the dsa for being a middle-class movement or like a college educated movement. A non-work like not specifically working class movement is in people who like live class. I'm not criticizing them for that. It's inevitable as. I said what I'm saying is that has been the biggest hurdle to them being effective. And it's something that needs to be addressed one way or the other. But I think it needs to be recognized as the fundamental problem before you can move forward because it doesn't seem to me that a lot of people think that's the issue and if you don't think that's the issue you end up talking yourself into some pretty wacky circles to try to figure out what the issue is and that makes it harder for you to address things and makes you have to deal with people who don't know what the terrain looks like and aren't addressing problems where they need to be addressed 

The lincoln assassination conspiracy theories that there's no conspiracy theory there because it was a conspiracy. I mean. I think some people forget that but booth was part of a ring of guys who operated out of boarding house owned by mary sarad who planned on the night of lincoln's assassination to kill lincoln andrew johnson. I wish they'd gotten him and seward and grant in in a in a decapitation strike. But what is even less well-known is that before that they had a plan to kidnap lincoln that they coordinated with and were funded by the confederate government it was. It was essentially a hit put out by the the confederate government and a number of the conspirators were hanged afterwards um. What happened with the rest of the assassinations is that the guy who was supposed to kill andrew. Johnson chickened out that johnson too for the love of christ and then the funniest incident was that someone went to kill william seward and he was in bed with a neck brace on because he'd been in a carriage accident and when he went to stab him he kept hitting the neck brace and then he ran away so not only was it a conspiracy. It very well could have been a conspiracy of a federal confederate government. I wish they hadn't shot booth and they found that out because that really might have increased the likelihood of a more putative government settlement with the leadership of the confederacy at least which was would have been necessary as a just a minimal starting point to make reconstruction work. There is other stuff though about there's again there's a theory that and I don't really see a lot of evidence for this that william stanton the war secretary was secretly behind the lincoln assassination and that he cut like one of the pieces of evidence is that the the telegraph lines were cut right after the assassination and were not operative for hours much like how the as they say in jfk the phone lines in washington dc went down on the 22nd of november and like booth's diary has some missing pages or something.

I don't think it's terribly persuasive. Most countries do or. I think most countries do change their. They change their form of government and change the constitution we definitely should have more than we did give me benjamin butler as president after the lincoln assassination and maybe we have we got something oh my god. The hype train is close. I remember this happened one other time the hype train where one person away from the hype train still not sure what it is. But it's it's exciting because I remember there's like a big thing that goes down. It's like when it's like a like doing a slot machine or all something. There. You see him there's a little train. There look it up this little chain so yeah we're one away. It's a scam train. How is it a scam don't get scammed folks. I don't want you to get scammed. I just like the little train guy oh so. It's so. It's a way to trick people into giving me money.

Benjamin wade becoming president after johnson being impeached would have been good. It's a little late. Johnson had already had a chance to do a lot of damage by then but also because remember because of the insane idiocy of the way that congress operated constitutionally at that time. Congress didn't come back in session after johnson becomes president for months so he was able to just go hog while bios lose him. But it would have been unlikely because there was a big consensus in the democrat republican party. Hype trade that they didn't want. Benjamin wade to be president because benjamin wade was ambitious. He would probably have run for office and gotten it in the the next election and he was a soft money radical. He was not one of these gold standard and once again our only hope was soft money apparently.

 milton friedman has the same analysis of the civil war about how it's really about gold versus fiat only. He thinks that's why the confederates were the good guys. I disagree. He's literally arguing for a a capitalist abstraction away from politics in the form of in the form of a gold standard which is arbitrary and enforced by state power. That's the thing a lot of those guys don't even know that like. I would argue that a guy like about how gold is is different. How gold isn't like other currency gold isn't like just the government. The gold can't be. No don't tell me gold. The icky gross state is why gold has value no no no he's too committed ideologically to to possibly say no to that. But I think that at the top levels most of these know that shit's not true especially in the finance sector. They know that that's not real so this thing really is just like a fake little video game to get you to pay like oh you want to see the number go up and then you press the button to see the number go up is this how japanese television works and yet people do it anyway. They know this and yet they do it anyway. Fascinating the constitution can never be rejected at the grassroots on the right anyway because the constitution is the is the basis for hierarchy. The constitution justifies hierarchy the true the cons. The premise of constitutional government is that there is a subject class that cannot be a participant in politics and so it can't you can't get rid of it because then you have gotten rid of all the levels of mystification away from the reality that the state is what we make it and if the state is what we make it then power cannot. Why would we concentrate power unnecessarily. Why would we concentrate wealth. Why would we concentrate life possibilities. Why would we concentrate beauty and and grace and and repose why would we concentrate that at the top we got high this train. I claim this is this ideology yeah.

The only thing I remember from my anti-drug wrap. Was they said. I was weak. They said. I should drink tea but I said sorry dudes I like my wits about me. So there they stood something like befuddled and stunned well. I walked off real sleek and smug pretty sure that's it. No no see that's the thing the drink tea thing. Some people think oh are you saying that's like oh you should drink tea. No they're making fun of me for not doing drugs. So they're like oh you should drink tea instead. It's like they said I was weak. They said. I should drink tea like oh look at me. No drugs for me. I'll be drinking tea pinky extended. But then I say sorry dudes. I like my wits about me yeah. I was a backpack rapper. Basically. I never had a roller backpack.

I will say that somebody asked for spanish civil war book recommendations if you like the military part of it. The anthony bevore has a good book. The social history is actually really interesting in a oral by oral history called blood of spain which is a lot of interviews with people on both sides. All the way through the hierarchy like carlos reques and anarchists and trade unionists communists. Peasants the description of of collectivization in in like cnt. Spain is really interesting talking about how they went about collectivizing agriculture in the south and then of course you got homage to catalonia by orwell that's a good one. The spanish cockpit carlos jr that's good all right. I think it's time to saddle up and ride off into the distance. Yeehaw getting a saddle up and ride get a dosey doe down the dusty trail howdy partners.
