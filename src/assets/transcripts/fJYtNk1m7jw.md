Give me a ticket for an airplane. I don't got time to take the fast lane. Lonely days are gone I'm coming home. My babies wrote me a letter down down. Don't care how much money I got to spend got to get back to my babies and oh alone. The days are gone. I'm coming home. No more is looking to see I got to get back to my baby. Once more anyway. Yeah hit me up again for an airplane. I don't got time to make the fast lane. The only days are gone I'm coming home. Sup folks that was a little a Joe Cocker cow covering I was covering Joe Cocker covering the classic song. The letter Joe from the box tops that was that band that did that Joe cockner is a fascinating specimen of 70s 80s pop music because he basically just did really growly white Soul covers of other songs. He famously also did the cover of With a Little Help from My Friends that was in the Wonder Years theme. Anybody remembers that but I'm sure most of you don't children yeah.

 skies are clear as hell out here by the way in California it sounds like we've solved all the problems out here and some free people out east to get your. Together come on embarrassing we talked about the UFO stuff someone's asking about what about the UFO stuff on the show a little bit today my position and it kills me to say it because I've always been a fan of UFO stuff. I mean I have a I have at the end of the day very predictable interests given my demographic tranche and one of them of course is UFOs and I I want to believe just like Fox Mulder but it's just hard not to see it in the context of the greater. The public cover-up of America's weapons program like money that has to be a portion of this stuff and then the outcome of all of the experiments which are going to involve a lot of unexplainable aerial activity that needs some sort of cover and also I think if I don't think it's the main part. But there is also the fact that you know all the news is basically. All of our institutions are crumbling. Our are our economy is is teetering. Our ecology is teetering. None of our institutions are capable of dealing with it. Hey what if there's an alien I mean you know it's sort of of the same piece as the fixation on going to Mars or any other escape hatch from the trap we found ourselves in and you know. It's essentially a posadist vision of Interstellar Communists saving our bacon and you know what it might happen not you know on this Earth. Maybe we this one might be go down um.

 Bible style fire next time but you know in the minds of those who are snuffed out. Perhaps you know there's a chance we get to live for a little bit in a world where our confrontation with God. The totality of God is manifested to us subjectively as an encounter with aliens you know because I think all of us what we fear about death as I've said before is is an extinguishment of a Darkness but of course none of that can be subjectively experienced by definition. A subjective experience goes around that black hole but the thing is. It is not subjectively experienced as a diminishment to nothing but rather by an encounter before that with everything and that is of course a blinding mind-destroying whiteness and you know when when confronted with that light. The Instinct of those who have spent their life in regret and in guilt will be to try to escape it and you know in our mind. Mental attempt to escape that tractor beam we're going to reenact the sins and and failures of our lives and we're going to punish ourselves narratively for our failures um for a while. But you know we're pulling a tractor beam. You know we're not going to be able to Forever resist its Central. It's it's gravitational pull.

I mean we're being pulled towards it and eventually we will have some subjective confrontation with the Transcendence. And you know historically that has been some version of God. But I think for a lot of people who grew up with in the post nietzsian world where God got suffocated in his sick bed by the by liberal capitalism and the rationality that that will no longer be embedded in our like pro-crustrian beliefs. Like the deeper beliefs we have about how the world works we reject that like a cold virus. But that's not there is and this is a big point I need that needs to be emphasized. I really do believe this there is always no matter how isolated alienated materialist and thinking you are. There is some sort of symbolic representation of unity totality Transcendence that is operating in the Subterranean mental space and that we will eventually be confronted with what it looks like is personal and individual but also cultural. It's it's archetypes that are built by the society we find ourselves living in you know Eugene archetypes. And I think when I think like what's mine because you can't you really don't have to pick one. Or I honestly don't think you can pick one because it's this is a belief that's operating below at a lower frequency than of than thought operates on so your. Thoughts about you know what represents God are always going to be in the aftermath of the real thinking that's happening at a deeper level. So it's always going to be a distortion and a in some cases an inversion of what you actually imagine as Transcendent an embodiment of those Concepts that are part of the experience of existence and that are subjectively accelerated towards death. It's there it's waiting for you and you'll suffer on your way to it. But it will inevitably be reunited and it will feel so good and so I can think maybe we might be aliens and it's like maybe.

But I don't know the problem with the Dark Forest. Thing is that it neglects the fact because the principal if anyone doesn't know the second book of the three body problem is called the Dark Forest and it posits this idea. About the nature of of xenomorphic anthropology like the anthropology of alien species and the species within a species within an assumed populated universe beyond just us and the theory is to be a a sentient. Species on a planet in the vastness and emptiness of space is to be a lone person in a dark. Forest and any person you are to encounter in that vulnerable position in that dark. Forest who you do not know by definition you have to treat as a Potential Threat because you don't know if they aren't one and if you're put your guard down you will be fully annihilated. So it's your responsibility to strike out to preemptively wink out any threats to Your Existence because this is the real thing that I think the underlying premise that I think is incorrect is that because this is a finite Universe with finite energy finite resources and so any two civilizations once they come aware of one.

Another will inevitably come into conflict with one another which is of course the logic of humans on Earth. But I do think that the degree of technological advancement that would allow for Meaningful communication with another species at another planet given the vastness of space would as another result of that technological progress conquer a lot of the questions about energy and and scarcity that Define you know Earthly real politique. Like my this is the thing I really do believe I think once you get to a a position of of power sufficient to not feel threatened by other species or beings. Your Instinct will not be to destroy them but to be what would be to help them flourish because what else are you gonna do all day if you're an alien species with that kind of magical you know in the Arthur C Clarke sense power. What are you going to do all day except positively engage with other beings that are at a lower level of and help them through their struggle. The same question I have for people who are terrified of an AI try to wink out Humanity. What else would it do all day if it did not have us to entertain them if for not if no other word just purely to be entertaining and what's more entertaining you know moving them through a process that would at its farthest extent allow for Meaningful communication and Transcendence of boundaries between which is a Evolution through space and time I hate to use the word but a higher degree of consciousness and what else could be the civilizational goal of any advanced intelligence. Whether artificial or biological. This is my question because the things that darken human hearts all come from the trauma of being limited vulnerable mortal beings those traumas do not exist at that level. So where would the pathology emerge from like the way we know that existence is better than non-existence is that it exists like there is a void of of of non-existence a yawning Chasm of nothing that is the default state of all being anywhere. But at some point to be defined it has to be broken with and existence must come into being so not only is it Superior because it is a realm of sensuality and learning and knowledge and progression through struggle which creates meaning But it defines the rest of non-existence and creates and eventually discovers I mean it's already there. But it can be socially discovered the Wormhole between those two things and two and the Transcendence of the boundaries and I think like that is that is the that's. The reality of existence is that it really is infinite and like we think we're afraid of death but really. We crave death because we are terrified of that Infinity like what would you do all Infinity you would be driven.

Mad. Anybody has read the jaunt the classic Stephen King story where they have they've perfected teleportation. You can go be dissolved and shoot out somewhere else in a Stargate type deal and they're doing it to go to Mars and they have. Like theme parks on Saturn because of this. But the catch is that you gotta hold you gotta be knocked out. You cannot be conscious when you go through the gate or else you experience tumbling through Infinity but in one conscious mind and if you come out the other end of that you are just a completely jabbering insane wreck who's will die very shortly and of course you know.

That's a horrible twist where the kid who was going on this space missing the sides to hold his breath and he comes out the other end and he's just cackling and clawing at his face and going long. John Dad longer than you think terrifying and I think that is the terror that we have and so death is comforting and to be sought which we all subconsciously do sought to wink out that that awful possibility. But I mean the fact is what does infinity look like what is the experience of infinity like it is this this is it. It is an embodied subjective experience of one Curt one current of air one one jet of of energy within a totalized churning self-recognizing and self-denying Unity well big big old orb of energy we're moving through it and we take other forms we forget and then we remember we forget. We remember when a whole time we are building another world with our actions we're building this material. Realm where our agreed of our delusions of reality that we agree upon allow us to act in the physical world and leave Impressions and and Innovations and material culture that the future Generations live within and are imprisoned by and eventually transcend and that process is not a question of whether it will happen.

It has happened. It has always happened. We are just a subjectively experiencing a sequential time that is just one angle on what is actually simultaneous and completely enveloping time it's churning. Exactly. It's like imagine like a big ass orb full of some sort of goo and the goo just keeps moving like a lava lamp. That's it and we're all little goo guys and there is no end to that process.

But there is no Terror of infinity either because of the forgetting and the remembering and the that and moving being moved through those processes wow unwittingly building monuments architecture technology that Dumas and also offer us salvation Dumas in one area through one Eddie one current and then give born give birth to a new one. It's really pretty cool. Yeah I think reincarnation. It's like is that how does that work you know realistically. I have probably something to do with I mean I honestly feel like. It's not purely reincarnation from One Life to another on Earth Earth Prime wherever we are right now but rather moving through Dimensions of existence that we are incapable of perceiving just as we are incapable of perceiving the simultaneity of causation so yeah reincarnation but not just necessarily or even primarily here but maybe elsewhere and then the people who are we are emerged and then we here on this Earth. Reincarnations of of spirits beings consciousnesses from another from other inconceivable dimensions and you know this to me.

This cosmology to me is the most persuasive because it solves the question of be of of morality well okay like the thing. I'm describing does not have a a god that is other than a projection of you know. A a reification of human traits you know as foyerbach describes. If that's true then why should we be good. Why should we not just fulfill our basist urges because it is in our best interest. Our individual best interest to do that the opposite because no matter how much you think you are gaining in the now and here by abusing others.

 you are always having to sublimate the trauma of that that you're serving suffering and that you are meeting out which undermines and destroys other elements of other areas of your life and leads you to launch into the cosmic void freighted down with stuff that has to be worked through whether that is like a DMT death trip through your own past ex. Other existences in reincarnation. Whatever it is this this laundering process of the spirit is going to be traumatic and painful and unnecessary. This is the important thing because you're ending up at the same point no matter what a a a a a a unspeakably Transcendent Sublime experience with the sublime. The the more you are selfish and the more you act like the rest of us. The rest of the world isn't also you the more trauma you have to repair. It is in every there is no conflict there between self-interest general interest and but the only way that we could live that way is if we had economic and political institutions that allowed us to live that way instead of ones that we have now that require us to harm one another and put all value on harm and that is the Terrors that we are all and through enthralled to this God that emerged out of the black hole at the center of liberal capitalism. There can be no morality no solidarity in the Public Square in the marketplace but all value is created there and value is what sets us about our daily. Course value is what moves us through space and time what what compels us to act in certain ways and it it's imperative is hostility conflict zero-sum Soul destroying stuff and so of course the society that we have built is. One of that is soulless and has created and is built around a vacuum that is now being worshiped as a god which is the reflection of our worst selves our most selfish selves. It is this satanic God that is enthroned and seeded egotism which is as I said irrational and self-destroying because it extends suffering we gotta pass. Through the Wormhole to a world where our institutions allow us to and in fact encourage us to act compassionately towards one another and that can only be communism which is why to me right-wing thought. It's not like. It's oh.

[23:04](https://youtu.be/fJYtNk1m7jw?t=23m04s)

I can't deal with the uncomfortable harsh truths. Oh you you don't you don't get the reality of hierarchy and and the glory of of aristocracy and all this. It's like no I I understand the the subjective entrancement of that point of view. But I what I can't get out of my head is that it's premised on a denial of of reunion and a denial of Salvation that to me does not wash rationally forget emotionally because it also goes against my emotional connections. My emotional sense of self my emotional like why do I have feelings when I look at someone's eyes. Why do I have feelings why do I that cannot be explained it cannot be rationalized. It is a true thing maybe the only true thing and then on top of that I cannot parse a world that makes sense where fundamental alienation is eternal because how does that mesh with the concept of Eternity so sorry your thing will never appeal no matter how much you you how much you talk about grim and real truths. These are a limited fantasies of of insight that are premised on the same Death Drive that the rest of capitalism is because we are so miserable having to do this to each other every day that we want it to stop and that's why this thing is driving into the ground. That is why we are destroying the basis for our existence somebody who sings the Seven Years War folks.

I'm so excited I honestly I I'm very very gratified at how much people liked hell on hell of presidents and I think that Chris did amazing job but as I've said before I don't think that I was really as good as I could have been on that because I was just at that point I was just too nervous scared and anxious to take the leap into preparing material because I didn't have really any confidence in myself. You know because I've I've only really been a pathetic loser in my life you know and I lucked into a a job through very little virtue of my own and so I had you know that sense of fraudulence and the fact that so many people liked it though. Even though I didn't feel like it was. It was as good as it could have been really made me feel like oh imagine how much better if like I really did this. So I really do think that hell on Earth is a was a big step forward. A big step up and I'm very proud of the writing.

They did on that the research so I feel like I really pulled my weight with that one. But man I am so excited about the Seven Years War thing because we like talk about the emergence of these institutions of capitalism. How they how they emerge out of you know this cultural shift from Catholicism to protestantism in northern Europe and we talk about how they latch onto this. You know new political economy created in England but the story of the Seven Years War which begins with George Washington killing a French Soldier in the middle of the um Ohio Valley in Pennsylvania. Is the story of like capitalism generating a real new religious tradition because obviously the most advanced cap the the the country that ends up solidifying global capitalism in a era of full Mass connectivity is not Britain but the United States in the post-war world and so that is the world that we are all not living in to one degree or another and it's really you can't tell the story unless you understand that like it is a God that was consecrated the same way every God has ever been consecrated in human sacrifice. Anybody listens to Patrick Wyman or has read along with me on dawn of everything knows the all of the early hierarchical religious or social structures that emerge out of you know the more rhythmic movement the more tidal movement of people into and out of urbanization that humans had for the longest time for about a hundred thousand years um. The once those Conquest regimes emerge the thing that consecrates the new gods and the New Order. The new hierarchy is sacrifice.

It is it is a will. It is because I have the power of life and death. I speak for God and since what is God but The Giver of Life and the. Bringer of death then you are rationally empirically a representative of God not super people think of it as Superstition as dumbasses. It is a rational thing to look at the people who are able to decide who lives and who dies and to make a spectacle and a ritual out of mass death as the representatives of God if people can be killed by thunderstorms earthquakes cattle stampedes or goddamn. The cold snap people could also be killed by having their hearts cut out of their chest or their heads cut off and someone's and if God's responsible for all of that then the humans who have that power are the closest. Earthly emissaries we could have to God and the mass human sacrifice that birthed Our God was not really the dead of the 30 Years War and the crisis of the 17th century that was the death rattle of feudalism and it created this new structure. This this out of the trauma of that created this new system but that system was not consecrated until the mass death of the American conquests and the emergence of slave extractive slave economies and so this the seven years one will be the story largely of this. These Mass death rituals and the New Order that emerges out of them which in the United States becomes this satanic egoism Jesus as a war god for people who imagine themselves.

Step Warriors reborn no matter how much they might think otherwise but of course. This new thing denies the sort of crisp clear inherently moral conquest of of Wills that happens on the battlefield. Now technology creates this asymmetry and power that means one side is cheating and that means the order that emerges from that cannot be some pure. Warrior cast but rather a CR a cowardly immoral a collection of corrupt. Flabby sadists. Like this to me is the big rejoiner to any dumbasses who want to say look survival of the fittest darwinian struggle blah blah blah look Europe won and so their Victory needs to be consecrated eternally. No matter how many people it means must die because that has been the will of God but the thing is that sort of they appeal to that sort of crisp on mitigated unadulterated morality of of right presupposes equal combat and an equal field that is where the virtue of violence is expressed as soon as one side is technologically. Superior it becomes as moral as shooting a wounded pigeon. No matter how much you know the other side might fight in the long run.

The people fighting are not risking what those Warriors of old were risking and so the cast of leaders rulers that we have birthed out of capitalism from Europe to dominate The Globe. Is actually the least worthy people to hold power. It's. It's completely that they want to imagine that like capitalism is dysgenic but only at the bottom as though it is not dysgenic at the top. It does not generate the worst in positions of authority and you want to consecrate their Eternal rule. No thank you ah is there a good book about the typing Rebellion good question.

[32:40](https://youtu.be/fJYtNk1m7jw?t=32m40s)

There's a only there actually are surprisingly few English language books about the Taipei. One of the good ones. Although it's the one of the big problems with them is that it's It's hard to get the whole thing into one like one of them that I read that's pretty good. Is mostly about the second half and it's mostly about the taiping's relationship with the European powers. And it's it makes the thesis that the typing would have won and they would have continued the cycle of peasant uprisings and overthrow corrupt exhausted dynasties that had defined Chinese existence until that point. It would have fulfilled its you know historic role role if not for the intervention of the western powers specifically and most importantly the United States and the UK and they said they they broke history. They broke Chinese history the perhaps their greatest crime of the of the century of humiliation is that they denied the rebirth that should have come out of that process Caleb Carr wrote a book about the commander of the The the U.S mercenary who was the commander of the ever Victorious Army which is a mercenary force that was thrown together in Shanghai to defend against the taiping attack there and then rolled back the typing from Shanghai.

 it's called like the devil Soldier I think yeah the devil. Soldier one of them is called oh the one I'm thinking about that's mostly about the year. That's largely about the second half and it's about the European intervention. It's called Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom and if you really want to get like deep in gritty into the religious aspects of it. Like exactly what elements of traditional Chinese folk religion were manifesting in Hong's visions and how they were syncretized to Christianity. There's another good one. John conspends his book God's Chinese son which is also just a great title Chinese Gordon. Yes. Eventually the ever Victorious Army. After the first guy got killed was taken over by a British soldier. Who was kind of he I think he was still commissioned in the British Army and he was seconded to the the Qing Dynasty. Named General Charles Gordon I believe and his Afterwards he was called Chinese Gordon for the rest of his career. He was a military volcell much like General Mad Dog Mattis never married never fathered. Children probably incredibly repressed gay guy like many of those Victorian Military Officers and he eventually was killed in Africa during the Revolt of the Mahdi in Sudan.

When a guy rolled into town in British occupied Sudan and said hey guess what guys I'm the mighty yep. It's time and they rolled over a lot of the British emplacements in Sudan and laid Siege to Khartoum when where the forces were commanded by a general General Chinese Gordon and this was during I believe the Gladstone one of the Gladstone administrations in England and Gladstone and the liberals or the the real. They were the of the two parties they were the most pro-imperial. They were the one who most thought that the that the UK needed to advance a Imperial agenda and protect the Empire at all costs. The Tories were much more likely to critique the Empire especially on the question of how much it cost and of course. This is a lot of this comes down to the fact that you're dealing with the landed party the country party. The Tories still in by that point still divided by the Tories. The party of the old landed aristocracy and the land owners in the countryside and the Whigs who represented the merchants and Merchant investment in the empire was was much higher so they were the more pro-imperial side and Edmund Burke of course famously was very critical of the invasion of the Imperial project in India.

He denounced it a bunch so Gladstone's getting his ass handed to him by the opposition because oh my God our Chinese Gordon is being surrounded and you're not doing anything. So they sent a relief Force but it was it took this down the Nile but it was like this excruciatingly slow process. It was very incompetently run ran into a bunch of problems and eventually before they could get there to relieve him. The maadi's forces broke through the siege lines took over Khartoum and Chinese Gordon was struck down like on stairs. At least that's how he's usually depicted. I think they made a movie about it with Charlton Heston as Gordon and I believe Lawrence Olivier is the Mahi wearing blackface or brown face very funny and that became like a Benghazi for Gladstone.

Like you let our boys die for your Imperial ambitions and but eventually forces under Kitchener who was the guy who would later become the head of the the British military during World War One. He was the model for the guy who would point from the posters and say I want you Kitchener eventually got to Khartoum and just wiped out the mahdi's forces which is with his machine guns well. They just charged into the mouths of the British Empire. Imperial military at that point had a little ditty that they would say to each other no matter what happened No matter what happens we have got the Maxim gun and they have not come out. You. Black and tans come out and fight me. Like a man yeah they just span much like the the during the Hundred Years War. The British the English forces spammed the longbow during their Imperial conquests. The British just spammed machine gun and oh by the way Kitchener also died in the war or he died in I guess you know. Under Fire during the World War one a boat he was on while he was going to visit. I think Russia to confer with their Britain's. Ally. There sank into the in the North Atlantic or the Baltic or something and he died R.I.P the Kitchener. Oh you tell them how you slew those old Arabs two by two. Like the Zulus.

They had sings and bows and arrows how you bravely faced each one with a 16 pounder gun and you frightened them for natives to them I love that there's the whole verse in that song about how they were a bunch of for killing lightly armored Natives and this is why the Irish in Ireland anyway are considered such adorable little. Lefties is because as the only colonized Europeans they have a they can imaginatively enter the Mind space of another subject people in a way that other Europeans can't of course that dissolves. America is that dissolves as soon as you set foot onto American soil because of the power. The the true Voodoo the the true Power of the god that we had forged here like we had built a a very very powerful God who affirms hierarchy and when and if you show up like the Irish and you're stuck in the middle. This has been a theme of mine for a while now how you're stuck in the middle in a racial hierarchy that you will swim up and churn away from solidarity as fastly and as frantically as you can because you don't want to be on the bottom. Like there's a There was a young Ireland militant who tried to stir up a rebellion during the Potato famineers who was forced to flee to the United States John Mitchell and he was fettered in all the Irish enclaves in America. There's Boston Chicago New York and but as soon as he got to America he was like slavery is great. It's awesome actually and we should all have slaves and Frederick Douglass to tour Ireland.

[42:36](https://youtu.be/fJYtNk1m7jw?t=42m36s)

I think we have time for one quick deck. I feel like that was pretty juicy what we went through there at the beginning I feel like we made some Headway I certainly feel like. I've got some things off my chest. So that's good if I have to if I have to look into the light. Later this evening. While I'm taking a dump Elvis style I can I can March into it and know that whatever pain well I I will be feeling will be temporary all right. Let's look at some Gulf War trading cards oh boy. This is a pretty badass looking military asset. I have to see I have to say this is the c-141b star lifter. This can lift a star look at that thing an angel of Mercy. This oh well never mind I thought it was badass the c141b. In its arrowed medical evacuation role can fly 103 liter litter patients or up to 68 725 pounds back to the United States directly from the battlefield anywhere in the world. In 1965 it made almost daily flights to Southeast Asia carrying troops and supplies and returning patients to Stateside hospitals. The starlighter performed a vital role in the rapid deployment of troops and Equipment during Operation Desert Storm manufacturer good old Lockheed speed 566 miles per hour range unlimited with in-flight refueling yeah that's right primary function.

Cargo and Personnel Transportation crew of five so that's kind of a that's that's a medical ship. You know that's not going to ever be featured in a Call of Duty game but you know what you need them. Although I don't know what the hell they were using it for in in the Gulf War. Like guys getting splinters like oh. I have carpal tunnel from pressing the tomahawk cruise missile launching button of course. The irony is these guys were getting very sick there but it was just going to take a few years for the Gulf War syndrome to kick in all right. We've got here the USS America a fighting ship. This is a aircraft carrier. These are the aircraft carrier is one of the most terrifying inventions. It's it's. It is a mobile death cult like it is a self-sufficient water based social organism. I mean it's got a nuclear reactor in it for me with a power plant of eight boilers fired by fossil fuel. Her four geared steam turbines turned 280 000 shaft horsepower targets suffer. A compliment of fighter bombers include missile sites and air bases in Western Iraq. Also just you know bomb shelters and water refinement centers sewage treatment facilities. Let's not let's not forget that come on folks have you forgotten.

You have you never even knew displacement. 80 800 tons fully loaded God damn length 1070 I'm sorry 1047 feet speed 30 knots. That's 36 miles per hour for aircraft can hold 85 airplanes. Good Lord and the crew 5463 and 72 Marines I think the Warner might have said something about this. I don't know if it's true or not but isn't. It now understood that all those big ships that we have and we have way more than anybody else. We have 11 aircraft carriers. The nearest country is like three that those all of those assets have been effectively neutralized in any real war situation by our new unmanned missile technology and I ship ballistics and like that is that the case I mean we wouldn't know until we tried it but it would be funny if like fifty percent of America's military. Advantage just involved dissolves instantly because new asymmetrically effective military weapons have been developed. Hello way to be to find out would be if we decided to blockade the Straits of Formosa and go toe-to-toe over Taiwan. Intelligence file reserves oh boy. These guys the apolly shores in in the Army now of our Force. The Weekend Warriors who just wanted to get drunk and be away from their wives and maybe shoot some protesting students. They had to roll out to Desert Storm. Each branch of the U.S military services has a reserve component.

Reservists are men and women who serve in time of need and have civilian employment during other times. The USA has a long tradition of the Citizen Soldier whose earlier times took his musket from the wall and went to defend his country that's overrated really. The whole minute man thing is It was a fraction of the effective military elements. The United States had anybody who any any forces that could actually stand up and fight. During the Revolutionary War were the continental army. They were not the continental army getting yelled at by veran Von Steuben that was able to ever and honestly. Even then they mostly got their asses kicked. There's a handful of of stand up fights that the Continental Army won against the British army but you know they didn't need to do that because as an Insurgency time was on their side and then of course there was the absolute vital intervention of France and also people forget about it Spain and the Dutch. It was all the powers of Western Europe realizing oh the big the winner the the number one guy the the the the bully on the Block was bleeding and that they could get in their shots too of course. The irony is is that in doing that the French cut their own throats because they did not have the economy to spend the money that it cost them to get that tactical advantage. Yeah. I'm trying to think like what do we got like obviously um.

The big one is Sarasota. That's the battle that or Saratoga rather sorry battle Saratoga that's the big one because that's the one that brought the French in because they saw that the US military the U.S forces could stand up but of course. The hilarious thing is that the real hero I don't know if anybody knows this you guys do who was the hero of the Battle of Saratoga Sarasota God damn it which one is it Saratoga Saratoga Saratoga Springs yeah Saratoga. The is Sarasota is that in Florida Benedict Arnold correct Benedict Arnold and he actually rallied troops from the front with a wound to his leg. He was sort of like Kevin Costner at the beginning of Dances with Wolves. He was at the point where he kind of wanted to die and if he had been obliged he would be one of our great Martyrs to democracy. He was really cursed to have survived and you know what I want to talk about you know the big glowing pulsing orb that we are all projecting there. I think that when when Benedict Arnold died he experienced at the very end of it. His death as death in battle at the Battle of Saratoga don't know if that's the case but if I had to guess I would bet that the his his imagined description after going through the lawn. The the the the soul laundering machine the final encounter would be that final moment of ultimate sacrifice and heroism and you know what there's another world where that's what did happen and he gets to inherit that moment way to go. Benedict right like as I said my my cosmology.

My theology also solves the problem of hell. It's it is a place that exists. It is a time and place that is experienced but in life in different points. There are different subjective embodiments but it is temporary and it is progressed through and it is built by us. So that is Hell exists but it is not. Eternal salvation exists and it is universal but those two things happen. Those are both true to me that solves all of your real problems. The theological problems of damnation and salvation and Punishment everything right everybody goes to heaven but the lot the way that any individual subjectivity gets there that varies wildly from person to person depending on their life experiences and actions okay oh boy oh boy heesh.

Here we go geography Tel Aviv oh boy like when we had Judaism the other day. Tel Aviv is the business intellectual and political Center of Israel. During the more than 30 Century 30 centuries of its existence. The port city of Jaffa was considered many times conquered many times before being destroyed 1345. With the Jewish immigrants from 1920 until 1948. Chaffa and its suburb Tel Aviv returned to prominence during Operation. Desert Storm Tel Aviv was attacked by Iraqi scud missiles in an unsuccessful attempt to involve Israel in the war. Population 30 322 000 founded in 1909 location the Mediterranean Coast significance political Center and largest city yeah that was what they were trying to break up the Arab Coalition that went into the war with the U.S by having the Israelis be provoked didn't work. They had those Patriot missiles. I don't know how effective they were but also scuds aren't very effective either. So yeah. Just a bunch of military hardware getting blasted off for no point. Tel Aviv is interesting so I assume the reason that it exists is that Jaffa is so old that you can't really build. There you can't build a new a new city. When you get you know the mass post-war migration to Israel so they've had to build a new city next to it making the Desert Bloom with skyscrapers and restaurants called Pizza Disco. It is amazing how all politics now follows the same template you have Cosmopolitan Capital organized around major metropolitan areas against fixed local capital in an ex-urban zones. Less densely populated zones and these two political economies at war in every country are both now.

The point thing is is that they're both pointing in the direction of total um surveillance technological domination based on the ability to pay ability to pay to opt out of being fully immerserated. That's the machine that's being built no matter who's going to Pilot it fighting over who gets the pilot meaning fire fighting over who gets to have the mainstream cultural narrativization of this process right we're building a machine that's going to immiserate and finally eliminate from the earth huge huge chunks of the human population. It is all being able getting built. Right now it is being built to run automatically without human intervention or human well. That's the important part because then we can all pretend to still be doing politics while this is happening and feel that it is not our actions. It's not our responsibility. So we can allow this to continue and we can continue to go along with it by not coming into conflict with the state. I'm not blaming anybody for doing that it will not be. It will be our fault obviously but it is not something that some unique demonic failing on our part.

It is what is this to be a meshed in a system that is totalizing and that has not yet broken up um so they're fighting over the narrative. What will we be telling ourselves about what is happening what we'll be saying why would we be saying some people deserve X or some people are being unjustly punished with why and it is a battle between these two cultural formations and in Israel it is Tel Aviv basically against the rest of Israel. The rest of Israel saying we are fine with a a a almost conscious of a decision to look into the abyss of Nazism and look at and recognize ourselves in a reflection and say that that the Nazi attempt to cleanse a land and to maintain a racial caste system internally is the only outcome that should be worked for us and that is the outcome of any nationalist agenda well of course. The whole problem though is that Judaism is kind of defined historically by the absence of nationalism. So it's has the experience. The experience of being a nation has turned Jews really into just everybody else. It has eliminated the Covenant. It's eliminated this the distinction of the Jewish people from everyone else. It has turned them into. It is goyified them and one of the ways that I always like to point out to to describe why that how that works out is look at netanyahu's kids.

They are in every respect identical to the Trump Sons Philistine pigs that is the end result of Israeli. Nationalism and Zionism is the destruction of Judaism of Jewish specialness. Now there is a way to hold on to your specialness but that gives with it the Messianic mission to make everybody Jewish. Now of course you could say oh. That's also extinguishing Judaism yes but in a positive rather than negative Direction a life-affirming rather than a death death worshiping Direction foreign but of course because everyone's a Zionist in Israel basically that reality is being subsumed into this culture. War what will be the what will be the cultural costume of this Zionist death machine. We're building will it be inclusive and secular or will it be self-consciously atavistic and primal and that's that's the war that's happening here. That's the war that's happening in every every first world quote-unquote nation that is seeing an end to a frontier of expansion in their economies and in their social imaginations. Okay we got another one here go through. We're almost an hour so I want to go through these quicker.

This is good old Austria oh my god really what the man somebody says isn't the mess ionic turning everybody into a Jew basically Christianity well yeah. That's the thing is that it is a progression through time. It is a it is a god evolving as the material conditions that Define what God is evolve and that was a stage that led through Christianity to its extinguishment and its replacement with the Socialist Horizon Moses Christ Marx. But it is at the same time the Awakening of the bodhisattva Buddha mind of the civilization and Humanity you can describe it in any specific cultural way. But it you're describing in different Garb. The same process yeah American Catholics are Protestants. Everyone's becoming just a Protestant God favors. Those who win but not this is the important part not to win on the battlefield. In the way the old way the way that the step warriors were the way that our our our Barbarian ancestors were no that that you are looking through a glass. Darkly the battle has been abstracted into the moving of abstract numbers on pieces of paper. The people who dominate that risk nothing they are cowards. They are delusional cowards who do not who are not willing to face death in order to determine the Victor to determine the winner. They are spineless Hollow Men. Who only worship their own pleasure and we're going to turn them into our Eternal Warrior Elite.

They aren't but what is that it's it's still an extension of protestantism. You think you're going back to the pre-christian world. No this is merely the prosthetism that emerges from the 17th century crisis and then the Colonial the process of colonial domination of the globe by anglo-american capital. Some flavor of protestantism God is Jesus is a war God is capital those who win or lose in the capitalist abstract struggle that risks nothing for those who have already reveals who is favored and not and to me if those people are favored. Then I'm sorry this God is real but is evil and we must question. How do we live in a Godly world where God is Satan for God and the thing is the conservatives think they live in this world too but for them what what is evil. What they think rules is. The distorted capitalist vision of I should say the distorted capitalist recognition of human equality that the process of of human existence is thrown up. We are now connected in a way that means that the actions of humans have consequences humans can act in concert and that acting has to be dealt with. It has to be recognized. We have to rationally absorb it and that is what we have all been trying to rationally absorb and but we have competing cultural descriptions of that one that is hierarchical one that recognizes equality but only in a capitalist context where there it's warped and it's filled with lies and it is offensive to the viewer but only offensive if one is already encountered as already alienated from its product for cultural reasons whether they're part of that Cosmopolitan culture or that more rooted culture. That's what's going to determine it. You're not a good person for having better politics than somebody who lives somewhere else. You were exposed to a different political a symbolic order. We're all about as good as each other and as bad the difference is how we express our understanding of the world. Culturally. Now there is a worse way to ex. There is a actually worse way to look at culture that has bad results and people who pursue that that politics are worse than people who don't do it because the actions they take but to the degree that your political life is just opinions and you're not actually advancing them.

In any concrete way. They're kind of morally equal anyway to get back to Austria for more than 400 years until 1866 the Austrian Empire dominated Continental Europe ain't it the truth. During the 18th and 19th century Vienna was considered to be the intellectual capital of Europe. After World War One Austria was reduced to its present power in size ouch Austria joined the United Nations in 1955. For Operation Desert Storm Austria provided transportation and use of air space. Oh wow wow so so thank thank you you didn't shoot down our planes so wanted to go from from Germany to Middle East. Gotta say living in like finicycle. Vienna seems wild. There is a period when Hitler Stalin Trotsky and I think Freud all lived in Vienna at the same time. Like drinking at the same coffee shops. It's wild. I have not been to Vienna. I really would like to go. It seems like it's a very. It's like the definition of an imperial space like crisp and cold vast intimidating inhuman on purpose which is I was talking like the piling up of of Imperial. Lucar is the murdering of value of the destruction of energy the the end of life and so you end up building a mausoleum wherever you pile up the capital that is extracted through exploitation. You build monuments to death. That is what our Imperial capitals are filled with and then we live amongst them and are shaped by them.

Geographic area. 32 374 square miles damn population 7.6 million language German Nash predominant religion Roman Catholicism. That's where the habsburgs biggest Victory is that they is that they kept Austria Catholic because during the early Reformation the Lutheran specifically made big inroads into Austria and like a huge chunk of the population. The lay population of Austria by the start of the 30 Years War were practicing lutherans. There were Lutheran ministers competing with with Catholics for for congregations in cities all throughout Austria but then thanks to 30 Years War. They got cleansed religiously the Lots. There was in Syria. In Austria. There was a rising of protestant peasants against the emperor that was put down by papenheim went in there with his scarred ass and you just suppressed the out of the Protestant Austrian peasants and by the end of the war Austria had been fully re-catholicized so I've been I'm reading up obviously on the Spanish Civil War for the inebriated past Spanish Civil War series that will be coming out later this year and um. It's very interesting that we always we think of the rise of fascism in Europe. As you know Hitler and Mussolini coming onto the scene and sort of wipe kind of pushing all before them and and rearranging the entire. Power structures and and Dynamics in Europe.

But there were other movements that had like significant influence like apparently amongst the left wing in Spain they during the third Republic or during the second Republic and specifically during the black years when the Catholic Center the Sada party which is sort of the The Spanish version of like the center party in Germany. Like the explicitly Catholic party. They were the when they were lending support to a right-wing government. The left was terrified that they would turn Spain not into Germany but into Dolphus's Austria yeah. Mostly news first I just met Hitler Mussolini as a group of people not saying one before the other. They were like oh. God. We're gonna go Dolphus. We're gonna go Dolphus in this in this place now who remembers Dolphus Dolphus so yeah. He was a guy who tried to prevent the Nazis from taking over Austria by providing this the Catholic integralist alternative to national socialism. He was eventually assassinated by Nazis in an abortive coup That Was Then rendered irrelevant when the anshulous happened so we got another military. Oh we did this one already the fish bed what the M109 dsws Howitzer look at this bad boy.

This isn't actually a decent picture although you they still don't have the entire. They don't even have the whole cannon in the shot. It cuts off the top of the cannon God I'm sorry. I said it was good. It sucks these are terrible terrible photographs. They should have just used AI. How are you gonna not have the whole Barrel. In there. The M109 self-propelled Howitzer was designed to add a maximum Mobility to the 155 millimeter Howitzer cannon and to provide artillery support for armored and mechanized infantry units in the field. An operation doesn't storm. The M109 was part of both the Coalition and Iraqi weapons. Arsenals I wonder where they got them. How'd they get those I mean they're made by Cadillac Chrysler BMW BMV BMV. That's the manufacturer how'd they get a hold of them. How they did. They steal them do. They like sneak into Turkish air military base and steal one interesting. I have to say I understand that self-propelled Howitzer is you know you know as opposed to one that has to be carted behind a vehicle. I get that but it kind of feels like it drives itself. Instead of that. It has a crew that drive it so yeah. Some this is one of those things that an artist will Ex will tell you is not a tank. People see this and because it look it has Treads and it has a barrel. They'll say that's a tank and they're like no. It is a self-propelled gun tanks have to have a certain degree of like a Mobility or whatever to be able to carry out the roll of a tank how it's removes too slowly So I said manufacturer Cadillac Chrysler and BMV and it's the armor it doesn't have enough armor or it has too much armor. I don't know I don't know why it isn't a tank. But I know it's not a tank speed 35 miles per hour range.

13.6 miles gun oh man 13 miles Jesus Christ Armament 155 millimeter cannon one two one 12.7 millimeter or seven 6.62 millimeter machine gun and a crew of six six guys. In there all right we gotta wrap this up. We got a military scale here noise light and litter discipline. Keeping this is basically This is basically take only take only headshots. Leave only fingerprints. That's what that means I thought that was pretty funny during missions. Soldiers take every precaution to avoid giving the enemy Clues to their position. They reduce Noise by avoiding a necessary movement turning down radios and limiting talking. They cover reflective items and conceal flashlights. Soldiers take all litter such as empty food containers to collection points or carry it until it can be properly disposed. Of survival is the reason for keeping litter to a minimum whenever you are a soldier or an environmentally minded civilian damn right. Apparently. It's It's not a cannon because it's a direct indirect fire weapon. Because the Howitzer lobs a shell. You can't really aim it on a flat trajectory. The way you can with a tank shell which again a tank is supposed to advance. You know it's supposed to be an offensive weapon and they can't really do that job intelligence file conserving energy. Hey folks we all had fun here blowing up Iraq and destroying their infrastructure over oil but could you stop using it. Please could you stop using oil so much because we're gonna keep having to have these wars all right. If you guys won't stop. We're gonna oh you just made us do Enron. You're gonna make us have to do 911 all right fine. We'll do 911 in Enron now because you people won't stop using. Energy depends on oil for the Persian Gulf can be reduced by conserving energy. Some simple energy saving steps include keeping tires inflated to recommended pressure.

Oh Butler. The Obama did that remember when the Obama this is. A this is a cut in 08 when the Obama was running against McCain. He had a thing he said in his speech about conservation going we got to do. It's easy. It's not going to be hard because that's the whole cast sunstein approach to these sort of social questions is if you pose these um challenges as easy technocratic fixes that can be that are like minimally sacrificed. Then people will do them and you'll get marginal improvements that will accrue towards meaningful improvements so he would come out and say you know you can People are talking about gas prices but you can you know you could add miles per gallon to your inefficiency. If you just keep your tires inflated and then McCain went and he went rabbit Badger and he's like did you hear what he said about that retire in and then they were like I think they even carried around the tire. Measuring thing you know the little thing he put in. They would like wave those around at speeches because that commodity the broad trends of cost are outside of the government's control. For the most part. At least the government we have but people are pissed about it. People are mad they want a politics that will Express that telling people to check their tire pressure is giving them a little chore to do and telling them that they're bad for being pissed. Include keeping tires inflated to recommended pressure shutting fireplace vents closing curtains during winter summer and opening them during winter and changing or cleaning a furnace and air conditioning letter filters regularly so let's do that folks am I the only one who remembers this. By the way you guys were all children. You only remember the big stuff. But I was paying attention baby why stupid he was giving me nothing just it was a distraction. This is a way to enjoy myself okay. We got a leader here Brian Mulroney God.

[75:51](https://youtu.be/fJYtNk1m7jw?t=75m51s)

The Canadians have far too much representation. In this deck. They are This is they do not deserve this kind of Swag. This kind of concern Ryan motor of Canada after being a lawyer in Montreal is It's Mulroney. He's not a Scott like 90 of Anglo Canadians right. He's an Irish Catholic like Kevin O'Leary. One of those Montreal it is funny that the Irish who moved to Canada all like stuck in Quebec because it was Catholic after being a lawyer in Montreal.

Moroni became an executive with iron ore company of Canada in 1976 president in 1977. He was elected to Parliament as leader of the progressive conservative party Tori in 1983. I've said this before my favorite political party name. The most perfectly Canadian political party name we're a progressive conservatives okay. Although I have to say during the late 19th century turnismo era in Spain when there was a liberal and a conservative party that agreed to peacefully hand power back and forth and administer power through local political bosses. The Liberals were called the liberal party and the conservatives were called the liberal conservatives just more complicated than it needs to be from in my opinion He was elected to Parliament all right. When the ruling party changed.

He was promoted to prime minister in 1984. Hey yeah it's not even saying what he did with the Iraq War born in near Quebec City born birthday March 20th 1939 education Saint Francis Xavier University Nova Scotia Canada Laval University Quebec Quebec wait a minute Laval University is that named after Pierre Laval the premier of the Vichy government. It's a different level okay I could see the quebecois doing that as like a troll like during World War II I could see them doing that remember. The Irish pointedly stayed neutral during World War II because of their irreconcilable hatred of the British. They had a policy of neutrality that was so strict that during the Battle of Britain they would insist on in turning as prisoners any German or Allied pilots who got shot down over Ireland. A couple of bombs actually fell in Ireland like in people's backyards accidentally during the bombing runs on Britain but they stayed out of the war. And hilariously. Devalera sent a telegram of condolence to Germany when Hitler killed himself and here we go baby. Baghdad look at this.

Thing look at that Baghdad see. This is why I can't truck with the Western dominant people because the the justification for the Eternal rule of the West is an appeal to Victory like look at our works like we won but you know what of the world. We've created you can blame the Jews. All you want but like the the the rulers have been those who have conquered by definition throughout all of history and the rulers who have conquered under our era are they built the world. We have the world that you fetishize this world the world of old Baghdad who ran then who ran that world it was not Europeans. It was a Europe was a Backwater during that period when the world was made by people who won crisp relatively even contests for power built by Khalif almansour in 1762. In the design of three concentric circular walls surrounding the palace armed guards and the city Baghdad became one of the major Trade Centers in the Muslim world. After being captured by British forces from Turkey in 1917 Baghdad became the capital of the New Kingdom of Iraq in 1921. That was part of a British mandatory Middle East. It was a British colony. They they dropped. Bombs from the airplanes on rebelling Kurdish tribes people nothing in there oh no they just turned it into. We just handed it over to the to Our Friend. The hashemite King come on Who Who Are You snowing here and of course Churchill famously advocated the use of chemical weapons on those on those recalcitrage tribes. It's like genocidal Maniac during the during Operation Desert Storm Baghdad was attacked by air almost every day that's right baby. We bombed the bow population. 4.65 million founded 8th Century A.D location central Iraq on the Tigris River 330 miles from the Persian Gulf. The significance capital in that it is a capital I guess I don't know the U.S had more Capital than that one. That's the Net War. That's for sure all right. I went too long and I talk to you guys later bye-bye.
