I still remember that terrible day on the broad stain the sand and the water and how in that hell what we called sulfur bay. We were butchered like lambs of the slaughter. Johnny turkey was ready primed himself well. He showered us with bullets and he rained us for shell and then five minutes flat. He blown us all to hell nearly blew us right back to australia got some sun coming through the window here probably look weird maybe. I should go against here so it's less weird looking. What's that is that better not on the toilet as some have said must stipulate that wow so shit's popping off huh holy mackerel man. I knew they were going to take it hard but I have to admit.

I thought that once the cops shut up they backed down but then we saw it happen and that's the thing to remember about this. The cops let them in that's the important thing. This is not. A this is not what a situation where some force just uh proved too powerful for the state uh where where where the the mechanisms of power were were somehow over awed by human concentrated human effort. Now they let him in and why they let him in is probably a variety of factors a lot of it probably just being that because these are people that cops are not trained to dehumanize. They treated them like human beings and so you can't treat people like human beings. If you're going to really dis dissuade them from doing something they want to do like if you really want. Some people stop a bunch of very angry people from doing something they want to do you have to disabuse them of it with violence and you have to be willing to do that and they weren't willing to do it. That's one explanation and that's I think probably on a micro level part of it uh. But I think also you know there's the idea that the cops are essentially also rioting. They're not happy.

That trump lost either so them letting them in is sort of their way of of of contributing to the demonstration and that to signaling their unhappiness and then of course you can go full tin foil hat and say well. They did it so that this could happen because I have to say if I was the deep state whatever you want to define that as if I was like the the elements within our government that are seeking to maintain uh the current system uh and are most aware of what that entails as opposed to being ideologically entrapped by their own. Like trump people are something like this is ideal you have an incident here that has disciplined both sides perfectly because for anyone on the left. The specter of this will be the thing that prevents it from ever being the time to say anything bad about any democrat in office because any show of vulnerability will repeat will lead to these people just taking taking power and also it disciplines against even asking for too much because do you want to do you really want them to go wild which if we did something too big they would do biden is going to get to point to these guys anytime. There's any big ask for progressive legislation sure do you want these guys go do you really want to test them and also I've said before that.

We're going to see a intensification of surveillance and police authority to deal with you know the continuing admiseration. I mean crime is going up as we said as I as people said at the beginning of this crime was going to go back up and it's up. It's happening all over the country crime's up. It's going to get worse because things keep getting worse and the dissatisfaction is going to get bigger and some of it is going to actually be pointed somewhere towards the people responsible for this and the state's going to be very interested in uh creating a narrative that allows for uh a the culture at large to go along with massive uh increases in surveillance and police power and the specter of a mega. Uh coup is absolutely just a perfect uh a bloody shirt to wave whenever you want uh whenever you're you're announcing the next you know round of uh of of panopticon surveillance overwhelming everything in the world what the hell is going on. I'm getting something on this. What is that sub gift or use bits to get to the next level am. I the only one seeing this. The hell is that very distracting and you know the right gets to uh. They get to they get if they keep pushing. They get to find out the limits of their uh ability to get what they want and the majority will still be pissed and still be uh activated.

But we'll have bet have learned you know where the line is uh. But the ones who aren't are gonna go off there's gonna be a good burst of stochastic violence 100 and every one of those incidents is going to be used. The same way that uh  they wanted to do so. Honestly. Like this is such a perfect thing and the funny thing is is you can write a story where this is just the byproduct of of the culture that we have of a of a society. What is going on with. This does anyone know what's going on everyone's talking and I'm very confused as to what is happening with these levels uh. I'm trying to ignore them. Uh it's very distracting okay. Here someone said american years of lead honestly yes but anyway uh you've created a society of spectacle where politics where like the stakes of politics are grafted onto pure entertainment and we give politics the same passion. We give to entertainment a country where the only time we generally riot is after our team wins or loses a big game. If you give big game intensity to politics.

This is gonna happen you could write the story where this is just a byproduct of that and then just coincidentally. It's the one thing that will be most gift wrapped and perfect for the use of our actual ruling class to maintain their dominance over us just like you could argue that 911 was the un inevitable result of our foreign policy and our our pursuit of oil dominance through ideological uh guerrilla warfare. But you could also write a story where the reason this keeps happening in the same direction and that all these dominoes keep falling the same way is because there's some hands out there pushing them in that direction and uh for me. It's a moot point because the the reality is the same either way and honestly. The the recipe is the same the boring no matter how outlandish or banal you want to make your uh explanation of reality. The the remedy is is very boringly uh straightforward organizing the working class or rather the work working class organizing itself rediscovering itself awakening from its slumber that's the only thing that's going to beat this no matter where it's coming from no matter who you think is in charge and also how seriously you take it like to me. There's no more annoying and by now conversation than the one that has been had ever since trump uh uh lost about how seriously we should take. This is this re is this a serious.


It is this a coup is this a real serious thing and and it it's such a stupid argument because it never really it's nobody wants to make an argument about what they think is going to happen. It has to be couched in well. It's bad and you should feel bad about it and to that. I say hey let me accept every premise of every hysteric on the internet who says that this is the beginning of a fascist coup. What the  do you want me to do about it and the answer seems to be feel anxious about it. Feeling anxiety is literally. The feeling of anxiety is is like the emotional cattle prod that they strap to our nuts every day of our. Compliant neoliberal subjects our anxiety is the is the the cultural manifestation of the coercive mechanisms of control and you want me to feel more anxiety about something. I can't do anything about because let's say this is phase one and tomorrow. The joint chiefs come up and say that because of the overwhelming demands of the american people we are blocking the further uh uh certification of the votes. What the  are you gonna do about it. I am asking what are you gonna do about it.

Everyone is saying this is a big deal. We should care about this uh everyone who ever said this wasn't a coup needs to be accountable. Okay congratulations you're taking this moment where democracy dies to  computer. That's the thing the proof is in the pudding for me. If you're still posting about this stuff and you think it's a coup. Then you don't really you're lying to yourself and everybody else and if it is a coup and everyone who said it isn't is wrong. Well guess what come get me come. Come make me accountable for being wrong where are you going to do that in the camps if there's not going to be camps. Then what are you going to do if you're saying it'll basically just be the same thing and you're going to keep posting well. Then why the hell have you put so much of your emotion behind this thing that clearly doesn't matter and can't affect anything.

I think the only interesting thing to see is how much the republican party coalesces around a position of re. Uh of denunciation of their own supporters here how much do they go to war with with the base because this had to happen the republican party had to discipline their base at some point. Now that's what's so frustrating about the republican party. They have the correct attitude and uh approach to their uh base and that is they are terrified of them and do whatever they want. But the thing is is that the base because the republicans all they want is the stupidest. On earth specifically it cannot be stressed enough that this is all happening this unprecedented attack on our nation's electoral integrity and on the constitutional order and the peaceful transfer of power is happening on behalf of a  game show host and nothing else. There is no there's no thing these people are after they want trump that is what god has gotten them to break through the doors and I would argue the reason they're allowed to do. This is because all they want is trump if they wanted something more than trump if they wanted something that could actually challenge established power and could actually energize a group of people beyond those those who have basically brainwashed themselves with television basically poor. Cable news none of you no like if they're rebellion.

I'm sorry but unless you are brainwashed. It's not going to happen. Now they could take over the party depending on how this thing hole breaks down but they're not there yet like if people have said like if this was a left-wing protest that never would have happened and it's not necessarily because they're bigger. It's because they would have been met with much harsher force much more significant pushback from authority which would have made most of them realize do. I really want to get my head caved in today and say no and then they'd stop and they'd go home and only the hardest core would stay to fight the cops. What you had here was at no point did. These guys get anything other than a few haphazardly sprayed mists of of pepper spray and as soon as they realized oh pepper spray's not that bad and then nothing else was gonna happen and they were literally opening the  donald trump for the personal fixing.


The personal uh just the the personal ego trip of an insane man just a a a a psychic identification with the point of view. Essentially they've taken celebrity culture to its ultimate conclusion. This is essentially the end of day of the locust by nathaniel west if anyone has read that book where the downtrodden uh star struck losers of hollywood burned the whole place down well. They're burning down washington on behalf of their their appointed god king uh because because in this country that that's the only thing that can stir passions no one believes anything can change. No one really thinks that things can get better or different in this country. They think that we are on a trajectory that is set by human nature or god or the constitution and there's nothing to be done about it and in that world. The only thing that's going to be able to reliably politically mobilize. People is going to be a purely spectacular politics of of oregon release and that is what trump has given us and now the thing is is that because it has a limited appeal but it is so totalizing in its appeal. We have a situation where the system has no longer has use for trump or trumpism. It got like the republican party got what it wanted. It got tax cuts uh and it got a federal judiciary in their pocket for the next hundred years up to and including an unbreakable 6-3 majority in the supreme court. They got what they wanted now. It's just about his personal ego and the whole point of a political party is that you go beyond the personal desires of any one person within the structure.

Like that's. The that's the old kingly model and like that sort of brain dead populism will create a royal figure. It has to because it cannot it's it's a rejection of politics. It rejects the notion that anything is being negotiated. It's totalizing and so only a totalizing vision is going to get people to  fight like that at least fight. Uh at least risk that but once again that's the only thing it's not because they're stronger or smarter or more or more brave. It's because the state will allow that it will allow those but the thing is. It's a tantrum and eventually they have to let the tantrum uh uh go out like essentially. That's how those uh democratic uh democratic governors and mayors especially this last summer during the george floyd uprising that's how they treated their base essentially by saying they're there and they just let them tucker themselves out and that's what we're doing here. It's just bigger and more dramatic and what's going farther because it's a bunch of  white men mostly demanding that trump be allowed to be president forever. He's not. They're not challenging any of state prerogatives. They're not challenging any mechanisms of power. They don't represent any movement beyond their own uh fandom. Basically. It's essentially a con out of control like that's essentially comic con on uh on crack right. Now in dc. It's freaking comic-con on crack and that's why they're allowed to do it.

But they're also gonna have to tucker themselves out. Most of them will go home but a few of them are gonna get violent and they're gonna be encouraged to get more violent uh by the results they saw and guess what that's to everybody's advantage too that's good for democrats. Every piece of violence by a republican gets to be a political weapon and gets to justify further repression and gets to call for the repression uh uh black social us like we get to call that justice for black lives because it's now disproportionately going against white people. Like that's. That's the kind of demon demonic trick you could play with that so they're happy with it. Republicans are happy because they know that if it's ever really close if any election is really really close like this election wasn't really that close honestly. It was only the commitment of trump and and the the para reality is able to create around everything. He says that is then affirmed by people who listen to him. Uh it wasn't that close a real close race. They know they have it. They have it and every and every piece of right-wing violence further uh reinforces their command of the space in the event of a real political conflict that they could pull some.

Uh like the reconstruction governments of the 1880s and 90s ah so yeah. Uh it's wild it's wild and wacky stuff uh. It is very disparating to not just just think of how of how much harder it is to get anywhere near that kind of uh threat to just you know established patterns of power and behavior from the left but that's just because the they're actually serious when they go against the left. But a big part of it is is that there's no thing that gets people that gets enough people the way that trump does. And that's because it can't be because it's not spectacle because it's material reality. It has to be built from the ground up of articulating experience not being brought from the top down in the form of just  madison avenue brainwashing. That's the only thing that will do it. That's the only thing they'll do it and if it's and if this is just more neoliberalism with its janus face and it's it's pulling off like a soft internal gladio or it is the first uh the first winding of a gear that leads to a fascist seizure of power. Some sort of uh inside out auto coup where like the the protesters like meld with the police and then and then essentially just arrest democratic lawmakers and  beyond saying that I do think that joe biden will in fact be inaugurated although. I do think that inauguration day is going to be very interesting my guess. This is as far as I want to get is that it they bristle that place and that there's like essentially a military occupation of washington dc to prevent a reoccurrence would be my assumption.

I didn't say I moved to oregon what the hell is wrong with you people. I didn't say that weirdo. I'm not going to oregon what is wrong with you people. I'm being gaslit by these people. I did not say. I'm moving to oregon what the  it I try. I try to do a good stream for the people and then they go and troll me like this. I don't know why I put up with it honestly. I don't know why I put up with it. Okay so now that we've talked about that. Let's talk about we'll watch the numbers just drop here. Let's talk about our last section of the republic for which it stands chapters. I believe 9 through 12. Uh this is really good stuff this stuff and I want to go through them kind of chapter by chapter because there's a lot of good uh stuff to point out in here. Uh we start with hilariously the election of 1876 in which the disputed uh votes uh led to a constitutional crisis and a essentially a backroom deal between the democrats and republicans to allow the republicans to keep the presidency in exchange for the end of military occupation and reconstruction in the south and uh this is funny because ted cruz was trying to during his nerd ass attempt to co to toady to the trump supporters by calling for a calling for a commission to like rule on voter fraud that is him invoking the uh. This case. Because that's what they did. They ended up establishing a bipartisan commission where they basically just made a deal behind closed doors uh and then they there was a constitutional amendment that actually ended that possibility because they saw how bad it was so once again ted cruz being an oaf and a dope and a dumbass. But we knew that um so there was a lot of there wasn't a lot of violence around that election. There was like talk of mobilization of troops and stuff um. I think I guess george mcclellan. Like wanted to form a militia to march on washington to make tilden president.

He's like the michael flynn of 1876 but nobody slam nobody uh ransacked the white house I can say that so so that's how uh that's how things are going since then so then he talks about the uh the biggest eruption of coordinated working class mobile militancy until that point in american history. This great railroad strike of 1877 which saw the almost the the kind of painfully um uh symbolic uh site of troops being pulled out of the reconstruction south to abandon free people to the ravages of the clan and the red shirts to go and help put down the strike in the north uh and it was huge it was violent. It was not coordinated very well because it was largely spontaneous and there was only a rudimentary working-class political movement in america at that point. Like there was the working men's association there was the international like uh uh yeah. The working men's association was one. The knights of labor. It was it was still a very uh incoherent movement uh but they were all caught by surprise just like the all of the bickering parties in uh zaras. Russia were surprised by 1905. Like you had currents being developed but it took an event to bring about a reckoning in the in this case. It was the fact that this depression had uh pinched the profits of the railroad companies but they didn't want to stop giving dividends to stockholders because they were essentially running ponzi schemes and needed new investment income to keep themselves up so they had since profits were going down. The only place that they and competition was reducing profits also the only place they could get profits was what a shock labor costs by cutting by cutting wages and increasing hours at a time when everybody was suffering because of the depression and people just realized oh. This is where the line is and it came from no ideological battle really no not a lot of not a lot of posting it came from experience. The experience of working near a railroad uh being having the railroad dominate your life which was something that uh the western farmers could also commiserate on because they were held hostage by railroad uh freight rates that was the margin of whether or not they ate in the winter and the it was predictably defeated because it was no one was really planning it and the states eventually all agreed that oh yeah no this is what we're here for. This is why the state exists to suppress this sort of thing but it led to uh a lot of the railroads backing down because they found okay. This is the limit okay good to know uh so that was chapter nine uh chapter 10. He talks a lot about uh something that is very boring but important to understand uh 19th century politics which was uh civil service reform. It was the end of the spoils system and that ended up being one of the only real issues that divided the parties because they basically all agreed to the same laws fair politics to one degree or another and then they were voters were sorted by geography. If you were and also religion well no basically geography uh because if you were a catholic in america you were probably lived in a city and you were a laborer and you were a democrat. If you were a white southerner. You were a democrat. If you were a small holding protestant northerner which is the mean northerner. You were a republican if you were a black southerner. You were a republican.


Although that mattered less and less as reconstruction governments failed to be able to defend themselves. It's not a coup settle the  down. What do you want me to do just yell about how it's a coup does that help you. If it's a coup shouldn't you be out in the streets like with your fellow militiamen gathering your garrisons. You better have some. Uh you better have some garrisons to muster uh and the funny thing about civil service reform is. It's sold in history as this is the good guys the good the good uh moral politicians driving out the crooks well of course. Not. It's it's of course about bringing out the ability of working-class people to get any percentage of uh of economic growth because they were locked out of capital but they did have their votes which means they could pry something out of the machine. But private property regime is present on the notion that you can't do that. That was the thing that the constitution was designed to prevent um and the way that the  tammanies and and other machines were able to distribute jobs to catholics and then give them political power in exchange for it. No no that just simply isn't done and that is why where a lot of the anti-catholic sentiment of northern republicans came from uh and so the fight over uh civil service reform is really a fight over democracy in a way and the rational civil service that we eventually got does not is still influenced by money. It's still influenced by authority by outside of uh interest but they're purely monetary. It's purely capital. It's no longer anybody who is accountable to anyone you would call people who are not you know a concentrated economic interest.

The way the capital is and he also talks about another the other sort of the the the bad side of emerging. Working-class mobilization is anti-chinese sentiment in california because the chinese were seen as as essentially slave labor imported directly to compete with them and. Because of racism and racial division and cultural separation that makes it harder to get to a point of empathy that allows you to you know digest politics at that level uh it led to just a wholesale demonization of the chinese uh and that is the populist that's like the fate that's one that's one facet of the face of american populism is. It is a defense of labor free labor or for uh property from cop from un uh from unfree competition uh and it's something that the political parties had to deal with when um when balancing powers against one another. But as usual you know the real the real heart of the of the of the anti-chinese sentiment. It really did come from fear of being economically displaced. It could have been channeled elsewhere. It's just uh racism is so good. It's so useful that it's that chant political channels for it open up when it emerges. It's it's. It's facilitated. It's not. It's not uh uh challenged and uh undermined at every  point.

I wanted to get some other stuff in here talked about uh convict leasing and the return of servile labor in the south because if you aren't going to turn people into citizens if they can't be coerced by a common social milieu. Then they have to be externally forced and uh when you've got a high labor intensity crop system like like cotton in the south. The thing is predicated almost on on self-exploitation at least and uh they talk about the indian wars how there was just no uh. There's really nothing that the natives could really do to avoid getting their stuff just took because there was money to be made in it and uh there was always this kind of sad tragic like shrug of the shoulders about indian policy among all of the the good-hearted reformers and ex-abolitionists. It's like what are you gonna do you know what are you gonna do and the fact is that you know we were gonna unless something stopped us. We were gonna take it all because you only stop if someone stops you. That's that's that's the uncha checked imperial engine. Something has to stop you and that we couldn't be stopped because our our control of our domination of the landscape. Uh then in the last chapter. Uh he goes into the intellectual history stuff that I think is really strong in this book and a nice through line uh throughout it to you know kind of understand how all these you know social. All this social ferment is being turned into like political wisdom uh. He talks about this daniel. This dean howells guy and all this and he talks about how like as I said on the stream yesterday.

Uh you you're seeing this kunian shift uh in in the social sciences away from lazar fair social darwinism towards uh like progressive social policy and the social gospel to come with it out of the protestant tradition and uh one of the things that emerged from this ferment is an attempt to like recap reaffirm capitalism in the face of all of the evidence of its failures uh by making it just and one of those ideas was georgism which was uh created by an economist named henry george who was a classic american crank in the best tradition uh one of our better cranks. I think uh and he was a guy who uh saw the horrors of of the accumulating unfreedom and misery of america in the supposed land of total bounty. It's because we have taken land which is by definition common and given it to people and his. He basically diagnosed land ownership and specifically rent on un un improved land as the the stake in the heart of civilization as as where all uh unjustice flows and he does this by essentially redefining capital to exclude raw materials and land and why he does that is essentially so that everything can flow from that presumption. All of his stuff froze from that presumption and the thing is if you go for that assumption. He has a very persuasive case and he gained a lot of influence and power power uh.

They haven't gotten to it in the book yet. But he ran for mayor of uh new york on a fusion socialist ticket like a labor party ticket uh against a tammany hall stalwart and republican theodore roosevelt and uh but both george and roosevelt lost to the tammany hack which just goes to show that you know whatever ideas and charisma you got. It's still new york baby and somebody's got to pay the  garbage man uh and so his proposal was yes a single tax no tax on anything except land and that that would remove speculation from the economy and remove concentration. And it's a classic american bit of crankery where he's trying to follow an equation by essentially making up his own math because he wants to avoid the confrontation. He wants to avoid the reality of class conflict because he's an american. He doesn't see the necessity because in these big wide open spaces you can convince yourself that maybe we can all get along and the american expression of that. One of them is georgia's because the idea was love the the sheer reality of this pitch.

The sheer truth because essential argument is this is so obviously true that if enough people believe it we will act like it's true and that will make us do it and that will reduce all of the capital accumulation and it will be a non-violent war of ideas that is won over time through application of our minds and our passions and that's in opposition to the marxist notion that no now we're going to win because there will become a time where there is a pivotal confrontation between capital and labor and labor's superior numbers and organization will will make it win will win in the battle that and it is the numbers it is people motivated by shared material drive towards freedom that will move them towards victory. It will not be that are you eventually change people's minds. That's the idea is that you just have to convince them if enough people understand this both capitalists and workers will see the truth of it and will want to do it. No one will act against their economic self-interest and if they do they will not be enough of them to overall the the democracy of dollars and that is why I think that georgism is uh very much in a tradition that we now see with mmt now once again. Mmt is I think correct. In most of the things it claims to do but beyond that it seems to think that because this is true you can convince enough people of that and by convincing them we will act like it's true and therefore make capitalism humane without conflict. I think it's the same impulse that drove georgia's now that doesn't mean it isn't true or useful. I'm just saying that the messianic heart of it I think is the same as it is with the georgists. It's an idea that the truth of this is so undeniable that if enough people know it it will convert them as if ideas can in the main. I mean that began individual people in the main demographically go against material interests. They won't so that's henry george also did not like chinese people.


Oh this is one thing. I wanted to actually read. This is uh this I just to any any young nervous denizen of the internet uh. If any of this sounds familiar please. Let me know he's talking about this guy. Uh howells who was essentially uh. He's the kind of guy. We don't have anymore like a gore of a doll like a a public intellectual who like writes novels and reviews and stuff. I guess the closest thing we have now would be podcasters. Howell's agonized over the industrial united states that greeted him on his return from quite personal as well as intellectual and moral reasons in 1880. Howell's 16 year old daughter winnie vibrant charming attractive and the apple of her father's eye had fallen ill in a way so many gilded age women and men fell ill. She quite suddenly could not cross a room unaided.

She had to drop out of school when he became sick the same year that george miller beard published american nervousness american nervousness. He you could call it anxiety. Maybe. He created a new world new word neurasthenia to describe what he thought was a new phenomenon. Lack of nervous force and symptoms were baffling in various as a desire for excitement and stimulation coupled with fears that ranged from fears of being alone to fears of being afraid to fear of everything charlotte perkins. Gilman whose story the yellow wallpaper captured. The disease was also its victim consistent. She wrote in her autobiography of every painful sensation shame fear remorse a blind oppressive confusion utter weakness. A steady brain ache that fills the conscious mind with crowding image of distress the end and damning result. The end and defining result was the paralysis of the will that afflicted winnie.

The cause doctors agreed was modern life itself its barrage of information noise and distraction. Its luxuries and its constant demands in unmanned men and feminized women leaving both men and women over civilized nervous artificial weak and detached from real emotion and vital experience. The introspection of reform reformation protestantism once devoted to monitoring the soul and the chances of salvation had turned morbid and transmuted into mere self-obsession gilman noted the significant aspect of her own case. She was in effect allergic to the home although she loved her husband and child. She saw the stark fact that I was well while away and sick while at home. I don't know. I don't know if that rings any bells for anybody.

I don't know if that sounds like anyone you know or are but the one thing. I wanted to say about uh oh right and then we got the election of 1884 when the james g blaine the man from maine the symbol. One of the symbols of uh post-war corruption ran for president against uh grover the hangman of buffalo cleveland and uh it's important to note that the whole issue basically boiled down to corruption because blaine was crooked and uh essentially cleveland was more discreet so he wasn't but he was indiscrete sexually. He essentially admitted that he had fathered a child out of wedlock who he had paid for the education of which led to the campaign slogan of the republicans mama where's my paw. So it was this battle of like personal virtue versus public uh public virtue but nobody was disagreeing with any of the top label stuff everybody was for  uh strong money. Everybody was against strikes and working-class organization. Everybody was mildly anti-chinese uh and they were all essentially dragging their feet towards civil service reform. It was sort of accepted that by that point the garfield assassination really set the seal that okay this is going to happen and it took them a long time. They pulled that band-aid off real slow but it's because they had to you know create sync uh offload.


Uh escape vessels for everybody but then uh blaine was killed not by his corruption but most likely because he was accused of being in the same room with a protestant clergyman who said that the democratic party stood for rum romanism and rebellion which was not what uh the irish catholics of new york wanted to hear not that republicans ever did terribly well with the irish catholics. But there were a good number of them who could have been persuaded to vote for a new york could be persuaded to vote for an open-handed republican. A guy who was willing to you know uh was willing to grease the wheels but that didn't go over well because it reminded them oh yeah. Those  protestant square heads they hate us rum as in alcohol because because the good protestant northerners were temperance men it was the drunken posada germans and irish who drank romanism for the catholic church and then of course rebellion for the civil war which yes they had done and it is honestly kind of crazy that we let that party still exist after they did the civil war one of many things that probably should not have been allowed to have happened so. I think for next week. We're gonna read a good chunk because this goes very quickly. I'm not that worried about not having enough. We're gonna finish the second half of the second part so from dying for progress ah dying for progress chapter 13 to the poetry of a pound of steel chapter 18. And then I think next week we'll do the last part and that'll be it. So. I think we're seeing as we read the book.

You know the uh the machine the leviathan of capitalism sort of stitch itself together out of the pieces of the post-war. Uh uh ferment and the key thing was always bribery at the end of the day. It was bribery that was what set that's what set the terms for uh where where uh the government was seeking its actual uh agenda from where it's seeking its real um. Uh it's real validation not from voters but for people with money because people had money more than people had more money. People had more paper money after the civil war than they'd ever had before because the government had been throwing around money to build the war machine and that's what does it. This is an mmt thing and the mm tears are right the us. When the us has said hey we get need to make we need to build an economy like for a war like the civil war or world war. Ii we just do it. We just make the money up and then we then the economic activity follows from the money. They're 100 correct about that. That's how that works but where that money goes whose hand it goes into.

That is all that is not uh that is very much controlled. That's that the hands it's already in are the ones guiding it and they make sure that it accumulates to where it has always been and then the more they have the more they can buy. Things with. They were able to buy the continent from they were able to buy the continent from us because they've essentially been places where money and paper have been held in the process of building an industrial war economy and then a railroad economy after that. So if you imagine as I am an alternative civil war recon post-war era. The key thing is what what dominoes would have to fall to give to give electoral and political like self-actualization to the freed slaves as soon as possible uh at the urban working class and and northern smallholders. And I don't think it's impossible but man it'd be very unlikely but once again. It's not a either or a question. It's not a yes or no question. It's a deal where just a little bit more makes things a little better. Over time. You know and just moves things in one direction rather than another. I think it's there.

I've been thinking more about how. I would actually want to like structure a counter narrative of reconstruction and I was saying you know lincoln being assassinated. That'd be a good place to put it but honestly. I would want to move it a little bit earlier and it is just to start with benjamin butler uh who I talked about the uh. The conservative doe face democrat turned radical republican who was one of the first generals to free slaves that they encountered in occupying the south and occupied new orleans and became a radical republican legislator after the war wildly corrupt but also a genuine populist who became a greenback party candidate a successful governor and then a candidate for president. He was offered the vice presidential slot before they gave it to johnson and right there even if lincoln still dies uh in april of 1865 that could hugely affect things for the better but also what if butler's vice president and then you know butterfly wings fly because of that and then lincoln is not assassinated because it was a close run thing. He doesn't decide to go to the. It wait maybe maybe maybe. Benjamin. Butler shows up with like a keg and they decide to get drunk and then they don't go to the theater and then somebody from like the sarat house uh drops a dime on him and then they all get arrested and it's just a footnote in history but then I would imagine. I still think that to get anywhere good lincoln needs to die and be a martyr for america. But if he's a martyr in like 1866 or 1867 and then butler becomes president katie bar. The door all right so. I'm going to wrap up here in a second while we've been talking have.

They declared a mega government in washington have they seized the uh the constitution and started adding amendments about like buck hunting does everybody go home. What's going on are they still in the capitol building trump died oh my god. I could see them like dosing him honestly right now. I could see them heart attack gunning trump right now because you know they're actually like sitting him down. He had to give that  thing today where he said look. I know they stole it. I know it's outrageous. I know they literally just took your right to vote from you and shat all over it. We all know that's true but you got to go home. That's that's the that's why this thing has to break against the rocks. It cannot uh correct itself because trump cannot correct himself because for him to actually do something about this he would have to say look. I didn't actually win. I was wrong he would have to say that he cannot start with look. This is a stolen election but you should just accept that he can say that because it's all fantasy to him these people have taken it seriously and then I'm hearing that uh the vice president authorized uh the national guard. Not trump did they 25th amendment. His ass did he get did he get cooed are they sticking him in a  uh in like a back of a car like patrice lumumba. What's going on is he gonna get dm'd is he gonna get dm'd by the joint chiefs and mike pence is that going to happen is mike pence going to be our big min.

It was big man right who did the who did the 63 crew yeah man yeah big man. I was correct. I thought so. I know my vietnam. So they that they could did. They could that'd be very funny.


I heard he unfollowed trump and then re-followed him. I think we could say safely that might mike pence will not be the the repub the president. I mean. I think we all knew that mike pence and kamala harris are very similar in that they will never be president. Kamala harris's only hope is that bite dies in office and these guys don't die anymore. They've invented some sort of adrenochrome suppository that is like long-lasting. They will not die. Biden will be a gibbering skeleton at age 96 and he will still be alive so she he's not going to die in office. He's not going to resign. She's not going to win a primary and if she did get win a general she would get her.

Ass killed and then pence is the same way pence has zero chance to ever be president. He will be the traitor's traitor. He is going to be hounded for this honestly. It is pretty. It's pretty fitting because I could see a thing where pence becomes the people person that they hate more than any other person in the world we're way more than any democrat who they sort of at essentially level. They have to be like well. You won you know you always end up putting venting your your real rage on the person on your side who betrayed you. The the traitor is always hated more than the enemy so uh. I could see pence being the focus of their rage like a guy getting pipe bombs in the mail every other week and well. It's a tragic thing that's come to that if that occurs it's not necessarily. I don't know I mean parody in the game. It's it's it's chickens going home to roost. Honestly. It's more like pence's best chance as someone points out in the comments run as a democrat as the guy who stopped trump from doing a coup. How about that.

No no no. There's some predictions that I that are easy pence cannot be president that those ones aren't that hard. I gotta say man if the my pillow guy was a little more charismatic and if he had run for office yet. I don't know. I guess that he doesn't he could go straight for the my pillow guy it's just the thing about my pillow guy is that he doesn't have trump's charisma and that's a problem. He has the regular guy famous guy thing that they love like he is a famous person who they think of as themselves and that's what they really want but he doesn't have the the. He doesn't have the showmanship and that's my only that's why if only john taffer were more famous among the mega people it would be john taffer the guy's got. He's another reality show guy who's who  pops on tv. I mean. I saw him give a speech at an americans for prosperity convention.

This is one of the first things I did as a as a tweeter slash journalist me and brian quimby from street fight. This is before chapel started went to columbus ohio to see john taffer speak along with a bunch of the presidential candidates. Not trump but jeb was there bobby. Jindal was there um  a couple more losers but those two for sure uh and I remember. I saw. I saw jeb speak and wow nothing just stuffed shirt just absolute zero bobby jindal also pip squeak just imagining that those guys ever thought they were going to stand to trump is astounding but then. Tafra comes out and he just explodes on these people and he's essentially demands that they all swear a blood oath to defend small business because it is the lifeblood and heart of america and of course. Small business is the closest thing we have to the old small holding fantasy.

The yeoman fantasy that is the heart of american popular freedom praffer would be the perfect encapsulation of that he would be the perfect person to express that truth. Sadly he's too niche of a figure if bar rescue had been the biggest show on network television in the in the oughts. Then he we honestly had a chance and that's what makes this whole thing so difficult to even think about is that trumpism is going to splinter because there's no one to take the  torch from him. Don junior wants it but he can't do it maybe it'll be don jr. But if it's don junior it's going to be a much reduced trumpism because as I said at the beginning of the show we're going to see a confrontation that had to come between the party apparatus with its long-term goals and its commitment to the the standing system because it benefits capitalism uh and the wild lumpen uh id that has been indulged but never given.

But that's because they could be indulged. It can't be indulged anymore. The stock boys won't allow it to be indulged. Anymore play time is over so how does this break up happen. Uh that is the question and what you could see is in a very short period of time. The republican party taken over by an explicit ideologically committed trumpist faction that turns q into reality from the inside of the party but that will take time it's not going to happen overnight. It would take several election cycles but that would be the project or people get to kind of get over like bite becomes president and it's not as bad as they thought it would be and the comforts of their home and the distractions of their life and maybe hey maybe oh we got a vaccine. Now fuddruckers is open you know like maybe just maybe they start going home and the the fringe are left and they form their own party that becomes like this thorn in the side of america body politic. But but it's one that will be there for the prophet of both parties and both branches of the ruling elite. So it's not going anywhere but that'll be that'll be the contest. My hunch is that most of these people go home because like for right now it's just that they cannot psychically imagine a world where biden is president. But once it's here and their lives are the same. It's gonna take the wind out of some sales not everybody not anywhere close.


I think we're I mean if we had any question about whether there's going to be a rise in stochastic violence relative to uh related to politics. I think this should really throw that one out the window. I think that's going to happen for sure what degree it's going to be real and what degree. It is going to be literally coordinated with government agencies gladio style that might be the only real question but we are definitely lit. We are definitely living in interesting times which you're not supposed to do but what are you going to do about it. What are you going to do about it for god's sake. I just want to grow peace out you.
