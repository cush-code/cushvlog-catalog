Um I'm the type of guy who waxed the room around that pretty girl's eye where you knew that I'm around I hug them and I squeeze them. They were all the same. I hug him and I killed them cause them either all the same. They call me the one. There are. I'm the one I go round and round without a care and I'm as happy as a clown when I'm a two-fisted ride I'll go well yeah yeah. I'm gonna have a guy that likes to run around. I'm in live in one place. I roam from town to town. I'm the wanderer don't tell me the wanderer I roam around round round around around mommy. The wanderer did you know that there was a parody version of the wanderer about henry kissinger released as a novelty song by a band called foreign intrigue that is a fact a true and baffling fact and the voice. In the song he sounds like henry kissinger. He's got the accent and everything I remember distinctly. There's a there's a bit where he goes. I look for nbc. They pay their bills for me anyway absolutely baffling a completely different conception of popular culture that we can't really consider. Nowadays okay hi guys gals folks. I know it's been a while been a while.

I wanted to get back on here with you because. I wanted to get going on the next book because I think books are fun and I want to get going with another one and the one I have in mind is first class passengers on a sinking ship by richard lachman. R.i.p. We're doing another book by a dead guy I don't know but that that's how we've been doing it lately and the premise of the book is is this out how the internal conflict within american like within any imperial headquarters in a capital in a capitalist contract will eventually devolve into people trying to get the last bit of crime left in the current contemporary in the present configuration rather than cl. Cooperate to change the configuration to be more sustainable because that means undermining their power and they won't have it. They simply won't have it. They can't have it and it's not even a question of their material interest. It's deep psychology. It's identity if they are not in charge. If they are not dominant figures in a social hierarchy. They have no sense of identity so they will fight to the death to maintain this thing. That's killing them all right so.

I came on first to say we're doing it. Baby first class passengers on a second ship. I'll say first chapter first chapter for next week get into it. Soft eased into it like a bathtub so next week one chapter first class passengers on a sinking ship by richard lachman. I just said it for the love of god but so now with that done. I figured I could do a nice leisurely q a episode I swear to god. I will not take one question and talk about it for two hours again that was honestly kind of rude to give people the impression that there would be questions and answers and then for me to just rant about nazis and god for two hours. Somebody's asking about the holy roman empire podcast series and I could say that we've recorded the first four episodes um and I honestly think it's the best stuff. We've done in the podcast forum me and chris and it's for one thing. It's largely scripted. We talk throughout it and we have some really good conversations. But it the spine of it is is a script that we both wrote and This is like me actually writing something for the first time on any length and I'm excited. I'm very excited to see what people think because I feel very much like if they don't like it or do. I can stand behind it myself.

So I'll just see as martin luther allegedly but probably didn't say at the edict of worms here. I stand. I could do no other but yeah. I really feel like like. I'm very very gratified by what people thought about hell of residence but and I'm absolutely amazed by what chris did with hell of presidents. But I really feel like I kind of blew. It a little bit personally. I feel like I kind of choked on it. It was too big of a project. I didn't know how to start and I ended up reacting more than like really doing a good job my end of shaping it and I'm really glad the degree to which is good is the degree to which chris was able to corral me and get something out of it so like yeah But this time I'm happy I'm hoping to to feel proud of my contribution at least more proud than I was although I do have obviously stand by everything in there. I feel I just wish that I had planned it out a little bit better beforehand. I was just sort of frankly panicking at the prospect because it was this sort of quantum leap forward and effort posting. I guess you would say but it is going very well hope to have it started. Have it debut.

By the end of the year yeah see if hell of presidents have been one president a day. I think I think I could have done better there because the hardest part for me was just. Wrangling was periodization and and weaving in the biography to the to the broader structural stuff. because how do you do it. You know how do you stuff these guys into this bag and initially I wanted it to just be like under appreciated presidents people who had a lot of influence even though we don't remember them. People like henry people like polk van buren of course truman but it ended up to the point where we couldn't really contextualize those guys without talking about all the other guys. So it ended up being all of them. The one thing I am proud of from my end on that is that I feel like we really put a light on the crucial decades after the civil war which are the least studied and sort of debated and and remembered culturally.

But the most crucial like we really do not have a remaining vernacular culture around the birth of capitalism in america after the civil war what we have instead is the western tradition while capitalism is being forged in the eastern money vaults. There is this peripheral zone. This liminal space where people can escape capitalism for the moment and try to survive on its periphery and then you of course. Those are the stories we want to tell we don't want to tell the stories of the gloomy imposition of capital over the the the vitality and and individual will of people who were just being crushed by a machine. No we wanted to imagine them free. We imagine the cowboy who is a laborer who works for wage but has the blue sky on top of him and doesn't punch into a clock and is able to manage his specific day and that's why cowboy becomes the model and that's why the truck driver becomes the 70s echo of the model in the same era or in america later because it's this it's a capitalist relation that is freed from the specific regime of time control that is antithetical here's the crucial part antithetical to the american project free real estate means that americans will not feel free unless they feel in control of their time. At least that was the original notion and so what is the story of our enclosure and the end of our time control.

It's not the incredibly bloody labor disputes. If you want violence. If all you want is some bloodshed. You don't have to go out west my god the bloodshed in in the organization of the labor movement in the united states. In the late 19th century pets puts all of the european the eastern western european labor movement in shame. Not a single european country had anything like the sanguinary violence of our labor movement so that was happening but that story isn't told because it all ends the same way it ends with enclosure and destruction of the american self which we can't confront in our culture. That's why our culture is so schizophrenic and demented and just self-destructive. It cannot truly face its own condition in a punitive democracy so yeah. It's like we got. We got pioneers and cowboys and lawmen and bad men and and the other as a native to be subdued and then to be eventually regarded as as a human and and then the the year the liberal psycho analysis can go on top like think about that like think of the ledger main think of the the sleight of hand that happens there. You've got this reimagining of the late 1800s as this pageant of em of of colonial imposition and and pioneering when in reality it is the bringing into being of an unprecedented industrial behemoth that is able to knit together political power cultural authority technology in such a way that it could wield the resources of a continent for the first time under a relatively united state apparatus. What's happening in the in the periphery is essentially foregone. But it's there that all of our subjectivity rests and that's where we do all of our critical left-wing critique of culture. A culture created by and dictated by capital and this is what I think mark's missed but could not have known he was missing and therefore we can't really blame him for it. It is the ability of cultural production to evince a self-conscious energy in the creation of consciousness like. I think that mark's assumed that to a degree of course everyone is being birthed into a bourgeois world if they're bourgeois if they're subject to bourgeois labor social relations. But the technological apparatus of consumer society that that is emerges is essentially is essentially able to lobotomize huge percentages of the laboring working proletarian non-capitalist part of humanity and genuinely make it make it impossible for them to perceive their own material self-interest because of their deep visceral social integration into a spectaclized regime where they think they're participating in capitalism as a american but they're actually in a nerf zone. They're they're.

They have the bumper pool the bumper the bumpers are up in the bowling alley and that's because of the of what the empire does how the empire temporally and spatially fixes the problem of of too much exploitation in the center and that allows the cultural pathogens to do their work to condition generations of workers into one understanding of the world that cannot really and this is essentially the most third worldly settlers argument. The problem with all those arguments is that all of this is beside the point. They think that many of this matters you still have to organize at the center of the empire because that's where the gears and the levers and the buttons are you are you can't opt out of it. Regardless of this analysis that's the problem with any of these sweeping analytical frameworks for understanding why we didn't get socialism. In the 20th century you can put all of them together and they can all point to real issues. But none of them can act independently. Everybody at the end of the day imagines themselves at a metaphysical level to not be the sort of social subject. That marx was living among when he wrote capital all right. Let's not go off on an insane rant again. Let's have another question but the thing is I do blame settlers and I do blame mao's third worldism because the point of those things and the way that they are presented is to say there is nothing to be done but me cultivating my virtue over you. The disgusting america ken swine by having a refined politics around this analytical point like why are you supposed to read settlers other than decide that everybody is a organizing because that's remember if you're not if you're not reading settlers to organize then what the hell are you doing.

I think that we just have to strip ourselves of the comforting illusions that allow us to maintain this paralysis and of course. I'm indicted myself in this too as always. But that's like those are the ones that I kind of ritually denounce in my ever present moment of like self analysis like where am I resting my understanding of the world on a percep on a pedestal of self-interest narrow self-destructive self-interest and you know it sucks but you gotta do it. It's what if you get the purity in mind like. I do you gotta do it. It's like doing the rosary you have to work out your place in the world in such a way that you can sleep and it's like you really don't. It's kind of silly and selfish and and very egotistical to think that you know your actions really matter. But you know what else is supposed to matter and we are all brought up believing that we have to find out if we are of the elect like however we cloak it. It is this search for specialness this raising up out of a morass that characterizes the the The protestant drive towards self-actualization turning the self into god not submitting to god as a force greater than the self but rather suborning the concept of god into our greater ego of course. This is most obviously reflected in the mormon church which is the quintessence of this phenomenon within terminal western american protestantism because that european protestantism and catholicism are dead those aren't living faiths. It's there's just another names for the same terminal narcissism self-worship but in america that you know living. Protestantism is just a mystified religious and supernatural version of that egotism of that narcissistic self worship like they look across the ocean at each other. In horror. The sophisticated god is dead european and the and the hearty earnest wasp hillbilly. But they believe essentially the same thing that they are the sole consciousness in the universe.

Okay someone says seriously what hope for our is for children to escape. This well see that's the thing I think the expectation that you get to dictate the world. Your kid gets at the level people. Want that is a that is a fantasy like that is that is part of like the the the the compliment of like consumer assumptions that undergird our lives like we are responsible for our child's destiny in a meaningful sense and of course like in good times that allows you know otherwise anxious and unfulfilled suburban rich people to fret maddeningly about getting their kid into a good college but you know now. Everybody is fixated on this apocalyptic end point because they cannot sustain a belief in systems as they exist and that makes them now imagine instead well. How do I guarantee that my child will not suffer like a horrible fate in the hand of some sort of you know massive economic or ecological crisis and you can never ever imagine that you can exempt anyone from anything. In this life. You don't know you're not in charge. You are not in charge. Having children is an expression of like love. You know like the deepest sense and raising a child is a ritual of love.

What they have to deal with in the world is what we all have to deal with and we all have the same responsibility to let that love guide us and they can't guide us wrong no matter no matter if there is horror no matter if there is decline and horrify and and destruction every someone has to live through these times and there's no reason that you should assume it can't it that you get to opt out you know that we get to opt out like. I do appreciate the catholic like duty concept. But that's precisely why catholicism is a dead letter because most american catholics are just a variety of protestants. Their only duty is to themselves and they approach the religion as an opportunity to engage intellectually with their spirituality. The same way that they engage intellectually with their politics online through thought experiments and virtue signaling. So I i respect like duty-bound catholics like but you're like the guys playing near my god to thee on the titanic and you should accept that because anybody who's converting to catholicism at this point is just strictly in it for the or Oh you're gonna be a sufi. No. I will accept 12 or shia the shia of iran and then mainstream sunni. That's it nothing more esoteric than that because like oh oh you're a catholic now oh you just want to argue about lore and you and I argue about like with if the pope is epic or not so. This is just the 2020 election all over again. It's just a new vein you're just looking for a new vein on your arm and all the other ones are just collapsed. I know who am I to talk that's true. I'm trapped in this morass with everyone else and all I can do is see. Whatever other people are doing and say is that a good way to do it or a bad one and I see this and I say it doesn't seem good to me. It doesn't feel authentic but I don't know. I can't who am I to cast any judgments on anybody else. From the outside.

It just looks unpersuasive if because if you want to just keep scoring points it's too easy all right and you're talking about like what about catholicism among latinos. Catholicism is declining among latinos too in the united states and in all of latin america in favor of westernized americanized protestant evangelical pentecostal snake handling. That's what bolsonaro is. He's a snake snake handler even amlo in mexico. The populist leftist is an evangelical like more of a jimmy carter type of evangelical. I guess so either way I think catholicism in america is dissolving in the twin jaws of the of the of the solidly protestant american reproducing glass and of the of the the latino man zoroastrianism very fascinating how do you fumble the bag like that can somebody explain the zoroastrian bag fumble to me. Maybe the thing is the first one can't be it by definition I think that might be part of it. This is the type of situation where if you're first through the door you are just unable to manage the contradictions involved in creating this new reality ripping this hole in the america human psyche. I don't know much about amlo. I haven't been paying too much attention. I think he's mostly doing good. I think that the his party's new dominant status in mexican politics is good. I love the fact that he trolls america and I'm in favor of his nationalization projects. But I'm sure he's also the dog in many other ways as basically everybody is right now. Nobody's doing great not good bob somebody says it's not a bank bubble more like an annihilation in the face of the islamic contest well. Why wasn't it zoroastrianism that was leading the quan quest. Why didn't zoroastrianism sweep over the desert where we know from what happened with the muslims. It was just ready to catch fire well. There's your problem.

They weren't evangelical. You blew it and maybe once again. That's because the first one will not be evangelical. It doesn't have to be. It's only later after further developments and you get a judeo and then a christian tradition that somebody can come along and create a fighting faith that is able to assimilate the concept of modern politics rather than go to war with it and be parasitic on it. The way that christianity is you had to be born into it h well. There you go same thing with judaism like the first books of the the first religions of the book have to be limited in that way because it is knowledge that binds and knowledge can only be localized at this point but later you know once greater. the accrual of technology around imperial nodes like the romans and later byzantines you're creating a more developed subject. You create you've got you've got the spread of like literacy and expansion of trade routes just increased population in general and there's a new understanding that like you know to to that that that monotheism can be can sustain itself beyond the locality can sustain itself without a specific understanding of the word of course what manages this new reality. Though see this is the thing how are they able to sustain this new thing where oh we clearly don't understand we out clearly are not on the same page about what m ammad meant by x y and z we clearly have different understandings of what this means vastly different ones. Let's put a pin in that for now and conquer all these unbelievers and they used essentially free real estate to assert their creed. The same way we've created the secular american constitutional creed. The arabs began almost immediately a project of conquest that allowed for the division of spoils to make up for the fact that oh we're not really on the same page here and then of course.

Then you're at the mercy of the ups and downs of the market of crop rotations of cycles of weather and after a long enough time you can no longer manage contradictions and you have another civil. War you have another breakdown. It's the cycle that dominates everywhere until capitalism emerges and breaks. It breaks history breaks. The wheel of time stops the flow between and within states and and and ways of being and relationships to capital and production and metaphysical concepts. It becomes frozen in amber which is why I really want to do. This show about the 17th century crisis because one I think it's fascinating to actually see blow by blow what goes into capitalism emerging in response to the inability of dying feudalism to handle the contradictions of the moment but then also notice hey. We had this climate and economic crisis from this exhausted system that could not reform from within and this new thing emerged and humans continued and like yeah now we're in the terminal descent of this new system intersecting with another upsurge in environmental externalities. Undermining the fundamental dynamics that sustain the order and new things will emerge new structures will emerge as they did before so like oh how can I put my children up to this what to anything birth death. The apocalypse which is always happening it is only to be human to do that it is nothing you cannot be condemned for doing it.

No one would condemn you and I would argue your children will not condemn you you're imagining oh. I would condemn my parents. If this happened but remember you didn't have that experience. You had the experience with your parents that you actually had where you you know probably never were that close or if you are you've drifted apart as everyone does and under the the the the dark matter of capitalism pushing us against one another if you imagine if things were that much worse for you that you would see them in the same light oh my god. Why did you bring me into the world but like a child of crisis is one that you're going to grow is going to grow together with those who are living with it and struggling with them. I don't think anyone would say that they condemn anyone for making making life. Someone wants to know how do you convince people to rem maintain humanism because the lack of hope breeds apathy and the thing is not for long like. I think everybody has to get it out of their system. You know They have to deal with the reality. It's essentially an adult version of how when you're a kid you find out the sun's gonna blow up someday i. I did not really like the spike jones where the wild things are. I thought it was like oh adults putting their adult. On this kid's book come on man just let them have their own thing but the fact that like what triggers this kid freaking out and wanting to flee into the woods and hang out with james. Gandolfini is finding out in school that the sun will blow out one blow up one day and I know a lot of other people have said that that is for a modern kid that is like the the psychic cleaving because it like takes you out of paradise and it like introduces death and with it and and and all these questions that shape the rest of your understanding of the world around you for the rest of your life and so I thought that was a a a good observation.

The rest of it not so great but the thing is like you come to terms with it and your life is this process of coming to terms with it. But the thing that it's all rested on is yes. I will die but I have some control over what that means. I can plan into the future basically. I can invest in things that haven't yet happened. It can be worth it for me to delay gratification in the moment because it will pay off later on for that to be true. I have to have a certain baseline sense of belief that my material circumstances will maintain themselves and all of our grappling with consciousness and mortality happens in that context directing trying to direct the future trying to direct our ourselves and those we love to whatever we all decide is happiness or the good whatever social value we're we're tacking around. But this is a generation not the first ever but the first since we have created this stable western capitalist subject who cannot take for granted their continued existence under the conditions of their lives that if they keep following the rules they will keep getting the same results they've lost the faith. They have been told that no the sun's not going to blow up 8 billion years from now meaning. Oh that means everything's going to go away and death is final. No no. It's going to blow up in three weeks. It's going to no. I'm sorry. it's going to blow up in what is it now six years remember aoc. When she brought the they introduced a green new deal. The the scare concept was we have eight years or something to get on the right track okay the sun's gonna. Then the sun's gonna blow up in eight years and how are you supposed to manage that when the assumption that you have mastery over your life is the underlying premise of western individualism. The thing that makes all of our consumer choices meaningful to us. This is a first we are back to those people in the 17th century who by the way all even before the 30 years were started assumed they were in the last days assumed the world would be ending. They were either terrified of it or they were welcoming it because they thought god would bring kevin on earth but one way or another. It was over in their lifetime from martin luther on basically from the 1500 from 1500 which is afraid a thousand 500 years. Since the birth of christ freighted numbers in the book of daniel. You have the same sort of birth of of a fervor and a desire for religious reckoning changing material conditions at the at the thousandth anniversary and that was directed by the church and by the ruling authorities into the crusades. Now in the 17th century. They can't do that anymore because the turks have wiped them off the board and are in fact encroaching on europe where does it go.

It goes internally it goes in these new in this new confessional war that masks a a struggle for power among the elite the the elite of europe but yeah the catholic church responded to luther by saying you're writing these articles in german you are publishing the bible in german. do you have any idea what you're doing these. Rubes cannot understand this stuff. If you just give it to them. It will make them go insane and the thing is if you look at what happened in the next hundred or so years of european history. It is unarguable that the catholics were correct and that the laity of europe could not handle being their own pastors as luther wanted them to be. They couldn't handle it. They flew off into murderous fratricidal violence and then they created this new this new pagan god of capitalism to take the burden off of their shoulders anyone who wants to know about the reformation in broad strokes. I cannot recommend highly enough dear mid. Mccullough's the reformation. One of those great magisterial type books you know like sort of it's a it's the battle cry of freedom for the reformation and one thing. I really like about. It is that he's an old oxford don and he's like a he's like an ironic anglican like he. Basically he's a he's a christian who likes anglicanism because it's the ironic christian denomination like everybody understands it's kind of a joke. They're like winking the whole time. But it's also just it's got a very human. It's got a very um sympathetic voice. There's clear understanding that everybody involved is like struggling to understand the world in their own terms but of course you know on top of this. This is all happening on top of a huge violent churn of of material conflict. As the dynastic competition in early modern europe creates a unsustainable level of violence due to the technological multiplying forces of the military revolution. Oh you know we're going to talk about the solemn league in the covenant. The whole last episode of the of the of the series is about england. We're like okay so that's what europe how's our europe ended up in 1648. This new order is emerging this one's westphalian conception. This creates this is essentially the starting gun on a new framework for dynastic competition that had existed during the medieval and earlier periods. This is a new way of competing a new understanding of politics. A new secularization of state authority let's go who's going to win england and so then we'll just rewind and the last episode will be sort of like. Kaiser soze the reveal at the end of usual suspects when you see him walking away and his limp goes away. It's just like oh well. All these guys were doing this on the continent. These in their little shitty island were crafting this social bio war weapon the social. This social political economic bio weapon that was going to end up pouring out the brain stems of everyone on earth.

We are recording hinge points right now someone asked about hinge points. We've recorded three episodes of a new six season six episode season. I have to say we have guests this season and it's been a huge boost. I think these are honestly. All of these are better than last season. I know last season was so great wasn't it. We love the hinge points and yet now they're even better. They made it better folks. They brought in guests and they're talking about the questions they're having a good time yeah.

Danny will be there too why did the guy think he was jesus's brother. This is of course referring to the progenitor of the taiping heavenly kingdom. The guy who went crazy after failing his sats for the last time are now the second the last time and had went into a fugue state came out believing himself to have met god to met. God's bro son and have been told that he was god's younger brother and I think it's because the qing dynasty had reached its terminal decline in a condition of accelerating externalities because that mid six that mid 19th century. That's a doozy h from like 14 18 from 19 from 1840s until 1870. You've got this period of massive convulsive violence. of course. The american civil war is just a small part of it 20 million 30 million people dying in china and that is also a period of agricultural crisis of blight. You know and the at this point exhausted ching were unable to meet the challenges but nothing had emerged internally to challenge it yet the old religious structures. The old civic religions and virtues of confucianism and folk religion had basically all been totally taken over and instrumentalized by the qing dynasty. So there is no way to to articulate opposition to um to the empire. Now the only way left there were two ways left one was banditry. There was a huge amount of 

There were pirates river pirates and shore pirates and bandits who absolutely plagued the chinese hinterland and in many places constituted the nearest thing to actual governance because they controlled the actual territory and the routes and and the state couldn't penetrate there and a lot of those people were basically what later would get called social bandits who are bandits and criminals and who do rob travelers and stuff but also organize like a oppositional political framework outside of the control. The the center um and the other is religious secret societies now most of these are taoist. Some of them are dedicated to you know the older folk religions of china. Some are buddhist and that tradition is is long going and many revolts against imperial power have the cloaking of these institutions and in fact there is simultaneous to the rise of the taiping. There is a taoist I believe it's called the white lotus rebellion occurring and the taipei the early taiping are able to use the white lotus rebellion as sort of a cover to organize well. The government was busy trying to stop that out but like this young man like he wants a language to articulate his specialness in the face of his humbling and a way to articulate the foreignness.

The alienness of the the manchu who rule over china and to you know affirm himself and affirm traditional folk chinese religion and paradoxically the figure who's best able to do that is this western imported figure of jesus christ who is inherently a figure of millennial expectation wherever he appears and that is one of the contradictions at the heart of western christianity and it's because the roman empire had co-opted. It had co-opted a faith born out of oppression by the roman empire and then basically almost overnight turned it into the official imperial religion and that basically twisted the psyche of it. I mean nietzsche talks about this and it creates this like psychotic break within the minds of western christians and this new what nietzsche called the slave morality is born. But here's this figure of christ who has emerged from the foreign world which had also just humbled china remember.

This is the exact same time of the opium war the first opium war when england just hides the chinese navy to essentially force them to accept pallets of opium to strictly to improve the balance of trade between china and england pure absolutely bloodless capitalist um logic. we really don't talk enough and emphasize enough and I don't know if you even could the monstrous reptilian nature of the roman of the 19th century british empire. it is I mean it is in every respect of successful nazism nazism before mass politics basically which is why you know. It has such a lower death count in europe which is why we remember it so relatively fondly so you know the chinese authorities already lost the mandate of heaven to these europeans by having to submit to them and admit in all this opium that destroyed communities and destroyed lives and give over these ports to turn them into dens of sin and western degradation. They as surely as any emperor in the past that lost the mandate of heaven maybe. The god of these europeans you know can be used and what they what he he did not. This is what's interesting about the the theology of taiping is that he was really not trying to christianize china. He was not trying to convert them to christianity. A lot of his early europeans and american supporters thought that's what he was doing but the reason he was able to gain such success in the hinterland.

Among like unlettered haka laborers and peasants is that he said I am god's younger brother. He had the impetus of this this powerful figure that they had maybe heard about from the western missionaries and he tells me that the manchu have imposed have perverted the teachings of confucius to turn the han chinese away from the worship of the one true god the chinese godhead who who who dominated like the pagan pantheon of pre-imperial china the confucianism basically got put on top of and put on top of for the direct purpose of maintaining the imperial state and so this is a like a cultural critique of like religions function in a given social mode but of course you know because the language wasn't really accident to do class analysis. They made it into an ethnic thing because the qing dynasty were not han chinese. They were a they were a nomadic turkic tribe similar to the the the mongols and and the tamarinds and then the taters that entire band of civilization that really organizes china towards empire from the beginning because the threat of horse invasion is what keeps china such a massive polity for such a long time because internal divisions are essentially impossible to maintain given the the constant threat europe is safe from other than like fitful mongol incursions that can't be sustained and the hun who at the end of the day are not able to extend themselves that much farther than the hungarian step and so that's why europe after the fall of rome stays these medium-sized powers that all fight each other until capitalism emerges among them.

It's it's a carcinogenic environment that leads to the creation almost inevitably of a tumor. So these taters had been brought in by the failing ming dynasty which collapsed in the mid 17th century. The same time that these 30 years war is happening for the same reason. The little ice age is destroying the agricultural basis not only of european late feudalism but also chinese imperial rule and so the ming was the the mandate of heaven. A local postal worker leads a successful bandit revolt that marches into the capital and takes over the forbidden city which has been another feature of imperial politics going back to the beginning of the creation of the chinese state. There is this cyclical process by which once an empire has been examinated of strength at the top. If a ecological catastrophe happens some rebel will emerge to claim power and start a new dynasty and that is what would have happened except for the fact that as the ming were falling a ming general who commanded a pass by the top of the great wall allowed a group of manchu an army of manchu 30 000 strong to come across the border so that they could jointly defeat this upstart and they are they're able to defeat this guy. This guy who's he's going to start the new dynasty and like two weeks later he's turfed and dead but of course. At that point the manchu have no reason to stop and they begin the great work of conquering all of china and it takes them decades and it kills millions and millions of people and there's resurgences of ming support. But eventually by the end of the 17th century they have established their domination but it's by the mid 19th century they have reached the point where the ming were when they took power and so they could be pointed to is this alien foreign power that has imposed this foreign religion. This false religion only for their benefit that christ and his younger brother can help guide chinese people back to the the godhead which like that the god he gestured towards was a real feature of chinese folk religion. As you know um. There is a godhead in hinduism. There's always one god at the end of the day right and and and the taiping promised to bring back this god of the reverence for this god and they went great.

I mean they did some crazy stuff about it very fascinating. They divided genders rigorously in faith. Like they men and women went to separate services. There was no co-mingling and or in public places. Men and women were not supposed to appear in public in the same places sort of wahhabist in that respect but the army was fully gender. Inequal indicated integrated in the early era. Anyway women were fighting alongside men against the ming. The the qing armies so like it worked like and I gotta say I've said this before. But I really think that marx takes the place of christ amongst in the same context of rural sustained economic crisis that happens in the 20s and 30s because the chinese communist party starts out as an orthodox working class-based party. Their strength is in the city shanghai. In particular they organize among factory workers. They understand the worker to be the agent of history just like the bolsheviks and they have their their policies directed by moscow towards that end and stalin insists throughout the 20s that the communists needed to cooperate with the nationalist forces under shanghai sheck and just like worm their way in path of least resistance which was always stalin's advice because he was a man. But eventually the the the shanks forces are able to isolate and massacre the urban base of the party. there's an attempt at a general strike in shanghai and it leads to a general butchery of the communist party. They flee to the countryside and there mao starts organizing those same haka peasants who had flocked to the banner of the taiping heavenly kingdom and uses a critique of the given system that is organized around the writings and ideas of this european interloper to make sense of and contextualize their lives and give them a goal to stream for and the taiping emphasized land reform and land redistribution as a key component of their economic agenda and where they went. They killed landlords and redistributed land. Now mostly the rural economy collapsed under the taiping because it was a constant war zone that's why 20 million people died of starvation and disease alright couple more questions.

Somebody's recommending melville's the confidence man I mean melville is who he is because he was set. He was there at the font and he he understood what was happening like the people who who the writers and thinkers who really have withstood the test of time for like actual reasons of merit not because they made somebody money like that's a whole different group of guys. The ones. Who have sustained themselves like marx and like melville did it because they were able to stand at a historical nexus of overwhelming power and instead of being destroyed by it or overwhelmed by it. We're able to divine some significant tributary within it and describe it. Mark's one of the biggest of all of course but think of how many brilliant minds of europe saw the cataclysmic eruption of capitalism in the mid 19th century and decided that the explanation involved people's head shapes. They started. Measuring skulls just hysteric nonsense but they were left without explanation. They were left a god and a guy like melville. He understood what america was. He understood what what the frontier meant and charles. Olson wrote a book about how like the pacific the pacific ocean in moby dick specifically figures as this graveyard really.

I mean it literally is the graveyard of the pequod and of and of ahab. But it's the graveyard of america because it's the end of the dream like he got that in the 1840s for god's sakes when he was like incredibly horny for nathaniel hawthorne who was an absolute um like by the numbers doe-faced democrat. His best friend was franklin pierce they were drunks together. I think that I kind of think that they drank together peer strength because of you know his family horrors and traumas and hawthorne drank because he was gay but yes confidence man. A great book about about the american need to be told. Some story and one of the key things about the story is somebody else has to suffer it's not just. It is not just salvation. It is damnation without which salvation means nothing. Tertullian said one of the early church fathers. Tertullian said that one of the pleasures of heaven would be the ability to observe the suffering in hell and smell the burned flesh and hear the screams. Oh did we get raided or something jesus christ holy.

Oh my god the zoomers are here. I don't know what to do oh god. I feel like I'm at the chosen reservoir. Here my 30 caliber browning is overheating what was I even talking about I forgot damn. Now. I'm completely frozen up and staring at this chat because melville yes yes americans at the end of the day want to be among the elect. America is a machine to make the elect. It's a machine to make winners and losers and we're supposed to enjoy the suffering of others as much as we enjoy. the own advancement of ourselves and what we find ourselves here. Now. At the end of history is is a politics that has no more dream of success. We can no longer count each other.

It's over the cons over with p I mean. Nfts are done for. We can't we can't scam our way out of this and that means all we can do is hurt one another we can at least arrange the deck chairs in hell and we can check and we can stagger the misery and make some people hurt more than others. We can generalize nationalize hell and then get vip seats because that's the fantasy of that's the fantasy of like christian protestant capitalist individual subjectivity that the thing that we're all stuck in the thing that we're all captured by completely is our own subjectivity. As the is the is the definition of the universe. Basically we cannot subordinate it to another thing. We cannot conceptually subordinate our consciousness to another thing and so that means we have to live the contradiction of an limitless eternal consciousness. A godhead and physical finite bodies that we know from rational observation of the universe the same thing that tells us that we're the center of it that we're also going to end that is an uncontainable and unresolvable contradiction. We spend our life trying to make it make sense through a combination of sublimation distraction and self-destruction. Oh somebody said we were good on the best joe thank you that was an incredible honor being on the best show was amazing so we got about 12 000 of these on here at one point and then they realized what this was and what I was going to be talking about and it immediately dropped to eight thousand.

I'll see how long I can keep these. I gotta actually. I was gonna. I was gonna go. I have to be somewhere but I kind of want to hang around for at least a little bit just to see how long it takes me to walk. These.

So does hassan ever actually play any games on the stream. I was always wondering that like it's a twitch streamer but does he actually play the games no games. He doesn't play games. Interesting would you guys prefer to see him play a game or would that be distracting. I feel like. I'm his I'm doing his like customer service. I'm like the guy in the room with a two-way mirror going like okay did you like that about what would you like to see hassan do in the next fiscal quarter all right well. I'm I was doing a question and answer session. So I'm gonna try to get a few more questions. It'll be tough though because this chat is moving much faster than it was before you guys all showed up so let's see if I can get it get anything. I don't know what the hell anyone does with with the scroll in in on his idea or on his channel because you can't see anything the zoomers have left oh my god. Where are they where are. The zoomers are they on tick. Tock are all the zoomers on tick tock because that's what's happening. I would love to play victoria 3 on stream but the thing is. I can't be in charge of any of it. I need an experienced hand is the water turning the frogs gay kind of yeah.

This is what's so frustrating about alex jones. I've talked about this before. I talked about on the episode about conspiracy theories. I did on the pod a few years ago. There's this like turns makes them like hermaphroditic and and infertile disrupts. Their their reproduction mutates. The out of them real thing that really happens but how does this nitwit define that to his people they're turning the frogs gay. The company has got a machine or they're like we want to see male frogs. Street corner understood a hundred years ago which is that there's a company that makes money by doing that and turning it into there's a cabal of weirdos who want the frogs to be gay and then they also want you to be gay and that's why people want to say he's a narc.

But no. I think that he is just responding to where the market is at the end of the day. A marxist analysis of conspiracies is unsatisfying because it denies narrative. It denies good guys and bad guys. It denies you redemption. It denies you a fantasy that you're gonna you're gonna get all the evidence one day and they're all gonna go to jail and there's gonna be a big courtroom scene where they're convicted and they everybody hoists you on your. Courtroom. You're gonna get you're gonna give the thumb drive to the reporter and it's gonna be on the front page and everyone's going to go to jail these systems produce this. The systems can't indict themselves and so in the marketplace for people who want a conspiracy understanding of their world. They're not going to listen to a boring marxist to talk about this. They're going to listen to where who will ever give them the best story and a totally cynical hollow performance artist like alex jones. I mean honestly at a certain point he could realize it doesn't matter anyway. I might as well get paid and if that's what he's doing it's the sandy house. The thing is the sandy hook is the bridge too far that that makes me think that he actually is just completely hollow and so he's like put me in coach and he goes from being ambiently anti-establishment in the 90s and aughts when that's still just sort of an incohate thing to becoming just another zeus to give direction to ambient republican petty bourgeois grievance. I think public ed is doomed. I feel like we're getting to a point where it's going to be charter schools private.

Tutoring I honestly feel like the next level for and it'll be honestly the cheaper option event pretty soon given like rents in urban areas. The cheapest option for the urban bourgeois would be to hire like tutors like the medicis had like you have like being urban. Bourgeois means you have a you have a maid you might have a if you're doing pretty well. You might have a cook but if you have a kid you absolutely have a tutor. It's me. It's daragur. There'll be that then like the remain they'll still be like the really expensive schools for the super rich people who want to guarantee their kid entre through the network but for like the striving middle class it'll be tutors and who then the tutors will be the failing to strive downwardly. Mobile educated those college loan beset losers and they get to live a gig economy life instead of being public educators with pensions and and cost of living raises and then they'll be cheaper public private schools for you know middle class people that'll basically be as good as president private school public schools and then there will probably be the public schools left as essentially detention centers for the unruly and unteachable whatever. However they want to define that which will make them essentially prisons that will be public school. The fucoian fantasy of schoolless prison will be finally and totally demonetized by the way that's why all these.

Like like this is what are we talking about you want to talk about whether it's feudalist feudal as a political economy as a social relation. It is feudalism in my opinion because it is bilateral relationships based on labor rather than than any kind of public space and people understand that a lot of people who his job. It is to just like stare into the guts the chicken and trails of um of the internet all day and then spew it out on podcasts and they recognize that oh these these currents are coming and so some people want to get in with the people who are going to have the good courts they want to become courtiers because like what are the jobs left we've talked about all the horrible gig jobs. What is a non-gig non-alienated job left. One of the few will be somebody who hangs around with the remaining elite and kind of keeps them company the way that the courtiers would in feudal europe and that means kissing the ass of the nobles and so what is the new flavor of the intellectual monk among the The intellectual post left whatever it is it's oxfordianism. It's edward de vere. It's the argument that shakespeare didn't write his plays like why the hell would you care about that. Now it's very simple if shakespeare is just some up jumped crow upstart crow. Some like hustler from the middle strata. Then the entire berkian argument. The aesthetic argument for capitalism and whatever post-capitalist structure we're going to create is that it allows the wealthy to concentrate resources and build a aesthetic and cultural world that we can all inhabit and that you cannot have that sort of cultural production democratized it will turn to dirt well. Shakespeare was just some guy from sadford then that's not true. It's no good. So shakespeare has to be the earl of oxford. He has to be edward de vere with his oxford education. His latin knowledge sitting on his father's estate oh man capitalism is certainly not halal. I mean islam formally prohibits the charging of interest which is the that is the germ of all capitalism right there. Like interest is the it's the logic the drive the engine.

It's the it's the powerhouse of the cell. It's mitochondria and it's banned in islam. Right. Christianity did too until protestantism came along to get rid of that problem but anyway I would rather not live in the gilded bunker of one of my new neo-dukes than have to hang around with him and like probably do coke all day and and just tell him yes absolutely sir. You can tell oh yes you can tell by the by the way he uses language in winter's tale. This could not be some base born son of a trollop. This is the mark of a of a dead of a austere and prodigious bloodline like you're benny jesuit.

No thank you hobbism is the future of america. I mean it. It's the only live wire among the major religions right. I mean and that has the capability to like be networked and to transmit like hinduism is obviously a live wire but that's because vast swaths of india have still are still living in like medieval relation social relations for god's sake but with modern technology and a political economy and you know hinduism reflects that it's not going to move over the world. It can't islam can and it's live. There are people who really believe in it. Nobody really believes in christ anymore and yes yes yes of course people do but I mean at a demographically meaningful level people believing that can act that way as opposed to answer a trivia question from a pollster about whether they believe in god or not. But I think the thing that will stop islam from conquering the globe will just be the breakup of supply chains and that means you're just going to get weird weird sort of quasi-pagan cults like new new regimes of power consecrated by new rituals of mostly violence and domination because that's how you do it.

Fury road is a great movie on this the way that they are able to meticulously describe how primitive accumulation wraps around like populations and builds cultural structures that defend and validate it. This is interesting somebody says what about a ghost dance for this dying civilization. Maybe qanon is our ghost dance. Maybe this whole this whole apocalyptic like you can draw a straight line from the left behind. George w bush cultural heyday of like christian conservativism to the tea party under trump or under obama to trump to q anon to just like the maga movement that it's part of and it's all it's it's religion. It's formal religion fusing finally with politics the culmination of a 40 50-year project to politicize protestantism that began in the 70s and if that's the case like maybe it is the live wire. The left only live because it's political not religious. The spiritual part is all gone that might get people to actually operate off of its. I mean my god that guy in cincinnati getting lit up in the cornfield. I do think you're going to have like early kernels popping on that and who knows how how bad that gets and maybe that does turn into some sort of cleansing violence from like the most unstable fringe of a movement that will largely just go along with whatever the program is because we're americans and that's what we do. I thought. I had a thing for the bulletproof glass and I did not.

It's interesting what kind of phenomenon you get when societies come under this sort of pressure like the ghost dance for those who don't know was a social phenomenon of of apocalyptic ritual around that that was spread by a prophet that was attempting to direct the that was attempting to um address. The situation which for western native americans was in fact apocalyptic. There was an attempt to make their their social lives conformed to the condition they were in and it led to this like mass outbreaks as they were called of ritualized dance and the western and the american over powers of course were horrified of. It broke it up. carried out the carried out. The massacre at wounded knee to help put it down but that also happened to the zulu after they began encountering european colonialists in the form of the dutch boers and later the english. There was a child prophet of the zulu who commanded that they execute they kill all of their cattle and this is the pastoral people who lived by herding and and and milking cows and stuff and just killed all of their cows and then there was just masturbation because it didn't lead to them being invulnerable to white bullets and then went back the continent but that sort of thing is inevitable when you have a cultural vocabulary understanding of the world. Social structure that is internally coherent cannot be challenged from within but is in terminal crisis facing conditions that will destroy it and the people within. It are aware of that and trying to manage the contradiction and these sort of apocalyptic movements arise out of the attempt to square that circle.

And I think that's what we're seeing now in in a much more muted and less intense way. Because you know we are americans and we're relatively comfortable at the end of the day. But you are seeing. These formations come into being attempting to expiate the the cognitive dissonance of living in a country where it has these institutions and social structures that are inviable and that you incorporate deeply into your understanding of the world and the good and that which is to be defended and yet are leaving you deeply underserved and in fact now self-consciously doomed. I think we're going to see more and more but how what what direction it comes to is going to be determined at the at the at the much more base level than any. I could sketch out here which is the frustrating and to all attempts speculating at this incredibly femoral moment in history. We love our history moments to be febrile don't we. I know I do all right. I'm still gonna. I know. I have a lot. I still have a lot of followers but um. I'm going to wrap it up. I don't want to overstay my welcome. I do have somewhere to go but I'll do probably do like maybe one or two more questions. So somebody says why do.

I think protestantism was so harmful. I I try not to use that kind of language because at the end of the day at the end of the day I love using that dumb dumbass phrase capitalism is this necessary lubricant to the emergence of these new social relations. They cannot withstand these old ways of being these old categories and with their old definitions. They need new terms and new terms for the old categories so capital. The productivism is going to emerge now luther makes it very specific because of his genius and ability to embody the moment. But the phenomenon is like a generalized trend um. But once it happens yeah it accelerates capitalism dramatically and now it and it ends up midwifing what we have now which is this post-christian secular western individual individual and ism self-worship. Whatever you want to call it do. I visualize time through a space dimension in order to interrogate my metaphysics. Buddy you bet your ass. I do. I love imagining time advances three-dimensional structures rotating them in my mind. If you will ooh is capitalism a demon summoned by john d I'll tell you right now. I would watch or read the movie or book honestly.

I would like to make it because you john d for those who don't know is this a figure of renaissance england in central europe who stands astride this. this historical nexus that from which the scientific revolution emerges but which is in every respect midwifed by alchemy. Kabbalah mystical ritual like it is not rationalism that gives us the enlightenment. It is in fact a devotion a deep devotion to a scientific interrogation of the spiritual realm and it all starts with this guy. John d who's a court magician basically to elizabeth and he goes and into the he goes to the court of ferdinand the holy roman emperor in bohemia or rudolph. Rather. The holy roman emperor bohemia influences the rosicrucian movement later in the rhineland. John d is nuts yes and it all starts with gin darno bruno getting killed by the church and maybe. At that point they decide we're going to break this thing in half one way or the other and they summon lucifer. They summon the lightbringer in the form of the capitalist western subject who can turn any faith any religious truth into its curdled and monstrous reverse and then to destroy the world with it oh. I would like to raid somebody else's q a on. I would love to raid q anon anonymous if I knew how but I don't know if I'll be able to because I'm not very good at this stuff raid channel. There we go. I'm not seeing it. I'm sorry. I looked at the twitch channel and I went to raid channel but now. I can't see it. I I tried to enter it in and it didn't pop up.

I'm being an insane. Boomer right now. I'm a boomer. I'm booming oh julian field okay or field. All right good. Ah there we go all right guys. This is perfect all right thank you for that. That was very helpful. I'm going to now switch you guys over to q anon anonymous julian field. he'll use me spitting truth. Those guys are really good bye-bye you.
