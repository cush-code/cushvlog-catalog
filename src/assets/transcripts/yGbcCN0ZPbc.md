Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kinda dumb with a finger on his thumb in the shape of an elk on her forehead well. The years start coming and they don't start coming back to the door and they hit. The ground. Running didn't sex but didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your. Brain gets smart but your head gets done so much to do so much to say so what's wrong with reef chan the backstreet you never know if you don't go yo never shine if you don't glow bow hey. Now you know an all-star get. The game on get paid hey. Now you're a rock star get the show on get paid all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars once asked can. I spare some room for cash. I need to get myself away from this place. I said yep what a concept I could use a little things myself and we could all use a little change well.

They start coming and they don't stop coming. You know those songs that one and and walking on the sun. Their other big hit those two smash mouth songs are remembered as sort of the absolute apotheosis of meat head culture at the end of the millennium right. Pre-911 meathead culture like not even mad enough to go and wreck stuff at woodstock 99 just too chuckle-headedly content with the end of history and its endless buffet they were fine. They were hogs at the trough but the lyrics to those songs are actually filled with a real sense of like a melancholy like like like a a a a cry for more than what they were getting. I mean my god walking on the sun as a whole verse about the failure of the 60s cultural revolution and how all the hippies ended up selling out and how they left us. They they gifted us this hedonic. Pleasure hell that we're all stuck in they were singing and clapping man what the hell happened and then the rest of it's literally about global warming as is all-star by the way the icu skate is getting pretty thin water's getting warm so you might as well swim my world's on fire how about yours better get to like it if you want to use yours. I don't know how that one ends but anyway you see what I'm saying their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites. I think there is something really evocative about the phrase.

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb something about how like our increased enlightenment our rationalism our cultural drive towards towards reason as the organizing principle of culture and of identity tears us out of our bodies. It makes us incentives to our own lived reality of sensuous experience. Because we are we are our our brain keeps getting smarter more refined more abstracted from experience and it robs us of our ability to to know where we're drifting to notice because we feel like yes we all feel that spiritual lack and we express it in different ways but it is a. It is a faint echo of the actual misery that the biosphere that we're connected to and that our bodies are connected to is experiencing on a moment by moment basis that is an um a mind-breaking scream. But we only hear it muffled through the pillow like the princess and the p because it's all we know. Things are bad happening elsewhere like think about what people talked about the 90s like before it was like global warming as we know it.

There was a great there was a a sort of amorphous anxiety about ecology you have it right at the end of the cold war. You have the. It's gonna cook us all now in that case the specific contributors to that phenomenon chlorofluorocarbons are were not essential to the maintenance of capitalism. They were extraneous. It was a good hustle. It was a good way to to to capitalize an element of the human experience give people a freon air conditioner or nice hairspray. It was expendable because of the danger opposed to the maintenance of the system but now now that we know what was really happening and that's why we actually were able to do something about the ozone hole. The montreal protocols did lead to the the ceasing of the production of cfcs now the whole zone. Hole's not gone and some people say that it's not like totally solved in any way but the trend since that treaty has been the real reduction in cfcs that have led to a deceleration of the deterioration of the ozone. Now that kind of shows that there is state capacity you know through the international system to address a problem like climate change to address an externality like carbon emission. Because we did it with cfcs. The problem is is that because it's so overwhelming and dominant as a function of the system everybody on one end of all 

There's like if the globe is divided in half right between those who are sitting on surplus and those are having surplus extracted political capital and political power is concentrated on one end but the misery of carbon-based global warming is felt at one end at the end that is farthest from real control of political institutions and for everybody who is sitting on on the surplus as as this thing is breaking up as the accumulated. Externalities are now pressing up against us in a way that they hadn't before. Everybody has an ins a belief beyond politics that they want to keep their position on this side of the line that politics is about sorting people like. I really do think that this is true. I feel like every main current of politics boiled down out of its fantasies when it tells itself what is actually being pursued by democrats by republicans and I would say by the to the degree that it matters and it doesn't really the center of gravity of like socialism and and progressivism to like the entire social liberal like coalition that has like some contr some relationship to like a class project or another but is untethered like all other bourgeois politics in the era after the fall of american labor power. What they all understand is that they are materially benefiting from this system not capitalism deeper than capitalism. The techno reality of the the supply chain the things that don't even that aren't even articulated in formal ideological armature. The way that capitalism was imminent elements of of this thing that cohere into capitalism that system gives me a degree of comfort physical comfort in life that I need and specifically that I need because I am an isolated maniac who has been rendered has has been put into a schizophrenic relationship with their natural environment because of how abstracted away. My day-to-day experience has been from the actual biological world like stripped of a relationship that then we fill with a neurotic fixation on the self that it's filtered through ideology. It's filtered through our identity. It's not ours. It's an illusion but it is an illusion that we reify in order to pursue politics in a condition of crisis oh. I know things are going to get bad soon who is going to suffer for it well. Not me. You know most people in a capitalist structure be before they're. Even getting to. The language of politics assumes that the people who are going to suffer for this change that has to happen is not them or presumably the people like them who they deal with every day and who can structure their identity in themselves and provide them with the matrixes of pleasure and pain that they seek to navigate oh man.

I didn't know that felix was streaming with hassan that's funny. I mean. I'm not drawing anything from them right now. I am not competing with them at all that is an entire other stratosphere. They got 36 000 people that that's wild so if you start from well. I'm not going to suffer then.

[11:13](https://youtu.be/yGbcCN0ZPbc?t=11m13s)

The politics becomes who is going to suffer and you encounter wherever your ideology is if you're a liberal or conservative if you're a white nationalist. If you're a identity politics ultra liberal who wants to like overturn the reward structure of western civilization to reward those who've suffered and to punish those who are responsible reparations. Assumption undergirding all of this politics is that someone else is going to suffer for this and who's it going to be and then the polls of politics are those who want to inscribe themselves politically like make their world make their comfort level their social comfort level universal by abolishing an other by abolishing the other. That's that's the that's the death drive at the heart of the conservative reaction to crisis. It is punish those who are already weak because it's their fault. They're weak reward us because we are strong and then carry out what needs to be done to assure that result politically whether through elections whether through extra parliamentary means. This is what you're doing when you're doing politics on the right on the left. What you really have is the exact same relationship. To this question the exact same motivating function.

The exact same unaggregated lumpen identity class position as in the like what people even think their class position is I was all aligned along one axis which is someone is suffering from my behalf. There is a regime that I am part of that. I benefit from and I have a relationship to it of superiority. How am I going to live with that now at the point of extraction the culture that is built the culture it was built by early capitalism. The culture was built by in american slavery. The rel the the the wage relationship in in the the wage relationship among early merchants and then and then industrialists the degree of like violence that made up the day the amount of like actual sanguinary conflict and and felt human misery as an experienced human misery. Is the order of the day for those at the very highest levels of the social order in the plantation south jefferson washington.

Those guys were writing their letters about the rights of man within the hearing distance of a cracking whip and that creates a culture around domination and the assertion of the self against the other that then becomes reactionary conservativism in a capitalist context. You're essentially taking the old the old order of the pre-industrial era. When power was concentrated in land people's power was directly related to the amount of land they owned not capital not some acreage that is what meant was meant by power and that meant also power of over the people on that garage that is real power and it is carried out in one site that creates a culture around capitalism and that is the tory reaction to the bourgeois and then it is the conservative reaction in the conservative counter reaction to the arising bourgeois in europe. These are this is all landed power trying to assert itself against capital and it's all around a culture of an eye of dominating another and that becomes the culture of the right in this current moment now so when capitalism hits north america like a meteor and sprouts up in the merchant north and in the the rich loamy soil of the south one region dominated by hard scrabble sandy and rocky soil that doesn't really lend itself to anything beyond subsistence agriculture really in new england versus areas of very rich land that can accommodate staple crop agriculture in the south. Now that stable crop agricultural capitalist social order that this array of meaning around these terms this symbolic order call. It is forged there in in jamestown and in virginia but then up north. Something else is forming in the in the merchant.

Cities such as boston boston is where you have the descendants of the puritans who fled the adoption of capitalism in europe to try to remake a communal world a communal a communal social order in the new world where they would not be able to be subject to capitalism's dictates but who carried with them capitalism as their undergrad the undergirding relationship to the world because even though they were serving capitalism as merchants they were also experiencing the social trauma of capitalism. They were feeling the alienation erupt within them. They were they were they were having a destabilized relationship to god and to their fellow man and they had to flee it first. They tried to overthrow the church because they thought that would do it and then they were driven out and then the ones who stayed over through the monarchy but over here they came and tried the most female tendrians the the most femoral tendrils of protestantism. The ones who wanted to try to re-stabilize the relationship between god and man away from the abstraction of urbanity and the abstraction of idle wealth come to north america but they immediately begin trading and they create a relationship to capitalism and morality that is completely different than that is forged in the fields of virginia. Here capitalism is abstracted it is turned more into manners.

It is more consensual. People are being exploited. People are being are laboring for others benefit but they are not compelled by per the point of an application of terror. There is an assumed citizenry. There is an assumed shared humanity and social order that they're a part of and benefit from or imagine that they will benefit from in the future that they believe in. There is a credulity towards the social order that exists even among the lower classes that you cannot evolve in the law. In the south you cannot have that because of the the maximal exploitation the the total rupture they're both being exploited. But some of the surplus of the exploited in the north is being packaged culturally around wages and then given back and that gives those workers of the north a reason to go to work short of being compelled to and of course. They are compelled by hunger by the need for shelter but that is not associated with the the state it's associated with nature. It is the naturalized element of capitalism that has now emerged because this is still a machinery of class exploitation. It's just getting different cultural characteristics wrapped around it and so the capitalism and then the democracy and then the the vocabulary and symbolic order that emerges out of northern industrial capital is not about dominating. It is instead because it isn't about watching and experiencing the infliction of human misery. It is about being alone in a room benefiting from that exploitation but not having it intrude upon you well. Hey.

This is the perfect situation you can live anywhere you can you can live in heaven on earth now because you're sitting on surplus congratulations. But the problem is you know where this comes from and more importantly you have nothing to do to deserve it. So you develop internally in neuroses and this is why you had a mass nervous breakdown among the victorian middle classes that was only quenched by a mixture of religious quackery like the theosophist movement and wide scale drug use this period in time when you had the nervous breakdown in the urban. Middle. Class is also when you had what is known historically as the great binge the moment when the intersection of all drugs that are possible to be synthesized out of nature and the ability to access genuine national markets for any real. Commodity like demand could pull things into existence and pull structures of of trade into existence and production into existence you had a moment when basically every drug you can think of that existed at the time was legal over the counter you could walk into a pharmacist and buy it laudanum every kind of morphine extract. You could imagine cocaine marijuana oh these were all legal over the counter. Hammered because they were going mad sitting on their surpluses.

[22:15](https://youtu.be/yGbcCN0ZPbc?t=22m15s)

Their asses living in a world where they cannot live in heaven because of their guilt that manifests as a masochistic desire to annihilate the guilty self because they're too addicted to the pleasures. The physical pleasures of life idle life exploiting and not being exploited but no pleasure that is pursued can be fully enjoyed. There is momentary pleasure fleeting pleasure and then there is the pleasure of the pursuit. But it is over time it destroys the self and it has to be accommodated spiritually by some attempt to be religious but over time as you sit there you read more you think more you understand things more. I don't know what is science what is this saying. Now. I can't even believe that there is a god to reward me someday for my virtue.

I'm going to have to just continue upholding it secularly because I just need people to believe that these institutions have a moral core to them because if it's just extraction they will see their chains and that is why slavery is is less efficient socially than capitalism because it requires more more coercion and so it is therefore oh and it requires more indulgence by the people at the top more more waste more ext exquisite expenditure because over time as you're piling up the looker on the on the backs of slaves in the south the experience of consumption what loses its novelty and has to be continually overindulged. That's why all the planters were in incredible debt because they were all addicted to an insane conspicuous depictions of wealth and indulgences. Like thomas jefferson.

He always was like damn slavery sucks but I really can't afford to to free my slaves because I have all this debt. But he had all that debt because he was addicted to buying books and french champagne and fine wines he needed to quell quell it. He needed some indulgence to make up for the reality of living this manifest in humanity in the north there is no need to indulge because you self limit because you are living abstractly and you are able to drown out that voice by recommitting yourself to public virtue because if you have no faith in an afterlife but you are as I said addicted to a certain level of of physical comfort in the face of this constant like neuroses that's pulling you away from your experiences and allowing you to live in these like abstracted realms and so the old puritanism converts into a secular morality of social progress and that's like people who say you know sjws or woke.

People. Wokeness is a religion or it's like the new puritanism it's like d . This is banal to say you're just ex you're just describing liberal theology because when you go from the the era of religiosity and religious credulity that the pilgrims lived in or the puritans lived in and you come into modernity that that that um that emotional connection to like a symbolic order that used to be religion doesn't go away it gets transferred into secular terms. It is the evolution it is. The it is the progression. It is the cultural dialectical progression of um of theology through bourgeois capitalism and the beauty of this is this is why capitalism is a perfect machine. This is why capitalism is the goddamn xenomorph from alien. We have to admire its purity because this means that as capitalism exceeds its historic mandate to develop the means of production sufficiently to be publicly democratically manipulated. We've reached that point a while ago so now in the era that we live in when capitalism is no longer a progressive force in history.

It means that instead of a working-class counter-culture generated by the collective self-interest of liberal subjects under capitalism articulating themselves through cultural structures like media memes a vocab a public vocabulary of of of ideas and orientations and actions that can be taken challenging this like broken old battle between old and new capital between really fixed and fluid capital between international capital and and ground capital. This this is a cultural battle within the ruling class and absent a working class. Counter to it all cult all political in all political acts of speculation and investment. At the at the national level. I will say effect to engaging in a sterile reactionary bourgeois. It is a dialectic that can't be worked through basically because it has no engagement with material reality. It is a pure mind palace. It is a frictionless plane of pure spectacle where the dying boomers the last homeowners. The last people to believe in this system are acting out the psycho drama of their imminent physical demise and the demise of the system that they believed in acting out through political institutions the republican and democratic party. The republican party representing landed capital the democrats representing fiscal capital of um and so even though both these groups of people well hanging on to mo to Bourgeois comfort for the most part are now feeling for the first time in their lives precarity.

[29:37](https://youtu.be/yGbcCN0ZPbc?t=29m37s)

They are imagining that their lives will be worse in the future than they are now. They imagine their children's lives will be worse than they are in the future than they are now and that is a real thing that has infected their politics even though they are all committed and this is the important part to maintaining capitalism as such because it keeps them where they're comfortable and what it mean what it boils down to is because we the amount of comfort we need is not stable like when I say comfort. I mean bourgeois. Convenience of life lack of lack of engagement with the natural world in a condition of you know real consequence and they are. They're absolutely terrified of this fact but undergirding everything is that is is their fear of feeling less of the conveniences that stand in for pleasure in their life because what I am saying is that no matter who you are in this equation whether you are a suburban boat owner the beautiful boater. The absolute stereotype the your feelings like ultra mag who's who we always we all imagine when we see them in cultures like liberated in a way like in a way that the the self denying left the neurotic left never can be and then on the other hand.

You have the the ideal intersectional you know tenured professor with with a house in a college town. You know or a like an hr department diversity officer or something pmc like perfect like quintessence. None of these people are anything less than screamingly miserable in their minds.

They are not at peace with anything if they've been chasing pleasure on the right. They've been driven mad by the pursuit. If they've been denying themselves the guilt that they feel in place of because what they feel instead of pleasure is just an assuagement of that sense of guilt. That's all they want. They just want to feel virtuous for a minute. They pursue pleasures because pleasures are deeper and and they need those but then they feel bad about them. The mega people also indulge and then feel bad about it. We do things that are bad for us one way or another like actually bad for our bodies and then we feel the badness that that action is and then we interpret it through brains that are seeking either virtue or indulgence sinning or or or praying or whatever no matter what it is.

We are all at the end of our rope because our our the systems that we're investing in are falling apart before our eyes and our faith in any of them to function is going away. So our ability to care about politics is going away unless we're caught up in this fantasy and the last people to be on board are going to be the homeowners because they're the last ones who felt that there was something to get out of it and now that they're alienated from it. They can only translate it through the cultural matrix of us versus them. The the them that we need to destroy or the them that represent the worst of us because for the liberal the white male patriarchy is all of the parts of themselves that they hate all the parts of themselves that they feel guilty for all.

The selves parts of themselves that they blame for their body feeling shitty and of course the like the pleasures they do feel the temporary indulgent pleasures they do feel. They attribute that to their virtues one way or the other either because they're cool and deserve it or because they're self-denying because they give in to an idea of self-abnegation or a self-assertion any way you slice it. They are miserable because the feeling the good feelings feel less good. The bad feelings because they're getting older. Their bodies are just in more pain feel worse and they are stuck with a a treadmill that is wearing out because it required to support it a degree of comfort that they are losing even if they aren't losing their house they're losing their bodies. They might be losing their house. A lot of them are afraid of losing their houses. A lot of them have mortgages but you know even the ones even the ones in the like. The house where they paid it off 30 years ago and now it's worth 5 million dollars if they have kids. They're terrified for their kids because if they have like more than one that they could just hand the house over to they have no. Way to they cannot believe that their kids are going to have access to the life they had and that makes them feel bad and it makes them feel like they're not in control of their lives and then they got to blame somebody for it and they either blame the thing about themselves that they hate the white male patriarchy which is the new liberal orthodoxy or they blame the other that it's all the things that they are not vis like superficially because we're fine refining the self and making ourselves god that's like when you are doing this you're hitting the stick all day.

[35:33](https://youtu.be/yGbcCN0ZPbc?t=35m33s)

You become god to both you and the person getting hit. But it's not coming. Godhood is slipping through your fingers you're going mad and if you're trying to be saved it is harder and harder every day to believe that you could be saved given how much worse things are going because if you're on that end of the spectrum you are aware you feel like with god's fingertips. The agony of the earth not like viscerally of course but every bad thing you have every bad feeling you accumulate. In your life. You connect it to this sensation. You connect it to the knowledge of how many how many how many forest fires are currently going in california when was the last mega hurricane. What's this what's the likelihood of desertification hitting the american midwest like all this all this.

If you are on the left it is your duty and I say this as a liberal or leftist or whatever your self-conception demands that you be aware of this stuff and how many people are dying in wars and how many refugees are moving across the country. How much is this system that you benefit from costing other people how bad does that make you feel and then you have to act but how can you act. You can participate in politics because to do anything else to participate directly in the world. And I mean this like from the perspective of just going out and volunteering to risking your life in combat with the state in a guerrilla war in like a maoist struggle you are making yourself less comfortable. The stuff you're addicted to you make yourself less comfortable and you have to be willing to do that now you're still operating out of bourgeois motives. But the reason that doesn't matter is that if you are acting even I'm sorry um but so that means that the bourgeois really have to feel it in order to move left. That is why among the bourgeois you see almost totally the non home owning the down.

Wardly mobile fail sons and failed otters of the middle class. The ac is louder than the ceiling fan and that means unless you have something to do and there isn't anything people can do that they can believe in because all the structures are broken like the entire. It's a bunch of people wielding empty weapons because all the forms we have are the forms we inherited from a dead labor movement and a dead left wing in this country and we're trying to build it from scratch so the work will be thankless. The work will be thankless in the sense that it will not give you the psychic satisfaction to drive you into acting out of selfish desire that you also need what will do. It is the belief that you can make something satisfyingly occur feel like oh. I am contributing to something that matters like that is the self-assertion that everybody is being robbed of by capitalism every moment and is trying to get back somewhere and we're all trying to get it back somewhere else.

The thing is most people are doing it as consumers because we only have identities of consumers. We do not have identities as workers because the working-class movement that generated that identity is gone. So we're all operating on this out of selfish bourgeois motives even if we're workers even if we're workers we want to do this because it'll help our lives like yeah yeah. Yeah. I get I get the I get to feel like I'm helping my fellow man and all that. But I also am going to get universal health care out of this.

I'm also going to get student debt relief out of this and maybe if we really push hard enough. I'm going to get like some sort of real cathartic conflict with capital or something that like feels like a project worth investing in that is something that you need no matter how committed you are to some degree because there's no thing to have faith in you have to build the faith through action and there has to be a first step and the fewer people are going to take a first step if there's nowhere to step. So we're stuck in a situation where engaging in politics is people who have made the decision. I am going to participate in politics as a vent for this feeling that I have to pursue something that matters I am going to convince myself that this action. This symbolic action has meaning contributes actual psychic energy into the universe that pushes something into a direction. I have I have made a mark on the world. The only way you can believe that when you put that ballot in and you have to believe it to put the ballot in is by investing yourself in a cultural battle that is defined at its polls by a nervous breakdown within the bourgeois two groups of retirees going insane and trying to annihilate one another. Now that's not what it is for people who are trailing these movements on the left or right who who are more sophisticated in their analysis.

[41:27](https://youtu.be/yGbcCN0ZPbc?t=41m27s)

But those people are largely the ones who are downwardly mobile. Middle-class people anxious about their future and their present and their continued ease but still let living lives easeful enough to spend time getting enjoyment out of reading about politics and consuming media about politics and making media about politics and yes. It is the 60s that never ended because we had this social conflict that did not result in a real civil war because it was cultural and the underlying conditions were too were too beneficial. There was too much there was still too much money to go around honestly. There was there were too many excuse me. There were too many mansions to build in the sun belt. There was too much credit to extend to people. There were too many new consumer opportunities for people. There were new conveniences and technologies of ease and enjoyment it just and it's left everybody.

I just burped a little bit and it's left everybody locked into this thing because all we're really doing by voting is nothing but what is happening by all of us voting all of us collectively making the choice not individually making the choice but collectively making the choice to opt for pleasure to opt for spectacle to opt opt to mind palace fun zone opt to sudoku puzzles. Basically creates election results that then become what sets up a political structure that we can then watch more of that. We can enjoy ourselves watching. It's essentially we go in every november and we put a quarter in the jukebox and then we get okay democrat president. Let's see and then we all react to that and we and and we vote to fill spaces. Now. There's all these other things that are moving things back and forth obviously but all we can individually do after we voted after we have put the quarter in the machine is just stop and gawk at the thing or do something else that might not be pleasurable and I really do think that well. It seems depressing to say that because it seems like oh we're stuck on this hedonic treadmill. We can never get off because there's no culture working-class culture that can interact with us remember. The the the undergirding thing here is a expectation of momentary pleasure.

The idea that okay things are going to get worse over time but right now sticking with following the rules makes my life feel good. Eventually you can't do it if things keep getting worse and they are so that is the hope that then the hope there is that that changes people's relationship in large numbers from their relationship to politics. As a spectacle. It essentially shatters the spell and I know that this some people say oh. This is accelerationism that's the problem with politics as discussed intellectually on the internet is that we confuse like morality with the spectacle just to say that you need to have a changed relationship between citizens and their material order does not mean you're rooting for it or that it's your fault if it happens means you're identifying a trend that absent a working class alternative.

The only thing that breaks down a regime is internal contradiction. I mean that's basic dialectical materialism like the contradictions are going to get it unless some outside force does and what that one of those contradictions is providing some shared prosperity to keep the functions of government going while extracting maximal profits from a system of declining rates of profit so whatever you want to call. Accelerationism is just an acknowledgement of the conditions and then that means that you now as a sid as a person are tasked with being aware of this fact and acting accordingly not using the fact that you believe it as part of your identity as a virtuous person and this I think is the crux of it is that what we are vampirically pulling out of our relationship to online politics is the pleasure of righteousness the pleasure of being good people. The the the indulgence that allows us to enjoy the mere pleasures of life the selfish pleasures of life and what allows and what that but what that means is that we cannot accurately engage with politics because it is through this lens because like accelerationism take acceleration whether or not you are one determines whether or not you are good right. Like you're a good communist or you're a good leftist you have good theory whatever it is. It adheres to you personally.

[47:53](https://youtu.be/yGbcCN0ZPbc?t=47m53s)

Other people believe it and therefore you can see it reflected in the world and therefore you can believe it that's a real pleasure and it maps on to your physical pleasure. Whatever your indulgence is watching. Half a pizza putting on the air conditioning even though it's not that warm out. All of those things relate not to all the stuff you feel guilty about but to your virtue the fact that you're one of the good ones. I know for many years for me. What it was was yes. I would. I would vent off my guilt in two ways one by trying to get good politics and the other by making myself suffer by freaking out about every feeling in my body to the point that I thought I was gonna die. The hypochondria like that was my way of essentially excoriating myself without me. Even knowing that's what I was doing that's the hair shirt. I put on is that I had this neurotic suppression of my feelings redirecting them so that my pleasure came from my virtue and all of my pain came from others but mostly my body like. I didn't become.

I didn't get like the us versus then liberalism a lot. I think because I had my own body to punish me. I didn't have to be punished by the vision of another that I needed to destroy which was just myself in the mirror which is what liberals do and this is to get back to the very beginning of what I was saying. Why politics now is defined by two sides seeking to divide the world into those who will be allowed continued access to the remaining spoils of a dying system or those who will be punished by having that relationship violently defined downward. One way or the other let's put it that way and it is and it is a domination not of a space but of a re orientation of space a retreat of technological institutions. Political institutions cultural institutions a social organism to geographically essentially retreat from those parts of the world that are no longer profitably engaged with and in that zone you will have people who are pleasure about it happy about it. This is the republicans this is what they want to do.

We're going to sort people by how much they're like me least go down first and because I have been engorging this whole time but still feel like because they have created a culture which is this their collective expression of anguish filtered through the liberal cultural lens. I'm enraged by it. Because it reminds me. It reminds me of of what I'm involved in and it connects it to this bad feeling but it is projected outward and so I must destroy and dominate those and once I no longer need to dominate them because now we have capitalism. We have technology thank you capitalism. We were so stupid the planter class to demand this. This inefficient structure give us finance capital please. This will be lovely we can dominate at a glance and have a fun time so they're having a flight. Their lives are just giant barbecues but they're miserable. They watch the football game and they want to throw. They they're miserable because somebody knelt because people not like them are being and value's not. Like theirs. They're being reflected to them that they have to see it and it pisses them off. They want to get it off the screen and their politics are about getting it off the screen now liberal politics though here you have from the position of the liberal suburbanite who is the center of the party.

The assumption well I'm not going to suffer so who's going to suffer of course. The real joke here is that the answer is meaningless because who's going to suffer is go is who's going to suffer in exact proportion to their relation or they will all suffer in relationship to their rel. They will all suffer relative to their relationship to capital their distance from capital. The farther they are from capital. The farther they are from the center of of like western identity the more they will suffer but then even in the core people will suffer like the white males suffer. Materially. A lot of them are killing themselves with goddamn opiates like massively suffering but later in a different way than people who are suffering in a greater distance but of course and so politics. In this steadily steadily retracting corridor is this battle between two groups who are sterilized can't remove related to capital. Even though they could hypothetically like interdict. They can't because they're acting out of their own lobotomized hedonized self-interest so like me doing this like me.

Doing this stream is a way for me to in the moment feel really good like when I feel my body. I don't feel the tingling. I don't feel the little jabs in my stomach that I half the time I'm like what is that is that cancer whatever. I don't feel like the aches and pains. I don't feel like the general nervous sort of the distress signal. Let's put that way. I don't feel the distressed signal of my body.

I feel you know. I feel the pleasure of a well-turned phrase and I feel like intellectual satisfaction. I I see like a a a a piece locking into another piece and like a giant mental jigsaw puzzle and I get to do that in part because. I feel like this is meaningful that it's not just doing that that it's meaningful and we're all participating in this at some degree to believe that it's meaningful but what that meaning is. I think is not defined by its political valence and this is I think the cause of a lot of misunderstanding of the role of political media is that there's a moralistic tinge to this that says you need to justify all participation in political media by its political efficacy by its by its definition um by its um god damn it oh. I can't say it. I feel like. I'm getting into the weeds here sorry oh right. There's two types of meaning so this me doing it you watching. It can have a meaning if it makes us feel connected if it makes us feel like we are orienting ourselves toward the best parts of ours of us. In some way like we're getting an idea that we can contribute to our daily life that's meaning but that does not but that is different than the idea that it is a political act that is changing the material conditions of the world around us and that that is the sinful indulgence that motivates political media people making it people consuming it. And it's the thing though is that it is impossible to avoid. It's it is what it is. We are liberal subjects. This is what it means to be a liberal subject. Like there are constraints and parameters to human invo development and like the basic kind of What is the word. I'm looking for ontological structure of like the human like what that means is not stable and so for me. What I am like dealing with is to demand to me to do something that affects political change in the world and it's running up against the fact that well anything.

I would want to do would not be fun you know and like that's still there that's that report that repulsion from doing things that aren't fun. I.e I feel like I'm getting something done because you're gonna have to fill in all the places where your day-to-day life is frustration where you're not doing something that feels good where you're not seeing a progress like that day-to-day feeling will wear you down unless it is coded to a belief that is fused to a an understanding that there is a human race and that you're part of one an understanding that that like this action is not selfless you know it is not about destroying or making oneself suffer and that's the thing is that if you have the puritan mind you have to punish yourself. But it's only if you're not punishing yourself that you can really get something out of being helped selfless and helpful to other people like the social subject that like we imagine it's not nobody look around. Nobody is that we aspire to it. We imagine it. We know it's real like in a metaphysical sense but we aren't it. The lives we live have not allowed that being to come into come into awareness only as a construct not as a lived instinctive reality because our decisions are made deeper than thought on how to interact with the world how to map good feelings and bad feelings on the stimuli we experience that is made socially so we are liberal subjects but we can orient what it means to pursue. The self differently and encountering ideas is part of building that opposition mindful intercession with our desires and with our feelings with our body with our sensations and for me like the cycle of thought that I engage in is a I guess. It's a prayer more than anything and I gotta say that like even though I do have a desire to do active work political like assert myself. I do think that I'm going to do more of it and I am already doing some but the thing is one. I'm not really going to talk about it for the most part because I cannot be prescriptive by my own. Understanding of my goal role here because one of the things I'm trying to convey is one of the reasons that you cannot use. Political media as your reality is that the questions discussed in political media are not meaningful in your life in the sense that they do not really tell you what to do in the decisions that you actually have in your life as opposed to the decisions in the game of finding the right ideology and progress the progressive force in history as capitalism enters its end phase and it could the end phase. I'm saying is going to extend very very far because at every point conflict will probably be stabilized out by continued withdrawal but there's going to be a increasingly unstable edge. There's going to be an increasingly febrile and and fraught border area that is going to become a point of real contention and that contention is going to involve people breaking out of patterns of behavior breaking out of material relationships and entering into new ones with new people with new goals and with the new collaborative vocabulary emerging out of the pursuit of those goals. I hope some of this made sense I get at the end and I'm like yeah that perfectly worked that was true.

I'm convincing of myself. I'm convincing myself of this stuff. As I'm saying. It mostly what. I'm what I am confident is that I've convinced myself. But I understand that there is a an additional level of like refinement that has to happen to make it translatable to other people to the degree that I would be comfortable with which is what I'm trying to put in the book. But I'm having a difficulty with because I am a libra. I have a very hard time making choices and it is all a choice of editing because I feel like a lot of this stuff could be could have a lot of like the the weirder edge like wobblier edges taken off it by being turned into like a pithier summary that requires a greater degree of linguistic engineering. We'll see if I can do it. I hope so but part of what it's going to be is me getting to the point where I have detached myself enough from the egotistical desire to write something that people understand and like and think make sense and not something that's stupid like that is an egotistical desire. That's not faith in what I believe or what I feel. It's. It's faith in protection of this. This little squid creature that is attached to my brain. I don't underse this is why this is why. I don't understand how this works not twitch or anything. I don't understand how human communication works. Someone says I only disagree with one small point which is that we're not altruists. We simply expanded our consciousness to see ourselves and others how is that a contradiction with anything I have said of course. The problem is that in the liberal imagination it is a fully theoretical abstract relationship to people. It is not visceral. It does not it is it is reasoned to it is reasoned to. It is utilitarian and therefore insufficient to get across the reality and to guide your actions towards communion. Unless you see yourself in other people and then when you see yourself and other people your selfish desires and your your The the desire to act as a species are aligned instead of in conflict with one another which is what they are under liberalism.

No. I'm not splitting hairs dude. They're splitting hairs by splitting those hairs. I didn't say that because it's implied and that's what I'm saying getting to a point where these questions are not asked so that or at least not. I should say this so these questions aren't asked in bad faith okay never mind. This is why I'm I'm having a hard time writing the thing. This is why I'm a neurotic mess and this is why I I am absolutely a know-nothing goofball at the end of the day and it's hard for me as a no-nothing goofball to justify my life. But that's only if I allow like a neurotic obsession with virtue allow myself to to just get pleasure out of feeling bad. Basically. I think that's the miswiring of the bourgeois liberal that that everything up well. I mean it does no matter what but taking pleasure and feeling emotionally bad the thing that says you don't deserve x y or z when in reality yeah you do everybody does chill out. You're being a cosmic dice roll. We were along for the ride for the majority of it. We had a few moments in life where there was a lucid connection to something else that we acted on and we maybe we should be proud of that and that that is and we're all but we're all banging through life in the exact same chaotic. Billiard action and we're all drafting off of that so. Stuff that's a waste of time and what makes me more believe that the stuff that I do desir end up doing. I do because because. I want to help people. I don't want to just bask in something but also lazy hypocrite demon who spent a way too long just as a very nasty little creature. I'll say that I was a was a nasty little creature. I'll say that again. I I used to be a piece of but the thing is. I know. I still am and it's fine. I am everybody is just do what feels right because there is something that feels right. That's the guess. I guess that's what the faith boils down to that when you take a step that there will be land there and to me that's self-evident if you're paying attention.

And I guess. That's the mental battle is is being able to pay attention all right. I'm a nasty big creature. I'm a big a big old. I'm a big old turd human but as I said everybody is just a various size to turd yeah. Let's get some sloppy steaks boys num num num eat them up anyway thank you guys for attending my streamed therapy session yet again. I really appreciate it bye.
