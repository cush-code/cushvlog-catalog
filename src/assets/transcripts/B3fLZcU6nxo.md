Foreign boats summer building monuments others counting out floats. Everybody is in despair have a girl and boy my name. Quinn. The Eskimo gets here everybody gonna jump for joy come on without come on within you've not seen nothing like the mighty. Clan come on without come on within you're not seeing nothing like the mightiest Trump Quinn. If you do what I want to do you can't decide my own tell me where to put it and I'll tell you who to call. Nobody can get no sleep with someone's anyone's don'ts. But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here everybody's gonna want a dose come on without come. Only then you're not saying nothing like I might air Quinn wanna see you come on without come on within well. I don't see nothing like a Mighty Quinn do what I want to do that I don't know just like the rest of lack my sugar sweet jumping guns and making Hayes just ain't my cup of meat.

I didn't get no sleep feeding pigeons on the limb but when Gwen the Eskimo gets here oh the pigeons gonna run to him oh it's funny someone calls me Bavarian my sister has gotten big into the ancestry stuff. She's doing the deal where you click on all the Leafs and you follow the the train. It's it's pretty interesting actually because turns out no not really Bavarian at all a lot of Norwegian actually But there is obviously a lot of German and it's near Bavaria. It's like in the Rhineland. The platinate actually Baden wurtenberg and then like those the Catholic Protestant sort of liminal space there but not Bavaria itself. But it is that like the Rhineland is where a lot of the people migrated in the 19th century to the United States and they traded their white wine for beer.

But the most interesting one and I said this on Twitter when I found out is that my ninth great grandfather like 19 ninth great great great great grandfather was from a small principality in North West Germany and in the 30 Years War he was a barber surgeon in somebody's Army. I don't know who's so direct familial connection to the 30 Years War which is pretty cool yeah. The the stream yesterday was very fun. I want to keep going because much better I mean obviously I can't take any credit because I just I said vague stuff like hey let's attack let's attack Transylvania. Like that's it but doing very well. It's it's eight. It's 1658 I think something around there.

So we've gone past the 30 Years War period the piece that we got to the Peace of Westphalia much earlier with much more of Germany under Catholic rule including Saxony where beer George was converted to Catholicism um that means that Wittenberg is back into under the church's umbrella which is boss But then we turned right around went to war with the Ottomans rinsed the Ottomans because they were at that point having a war with the safavids and they didn't have the wherewithal to split their attention and we kind of went around through the Black Sea back door and ended up taking the Holy Land that's right Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III taking over for his dad. The the Habsburg of habsburg's reclaiming the props oh Geneva Heartland well the place where Kelvin came up with his France and Poland we are going to partition Poland that's inevitable but you know come on there's no world where the Poland does not get partitioned a million times. The real the real leverage the real like historical break. We're gonna have is that if we succeed in carving up France taking it Taking like outside Lorraine for the Holy Roman Empire giving a big chunk of like the Basque country and Aquitaine there to Spain and then turning the rest into vassal States. Then it's it's us the habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire versus the the English the Norwegian I'm sorry the English the Dutch and the swedes so I'm hoping if we could be if we beat France. I'm going my plan would be from there invasion of Ireland of course. That's always that's always how you get if you try the only real way you can get to England is through Ireland. Go there alive with the local Catholic population and at this point the I think in England. In our version of it. The English Civil War has led to a collapse of the monarchy. They got some guy in there don't even know who the hell it is so so the Hope here is to exterminate England and at the very least suborn the Dutch.

As we know from history. The Dutch can be suborned but the Anglo has to be just definitively broken and then with Germany being the hegemonic polity of the modern world. You get a nice clean socialist Revolution at the heart of capitalism where it belonged. So that's the goal to to redirect the flow of historical forces towards Germany and away from England. But if we break up France humble their their asses. Then I guess we take. I don't honestly think you you take North America but you know you become like a trading partner right so yes of course.

Eventually that means war with Spain and Russia but come on the Spaniards. They never had a chance and you know what it has nothing to do with their Mediterranean temperament or even the the lovely weather. It has a little bit to do with the aridity of the soil in the Iberian Peninsula. But only so far as it led the Spanish it helped motivate the Spanish to take the big style investment risk of exploration. They were behind the eight ball relative to the other countries in Europe and they were forced to go west because they were holding on to some scraps of decreasingly arable land and then the fact that they were first and the fact that Spain is the first hegemonic state-like thing to a marriage after the Roman Empire in Europe. After the fall of Charlemagne anyway it meant that it commenced a competition between the other states that now had to like Orient towards Spain but Spain was never going to be able to adjust because what gets you to the top.

It is is what is going to bring you down the the the the things that you the tools that you use as a state to gain power to to to to accelerate like past your limitations and create like a New Horizon. As soon as that machine has been built. It cannot be reformed meaningfully from within because the the elite power holders who got you there are going to use their position to prevent anyone else from challenging their specific power within the structure and so that means that for example Spain spreads feudalism to the new world as opposed to approaching the question of colonialism from a you know. A from a national or commercial perspective. It becomes a a simply a process of saying hey you know how there are people who hold land and and the rights to labor within a certain area in Iberia. We're just going to have you do that in North America or in South Latin America you you swear you're loyalty to the king not even to Spain and then you get to be your own little feudal Lord and so the vast Riches of the new world you know extracted by the wholesale.

Slaughter of the of the population were alarmingly ineffective and helping the Spanish fight off Rivals like France and resistance within their body politic like in the Netherlands and so Spain just had to sort of drift through this process. Well France develops the absolute estate the Dutch developed the first modern commercial economy. The English bring the commercial economy into a constitutional monarchical order. They synthesize all of these processes. Meanwhile none of these processes are allowed to take place in Spain and it becomes so embedded that by the 19th century I was saying this on the stream yesterday. By the time the Bourgeois buy out the land of the declining Aristocrats of Spain and the Catholic Church's land is finally put on the market in Bourgeois by it instead of bringing Bourgeois values to land owning like they did in the Netherlands like they did in. In England they start living like Aristocrats and just blowing all of their Surplus instead of investing it in improving production.

I definitely have to remember to not Siege London I need to take it immediately. The same thing with Hannibal too Hannibal don't don't around go see attack and take Rome what is wrong with you. I mean I'm sure that Hannibal had a good reason not for trying to take Rome but at the same time his strategy of like playing whack-a-mole with Rome's allies I don't know I don't know if it had a. I don't know what the viability of that was and obviously it just didn't work. Someone says I'm describing what sounds like our Bourgeois too precisely where every this is why all orders collapse because there is a fix to any exogenous crisis that afflicts a political order. There is a fix always there has to be because humans have the capacity to endlessly rearrange their relationship to Nature. We know that it's just a question of executing it.

So we know it's possible. The reason it can't happen in the long run. Accumulating crises plus the internal tensions and contradictions within the society will bring about their crisis and collapse why they can't respond productively to crisis and instead have to only deepen. Crisis is because Elites will not let go of their particular power and it would require that to meet crisis like when everybody starts fighting the Dutch when they become too dangerous in the 1700s. And like France and England team up against them. The The Amsterdam burgers who had built this thing this incredible machine helped destroy it because they wouldn't they owned all the boats for one thing. They didn't want to risk them in battle. They didn't want to pay taxes for the the military. Is there an example of it happening Elite seating their power to solve the crisis I'd be interested to see someone 

Maybe put up a a potential candidate for that I think once you reach a certain level of social complexity and hierarchy. You have created a situation where your Elites live in a different world. Then the one that the rest of their society lives in and the one that their society is collectively interacting with nature and other people with like they are in a bubble that profoundly dwarfs and warps their experience of the world like they're looking through like to the other side of a black hole created by their wealth and power I mean you could call it mental illness and in like a strict sense it is but of course it can't be recognized by that because they've a society has been built to select for that kind of mental state and no one can get in the bubble and stop them is the thing because they built the systems that before anything else prevents that other stuff is built on top of those directives. But the prime directive of maintaining that separation is the one that all goals and all energy derives from everything else is secondary and and like the story of the the rise of the Bourgeois in Europe is of the old land-owning Elite being forced over time to concede both by the political and Military Power of the Bourgeois as an independent social Force but also this is the most important part. The necessity of competing with the other European powers and the only time that like a subaltern class can rise to disrupt power is if they have an alliance with some segment of the Elite Class because the Elite Class have access to levers of power that move people through social channels and if you don't have that executive function your numbers and your energy won't mean anything oh of course.

We're going to talk about the transportation of the acadians in the Seven Years War podcast that's an amazing story they just say hey you. Out of here you're going to Louisiana. The difference between being forced and choosing.

 really just comes down to the context. The pressure that they face like they will. They will concede power if forced to by another Force within their society working class for example organized and around executively functional institutions but in the absence of that which is what you usually get towards the end of a cycle of power. They've beaten everybody else off. They've. They've jacked everybody else off. They've defused every other challenge to their internal Authority because remember that's the prime direction of the system they are then left in a situation where they will either be destroyed or recognize their threat the threat to them existentially and to this the system that they claim to be part of existentially and then to do something of their own choice to change it. And that's what they won't do because they cannot conceive of change as anything other than annihilation because they know it's a deep part like wrapping around their spine below conscious thought they know what they have done. They know their crime.

They think of it consciously as their their the much they fear the other but that is just a guilt that is guilt and it turns into a terror of the other because if I am brought low if I am brought down for my status how could I experience anything other than Annihilation and so if that's the choice then there is no choice you keep doing. What's been you've been doing no matter what it does. And that is what's so terrifying about the moment we live in is that because we have evacuated a faith in any superseding force that could forgive us and we know that others if they're as selfish as we are and we project ourselves into others. Others who are as selfish as we are could never forgive us for what we've done. Then we will be torn Lin from limb and destroyed bodily and that that's it like that's the fear. There is no hope of a greater salvation so anything but that basically and without any social vocabulary for forgiveness at any level. There's no there's no point where that anti-solidarity that rep that magnetic repulsion to other people and to and the sense of Menace implicit in anyone who is below us No One's Gonna Change No One's Gonna flip.

No one is going to push together foreign yes like FDR somebody's talking about FDR. That's this is interesting to talk about guys like FDR because like we love to ascribe a a all-powerful agenda to people at that level of influence and control. A guy was U.S president during this moment when like the American Goliath the real American Goliath the Techno monster that besides the globe was born you know like you could look back and it's it's stages of expansion and awareness. But they're all organized around tipping points and the big. One of the big ones in American history is World War II and so you know you look at him and there's this assumption that the neutering of the working class was like the general the real motivating force behind um the New Deal and the emergence of like the legalized labor movement I mean for one thing.

The context of that was that it was a demand that was being made by a coherent and Incredibly powerful and Incredibly effective working-class organization that was making it so that the state couldn't function without its participation like you were talking about when you're talking about like the sit-down strikes in Flint. You're talking about not just withholding labor as a group but as preventing access to like huge capital resources by these companies like that is not sustainable that level of class conflict is not sustainable because over time the working class will bring this thing to a halt. If there is not a come down. An FDR emerges to sort of negotiate away from that class apocalypse and yes that did this that is an important step down the road to the working class political power being emasculated for guys in these specific position of of like FDR or you know the the big new dealer.

 Brain Trust types like Harry Hopkins I genuinely think those guys believed and they had every reason to believe it given their life experiences that the that man was being governed more and more by his reason and that that reason applied to the question of Economics would eventually lead the most influential and important people in the country and the world to recognize that capitalism would have to be euthanized that that there would have to be a project of defanging capitalism and taking it over the vision for how to do that was best exemplified in that most advanced of the Social Democratic states Sweden in the 70s with the meidner plan. The binder plan was a a concept whereby the state was going to and in lieu of taxes for corporations was going to take a percentage of stock every year and that meant that over time the state would eventually have a controlling interest in every large corporation operating in Sweden. Okay and I really do think that guys like FDR and and the and the and Henry Wallace and the new dealers in general that's how they thought it was going to work out that and they thought they were doing that by every choice they made now was that Ron obviously.

That's why you need to be a communist d but just saying you should be. A communist is dumb because people do not come to their politics because of their virtue and insight. It's their life experiences bringing them to a conclusion through experience not through in interacting with intellectual Concepts. The intellectual concepts are what you do after the experience has happened. They are the the symbols that you clothe your experiences with are the intellectual and ideological. Concepts you operate from but I think at that point like you had people even at the very top of power who could imagine a step down. They could imagine stepping down from their specific power position within capitalism to a more egalitarian social relationship and trade that power and money for a greater sense of Social and individual security and of course. Eventually oh what's this hey we get to flower as human beings for the first time wow that's wild but of course you know not even with it but not even with that like it could be a logical choice that they believe that that period could make but now that the the third world war has ended with the final. Triumph of this capitalism shorn of any resistance within it nobody at any level of power thinks that there can be a step down like I mean.

We got the richest guy on Earth freaking out about FBI crime stats every day and like that's not because he's worried about other people that is because he can only imagine living forever on Mars maybe or being stabbed to death by a a other being destroyed by the other. Those are the only deaths that that's the only ends that they can conceive of I'm not gonna. They're not gonna die of regular human causes. They have the money to prevent that from happening but they don't have the money necessarily to prevent the system from collapsing now of course there's plenty of other things that could happen that are being masked by this dichotomy and neurotic fixation for the for these people like the real reason that that musk is so fixed on danger and crime. Is not that he's going to have it happen to him but that he is going to at some point run out a runway on his. This up and I've said before the the failure of AI of self-driving cars is one of the big reasons it might happen so yeah. I increasingly think that that there is a a always going to be a horizon for human flourishing that illuminates like our day-to-day experiences and gives us meaning and and context and values. But that that is a separate question from whether this particular iteration of of human experience directly leads there yeah.

That was funny. They were like hey they show a video. They showed a video on. They released a video on Twitter of a self-driving car just blowing past this pedestrian. Like hey good news. It doesn't stop randomly at shrubs and bags. Blowing by in the wind anymore but now it will just measure the life of a person against your need to get to the store on time and just roll. The dice fact is no one will trust it like yes. That's what a human would do. A human would just drive by that person who's that far from your part of the street. But we we we have accepted human responsibility socially for those choices and those machines cannot take that responsibility so we will never be able to trust them.

It is wild watching these guys just destroy. Every the 08 crash created a I I want to say final because that's teleological overly teleological because I have no idea what's going to happen to to change the order and continue things and we can never know what like what cross currents we're dealing with But I will say it does feel like the last burst of a Dying engine after 08 when our when our last like real estate based speculative economy kind of blew up and we had we had a choice of like okay well where are we going to dump money. Now. The answer was Silicon Valley because that is the next best thing to just Pierce Financial speculation because there was no more place to productively invest in the United States because we've priced out production in the core. This is just as Marx had predicted would happen. It gets to the point where it caught. It's you are required to put too much Capital into machinery automation and it makes it no longer cost effective to produce but you can't pay people to do it because wait. The wages relative to the rest of the world are so disproportionately high that in the global market it's not competitive.

So where can you dump the money into something. That is just a bunch of attempts to Arbitrage existing elements of the economy and pry money from them. Uber Netflix all of them that's all they could do and and then of course there's the The tech economy of like ad driven internet interaction. You know like oh people are looking at the internet. A lot that means eyeballs that means this is an advertising space and then we created the the ad dollar. The the digital ad dollar which became the succeeder to the Petro dollar like data became for Silicon Valley. The thing that backed the extract the transactions and backed the currency and built this that insane Camp. Series of campuses with these wild amounts of money at their fingertips which they used to create yes some technology but technology that mostly just can be used against the population to surveil them and police them. But none of the breakthroughs that would make the future possible that these guys imagine like super fast space travels and you're you're in artificial intelligence. They hit a wall on all of that and they're all hitting the walls simultaneously. That's where we're dealing with right now because the thing that allowed this to happen was Zero interest rate environment which persisted for over a decade. That environment is over that means that the system that was built by it can no longer a deal and cannot as we've discussed adapt.

So there's going to be this last push to try to Bluff their way through by acting like Ai and it's accompanying Innovations and breakthroughs that are going to save us from our spiral of profitability. A good bluff through a bridge to a future where they work. That's I think what they're all hoping for fantasizing they're going to do. But like even if AI is functional all it can do is further proletarian eyes. American workers and reduce Americans buying power at a time when American consumer spending is still the engine of the world economy congratulations you saved you saved some money. Now nobody could buy this. I don't think we're in The Silo because I can see the Sun and you can't see the sun underground. Pretty stupid to think that yeah because like the traditionally my boy Walter. Scheidel has a book about this traditionally the only thing that really the one consistent thing that that really works to exogenously solve this problem historically when you have just you have overproduced. We just have way too much stuff. We have way too too much debt and way too much hoarded wealth How do we affect a jubilee well. You know the the the fantasy that we all have is that we come together collectively socially to carry out a jubilee and that I think is the is.

The animating force behind the Socialist movement is that we can get to a point where we can choose to forgive collectively and every level spiritually financially and clear the Slate and reduce the overhang but traditionally what it is is. War does that war destroys the overproduced capital sometimes it's sometimes it's a timely plague but usually it's War and you know to say well. What does it mean to have a capital destroying War in the context of thermonuclear weapons blanketing the planet yikes like we're seeing a very interesting situation though because what differs now from 08 is that they have learned that you can't just let you can't let anybody fail because it will actually spook the horses they've seen them be spooked before they know they'll do it so with that in their minds. Now there is no nobody is getting left out so that's why we've already had instantaneous bailouts and I know people can say they're not Payless whatever just instantaneous systemic response to collapsing institutions.

It does all feel like something just needs that there just needs to be like one push you know one thing and everybody's waiting for it. But I don't know maybe maybe. The technology has has progressed to the point where yeah like it's just a it's a constant sense of suspended decline without any moment of of tension release yeah. I mean maybe it's this default situation. Although you gotta figure that I mean they will absolutely not I mean the Republicans would let it happen for sure which is the grain of Truth in the analysis of the parties. That says that the Republicans are like the truly radical party you know. They're the ones that generally challenge capitalism. It's not because they are based populists.

It's not because they have any sort of class analysis of society that would be liberatory even just for white people by the way like they don't have a vision that even creates like a white hair invoke democracy like that's not even there in the American right. Wingery has none of that it is pure unadorned. Petty Bourgeois resentment that is it and people respond to that think like a lot of people who are leftists respond to that very deeply and it's like yeah because you're in a grieved Petty Bourgeois too. Of course you see that as as you understand it but don't but that's not product that is not It cannot be politically productive when the aggrieve petty Bourgeois takes over a political system. It drives it to annihilation because as I've said before the Peri Bourgeois cannot have solidarity with anyone so there can never be a reached out hand that can be grasped so that means you've got a you will either be destroyed or you will be the author of your own destruction and that is a act and that is pure in its kinetic will.

So the Republican party will destroy the economy will destroy the world system. We'll put put but not product not behind any politics that can respond to that productively. My guess is that they will just give them everything. My guess is that they will give them everything but they will that still won't get all of the freedom caucus people. But it will probably at the very least get like the moderates who just got in they. They have been talking about doing a discharge petition and but even those new moderates I don't think are are going to be able to vote for any anything that doesn't have Cuts in it and like work requirements and other social sadism. So I could see that happening I I still I don't think there's any deal that the Republicans in Moss would accept for the reason I'm talking about like just like the McCarthy election to do that to just say we have no plan. We have nobody else who we would back we have no way of having an alternative. Leadership to McCarthy. We're just going to vote now and you could doing that once is like a hey a shot across the bottle like we don't like you thing okay but then to just keep doing it vote after vote after vote there is no organization here there there's nothing but the collective Death Drive of these lunatics and con artists sociopaths small business tyrants.

They have they just know and again people look at that no and they see a heroic you know because it's something. Even though it is just this suicidal death drive. It speaks to some desire to shape one's own life. Some desire to assert autonomy in the face of the on-rushing history. The problem the Liberals have and the left largely too whatever the hell that means like just people who self-describe as leftists is that there's this understanding that the system is such does not work. Cannot work is only getting worse but also all of the institutions that make up this system must be upheld must be validated and that means must you must be in the face of them passive.

Basically I mean people are wondering like why didn't they raise the debt ceiling before the Republicans got in. They could have done it during the lame duck or they could have done it before that and Biden said no that's wrong. But I kind of I gotta Wonder would they have not been able to do it like would guys like mansion have said no on principle. We can't raise it without doing something about the debt and so they just said I wouldn't be right to cover for the impotence of the White House. So that's why people want to talk about oh Biden's. What Biden wants is Biden really a neoliberal How can he be again for work requirements now after doing the child tax credits earlier in his administration.

This is incoherent that's correct because there is no presiding ideology. There is not even a plan an evil plan like the the Democrats. The True Believers will insist that there is a good plan with a good long-term agenda. The Democrats have there is a mirror argument that says no they have a bad plan that's bad for us. I think the truth is that there's no plan anywhere in any of the parties because the organs of planning have been uprooted and dissolved by the last 40 Years of American politics in which money has completely overwhelmed the process and all countervailing.

Democratic accountability institutions have been dissolved in it. So I was like oh the Democrats they want to cut entitlements. They're this is they could have made some of them probably do but there's no generalized goal for anybody. There's just a bunch of self-seeking freaks the kind of empty. The kind of empty monsters who went into politics at this point in history and like that is why one of my my single least favorite genre of political writing worse than anything are articles that give the Democrats advice on what to do like say like Democrats need to play tough on the deaf ceiling negotiations or anything like that because you are a betting a lie bigger than anything that the Republicans claim to believe whatever you you can talk all there about disinformation and the Monstrous lies that the Republicans feed their idiot base and the the the paranoid style. But if you're going out there acting like oh yeah. There's a there is somebody who can make a decision decision to activate a tactical plan of action that it's going to that it that has something in common with like the general Democratic voters.

Agenda economic agenda or social agenda you're lying to them and to the audience and yourself. And that's why I've gotten to the point where I'm not mad. I can't get mad at them anymore because they're just. They're just flesh wads. They're. They are organic their organic circuit connectors. Like they they exist to move the electricity through the system. Like there has to be like bio nodes between the the electrical transmission the signal. The algorithm needs Meat Puppets We Are The Hollow Men We Are The Stuffed men I think like like one of my very first Kush Vlogs back at the. During the during quarantine. I think I read that I think I read that's in the Wasteland right yeah. That's that's sound poem leaning together headpiece full of straw oh God a killer of the flower. Moon hey you know what the political system is completely intractable and you know. We're we're Frozen. We have our choice of of of kinetic self-defining action in service of a nihilistic aggression or fetishize and moralize our paralysis and failure to act. That's your political options. But God damn it.

There's a new Scorsese. It's going to drop. The trailer looked fire very excited for it yeah. That's the really is the mark of a good director do they want to make anything contemporary and if they do they either are Poisoned. With hubris or just don't have that much imagination oh man. That's a good question will there be a good covet. Movie I cannot imagine and obviously you see nobody wants to make one you know there were a few attempts to address it directly while it was happening and people were dealing with more of the restraints of shooting with coveted precautions.

But as soon as that lifted everyone's like we're just going to forget. This happened and I mean I'm not I of course I try to forget too because what what do you get from remembering you know like you get the satisfaction of being more aware of the horror that happened than everybody else and yeah like if you follow more close coveted personal coveted protective regimes you're less likely to get it again if you've gotten it or for the first time but there's no way to commiserate about it. There's no way to build a meaningful politics around it. Like the only covet. Politics that have persisted are the the ones around Petty Bourgeois resentment what a shock which is why RFK for me is a non-starter. Like obviously it doesn't matter and people who are still looking for a a presidential primary savior given our experience have willfully deluded themselves but yeah if you want to if you want to keep people thinking about covid. The only lens left that can socially reproduce that into like images and like concrete ideas around it is the ID range of people who were mildly inconvenienced all the Real Horror. All the lasting horror cannot be politically metabolized. It'll be interesting. I mean even the we love to document our recent past.

We've got the new thing where Brands and events have taken over the role of IP for adult films films for adults rather and then even something as relatively dry. As the 2008 collapse has had several films Margin Call the smartest guys in the room The Big Short. There was a HBO movie where Giamatti played Ben Bernanke. I think I don't know if we're gonna ever get anything like that. On covet. I don't know if anybody wants that we'll see it'll probably be a few more years for sure. Well. Wall Street isn't actually really about the 08 collapse. In fact I remember Matthew Iglesias complained he said if you want to make a movie about the about the crisis. Why would you make it about this guy who was scamming people on penny stocks. That's not the story of that's not the story of the OA collapse. It's like well who gives a about that like that's not what a guy likes scorses. He cares about the the specifics. There's the little every time DiCaprio starts explaining that the actual way that his scam Works he would just go like you don't give a about that he is at like who does something like that who populates this economy who responds to the incentives that we're making thank you h . What's gonna fail First Banks or commercial real estate. I mean commercial real estate looks like it's in real trouble and I don't know if the mechanisms of bailing it out are as well lubricated as they are for the banking sector. I would of course love to see a 900 year. Old.

Clint Eastwood make a Coven movie that would be very fun. I don't know this might be somebody's asked about the entertainment industry now with maybe even sag striking. I mean I think that sag and WG are right to strike. Now like I do think that the the AI for Solutions these people are imagining cannot work the way they want them to but nobody's going to figure that out until it's they've destroyed the entire industry like they will destroy the industry pursuing these AI fixes and then in the and then there will be just be gone So they do have to to stand up now but like I don't know if the studios feel like they're in a position to make any kind of deal. I said I'm sorry. Wga not the dega of course. Not directors aren't going to stick their neck out for anybody come on. It's amazing though like de-skilling is the directive. It's the prime directive of automation. It it it's not to relieve people of Labor. It is to remove monetizable leverage bearing skill from laboring from from the specific laborer and it's like what's going to fill that Gap I think it's just going to be more 

It's just going to be maybe a leveling up of like social media elements and like parasocial entertainments. It does feel like there's still need to be like flagship Entertainment Productions. Honestly they should be seen as loss leaders because if we don't have entertainment we don't have anything like that is not to get to Neil Postman about it. But the thing that all of this is designed to produce yes profit obviously. That is what it's meant to produce but like that the profit motive like made legible to human life to to be de-apped to be materialized and incarnated is to be entertained. It is not like life is not to be is. It's not a contest of Will and of overcoming obstacles and asserting one's individuality in the face of of the world that they encounter and to you know have their labors be acts of will. It is to consume yes obviously but specifically to consume stories about why this is all good and why we should be doing this and why you don't need to have any kind of control over your life because these stories are telling you exactly why the world is the way it needs to be and the fact that we're seeing these load-bearing institutions being undermined. This is what happens when capitalism is not in context of resistance from something outside of it.

It will eat itself and it will dissolve from within its own institutions in the search for any morsel of profit in a context of declining profit margins in in aggregate because obviously there's all-time high profit profit rates profit margins right now all in all these sectors but they're just being dissolved from within. It's all getting eaten up and our Elites can no longer invest profitably so they just conspicuously consume like they're we've gotten out a bunch of Spanish Aristocrats and debauched bourgeois the investment mechanism that's supposed to keep capitalism One Step Above. The malthusian Wolf is investment which creates new advances in technology and efficiency so who knows who knows. It's certainly an interesting time to live and you know what we're all going to make sense of it. One way or the other. We're all coming out the other end of this and I think we will all end up in a field laughing at how silly it was that we ever were so scared. But that's me I'm a kook bye-bye.
