Is my god dammit. I got a colic hair is all over the place at this point. I'm getting to a situation where I've got this thinning promontory in the front that is separating like the berm here from this lake of lava in the back and I'm basically okay with my hair as it is like. This is essentially like mid-80s nicholson and I like it you know. I think he looked like a goddamn pimp. In infamous is gonna wear away. It's gonna be some global warming ass sea level rise and then I'm in the costanza zone in which I get sides which I just don't know if I can handle the sides. I mean I'll have to if I have to you know you have to you you you handle whatever happens you know. But it is That's not something that. I have yet been able to accommodate myself too hopefully. If it happens. It will give me I'll have enough time to say goodbye before I end up with sides. Not shaving it can't shave it can't do. It can't do. It can't pull the trigger on it. Just it's a look. It's a general vibe and look that. I don't really find convivial. I don't know it wouldn't feel like it was me and I do feel like there's something I think there's people say like you know hey say. Answer is just leaving it there because it's more hassle to keep it that close you got to cut your hair more often why if you're saying. It is just letting it go which is what I'm going to be doing one way or the other.

So if I get the sides then I got the sides and then I will besides king oh god damn it. The all right. I'm gonna try to see if because a lot of it is getting this thing to connect because if it actually is connected shut up everyone be quiet all right. I'm giving up I guess I gotta use the mic the reason I don't want to do. This is because people watch on youtube say that if it's not connected to the computer it's really soft there and it sounds better with the microphone. But the microphone isn't or I mean. It sounds better with this than with the microphone. But if I do it with with this everyone gives me the business while I'm not doing the stream and that is of course more distracting because it's right there as opposed to some youtube comments oh god. I really what is wrong with everyone.

Why is everyone why can't people have a common experiential like framework so that they have when they say fine. It means the same thing to everybody can we get some sort of denote some sort of connotative esperanto because I don't get how some people can say. It's fine and some people are like. It's terrible. It's the same thing all right. How are we able to have a functioning society with like agreed upon rules that we could all like follow some sort of rule of law or scientific pursuit or engineering. If if there's that much difference in people's experience of the same goddamn phenomena. How can things be that much determined by your subjective experience of it explain this to me so okay. This sounds good but now the poor schmucks listening on youtube. They can't hear it so good so.

I don't know what to do and since you guys are the ones yelling at me now I guess. I will listen to you and that's just you know. It's a way. It's the way that young players are always screwed in any sports contracts. It's because the people who end up in leadership positions in the union are almost invariably veterans and they don't really have anything in common with younger players and so they're always happy to to underpay younger players for them to maintain their privileges as big shots and that kind of thing happened throughout all strata of business unionism in the united states and it's one of the big reasons why when push came to shove and the crisis of capitalism happened within the democratic framework. We there was no working class there to speak up for its own interests because the institutions that had been using to do that had been totally co-opted and now we live in the aftermath of that and I think that's what I've really been trying to get my head around and what I want to express more in a written form.

Hopefully soon is is the degree to which we really are operating from a a fundamentally different political reality than the one that governs the way. Most everyone assumes politics works because of the total removal from bipartisan political debate. All questions of macroeconomics all questions of distribution of resources within the political framework with that with that's gone that changes the dynamic within politics and it removes it from the material world over time to the point where when you have something like say a 2008 economic crisis where even like the bubble fueled rickety machine. They put together after the end of industrialization in the united states. Even that fell apart it was restructured with even less allowable. Argument now the question of hey when the economy collapses Should we just give all the money back to the people who did that and kick people out of their homes. In the millions do. We want to do that well. Both political parties think we have to do that so it's going to happen no matter what so there's no political. There's no friction here but the political process and like our general trajectory the thing that determines our actual fate as opposed to the short term you know ebb and flow of the political fortunes of two factions within capitalism that mostly just change a distribution of of intensity of infliction of pain on one segment of the underclass or another on behalf of the same algorithm-ridden corporate overlords and I want to talk about the way that this works the way that this like creates subjects who essentially are incapable of operating out of anything other than a most based narcissistic self-interest that they don't even know. That's what they're operating from and that that dominates the way we approach politics. We have been d d classified we know. We do not process class through lived experience or expressed through culture.

As experience we live atomized lives as consumers. We are consumers first and foremost and that is that and so if that's the case and I think it is because we could no longer hold. The machinery of state anymore. Like a working class is a class with a a in itself that works on its own behalf a class for itself. What mark's called that's a transition that's class consciousness and we were flickering there for a while in the u.s but the door slammed shut in the 70s. The the thing was dead on the table and what replaced it was this lived experience of consumption and so that means we have to look at if we're going to look at what like the general trends are of ours of our social organs of our of our destiny as as a nation and then of course you know because of our central places in the world the world around us the world itself also so if that's what we are now. We're consumers how are we expressing ourselves because we can't express ourselves through the language of class class struggle strikes. You know paris paris like counter cultural organization against the state along class access. The entirety of what used to compromise working-class culture in this country you know harlan county. Usa is a good example that still exists but it is not coordinated. It is not at the level of anything beyond like an individual you know industry or specific shop.

Everyone is everyone is operating on the every man for themselves principle because we are in this sense of constant crisis because we are so precarious everyone is on a tenter hook that means everyone is forced to choose the most basically the the the illusion created by the total precarity of american life. Post 1980 is that the building is on fire because everyone is so. Precarious all problems all political questions specifically are phrased in the assumption of a burning house with very narrow time sale for survival because everyone lives that way. When in reality these questions are the house is fine the house is fit as a fiddle. The house could provide for everybody but we don't think that way and if the house is burning who do you save do you save the neighbor's cat or your cat. Do you save the some you know stranger who's wandering around in the and for some reason in the second floor or your grandmother do you save your wife or your. I mean this is it's the lifeboat ethics and that is what what we live with. That's the politics we live with. Because of the precarity we all feel and that means that all politics are are based on this.

This grasping panic and this expressed as sadism as I have said the the sense that we're going down. We have to protect for us what we can which is why democrats and republicans align in whatever their narrow lee felt economic interests are they they support them. Now that means that working-class people are more likely to adhere you know to the job. They do there but everybody even if they're positioned you know in that tenuous zone. We all are where we're both exploited and exploited the the stuff. We get we're going to cleave towards and we're going to want to hold on to and more importantly. Now. We're going to want to punish the people who are responsible because if the house is burning and we're all going to die which is the end stage after you realize you can't get anybody up more out of the house who's going to pay for it who burned it down and who's going to suffer and that's what our politics are because everyone is operating at the end of the day out of a political narcissism including myself because we are our. The entirety of our idea of what the political good is is not grounded in any kind of transcendental transcendent morality that encompasses anyone outside of ourselves.

We think it is but at the level of emotional truth that the at the level where you know the things you believe go beyond believing them as words and believing them as actions. What we're really driven by is what we think of as our best interests our best material interests and because we do not live class and the class is not conscious that ends up meaning getting mine and it creates monsters. It's creating monsters every day. It's turning us all into monsters and that's the idea to turn us all into just attenuated strings of neurons who are being forced by the algorithm of extractive capitalism to consume and labor at the request of whatever stimulus or stimuli are being offered you're just there to avoid pain and experience pleasure. Everything that is not forbidden is compulsory that's the end state of life under capitalism and we're all headed there slowly and within and it happens within our lifetimes. It happens in the lifetimes of families and it's it. It's not like that means people are worse now it means that the forces pulling us apart are stronger than they've ever been and it means that our expression our cultural expression of this of our of our attempt to you know battle the tide and maintain.

Some dignity is marked with that it's marked with the trauma of that and I think a way you can look at. That is look at who the last two presidents were the presidents who came in the wake of the 2008 crisis when there was this massively unpopular bailout that no one wanted and both and it happened during a transition of power from one party to the other. This is still amazing to me. Nobody wanted the bailout politically like the the people. No one wanted it and both parties got together except for a handful of republicans who had cover to do it because they knew it was going to pass. Anyway voted for it and both presidential candidates. Running supported bush's plan and when biden obama won he continued it in the aftermath of that.

We lit we fully inhabited a world that we've been transitioning to you know or accelerating our transition to towards the 70s. Obviously but really like this was the moment of like full liquidity of of of the the liquefication of the barrier between the spectacle of entertainment and culture as expressed by our purchases of media. Like that's. The sum total of what we are right is what we buy to watch and because that's the residue of all the other transactions that make up life as a commodified atom but that we can't see except in our like anecdotal daily life. The only expressions that we can access are cultural which is stuff. We pay to observe some way or another an economy because everything has been commodified and the way we do that politically the way we did that politic the political expression of that consumer thing is voting and so our there was this dynamic where our expression of our lives is as atomized consumers composed of buying things and once while voting created this dynamic of a political superstructure and a cultural superstructure and what we did where we who we voted for in in the in our acts. Our symbolic. Enactment of our consumer choices within politics would then like set create a material condition that culture would respond to and the degree to which that vote contributed to a change in anything has reduced under over time to now where the stick is not connected to anything anymore or if it is.

It's at almost a quantum level. The machines are growing on grinding on behind the scenes almost completely. All we really have is the shadow of the shadow and that is and that is and that and that that has left a gap in our belief of ourselves as political actors. Like this stuff's not working and yet we still care and that means we have and the degree and that hole has been filled with our absorption of politics into the overall of our overall emotional response to media in general. It becomes part of our media diet and so the expressions on the population level in the hundreds of millions of people level. The only population level you can get to where like you can really trace trends meaningfully and screen out all of the noise.

You have what people watch and buy and listen to and what people elect and since 2008 we have had our choices and what we have done is essentially recreate. Two. Archetypes of two different um groups of people divided by geography and demographics mostly not class one of them but not in any way the determining one choosing between different modes of value. I guess different like a package of cultural and aesthetic and boiling down to aesthetic preferences because we're talking about is whether you're voting or you're buying something. You're you're watching a channel and contributing to its ad revenue you're purchasing a streaming service you're downloading something what you're doing is. You're wanting to see a certain thing a certain thing that expresses your overall cultural preferences and I think that we can see those both in the politics and the political figures that we've exalted specifically the presidents because that's the biggest sample size you can find right that's where you're really talking big numbers and turning trying to get something out of you know the vibrating hornet's nest of american society with its you know. It's total atomization of social interaction.

The heard something and you look at the figures who emerge from our culture where you also have hundreds of millions of people contributing and this brings me to a subject that I've been talking about for a long time. I wrote an article for it embarrassingly enough now that I look back on it for current affairs a few years ago where I kind of scratched the surface at what I was trying to get at about prestige television and I think I finally getting to kind of get my head around what I've really been getting at this whole time because I think you have to because what really made me realize this because I've been trying to articulate this. I wrote the article which I think was okay but it really glossed over a lot of important stuff and I've refined it over the years. But what really kicked it in for me was the realization and I think I've like known this in the back and other people might have said this but it never it never really hit with me before that barack.

Obama is the prestige tv president and that's been sitting in my head for a while and I finally figured out like what I meant by that and now. I think I understand or at least I think I'm close to it so. I'm going to try to talk this through so we've got our atomized pringle population okay in the 80s and 90s. We're reacting to the the the end of labor power in america and this new nor this new world of debt financed consumption as the american economic model and all the cultural implications that that has further just deepening these processes of alienation. While at the political level. Deregulation accelerates to create all this new explosions of money and everything so the deregulator deregulatory framework that came in with carter and reagan broke up the old calcified fortis business model of a bunch of big sectors of the american economy finance real estate and most for our purposes most importantly broadcast media before the before the 70s.

 the media the television media what that meant was three networks that put on shows every night to try to get as many eyeballs as possible to sell soap and beer that is it and what that meant is television was broadcast. It was trying to catch a big net and even within that there all the attempts to like narrow cast vote for you know like soap operas for women who are home all day and you know westerns for dad and cartoons for the kitties. Those are all sub-demographics within a broader conceived like american suburban family right fam. It was a family thing and it was the demographic was. I mean it was the demographic was made by the media itself. You know what I mean it was. It was a totalizing you know obviously it The reflection of it was biased because of you know racial prejudice and and all of the attending you know distortions that that brings but the people making it were making it on behalf of what they imagined to be an american audience and of course that was a very racist assumption patriarchal. All that that was part and parcel of the social order at the time and you know and as a result but that's not that as bad as it was is not what we're talking about when we're talking about what the business model was getting people to watch the shows as many as possible by making them appealing to as many people as possible. What that meant was television was not a challenging artistic medium because you couldn't afford to make something that a lot of people didn't watch. It was that simple it brought things towards the middle. Like there was there were higher brow shows on tv especially mini series and there was lowbrow stuff like he-ha or whatever. But there was still a sort of a a a self-conscious sort of middle tier thing a idea that this is a general product for a general audience.

[24:10](https://youtu.be/CDkvfjGcIdE?t=24m10s)

Meanings like there's things below it on the entertainment scale that are more tawdry like you know b-movies and pornos maybe and like professional wrestling and then there's things that are more refined like theater and books. In the opera we're right in the middle and that's where we are like you can stay there. You can go out either way. But we're here deregulation broke the whole thing up and it brought a new business model in and that was making things for people to pay for a fee based system. Now the challenge there is well how do you get people to pay for something that they get for free and they say well if this is what they're looking for will go here and here now the easiest place to go of course is below obviously because it doesn't require art. You don't have to have the perfect chemistry of people coming together to bring something that has any sort of you know agreed upon quality.

The quality of nudity or a guy's head getting cut off or the word is purchasable. It's quantifiable at dollars and cents and so when hbo for example started in the 80s called home box office. The pitch was you can watch theatrical films in your home and that didn't just meet because you could see those on tv too unedited nudity violence and then when they started doing their own shows like first and ten and dream on which I remember watching as a horny youngster the premise is essentially this is as this is as good as like a mid-tier network sitcom but there's tits that was the entire pitch. There was. It was not highbrow at all now two things happen though in the 90s that complicate the matter one is the internet explodes and that means the long-term value of pitching here to a fee-based audience is going away because I can go on the internet and jack off why do. I need this.

So where do you go you go to quality you go to quality. The first hbo original series was oz and it came out in 1997 and they poached tom fontana from homicide which is one of the best procedural cop shows of the 90s. In terms of critical acclaim. The closest thing there was in the pre-cable era to a prestige show and the funny as funny as oz is on rewatch. It's interesting because they were clearly trying to make a show that was trying to appeal to a higher brow aesthetic audience and they were doing it through the traditional mode of narrative artistic expression on television which was the teleplay like shows in the early broadcast era that were pitched towards a higher brow.

Audience were largely things like show house not playhouse 90 and like twilight zone or whatever it's things with set stories and and very bounded dramatic. Very bounded um what's the word like blocking people you know people in rooms people in rooms and the need for and you know like the the the popular kitchen sink melodramas of the day well in the 90s. By the 90s the the equivalent the theater equivalent to that the theater equivalent to you know edward albee or eugene. Was um or neil. Simon was like experimental theater moment shots and all that with harold pirinu like talking to the screen and zipping around on a habitrail and and you know being splashed with paint. Like that is a theatrical approach to high brow art and that was kind of a misfire and it's but it's still an interesting you know artifact.

But what it speaks to more than anything is that there was a recognition that if there's money to be made in broadcast in in fee based entertainment a lot of it is going to come from offering a superior product in quality. Now this is early that calculus changes later but while there's still this remnant monoculture. It's It's quality as broadly understood by like a educated audience who is always who you're pitching mass-market entertainment to and so when shows like the sopranos showed up. They were meeting a new demand for people who you know were working. Longer hours were more stressed less able to afford time or money to go to the theater or read books who were more yearning to find a easy way to distract themselves from their growing immigration. By I don't know watching a show the sopranos and those attended shows and the network of you know recap related economies that sprung out around him. We're there to codify a new standard of quality within the entertainment industry. Around this new model. This is essentially this new business model like it was all.

It's the entirety of prestige tv as an ideology is just wrapped around the material reality of the fee based cable television model competing with and replacing the broadcast ad based model and so that leaves us to wonder if that's what happens if it's breaking off and and bound and like being defined in opposition to like it's not tv. It's hbo where what direction is it going culturally if you're doing a fee based service by definition. You're going for the wealthier half of the people who watch broadcast television like the people who don't have money who can't afford to pay to watch shows. There's nothing you're going to be able to say to them to get them to do it. They can't afford it as long as there's a free alternative that offers something that to them is essentially the same thing so that means you got to go for the upper half that means you're going for the more educated half you're going for almost exclusively college-educated people. The people making the program for them are exclusively college educated and what do they come up with what is this what is this feedback loop of people paying for services talking about the shows. The show's staying on creating culture moving forward rip-offs being made an entire genre of programming being created. What do they come up with sopranos breaking.

[31:46](https://youtu.be/CDkvfjGcIdE?t=31m46s)

Bad mad men. People joked about how it's the anti-hero. It's. It's this. It's the figure of tortured but highly competent narcissist sociopathy and there's a whole cottage industry of critics asking the question. Why do. We look up to these psychos and it's because they're us in in exaggerated form. They are the luciferian selfishness that drives everybody under capitalism. Magnified into these figures of our reflection on ourselves and when I say us. I mean the people who watch these shows so the college educated half of that middle and upper middle flop and what do we see. We see these psychopaths and what who operate purely from narcissism and then the drama of the shows is them dealing with the consequences of that that they don't like and they are of course. I'm not saying that we're all as evil as they are. We're not anywhere near as evil. As they are we all have humanity that they don't but on the flip side. They are also much more competent and powerful than we are when I say that they are us. I'm not just saying like their worst. They are our dreams of ourselves our dark dreams of ourselves if we were essentially we those guys.

Those characters are answering the question what would I be like if I was handsome as don draper if I was as good as chemicals as walter white if I'd inherited a mob fortune and was also smart like tony soprano. What would I be like what would I do if. I had those suite of skills and suite of of of abilities and traits and attributes those exaggerated stat that exaggerated status and the answer is we would be monsters because we're operating from selfishness once again. I'm not saying any individual person entirely. I'm saying at the population level collectively our decisions. At the end of the point. The pointy end tend towards us choosing the self most selfish path because we are fixed in a network of precarity and counter and exploitation and mutual exploitation self-exploitation with no undergirding class consciousness to solidify as an opposition and push back against. Now.

That's what's being created by the prestige tv genre that is this that is going to become synoquinon in my opinion culturally with the democratic coalition. I'm going to just say it that's the democratic party prestige television viewers of prestige television that that if you want people say I talk too much college non-college if you define it correctly. I could say prestige tv no prestige tv or rather prestige tv self-consciously indulged in and prestige tv con indulged in as just something else on the cultural menu and that like the whole package of prestige tv cultural artifacts and and like expectations and values are just sort of invisible to you So if that's what they're getting what about the bottom half of the tel of people watching network television what are they going to get well network television itself responded to the pressure of cable by doubling by creating and then hyper exploiting the concept of the reality television show which is the the act of watching a show stripped of any artistic elements whatsoever like as in it is no longer an expression of someone's you know creative will. It is just someone being themselves and of course.

No one is themselves. Everyone is performing but every like the barest art in reality programming is the art of performance of oneself which I could literally get that anywhere. It is just transparent and there was a while there. In the early early in the late early aughts just was reality. Tv is shaping up into a genre when reality or prestige tv was shaping up into its own genre reality. Tv was reaching depths that it has not gotten too since who wants to marry a millionaire the swan where people would get people with like facial deformities. Would get plastic surgery and then compete in a beauty contest which with each other man versus beast where kobayashi had an eating contest with a kodiak bear and if the prestige tv generation created their own characters their drapers. They're they're walter whites. They're tony sopranos what are the reality tv generation the people who do not find all of that pretension around hey. This isn't television. This isn't entertainment. This is actually soul craft whatever the people who convince themselves that there is some deeper transcendent artistic association with a television program tried to talk themselves into no.

This is as good as a book. This is as good as as shakespeare. They don't have the cultural wiring to trick themselves into thinking that's true which is what it comes down to. They haven't been conditioned to think that's true and so this whole thing. This whole performance of quality falls on deaf ears so who gets created out of the muck of reality a bunch of celebrities most of whom are non-political. But what's this a few of them become very political. One of them. Of course we all know becoming king of them all but back to the prestige tv shows as I've said if prestige tv and the prestige tv anti-hero is sort of a cultural topa. The cultural expression of like this greater demographic mass then barack. Obama is the prestige tv here president he is the political equivalent. He is our expression of ourselves which is as a narcissist.

What would a narcissist someone devoted to their luciferian self-pursuit do if they were to pursue the highest office in the land and just like the answer is what would you do if you were madison avenue. Slickster is be don draper what would you do if you were a baller ass black guy politician. You'd be president of the united states barf. Sacko crumble and clear and if you read the stuff that obama has written about himself and written about himself and written about himself. He seems to know that he is this character like he is driven to express himself which is what we all are driven to right like that's. The other part of this narcissistic compulsion is that how many people who watch all this artist all this television watch.

[39:57](https://youtu.be/CDkvfjGcIdE?t=39m57s)

These movies believe themselves to be destined to participate in that process to contribute to it. How many people have flames of self expression through like a creative life that is the only life by the way that means anything in the entertainment that we consume every movie and tv show premises on the idea that working with your hands. Long-term is a fate worse than death that's basically the lesson we get from the culture is that you have to have a higher ambition you have to either be working towards some sort of life of mental reward or you have to be even if you're in like a a condition of physical manual or unstimulative labor. You have dreams that you're working towards mike and so we're all we are all. We're all looking at ourselves through our entertainment is what I mean is that in a co in a totally commodified artistic and cultural space like the one we have in all art boils down to flattery because you're trying to get people to watch it and people are gonna watch it if there's something they like about it and like we could talk about what quality is. But quality is much harder to buy than pandering so what we get over time in every program to some degree even our favorites but way too more degree in others and over time more and more as I'm saying this is a linear. This is a progressive process. This is art being attenuated out of itself as we get micro targeted. The sum total of our of our media consumption is flattery and you say well why are the anti-heroes. Why are. They 

Why aren't they good guys well. We have the good guys. Those are us in our fantasies of ourselves but because this is art because we've convinced ourselves that this is meaningful art which means it has to make us uncomfortable. It has to make us challenge our assumptions it has to make us feel something. This has to be the dark version of our fantasy selves of our flattered versions of ourselves where we have the competence of our heroes but none of their moral character and barack obama pursued his life like a prestige tv anti-hero. He is fully invested in the notion that the world is unchangeable that the fundamental machinery of exploitation to make the world run is an unalterable it cannot change. All we can do is find a place for ourselves within the gears and that the value of our life comes from our ability to make those experiences meaningful to ourselves and of course. We can you know turn that into any other self-justification but at the end of the day to create an impression a a imagined growth a pseudogrowth to hide our central core of just narcissistic self compulsion because obama was driven narcissistically to the point of total commitment by a desire to be to be acknowledged and ratified by power not to wield power because he flatters himself intellectually too much to think that he could be so naive as to think that a politician could wield power.

He knows they don't that's part of what makes him deserve his station because he knows that and his knowledge of that gives him a layer of irony that coats all of his behavior and sanctifies every decision he made which any position person in that position would make but which is another person a cruder person a less refined person. A person who didn't follow the rules didn't peop. Their pinky extended didn't go through the right ideological conditioning will make worse and he justifies himself. In those terms there is nothing that anything could do anything could only be worse and the thing that made it better was him and not his virtue. His irony which is all you have when you cannot find like a when you feel in when you feel that sense that happens that has happened to me of total complicity. In all the worst and most monstrous facets of life. There is a deep desire to just pull your own skin off and and and deny your guilt and that has to go somewhere a lot of it go. Some people reactionaries for example love to put it outward and and and blame others. But a sophisticate uses irony to condemn themselves well at the end not condemning themselves giving themselves the reprieve of self-awareness and that's obama and he spent eight years as the economy was stagna turning into this gigafied hell for everybody and essentially denying a viable future to everyone who came out of the sluice vats of childhood into adulthood that became the expression of the top half of that distribution of culture who both watched prestige tv and voted in elections because remember. Even though there are other people who vote and there are working-class people who vote they're not riding the caboose or they're not driving the train.

They're not in charge of this process because without working class act action without effective working-class organization the the democratic party will be run by people for their own self-interest and that is as members of the democratic party not as representatives of anything but themselves and that's what happens when there's no accountability within a system of total atomization and narcissism and and every person for themselves behavior and so that means that these shows are essentially the brain of the people who run these parties and the people who put out the the talking points that make up the cultural conversation around both the shows and politics and this is the pmc as people define it. This is like the thing that needs to be killed according to people but what they're missing is that it is just this ghost. It's a ghost of a machine and it's and it's not in the sense that it's haunting it in the sense that it's like levitating away from a corpse and so politics at the democratic party cohered around this obama. Consensus which broke down with with which basically broke down were for lack of a successor like that was the real reason they were. After that is they needed another one and there wasn't any but more importantly was the eruption of or actually no felix said something today on the show Hillary was the fx version like obama is like the a the hbo amc anti-hero.

He's walter white and hillary was jack teller from sons of anarchy just the o fish fx metalhead version because she's from the 90s and she doesn't really she wasn't of the moment like obama just stepped into it like a rape but anyway while obama was creating this thesis. This political thesis reality tv was creating this antithesis and because it's reality television and because the membrane of like propriety that the college people have around themselves that prophylactic of propriety that they use to reality. Even though it does nothing it has nothing it's just denying themselves pleasure. They don't have their their raw dogging reality so give me donald trump give me. The actual reality show oaf give me the guy who's only actual artistic talent. His only talent in life is being obnoxious in a way that is compelling to watch and then make him the president and then we got the rise of the the reality tv antithesis and now they're fused you've got the prestige tv democrats and the reality tv republicans and that doesn't mean that you know we're going to get another case of like perfect. Examples like this and I think that these coalitions are going to see some pressure in the coming years for sure. So there's no way of knowing where it goes from here.

But I think that's where we are now oh okay that was good yeah trying to get all this stuff straight because I want to be able to whenever I get anything done written down. I want to just be able to feel like. I have made them my case and I don't have to like defend it anymore that's my main thing oh the other thing about obama in the prestige. Tv so this to me is the real nut of it just as like a as a metaphor. So barack obama famously loved the wire right loved. The wire loved watching it. Many many liberals pointed to the fact either publicly or you know in their heart that one of the things they liked about. Obama was that he watched the wire now what's the buyer about right. The wire is this dickensian foray into the demi-mon of baltimore and it's a social. It's like a drizer-like examination of the social ills created by our unjust system and it even lays out like a case in five seasons and the show is essentially the ideology of the obama administration. As a performance as an aestheticized expression you got that first season right shows the horror of the war on drugs as you love to see in a in a genre entertainment.

But what's this oh it's failed. This is a failed war on drugs. It doesn't work oh. Damn. We've acknowledged that we know that we know what's up this problem. It's bad and we're aware of the badness what's all right. The second season answers the question well. Why is it so wait a minute if the draw if it's if we can't solve this problem by locking up drug dealers. We got to find out what's causing it if it's not just drug dealers and the second season is about how yeah. This is all because the economy of baltimore basically shut down in the second eight seventies and there was no money and created cycles of poverty and dysfunction at every level political and economic life and it's it's it's like. It's not actually that difficult. It's pretty clear. But crucially there can be no solution to it because what is the only conceivable means of reversing this sort of economic trend right you would think it would be some sort of labor movement well. The labor movement is one part of the problem labor and even if frank sobotka is a good guy he has no hope of actually affecting change like. It's a doomed criminal scheme that gets him killed in his union to certified and it ends on a note of well. Jam.

I guess we're not going to be able to do anything about that so the next three seasons essentially find new culprits real things that we can do something about because we can't do anything about that pesky base. Third season is about drug legalization. If we gotta have these drugs. We don't have to be rocking people up which of course the obama administration never carried out. But you always got the feeling that they knew that they should you know that's how people justify all this stuff. The fourth season identifies oh man. We got a real bad school system. If only the schools were better. These kids would get in better situations and then the third season oh man. This media we got.

It's pretty bad. We only had a better media. This thing could be better and that is the way that is the obama democrat which is like the brain now of culture approach to reality this acceptance of capitalist realism and then a jaundiced view on reforms that we should undertake and try to make go but which are at the end of the day also probably insufficient. So how mad should we ever get that we didn't really do much more than we any of that stuff. We said we would we know what to do but there's only so much we can do and for a lot of liberal democrats. The fact that obama watched the wire stood in for having any actual coherent approach to any of the problems in the wire because he'd seen it and that is all of us in that headspace feeling complicit in a system but also precarious wanting to assert.

What we think is the best for the best without rocking. The boat too much to fault make us fall off of it and the answer to that is broadly neoliberal. The neoliberal democratic status quo. It's like well you know yes. This is a horrible unlike unfortunate system but and yes you know. I'm just one of the lucky ones who got out of this whole college experience with money and everything. But what else can we really do what else actually let me rephrase. This. What else could we really do that wouldn't risk my position and the answer is not much and that's the democratic party. But the thing and remember is. The republican party is equally held by the wealthiest and most class coherent and portion of the people who reject all that the ones who see this package of values and say no thank you I'm on the other team. The bottom part of that coalition is no more able to assert influence at the political level than the bottom half of the democratic coalition is and cannot for the same reasons.

It's just beautiful boaters and and and the the small bourgeois petty tyrant buddy guarantees of the world trying to create a fa trying to act out this fantasy of national auto autarky out of you know. A this remnant the last gasp of the of the dreams of jefferson that that anyone could be ungoverned because the conditions to be ungoverned in that jeffersonian jacksonian sense no longer exist but try telling them that and you don't have to because they still have money and they still have a lot of power and they are still a political power and they're going to assert it and they are yeah. They are at war with the broader like globalized finance capital. But neither one of them have a goddamn thing for anybody below them. Except exploitation and misery. They are court they are will. They get any benefit to putting anything off to anyone else in a moment of capitalist crisis when there is no structural incentive either politically or economically for redistribution to occur in any framework and that's why you cannot get anywhere through either of these parties.

I did watch the wire what are you talking about. I saw the wire twice not watching the wire critically. I don't know what that means and if you're saying. I didn't. I didn't get the right message out of it that's not a thing sorry. That's not a thing. I know how it felt it seems to me to have been processed and you can't tell me. I'm wrong obama didn't watch the wire what are you talking about obama watched the wire shut up gaslighting me a conversation with president obama and wire creator david simon. H president praises the hbo series the wire. You why would you do that are you guys. Are you guys getting riled up because I said something about your program. You didn't like. It's still a good show. I've seen it twice. Oh. You all are gaslighting me and I'm not here for it. Not here to be gaslighted and by the way forget what the politics are with the wire.

It's entertainment value is undeniable. The great acting some decent photograph decent. Camera work although nothing too impressive. It's not one of the more. I mean. It's like intentionally sort of near realist. I guess but without the wacky camera movements and there's good stuff in it. I enjoyed it. I've seen it. I'm just talking about. It's. It's residue. It's like political residue and like I see a lot of people saying like when obama says he likes pr. Parasite or something.

They say did you really get it. It's like well. You didn't really get it either. Nobody really got anything you get it the way you want to get it. He's getting it the way he wants to get it and we're all getting it the way he want. They we want to get it. I think people like obama get it the way he got it and that's why judging programs on their political content is dumb because you're just looking at a mirror car. Kenny that's somebody said that the only person on the wire who would have watched the wire is car ketty exactly and I think the reason people don't like that idea is because there is buried even in the deepest materialist. I think who feels capped in this at some level behold into cultural critique is like a way of life that if enough people watch the right stuff things would change I think there's no way to understand people's response to art the passion of the way they get about the politics of it and the prescriptive way they get about the politics of it. If they did not believe that somewhere there's no other way to make sense of their behavior and that is in my mind delusion because everyone's just gonna see it the way they were gonna see it which is conditioned by their pot in life your your.

The magical elixir you think is in there is only seeable by you and specific people like you so like people say does wolf of wall street make encourage being a amoral scumbag yes to amoral scumbags. I am not an amoral scumbag and I had no desire to become one after watching that movie. It's a great movie that has nothing to do with it. Okay good. I feel like I got somewhere there. That's good she I'm done watching tv i. I wanted to get this out there and now I feel like. I have. I feel like. I finally kind of birthed the baby on that one because more than anything when I was talking about prestige tv. I just wanted to get at the idea that that the the the quality that's being imported. There is is a it's a fantasy that we're all kind of participating in will consciously and unconsciously because we're we have to make do or we feel that we have to make do with it and I don't judge anyone for feeling that. But I do feel like that's the underlying drive and I didn't really ever feel like. I articulated that nest as as fully as I have here. I feel good about that most cringe hbo show that's a good question. I haven't seen all of them um that is that what dream on is good shut up. There's a sitcom plus boobs.

What else do you want weeds is a showtime show. How dare you oh god newsroom is very cringy. Newsroom is quite cringy. I've never seen john from cincinnati. I kind of want to I've heard. It's pretty funny. I loved tales from the crypt oh my god that was appointment television for me. Keeper what a stitch and that was hbo in its quintessence there before they got fancy. It was literally just ec comics the stuff that they used to keep under the counter in the 50s and they had. Keefer committee had william gaines in to ask him why he was perverting the youth and it never that kind of content would never cut it with the fcc just condensed into a show guys. Getting their heads chopped off and topless women everywhere that was the original pitch and then they got haughty and the thing is is. I would rat that's the lie because you can buy tits and blood you cannot buy art and that was the lie that hbo and all these other. This machine learned garbage is good and why because we need it to be because we need it to be speed a goddamn book. I'm trying and failing trying to read books trying to write a book books are good folks. What can I say books. We love them. We love a book we love. A book just read a book but when you watch shows and I watch shows just have fun just have fun with it.

Don't get mad for no reason and don't go into a show going how can I use this show to express a political view in some way or like get mad at it or decide that defending it is part and parcel of defending like all that is good against the rising tide of reaction. I got to say much better much better than the sopranos. If you had told me that I had to judge which of those two shows would become the big cultural defining hit come out of hbo's prestige lineup and just by the theme song. I would have said oz all right going out on this yeah. The soprano song is terrible one of the worst oh am I gonna get dccid for this all right. I don't want to get dccided. All right guys talk to you soon bye.
