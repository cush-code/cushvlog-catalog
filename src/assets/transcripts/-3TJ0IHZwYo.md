I've decided I'm sick of lyrics. It's too hard to remember them when I have the camera on me easier to just make noises all right look at that. It's already going down that's good. It's a hot one here. Los angeles folks finally got it. I felt guilty all summer watching everybody else get owned by super high temps. But I was always I always remembered memento more. I was like it's coming for you. September is the month the cruelest month down here in southern california and I'm feeling it. But I'm all right. I got my polar black cherry which for my money the best of the seltzers best of the flavored seltzers also apparently one of the ones with the highest amount of impurities or something right behind choppochiko which will apparently give you kidney stones or something.

I don't know okay so today we're going to talk first again probably won't talk too long because we haven't gotten to the mini stuff yet which is going to be about america in the second half. Right. Now we're still setting up lachman. In this book here first class passengers on a sinking ship by richard lachman. We're setting up his concept of hegemony how it is established and specifically why it declines and because lachman is a academics academic before he even gets to examining any of his hegemons or would-be hegemons by the way thank you to everybody who sent me the last valley. Apparently. There's hd version on youtube which I will be watching probably tonight thank you very much very excited about it. It is astoundingly it's like basically the only 30 years war movie that anybody ever bothered to make. I mean maybe there's some obscure. I'm not aware of but beyond that like that's really the only one trying to think of anything else that even comes close not really anything um but anyway back to lachman um. So in the second chapter money and military success.

1518-15. He takes all of the rival theories of hegemonic decline that exists sort of in the ether in the academy and in popular understanding and scholarship and breaks down exactly why they ain't. In this book read wedgewood if you want to read a one volume thing of the so of the of the 30 years war that'll get you like a lot of the flavor of it and the interesting you know arcs and and allow you to and and as an entrepreneur to you know. If you get the virus the nerd virus and want to read more about it as a like give you you know access to the rabbit holes where you want to go down to reed wedgewood shorter much more literary I mean you know there's a 30s historian when when they actually cared about having things you know having prose that actually was fun or interesting or aesthetically pleasing to read. Wilson is the thing about this book. This is the wildest to me if anyone has read this. This is like the um the modern sort of capstone like okay you want to know what happened in 30 years.

War read this one and it does have everything you know it's huge and it's got the whole war. But the premise of the book such as it exists is that 30 years war wasn't actually that big of a deal. It didn't do really that much to any of the to change any of the structures of europe at the time and and then in addition to that the the holy roman empire actually gets a bad rap as a dysfunctional political organization because it was working pretty well until the entire continent burst into flames and it's kind of baffling to me that you would write a book about this long about that subject with like the desire to basically get people to stop talking about it very weird. He's english they're freaks english historians absolute mutants but yes if you want a one volume you're not going to get all the nitty gritty details like where all the armies went and all that stuff.

But I'm here to tell you having read a bunch of those books that just absolutely goes in one ear and out the other and it doesn't really add to anybody's understanding of anything. You've got to be one of those military historian types who like fixate on tactical movements to find it in any way interesting and yeah. Like that's the stuff that I think I i got into as a kid as a civil war as an american civil war nerd but you know you're supposed to move beyond that. I honestly feel like if you still fixate on on that element as an adult you're kind of refusing to grow up okay. So latchman is going to go through these other concepts of hegemonic design or edumatic decline and basically point out how they do not actually answer the question of how hegemon's decline and therefore are inferior to his own model which he will advance in the subsequent chapters and so that he goes through four basic analytical frameworks. One is decadence the classic hard times make strong men strong men make good times good times make weak men weak men make hard times cycle. The joe rogan facebook potted history that is sort of like the background radiation of like reactionary historical understanding.

You know moralizing and and power serving and the section here where lachman he really goes hard against these guys especially nile ferguson who gets owned pretty good in this section where he just points out. You know there's absolutely no analytical rigor to any of this. It's it has no it offers no mechanism and it also includes just absolute fraudulent information. For example nile ferguson talking about american decline claims that it's because we don't have the guts to actually own our imperial designs and create like crops of dedicated civil servants who will go around the world like the and and assert american hegemony. The way that the raj the british did with raj in the 19th century and that the reason we do we're we're failing to do. That is partially because we're spending too much damn money on social security and medicare and not enough on military and lachman shows.

Pretty quickly like well. That's completely made up like social expenditure has not really gone up in 40 years what has happened is that tax revenue has collapsed and that he doesn't say it. But I mean I know enough from reading other things from lachman and from you know reading the beginning of this book and his specific theory of elite conflict within polities causing them to not be able to function at the capacity that they might theoretically have that that's a result of elite meddling an elite conflict that no no no we're not going. Gonna pay to maintain the the the hegemony that benefits us and there's no central authority that can make us so those guys out the window.

You you suck idiots obviously Then you've got demographic and ecological explanations for decline. He name checks jared diamond in this but most of those theorists aren't talking about modern hegemons and don't really have anything to say about modern hegemonic decline and there has been a lot of actual work done to compare demographic or ecological conditions. There is a theory of that a population the population growth beyond you know its stable point is undermining but that doesn't really you don't really see that or at least lack. Implica implies that you don't really see those sort of demographic pressures in these cases of actual hegemony hegemons that decline which means that's not responsible for a hegemonic decline. Then he goes more much more respectfully.

He addresses world systems theory matt wallerstein and origi and he says world world systems. Theory has a lot to recommend it as a analytical framework for understanding how capitalism specifically operates on a global scale but it is very vague on internal dynamics within hegemonic polities and so it is unable to answer questions of decline because it does not specifically address those and then for the and then in the fourth. Chunk of this the final chunk of the second chapter. He takes people to task who whose theory of state power and and and hegemonic dominance in the decline revolves around pure just material access but material resource access. The states that are able to access the most funds and are able to operate from the highest material condition. Are able to dominate until the second and third rate powers gang up on them and then they decline but with a number of very convincing charts at the end of the chapter.

Lachman points out that that's not really the case. Historically there are tons of examples from the early modern era on of the largest most powerful richest states getting their asses kicked in colonial and and continental wars by much smaller powers and in in some cases smaller powers punching way above their weight and you don't necessarily see a dynamic of cooperation against a hegemon so much as a hegemon just failing to access its theoretical state capacity and so latchman ends the chapter like okay. So why then did. These did the first attempted hegemons of the early modern european era habsburg spain and then bourbon france and then napoleon later who made it gas grasped for hegemonic power were for a moment. The apex most powerful most rich polities in europe but were and were able to build significant colonial empires but could never actually achieve hegemony and ended up declining in the face of dutch and then english power and so to answer that question we turn to the chapter three. I didn't write down the name of chapter three because I'm a dumb ass why didn't. I do that. I'm so stupid chapter three spain and france military dominance without hegemony.

So he starts with the spanish habsburgs. We all love the spanish chaps we're expo don't. We folks first off the gate create this massive incredibly rich american colonial empire but as soon as it almost as soon as it's built and starts pumping unprecedented amounts of silver into the european economy. It begins the process of undermining and dooming the spanish spanish power and you look at the resources they had to access and you say how did that happen and latchman's answer is it comes down to the specific array of forces and powers that dominated in iberia when the colonial project began specifically the fact that the royal power that eventually was able to claim united control of the iberian peninsula after the portuguese war. In the 1880s the habsburg monarchy there was only able to gain that preeminence by striking deals with the regional military aristocrats who had done the actual work of reconquering the peninsula from muslim powers. Like th that is the specific context of spain is that it would it had the historical reality of having been dominated by muslim emirates which over years were pushed back but pushed back by local catholic christian catholic warlords who were able to exercise military dominance in their regions. And the trusterama trestamaras and then the habsburgs who came after them were only able to sit atop power in spain by granting essentially regional autarky to the military aristocrats of spain at the expense of the peasants and the towns because they essentially did not have 

The the royal family didn't have a independent power base to countervail that author the power of the aristocrats and essentially had to sign off on their power that that's the reality of these dynastic struggles and the rise of these dynastic families in the early modern era. Atop these new powerful states is that they got there largely not through conquest within their polity but by acceding to the existing power. Structures that existed locally and in spain that meant these autarkic military aristocrats and an atari antarctic military aristocrats aren't big on giving money to a central government to create independent bureaucracy to extend state capacity at their expense at the expense of their private power which meant that when it was time to actually administer these colonies that they had established in the middle east and asia they were forced to recreate feudalism in the american context rather than impose a state project of extraction. There anybody knows from from junior high history.

The incomienda system everybody knows the encomienda system anyone encobianda and that was a system whereby because the state didn't have the capacity to actually settle and dominate and impose its will. In the new world it gave land grants and more importantly the grants to the labor of all of the natives found on that land to the aristocratic and but not all aristocratic. Many of them commoners just you know trying to raise up in the world who went over there and actually did the the work of the crown of spreading catholicism and and habsburg rule there. And what that meant is that while there was a system to send silver send money send the fruits of trade back to spain over time. Spain got a smaller and smaller percentage of the wealth made in the colonies because the local powers there the lat the encomiendo rulers became their own autarkic aristocratic. Barons who were jealously guarded. It kept it home defied the mercantile demand to only trade with the spanish crown and while the port of the the the city of seville became the entre po for all new world trade They were never able to the the seville traders were never able to assert control over the producers in the colonies the way that the dutch the the way that the trader the merchants of amsterdam and london were able to do for the later hegemonic colonial empires and you get a situation.

Eventually where spain sends colonial administrators from the metropole to the colonies who then have to contend with these deeply embedded local power structures where american spanish aristocrats are sitting on top of existing networks of like native social structures that they have command of and access to the resources of and the colonial administrators basically just have a piece of paper with the king's signature on it which you know in the jungles of venezuela doesn't really put go very far and so you have this push and pull between the colonial elites and and imperial officials meanwhile you have fortunes being vast private fortunes of tit of of spanish subjects being built in the new world. Giving those fortunes influence back in spain and you have this dynamic occur where the colonial power the colonial elites. The new colonial elites are able to assert more influence in the metropole of spain in madrid than the metropole is on the colonies and that means that even though there's this vast wealth being pulled out of the ground in latin america. It's mostly staying in latin america and is not going to the funding of state capacity that could have created what they call that virtuous cycle that builds up a a state capable of not only defending its territories but defending its geopolitical status in europe among its rivals and so you have spain being the subject of every other major power in europe's fear and suspicion.

 you see this group these cycling of alliances against habsburg spain that run all the way through the 30 years war. They're swat they're getting swatted by everybody. They're they're like a elephant getting stabbed by a thousand. Spears they can't even put down the dutch revolt which is just this fraction of their population with a fraction of their resources because all the resources are just bleeding away because they don't have the capacity and though what does that boil down to the fact that the entire spanish state structure was premised on this network of independent basically aristocrats who had no individual interest in seeing the crown really advanced and so that spain became unincapable of defending its own power and soon enough the french were able to overcome them. 30 years. War is a big part of that that really does help put significa Rishloo and the french are able to use their diplomatic skills and their vast resources because they're the other richest country in europe at the time to isolate the spanish and to eventually see a large part of their territo. Their not not their new world colonies which are largely left alone but a large chunk of their european. Empire taken pulled away from them simultaneous revolts in portugal and catalonia that lead to portugal permanently re-detaching from the iberian union and I mean and it was not that the spanish crown was not aware of this count.

Duke olivares who is the chief minister of louis of philip. The fourth made an attempt to centralize authority in spain. This the the union of arms. In 1625 there was an attempt to actually make every elite within spain responsible for spain's military. Success make them all have to kick in but they of course resisted it retreated to their regional strongholds and undermined the authority of the of the royal family at every turn. So although the habsburg state was precocious relative to other states in its power and capacity in the 1500s. By the end of the 17th century they have entered into a irreversible decline which is picked up then which gives the option then for the french who after the frond is put down which is their own revolt because they spent a ton of money and alienated their own elites to try to defeat the spanish which led to their own peasants and aristocrats to revolt at about the same time but in their case that led to the triumph of the absolute estate in the person of king louis. Xiv who is able to centralize authority in the crown but how does he do it. He does it in a way that yes firmly establishes royal prerogative over the hexagon but does it at the expense of the dynamism and and ability to ex to effectively extract resources that would have allowed them to continue to successfully compete with the other european powers. What what louis does is that he keeps the elites within france. The aristocrats the towns you know the landowners from unifying against the royal family and and making them all reliant on the royal family by making the most lucrative path of investment and the most lucrative thing to do with your money. If you were a elite in france to purchase a state office and state offices become the object of competition among the imperial The french elite. Now that does secure louis you know he builds versailles. He makes all the high aristocrats move from their homes their chateaus and spend a zillion dollars living in versailles and hanging out at his garden parties and putting on arsenic-based makeup and calling each other or whatever the hell doing doing bands and zingers just trying to stay stop dying from boredom before they die of syphilis.

But it comes at a cost and what that cost is is that when france is able to ass coming in late but so france is able they they have to come from behind because the at the exact same time that like caribbean and and latin american colonies are becoming like really lucrative is when the french wars of religion are basically making it impossible for the french to commit to any kind of real colonial policy only after the wars of religion and are they able to actually seriously try to start a colonial enterprise but the inside the incentive to invest in colonies is undermined by the fact that for the colonial elites of france or for the for the the economic elites of france the highest return for any of any money is going to be to buy offices so that means that french colonies become wildly under capitalized. They end up having to depend on europe english and dutch and portuguese trade routes slave networks to to get labor for their colonies and to get to get the resources out of their colonies. So they end up having to sell for example a lot of the caribbean sugar to dutch middlemen and then give up therefore a bunch of the profits to the dutch just to get it off the island because they lack of the lack of capital investment in the colonies and of course we're only really talking about the caribbean ones because canada was always a money loser from day. One canada never made money and part of this is because one of the things you get from a you you can get from a colony and a thing that the british ended up getting a thing that helped the british leapfrog over the rest of these guys we'll talk about that in future chapters is if if you can create a colonial market for metropolitan manufactured goods that that is a vast map that is a huge economic stimulus and that was never built in any of the french colonies. The richest french colony of course was santa man haiti where all the money was kept by a very small group of ultra-rich planters who spent it on luxuries much like they did in the south of the united states which is not what you want. The the the vast majority of haitians were slaves who didn't have any consumption they weren't buying. Having having colonials buying stuff from you having your colonials buy the product of your shop houses and workhouses and and your trade networks is a huge boon to act the economy and a huge source for state revenues that you can use to fight the other. European states and the french were just unable to harness their colonial powers until they got lapped by the spec.

The dutch and the british and then the and then had it basically taken from them first with first. By losing canada in the seven years war and then of course losing saint-domingue and the caribbean most of the caribbean holdings during the after with the haitian revolution in the napoleonic wars. Now the french do come back under napoleon and make a grab for hegemony that is spectacularly successful in the in the short run and that absolutely destroys all those old barriers to effective state capacity.

The the the napoleonic empire is not one with independent sources of power. Those have all been wiped away by the guillotine and by the french revolution and a military aristocracy. Basically a meritocratic liberal military aristocracy governs the entirety of the napoleonic empire but and in that way it it. It shows the only like effective way that any power could feasibly assert continental hegemony and the way that hitler tried to assert continental hegemony. 100 solely years later but con a permanent conquest regime in the modern era is simply not feasible in the long run or even in the medium run and so napoleon got got and that's the end of france's plays for hegemony so you got.

These two states one that got there that started building an empire early built an incredibly wealthy resource-rich empire but didn't have this the state structures capable of turning that into hegemony and then the french who had more. They had. They have always been the richest most populous most agriculturally bountiful european polity yeah and that's geographic that's largely a geographic response because of that. Like I called it the hexagon earlier they call it france the hexagon. Sometimes it's fully. It has natural borders all around it basically and within those natural borders you have this just vastly rich agricultural territory which in its own way helped france's economic growth but all but one of the and and capitalism doesn't really catch on in france. The way that it does in spain in large part because independent individual legally recognized land tenure which becomes the cornerstone of the european politi. British political economy that ends up dominating the world cannot really be asserted in france until the revolution because of these competing elite networks.

All of whom are making claims historical feudal. Rights-based claims on resources and on state offices which does not allow for the centralized administration of private property that is the key to the british brenner. I think is is. I honestly don't get that there is a necessary conflict between brenner and wallenstein at the end of the day because I feel like the brenner explanation for how capitalism begins with land tenure in the british countryside is correct but how it spreads and how it becomes dominant in the world. I think has never been more well elucidated and explained than through wallenstein and the rigi and the world system stuff.

So I don't know why they gotta fight. So these so in that chapter. We are dispensed with these two forces that materially should have been able to assert continental hegemony but just weren't able to do it because of the nature of their elite institute. The nature of elites within their country and the competitive framework that it can never be resolved from the center so next week we'll talk about the next two chapters which are about two hegemons that actually were able to estab or would be hegemons that actually are able to do it briefly in the taste of the dutch. Much longer in the case of the english but in both cases eventually brought down eventually humbled although not in the way obviously that they deserved you know like considering the worldwide monstrous bloodletting that goes into building a hegemon like that by all rights the dutch and the english shouldn't exist as people but you know hey you don't get justice in this world and we'll be talking about that. Next week those two chapters and then after that we will get to the second half of the book which is all about applying this concept of elite conflict leading to hegemonic decline to the contemporary united states.

So so let's take some questions now for maybe a half an hour or so if any of that made sense. I do like it. It's academic. He's a he's you know the man's clearly an academic. So it's a little dry but it reads very quickly. He doesn't use the he doesn't get lost in his clauses. The way a lot of academics do But it's a very um. He is so focused on applying like the analytical framework and the lens to everything that it makes reading it very It makes like getting his point as he's is he's making it very easy because because he's not letting anything like kind of extraneously just go on not put not put nothing good nothing is nothing doesn't get put through the ringer. You know of his analytical framework. So I like it. I did not see brandon's speech the fact that people are. Picture of him with with like red. Lighting is hilarious to me. You could not. I'm sorry man if you're laughing at january 6th and saying it's It's it's hilarious watching liberals cry over it which yes it is. You cannot start wetting your pants because some of the most tedious dorks in washington. Dc decided it would be epically hilarious to take their 90 year old fossilized senile quote-unquote boss and set him up for a self-respect good.

Lord nothing has changed about brandon. He is the same doddering doofus. He's always been because these guys figured out a way to just repeat the same cringe-inducing meme. Images of each other that there is no difference between any of them and the thing that really makes them know by the way the thing that actually makes there no real practical difference between either of these groups of people is that they're both voting for parties because all of this all this strum and dong all of this. All these all of it is just to reassure one group or another of people who vote democratic or republican. Both parties have a long-term teleology towards nuclear war with china. The only question the only real difference between these two parties is which coalition they imagine going to war with china with now yeah. Like you got the anti-war you know geniuses who've decided that the trump republicanism is some sort of antidote to militarism lol but every single one of them will tell you that like if they hate if they're against the war in ukraine and america is supporting it. It's because that's taking the bot the the eye off the ball revisavi china and because they think we should be aligned with russia against china.

The fantasy is that you can cut off globo homo and have a a new coalition of based white republics. Go to war with china on behalf of like white world supremacy which is you know that's insane death drive mania but the the democratic response is no no. It's the us and e and the eu against china and russia. But either way. It's a war with china just a question of the alliances behind you when it happens so like there's no. There's no side here that's going to rescue you from the worst outcome. There's no side here that's going to provide a harm reduction which both sides love to talk about um yeah. Somebody keeps asking about the pakistani floods man that's who boy not good that's for sure. I don't know what the else you're supposed to say about it. I mean when he's when you consider a thing like that. I think the only the only way to really like stay. Sane is to take. The long view you know to to try to get your way personally to whatever through whatever kubler-roth cycle you own you have whatever whatever fantasy you might have been clinging to of personal immortality or or social transcendence and just know you know like everything is cyclical nothing is permanent. I mean I don't. I do not have any hope that like horrors like that are going to spur any kind of like real reconsideration of of the global political economy.

I mean that is the conceit of ministry for the future right that like 10 million people die in india and it actually makes people start taking things seriously. I mean 80 percent of livestock in pakistan dying. I don't see it making any anybody take anything seriously and yeah. There's chinese heatwave that basically went uncommented upon we we are too we are in a horrifying situation where we are fully aware of almost all the horrors in the world and a finger at a few keystrokes. We can have access to all the world's horrors and we can be aware of how they connect to one another and how we they connect to us and our lives and how we benefit in some abstract way from from the things as they as they are. But we have absolutely no individual ability to do anything about them which is a situation that nobody in history has ever had to deal with. Previous people have gone through apocalyptic cycles of decline but never with some sort of understanding of it being a totalizing phenomenon but yeah. I mean things are gonna get worse obviously but we're all you all still just gotta live man.

I don't know you can't use it as an excuse is. I guess the only thing that I think of because you don't help anybody you know using it as an excuse to to destroy yourself or to not extend yourself to other people to not to not reach out to not make an effort. That's only shortchanging yourself and only robbing. The time you do have that we all have of the potential for meaning but yeah it's certainly horrifying um yeah. The one thing that you you you nobody is gonna get is is some clean break that allows them to to not have to be with themselves anymore. You know you're gonna be there no matter what and so you have to decide what that means who you are and that is something that we have control over even though you know every institution and every social phenomenon of life kind of insists that the opposite is true that we are. These reified beings who are kind of doomed to cycles of misery and I think you need to do that because the big thing that I am the big thing that that this makes me despair about the american situation specifically is that people don't have any obviously faith in the future or in each other or in government to do anything for them. But we still do all know just by our day-to-day experience. That power resides somewhere and that there is the power of life and death that can be exercised but only to punish and what I think we're we're going to be looking at in the future. Here is this psych these cycles of punishment and scapegoat seeking to to amongst those people who are still like cleaving to politics as a solution. It can only solve things by providing that sort of ritualized catharsis not by solving any problems but you know that doesn't feed anybody and people are still going to be hungry so um.

I gotta say bolsonaristos in brazil in general taking a huge l that some guy doesn't even remember to put a bullet in the gun what the hell happened. He like had the safety on or something my guy in japan out I don't know I mean. I can see it like you say why would you want to shoot. The why would a brazilian guy want to shoot krishna. I mean the whole like the brazilian right is like our right. They're all beset by paranoid fantasies of being encircled. I mean in their case like you know. Brazil is at this point encircled by more leftist regimes anyway Apparently he was a rockabilly too. I saw a picture of the guy. The brazilian teddy boy greg trying to kill the vice president embarrassing. He put the bullets in backwards. Jesus christ jesus that up the okay so this that honestly makes me think it's a bob roberts situation and the whole thing was a setup to boost the kirschner's and the the the that wing of the pironist movement in which case hey well done like. I don't you got to do what you got to do. You know you can't be squeamish at this late date okay yeah you can't yeah. Everything is 

Everything is a hall of mirrors and shadows. No there's no way to assert any confidence and the truth of anything. I mean obviously we've always been living in fabricated realities. But if everybody sort of has a base commitment to the fabricated reality it transcends the fabrication and becomes material and true and that that is what is fraying. That is why to be incredibly dorky about it and cringe. The only answer to any of these questions is is love in any form. You can find it because it's the only thing that can't be fabricated because it is not received intellectually and processed intellectually the way that our consensus reality is is perceived and processed emotionally. It arises from experience the whole of experience not just a abstracted thread of symbolic representation of experience. Man europe this winter england oh. I don't know how the brits are going to handle that but the thing about the bridge though is they're sickos. They love that purpose that was the last time they had any goddamn purpose and meaning in their lives or they imagine. That that was the case of course. None of them actually lived through it. It's a fantasy of of meaning through collective suffering. But of course it is not collective suffering. It is only individualized suffering happening at the same time will the uk end in the next 10 years. I mean. I think this winter is going to be a real stress test.

We'll see where does power exist now. I think the reason we're all freaking out. So much is that power has has vacated human human agents power no longer resides in human agency. There are people in positions of power obviously and those positions of power have more concentrated power over the world than has ever existed in any concentrated form in human history. But the power resides not in the office holder but in the office the person in the room. The person in the chair is completely fungible and I think that is a new that is a that is a new that is a new arrangement in human affairs that is only made possible because of our technological social structure. Now of course theoretically power we have all as humans the power to pull this whole thing down and to get into the t800 and change its programming. But we would have to believe that and we would have to believe in each other to act to make that happen and once again that belief is not going to come from some consensus understanding of events. It's going to come from experiential love alloying and and cycling up within people. Cooperating together.

People are I gotta say. I gotta wonder about china everyone say you know people talk about blessed chairman g saving us and all that but it does not seem like they really have a plan either. I mean yes they're creating you know a This belt road network and and and the the state party is still has the whip hand vis-a-vis. This all these you know public-private enterprises but it still is caught in this cycle of in order to maintain its legitimacy needing to offer middle class lifestyles to a population that cannot possibly live that way yeah. Like if the chinese inherit the world. It's not going to be the whole world. It's just going to be wherever they can project power in a context of completely failed supply lines and at that point can you have a can you maintain a central authority or do you lose the mandate of heaven. I don't know everything is. Everybody sucks as the bard himself.

Frederick durst once said but that's fine we're all here right. Now. Nobody in this chat is currently in hysterical misery at least. I hope not if you're in hysterical misery right. Now you should probably be doing something else unless this is distracting you from that in which case happy to help okay so oh somebody asked about how hell on earth good. I have a couple of plugs.

One is of course for the podcast which will come out in the fall we're shooting for maybe november. We want to get it out before the beginning of the year before the end of the year. But we'll start we have about half of it written and and the first four recorded but not fully you know edited or whatever so we're on a good pace. I think it's gonna be very good. I'm very proud of it But the other one is that next thursday it'll probably be around six eastern.

We'll see though I am going to be playing on twitch here europa universalis with some very friendly nerds who are very good at it and have offered their help in leading me through a campaign. So we'll probably do something 30 years war related. You know like maybe maybe try to unify germany before it can fall apart we'll see. I don't know maybe maybe try to like be get prussia to exist early. I don't know we'll see. I've always kind of wanted to see how far you could push the venetian republic like could you could you could you get venice to like hold together and become an independent power that is able to prevent the italian wars from basically destroying all of those early capitalist nodes that had been built and and pushing the pushing the focal point of british or of european like trade and manufacturing up north into the low countries in england. Good old doge don. Dallo was 95 years old when he led the when he led the crusaders into byzantium. I don't know I'll probably get owned and it'll be very frustrating but we'll see. I've just I've been wanting to play one of these with somebody who knows what they're doing and they they look like they can help me out oh. I will certainly try to ignore the chat oh.

I don't know if. I'm watching that lord of the rings thing tolkien. I watched all those movies in the theater. The original lord of the rings movies and I always like was like that was fine but it never really got me and then I watched. I think one and a half of the hobbit movies. I watched the first one then. I had a friend who liked it more than. I did so. I would go with him. I think I fell asleep during desolation of smoke and then I never saw the third one at all which is the one with the big battle in it. I couldn't even be bothered and this is like this isn't even any of those guys. It's some. No thank you It'll be this. The stream will be on this channel. It'll be chapo the highest score. I've ever bowled that's an interesting question well. I think I had like one 230 one time. I got around 230. That's definitely the best. I ever did that was wild but most usually. I'm sub 100. I don't know maybe it wasn't 2 30. It's been a while that sounds high now that I think about it. 300 is the best was it that high it was like 180. I don't know it was it was in the high. It was around 200.

I don't know I'm terrible at chess. I'm awful at chess one of the worst at chess. Also you can't bust my balls for being bad at bowling. I'm literally disabled okay that's ableism um. I'm terrible at chess. I make moves that always lead in disaster and i. I honestly my fiance amber pointed out kind of why this happened is that I hate having to choose to make a move. I hate it. I'm a libra. I hate it and so I think what I do is. I subconsciously pick the move that will make me lose as fast as possible so that I have to stop thinking about it because it's like. It's just that kind of me is like hell having to make like very consequential decisions that I am not confident about. I'm a big yeah. There's a reason that this is what I do that. I don't actually like have any responsibilities because I'm not built for it. I mean maybe that'll change probably will in my lifetime. We'll see might have to make some changes but situations will dictate that I can't really try to force it. I think for me. It's just like it it. It's it's it's not so much anxiety of making the choice of which which way to go as it is like. I don't know why one is better than the other and so it annoys me yeah.

I'm definitely more of a trotsky stab me in the head all right. So this is an hour finished it up so next week we'll be back with chapter. The next two chapters chapters three and four chapter three are about those disgusting monsters. The dutch and then chapter five is about the the the the reptiles the the people who like discovered an ancient obelisk while digging around in their countryside and then we're all enthralled to its evil power. The british who's whose demonic enthronement in the world we have only ever we've never escaped. All america ever did was was just take over leadership of a machine built there on that cursed aisle but on foundations made by those hustling scratchy scrappy dutch. All of whom of course did their success win on you know piles and piles of corpses. So next week. We'll talk about that bye stay cool.
