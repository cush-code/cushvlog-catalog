Hello hello everyone hello gang hello Kings little Queens gonna start today with a reading right off the bat. See if anybody how long it takes somebody to guess figure out what I'm reading here. Oh I might cat Matt carp I do it. I'll pop on please be my guest give me back my broken knight my mirrored room my secret life. It's lonely here there's no one left to torture give me absolute control over every living soul and lie beside me baby. That's an order give me crackin. Anal sex take the only tree that's left and step it up. The hole of your culture give me back. The Berlin wall can be Stalin in st. Paul I've seen the future brother it is murder. Things are going to slide slide in all directions won't be nothing. Nothing you could measure anymore the blizzard. The blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold and it has overturned the order of the soul when they say repent repent. I wonder what they meant when they said repent repent wonder what they meant you don't know me from the wind you never will you never did. I'm the little Jew who wrote the Bible I've seen the nation's rise and fall I've heard. The stories heard them all but love is the only engine of survival your servant hear. He has been told to say it clearer say it cold it's over it ain't going any further and now the wheels of heavens stop. You feel the have devils riding-crop get ready for the future. It is murder there'll be the breaking of the ancient Western code. Your private life will suddenly explode they'll be phantoms. They'll be fighters on the road and the white man dancing. You'll see a woman hanging upside down her features covered by her falling down and all the lousy little poets coming around trying to sound like Charlie Manson and the white man dancing give me back. The Berlin Wall give me Stalin and st. Paul give me Christ forgive me Hiroshima destroy another fetus. Now we don't like children anyhow. I've seen the future baby. It is murder. Things are going to slide slide in all directions won't be nothing nothing you can measure anymore the blizzard. The blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold and it has overturned the order of the soul when they said repent repent.

I wonder what they meant by having a little Leonard Cohen Canada's answer to Bob Dylan's ah I'm not drunk you're drunk are you guys doing let's see. If the questions are man. I haven't seen the new Biden ad someone asked if I've seen the new Biden ad and holy mackerel holy. It's pretty funny I mean yes racist and that is bad but man. The thing it really indicates is that they're going to campaign by taking all of trumps principles and saying we're gonna take all of trumps like basic campaigning talking points and frames and say no because they can't offer an alternative. They can't offer an alternative right. Now we're seeing this small business. We got a small business a slush fund basically that's being raided by any corporate big corporation with a with a halfway competent attorney or a County Department people are gonna be completely left out. That's so well no no unemployment. No no rent no rent Jubilee no debt no debt. Jubilee you still owe everything you'll see what you can get maybe some Cobra limb Cobra and the thing about the Cobra is you don't get it any cheaper. They just get paid more and what is the alternative. The alternative is. Trump said that he would did a good job with the Chinese but actually no he did a bad job with the Chinese oh. Really okay so one way or another. We are all in agreement that this is about child. Much of it is China's fault and who's gonna be a do a better job of confronting them over it. That's it that's that's the solution not anything not anything that could allow people to. Pot-bellied subs got ten million dollars in loans from the small business fund. It's a complete and then he was gonna do something different of course surprise surprise. He did he was lying the whole time but you could be excused. I hope he can't cuz I survived on it that he was envisioning something different Biden is explicitly saying. No we are on the same page with this minimal. Corporate raiders who always end up benefiting from all of this and guess what when all those small businesses that are supposed to be helped by that loan when they are never able to get back in business. All those restaurants then we all love those little guys. Those are all getting bought out at least the ones that are economically viable.

I gotta get bought out by chains by Amazon is gonna get into the restaurant business. I can't restaurants where like you pick like the hybrid chicken cauliflower you pull it screaming off of the off of its like mutant hybrid freak umbilical cord / root and just like cook it right in front of you itself cooking actually it has a little button on it you press it and it plumps while it stares at you so like that's gonna be the end of it. Like this is this whole thing is gonna be benefit to the ruling class if they can maintain stability if they can make it to the money so mean something that at the end of it they're gonna be in a position to just buy out the economy. Basically out of thing collapse. You see remember when the stock market went down remember biggest drop in human history well the reason that stopped and now that it's going back up. It's cuz statement signals in the short term. They are going to be made whole in the short term. They're not gonna. They're debts aren't going to be called in their profit. Streams are not going to dry up they still get to maintain viability as corporations and that means that they could still make money and they can arbitrage off this and that means at the end of this if they're able to like keep suckers going out there and risking their lives for minimum wage to keep this thing going long because the the money that they're getting is supposed to have some worth because there's a because there's a government with actual like ability to function that like stands behind the debt that is implied by the note.

Then they're gonna come out of this winners because like there was a crisis in capitalism has been since live Indies and certainly one that has anticipated our only intensified since Oh. 8 and this is kind of a way out of it. In a lot of ways this could be a way out of it because the only way out of the situation like that is to reduce competition which is what they've been doing but maybe not fast enough to keep them. Self make them so keep themselves viable. Now they get a chance where they could just buy out you know you know in a with the blink of the eye and nobody even noticing this crisis and they're gonna be made whole and then and everyone is. They're gonna be in the reserve army of the unemployed and there's gonna be a ubi as some sort of part of this by the way that's inevitable if this system maintains itself ubi. It's going to happen. But it's going to most likely happen on their terms and this is going to be the thing that normalizes the ubi and it normalizes the corporate overthrow of like even the middle bushwa. That's what it'll do oh boy getting real with you guys here. And I say that I think about it. I don't think I'm wrong.

I don't think I'm lost because to stop it. There would be some sort. There has to be some countervailing force at the table somebody to force their will and for these guys to be scared of and there just isn't Bernie has been defeated. His his his his movement is in turmoil and it never wasn't. It wasn't even big enough when it was at its zenith before it started going down like the whole point of the Bernie thing in my mind like long term like photos because I'm putting on my plate long term sort of Spangler ask decline of the West Doomer hat and I kind of always believed even though I was like you know strategic or like tactically I might be up on something but at the long-term I was always thinking. None of this is gonna actually work in any meaningful sense. All its going to do is push a process forward when so that or the inevitable crisis of capitalism comes like the the apocalypse of capitalism comes that the left is in the strongest possible position to vie for power in that situation that was always my hope and dream. Like that's what I thought Bernie was for at the end of the day like short-term you can talk yes building building socialism or building an idea of socialism in people's minds giving them an idea that company can help them providing them with things that make them feel empowered in their own workplaces so that they can organize as workers and gain class consciousness. That is the road but man like I didn't think it was gonna result in anything real. I didn't think we were gonna get Medicare for all. I don't think Bernie was gonna succeed.

I thought the ball was gonna keep moving so when the crisis came the left was in a position to win and now I feel like this really does feel like it could be the crisis and if it is I despair basically for where we are. It doesn't feel like it's enough. But I don't know I don't know there's no real way to know so that's me so. That's me guys. That's where I am right now how are you guys doing. I mean it says not the crisis yet. But we don't know what this is. The beginning of we certainly know what we don't know if the long-term effects of the second thing aren't colliding especially colliding with climate change and like the co and the independent fact that there's a fossil fuel economy crisis that no one is saw coming. We're like the fossil fuel economy the entire carbon economy. The petro dollar is collapsing how about that you put on this to shift together. Yes. The capitalism is very durable and it certainly has institutions that are built now to do its bidding in this situation. But I gotta say this is a real challenge. It's a real challenge. I think we could at least accept that at least I hope I hope we could all right. I'm looking for another good question have the pod jobs ever gotten. No may have turds.

I don't know if you should quit your hospital. Job. I don't know what it is. I don't know how supported you feel. I don't know how much money you're getting. What states are the caucuses Oh Appalachia. That's easy no no yeah. That's that's that's a no-brainer Midwest of the Balkans and the caucuses Dagestan Chechnya and all that yeah that's Appalachia for sure West Virginia and Kentucky I'll bow the way through it. It was Missouri yep. Yeah. We're the Americans the work where they each Lawrence's American spirit lives the hard desolate killer. The scotch-irish border Reaver yeah. Those guys are the most like Chechens honorbound. A warlike religiously ecstatic come on. It's. It's very good. It's it's it's it's cance. I don't know about the other ones like I don't know what like I don't know what I know I think Ohio Pennsylvania.

I think h that's kind of I feel like all right New England is England. Right right New England is just England or like the UK and Ireland the British Isles right. The British Isles is New England right that seems correct and then does that make the mid-atlantic and like the East Coast like continental Europe like France or for Italy. Maybe just because there's all those Italians I don't know now the devil's about to be a permanent minority party. Ah it's interesting I don't know. I think that there's this argument being made that they're like trying to become the new natural ruling party of capital. They're like trying to usurp the role for the Republicans. That's why there's this rightward shift is because they're making a play to be the real cook thing of capital and to like reify like social liberalism as as like the backbone of the legitimacy of the lip of life. The neoliberal state you know like like locusts becomes like the Divine Right of Kings what whis becomes the reason for the legitimacy of the sovereign. Like the it's not it doesn't derive from God. It derives from the fact that they they observe certain forms about about like cultural diversity and like that but the problem is is that they have this crisis and Democrats are bad in crisis when when they are forced to promise things they know they're not going to do meeting a hard-boiled egg.

It's really a simple but delicious treat. I gotta say yes hi recruiting that is really that's what Biden would feel like to me. You know the last guy I've eating an egg at least trying times. I only brought one egg out because I thought I'm gonna have dinner soon but damn it. I want another egg. They're really good you know what somebody asks an interesting question. I said should you be rooting for Trump over Biden. Now a lot of people have accused us of like being closeted. Aunt writers or like trumpets or something trump has become so polarizing a figure on my racial and gender lines that saying that you should vote for Trump or saying like objectively that like a Trump win would be better than a Biden won. It is better to adopt a Buddhist posture. It is better to point out one doesn't matter who you vote for at a personal level. It's Lib to think that that is meaningful like the indication of your worth as a person. You're symbolic like people think that they think that the vote is them and that's silly. It's just an act just a booze wah honestly if we look at it. Culturally it's a Jewish one ritual aspect ation. That's what voting is so who gives a if you do it or not or what you do. When you do. It let the election pass through you like gamma radiation. Now that burning isn't there. We are the record producer in Boogie Nights.

This is a wipey not an MP so that's my attitude just to not get battle back because I see people like they're already getting riled up about oh. I'm gonna have to fight these Biden people for the next six months. It's like you've been fighting these Hillary people over the same point for the last four years. Do you see an end to this. Do you see this ever meaning anything do you see this ever resolving do you see this anything other than just permanent self-inflicted hysteria. Like a self-inflicted neuroses let it go let it go let's go. It's my advice. People got what about the Biden. What about these harm what about my head my ass on dust. In the wind. We are shadows and dust maximus shadows and dust sands through the hourglass.

Those are the votes of our lives who gives a blue schwa affectation like neckties at work. That's what voting is. It's a thing you watch. Your. Social betters do little curtsies court courtesies that look like legitimize them each other in their ritual performance of power well. Most people observe non-plus from the sidelines that's what voting is oh yes we need to cotillion with it with the Margrave of Liechtenstein. That's it it's a debutante ball. It can be useful because of its cultural power as an organizing tool.

This is what we try to do with Bernie but that part whatever future use elections have and they do have some I'm not saying to say no to that. But I'm just saying that the your interest in this election is over so you're not going to be doing anything for it. Right you're not gonna be donating time or money for this. Guy that's a given you're not gonna keep giving him any of your time or attention meaningfully. So what are you. Gonna do spend this time arguing with Biden supporters who are not operating in good faith or do you just start grilling do you get grill pilled. Do you just embrace the Jimmy Buffett lifestyle. Do you just waste away in Margaritaville search. It for that lost shaker of salt. Let's do it. That's what I'm planning to do guys so. Let's get grilling. Let's get it grilling hashtag. Let's let's get grilling no maybe not I don't know something grilling related. Let's think of a grilling related hashtag grill pill.

I don't know whatever so that's the that's the argument that's to tell people about voting in this election because I can see people already just like even though this is a crucial moment in history and we really have to figure out what to do next. Pronto people are wasting time arguing with Biden voters. About this point we need to focus. This is like our response now could determine the fate of humanity. I mean I'm not being hyperbolic there. If we could seize this chance. I mean I'm not saying it's likely but if it's possible it requires focus right now and talking to bite and supporters about this. About who's actually you know that's actually privileged of you to say that you can vote well. No. It's actually privileged of you to say that because most people who are not privileged over the Western know Grill on that taking the Bernie campaign and turning it into a thing for local races and and things like that any of it it has to happen very quickly. The structures have to be in place so if the pressure gets put on them they can take the weight they don't just disperse and then the great big power is just roll everything up into one great god horrifying consolidation so my god.

Let's get to that business right now so I'm not hearing any more. But from now on I'm not gonna talk about the race I will make fun of something Biden or Trump says but not in the context of which ones you should vote for or anything all right. Maybe I won't even do that. Maybe I else totally boycott it. I think maybe just like as though as a as a piece of self-discipline I should enforce on myself. No you're not. Gonna say anything about either of them no matter how funny they are and trumpet Biden or - the funniest people on earth and guess what I can't say I won't watch the debates of course. I will and I might have to stream them because I'm gonna be on a lot of drugs but that because it is such a perfect culmination of everything I've ever believed in I have to give myself that but other than that I'm ignoring this campaign talking about everything else. Oh. We got a lot to talk about there's a lot stock I can't wait to talk about it but this specific campaign we're not talking about at least I am we might talk about on the show you know because it is the news of the week thing but I'm going to remind everyone during that that you don't have to have opinions about this stuff but something in the video.

The other do psyops is a future competition with China is if oh I talked yesterday about China and I'm kind of skeptical that there's gonna be any kind of apocalyptic conflict just because our economies are so interdependent and the elites are so intertwined and their interests are so interlocked. It's like there's really nothing other than just sort of pathetic like nation-state shadowboxing to require this system. To have this much grit in it would they make the stuff we purchase it. It's symbiotic it works both ways. It's like think they get to build a domestic economy through export. We get to cheap goods at the expense of our agro streak or of course in the long run. It's destabilizing because it's that it's you know second law of thermodynamics. The system eventually starts eating itself and then it destabilizes but the interest at the top are the same.

So I really think that this is all going to end up being some sort of sin Oh American hegemony. I think that's the most. It's just unless unless the caste Theory really asks bhagavata ban and it could have I mean Trump being president is not something. Most people would have predicted even using like the most you know loose definitions of probability back before it would have been happening and this guy does have the power I mean. He is a actual actor in history which is insane to think that Donald Trump is one of those guys like Napoleon you know who literally has history in his hands. He is history but in the art behind a Tonka truck wheel. It's breathtaking to think that and it's just an indictment of the system that it's come to this I mean. This is the ultimate repudiation of every system that we live under capitalism. Liberalism anything oh the enlightenment for God's sakes the Industrial Revolution technology at all like it could turn you to and completely die for God's sakes. But it's the reality we're in that's crazy and it's horrifying to think of.

But we got to think of something to do. In this con. There are this moment of insecurity oh boy whoo feeling it guys how you guys do it how you living. I say something else. But I forgot I forgot what to say ooh Dark Tower Buddhism okay all right strap in guys. So the long and short of it is is that I a while ago had a few rough Christian religious style.

Revelations that pointed me in the direction of Buddhism is the closest repository on earth of like eternal truth or wisdom of any kind and as but the problem is is I I have a very hard time acting on those beliefs through things like meditation and you know rigorous abstemious. This or anything really and part of that is that the it's like the cultural vocabulary of Buddhism is very very alien to me doesn't really resonate you. Know I mean and all the ideas like you know people you know like a Shinto like a trot. A shrine was like the ball like sitting there like that stupid music with the flute you know. I don't like that music and I know that they obviously it's not monolithic culture. I'm just talking about what my precondition brain stamp relates to it. You know what I mean like I have I only know Buddhism to the degree that I know anything which is through cultural context and then means I get like an association of images mostly from television like a literal stereotype. So that's what I'm operating off of because I don't have a deeper cultural awareness of it because of where I grew up so that's like a barrier. But then I've realized that the dark tower world of Stephen King books I have read at a young age so we're like integrated into my Mitel landscape. A very early year period absolutely contain a lot of the same elements ideas of you know eternal recurrence that the idea of like evolution towards a higher plane of enlightenment through and turtle the turtle seems like the paternal who's back the earth is on. Oh.

He's like Buddhist like I don't like that guy but I like the turtle. So I guess they give the turtle anyway I did watch the SNL zoom a party. It was really terrible really really bad made me my tummy hurt a little bit it really sucked sucked a lot. It really reminds you how much they're pushing. That audience to get the jokes if they didn't have a live audience that show would never have made it past a year because thing is the thing obviously the real secret of SNL is that it was never good. There is never a time when SNL wasn't any objective or meaningful. So that's good there are just times that are remembered more fondly by people. Because of the placement in their lives. You usually see because it's an eternal thing. You see SNL when you're a little kid and that version of the show. It's so formative to your like sense of humor and and like cultural context that you give it. This outsized place at your heart and then you remember the best parts and forget the worst and that's true of every era of SNL. No matter how much we love it now Will Ferrell era which I love of course and a lot of people of in this chat I get the best love has a lot of speakers. Now I do think as someone who's watched it my whole adult life that there isn't been a notable drop off in the last couple years. I will say it's a little worse than it's ever been but the thing is. It was never as good as the people who compared the bad new ones to was but you know there's no there's gonna be a couple of decent sketches in every season and but no but like it needs to feel social and needs to have everyone laughing.

He needs to like keep pumping everything up that way and just having them just on those zooms. Every one of these zoom based shows they had that fundraiser yesterday which god bless them. They raised a bunch of money but watching these people. In there these musicians get into their cast and dance in front of featureless walls. It's just a bunch of people. It's a bunch of people out shat ChatterBait like live streaming their mental breakdowns. It was very it's like oh. This is not reassuring at all. This is terrifying.

It just reminds you how wildly isolated we are and that's the thing that's most disheartening to me. About. The future is that this is a moment where solidarity is more important than it's ever been and social solidarity has been rendered basically impossible unless you've got an ar-15 and own an Arby's franchise and really want to get that money going because you got boat payments. You basically are not in a public context. What you were either working dodging coronavirus not to keep your family alive or your home. Neither of those allow for any kind of solidarity.

Any kind of like public demonstrations of anything workplaces lose our an all-time low for leverage in most businesses because of how many people are unemployed. Now Amazon's hiring a hundred thousand people because a lot of the people they have are sick and/or are staying home because they don't want to get sick and so there's posture being played. Spots are being taken by people who are more desperate who are more willing to work in those conditions because they're in a more desperate monetary position than the people who just recently had those jobs that no longer can afford in their own minds to go to work that's terrifying that's terrifying to contemplate so that's the big question and I don't that's why I think that's so hard to formulate answers to the what is to be done question because so much of it depends on obsolete. It's looking like social forms you know like the public person. Like the Pope. The public human was like our only entrepot into solidarity and empathy and all the things that build a social order. Now we're retreating to just a situation where we've completely abolished the social. There's no social component at all and now how are we supposed to fight in this terrain. That's entirely created as a superstructure of capitalism like we're fully super structural.

Now we've completely like a huge chunk Sasa flocking detection to the actual mode of production. It's wild people and I don't know what to say. It's my party and it's freaking me out so anyway. I hope everybody be thinking of questions and I hope everybody tries to think of answers to these questions but don't spare any brainpower you don't need to ah the presidential election. That's my only request to you for both of our sakes for all of our sakes. Just pay it no mind gone fishing that's a YP not an MP you know the the the military coup might take us a little bit left hilariously military coup partially because of the fact that the military is actually the most diverse institution in America at its base like the people would make it up but also just out of the fact that like there will be an a political need to like distribute social goods. It's such a way to maintain order that will supersede a lot of the the gunk in the system that's built up by the the reality of like a political culture like having Democrats and Republicans and creating ideologies around them and then people investing them to one degree or another with validity and then you know reifying them through law that creates a gunk that like breaks between it makes it hard to like fully exploit so that means that they would like have they would in an a political way just like distribute stuff so yeah it might actually be sort of a populist military coup. I mean I'm not. I don't not nearly as ideological or as left-wing is like the carnation revolution certainly not but honestly maybe a it might be I hate cruel. It could be the thing that saves us ultimately depending on how things were to fall out. It could be this thing that saved people from fascism by by by cutting off mass politics before because become fully realized and fully captured by nativism you know but that's only like in worst case scenario of course. I think I don't think we have to go to that I think we could we can create social durable social orders that can take some responsibility and get some power and leverage in this coming negotiations about like the reorder that's to come so yeah.

American bath ISM I mean oh boy yeah yeah tragic Jameson's been on this for a long time. It's it's certainly that the argument is not wrong. Like there is a there's like the VA is the only actual socialized medical care in the American system. It is it is not single-payer. It is owned by the state VA. Doctors worked for the US government that's like the NHS. That's the domestic NHS that was my favorite thing for my in our interview with Josie stack as we asked him about what do you think about universal health care and he said well. I think we should experiment and I feel like we should try some Medicare for all is a good idea but also and I was assuming he was setting me up to say the thing that like all those people said which is it well. We'll give a well basically a way to say a public option. You know wills will do competition between the private and the public sectors needs public option even if you call it Medicare for all. But instead he said we should have Medicare for all and then have a in competition with the VA and expand the VA and I was like that's just direct provision. You're talking about. So I was like damn. Joe go off I mean like I said if if Josie stack could be our horthy. I think there are worse outcomes of this crisis. I'll tell you that but anyway like in there's a social culture if there's an actual Spri decor there's chain of command and their social provision for everything food to medical care to housing.

I don't know probably not going to happen. I don't think we've got me. See stats in. Here anymore. I think they're all bunch of time serving. I think there are a bunch of just lizard people. I mean honestly kind of the fact that they have a food Trump yet kind of sells me that they don't have any heart that they don't have the balls to do it or they're like they've been conditioned there. I mean there's this new book by this guy. There's this new book by a guy who's like a 40 year tenured professor at West Point who is doing a book that just exposes. The institution says the entire time I've been. There all this institution has done penetrated is is created a bunch of mediocre yes-men zombies who just stumble into one failing campaign after another losing to one collection of like shoeless insurgents after another because they all I do is replicate like the worst herd instinct idiocy of the US military culture and I think yeah that's that's now who's in charge they don't even have the balls or even an imagination to conceive of themselves like like I bet. They even think that things like well we couldn't coup the president that would be against the Constitution but they actually think that you know they believe like they actually in their hearts would think that and that would stop them from doing it. That's the kind of imagine it like imagination lists just dholtze guys who could not think outside of any box.

Don't even know that there is a box just pissing in the corners of the boxes and not even staying to one pissing in all the quarters and not even like making a piss on this. So it's less bad in the rest of the room. I don't know the name of the book. I'm sorry. I guess I can look it up. I haven't read it. I just read an interview with the author but it certainly makes sense.

I mean those guys have not won a war in 30 years seriously. These are like oh and fifty right now in like in since the 20th century ended what was the last war they want well. That's where they want what bombing Kosovo where they buy it. The way it didn't even prevent any of the atrocities. The worst atrocities all were committed after the bombing started so they didn't even stop it but so they created costume. Oh that was the last big W for the US military fought to an absolute draw by the Taliban for 20 years. If we do get out of this thing and I hope we do it'll be with the Taliban going to take over as surely as the North was gonna take over South Vietnam as soon as we left that means that's a loss that's an L Taliban was the government we replaced so that's an al. That's not even you like some people could say like oh you know we technically know. This is a al Iraq I mean what was the point of that I mean if you take the actual mission. It was like one of those. It's a brainteaser. It's like did we win the war in Iraq or lose it. It's like well the reason we were supposed to go. There doesn't exist so like the thing we were there for. It isn't a real thing and now that we know that there was no justification which means there's no way to say whether it was a victory or defeat. It literally nullifies it because you're not judging it by a criterion anymore cuz.

It's like well we stopped the weapons but there weren't no weapons. It defeats the question that's how bad it was that's how bad and disastrous a war. It was and now the country is much more influenced by Iran than us which wouldn't be a problem if we were smarter and decided to just flip sides in the Middle East and join up with Iran against Saudi Arabia in Israel has anyone thought of that. By the way can we just do that couldn't we just do a plate a face turn like in the WWF mmm a bunch of losers losers. They have no imagination like the smartest one of them the guy who was like the genius of the whole generation. Let's David Petraeus who's big genius idea was hey let's just give those guys money. So they stopped shooting at us and it only worked as long as they had the money directly in front of them and as soon as we left they just became al-qaeda or big. They became Isis oops.

Oh no who would have thunk it so he literally just like did a temporary cheat to get out of like a bad press. It was really just to get out of a bad press era. It was basically to provide the surge existed to get what Nixon and Kissinger are always looking for when they were doing the Paris peace negotiations which was a reasonable interval because they had accepted as a fan accompli that the South would fall they just wanted it to not fall like the day after we left. They wanted there to be what it was called reasonable interval and that's all the the surge providers so that was his big. Genius innovation was to do that and then so that that was it and then he went home and he gave all of this classified information to the journalists that he was having sex with and it would only found out because his real housewife from Tampa threw a a glass of chardonnay and someone's face because they were spending too much time with the general I mean come on. That is their guy that's their suleimani that's their that's their Wallenstein give me a break good lord that's their Francisco Sforza hmm.

Bitter Lake is an Adam Curtis documentary about the Saudi Western alliance which was forged after World War. One very bad idea for everyone involved oh all right. I'm looking up that book look. At that look West Point. It should be called like dis so what Wes disappointed that I never lied okay. It's called the cost of loyalty dishonesty hubris and failure in the US military by Tim bakit. Apparently this guy kind of has a house. This is kind of a crank because he had their like fight. You had to go to court to get tenure because they like denied it to him or something and he was able to claim that it was unfounded and they had to give him a job back. So he's got a axe to grind but everything you said make sense to me.

I mean look at the record. We suck we really suck oh boy. I will go on place and listen stream if they wanted me to I don't know I don't know I don't know if I don't think their. I don't think you. I don't invite myself. So I don't know if they are. If that's if you're if you're not speaking for them. I can't say working nine to five what a way to make a level oh boy. I'm in the stable of the horses. Yes I'm a horseman your father's people make fun of him. I think he's a nerd but like I honestly feel like he's onto something via visa via lightly cuz. Obviously a lot of leftists are very down on European institutions well. They should they're awful international institutions they are dog. They're awful. They perpetuate capitalist. Re they're they're they're bad but the thing is is that like I really feel that the crises were certainly sake were certainly worth seeing and that was talking about this long before. Coronavirus where it's only even more underscored that international cooperation is going to be listen so important because none of these things can be dealt with on a nation state level. The virus can go around borders leaves and you cannot have an international policy on climate with the rest of the world not signed on because it's gonna happen. It's gonna get going elsewhere so that has to be cooperation. What it looks like is the question and I think that but so like I think you know anti-eu leftists. You know I brag sukira leftist I sympathize with those ideas. But I think a lot of them are focused on the idea like we got to undermine these institutions. But I don't think enough question has been enough. Enough has been put into the question of what do you replace them with cuz I feel like if you just fall back on the nation-state. It's just gonna be make it harder. It's gonna make it harder to turn to do any kind of the organizing we're gonna need and I will say the devera focuses theory of like get in these institutions take them over.

I mean obviously ironic. It would be funny for me to say I don't think that's a good idea when they say oh isn't that what you were doing with Bernie. It's like well fair enough. I think maybe like the other question is just like the degree to which it's a viable option. I mean his election results indicate it might not be very viable. But I would give him credit just because he's asking the question. He's like what are we gonna do about these international if we just break them up and replace them with nothing. I don't think that's good what if I'm fine if somebody is got an idea for alternatives. But I need to know what those would be. We need to start talking about them. It's trying to move towards making them possible or what are we gonna do with these ones that exist. So I'm I I don't know enough about the EU to say definitively whether I think it's a good idea or whether it's a waste of energy. But I can just say that I appreciate that anyone is looking to answer that question of how to do left internationalism because I agree that what has been have failed but it has to be replaced with something. I think people more people need to be talking about what that is so that's just my that's my take on that whoa yeah god. I'm gonna cave that this I might do it on streem one of these nights.

If I go late you catch me. On the right time I might do this alright on the street and it'll be the most terrifying and traumatic experience. Any of you will ever have. It will make the art but Dwyer footage like an episode to Captain Kangaroo man I loved RC Cola. It's got real sugar delicious Upton Sinclair's 34 book title well. He had the first one the one he wrote to run for. Governor was aye-aye governor and how I ended poverty and then he wrote one called how I got licked which I loved the title of yeah expect that episode. Sometime in the next two weeks I think I'm already about halfway through this book I read it for it and disagree. It's not only is it really just a fascinating story. There are so many historical residences. I'm not even gonna lecture. I'm going to try to be as as subtle as possible with these. I'm going to try to make them clear without underlining them too much. But I really feel like they're gonna pop. The historical residences the rhyming of history the tragedy and farce of the whole damn thing so that it should be fun. I think I'm going to call it epic fail if you know anything about us and Claire you'll see how hilarious that is I do like the mountain goats John Darnielle. However hella Tunes me all I know my Frank Lloyd Wright is that as a Balkan Midwesterners have to have be in competition with the other states in the area and so Frank Lloyd Wright is with Scott tonight first and foremost which means what realistic guys from Wisconsin guys and women from Wisconsin who are cool and it had like good. I can be like right number one in architecture. What do you got Minnesota where's your mark Frank Lloyd Wright. You don't get one Phil.

I hope I hope Senegal. So this did she did she win do. They have the election yet I don't think they had I'm rooting for her. Certainly I don't know if it happened or not I'm certainly rooting for even though she was a little too. Warren Warren's curious for my liking you know hey who didn't say I wasn't magnanimous look out damn magnanimous. I am give me a lawyer man. I want bill counselor Ron Kuby no McConnell will never lose in Kentucky. Now is there forever brings home the bacon he brings on the bacon and the snow I have read DeLillo hop dare. You read. The Lilla I'll read eared. A little help. Told me to read the Lillo -oh if you mean on the stream. Yes never mind that's a good idea. I actually might oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that. Now that I think about it. Yes little ole would be good something about the Airborne Toxic Event. Maybe the movie for my tenor Twitter banner is blue nights. It's the scene where Derek and Derek and Brock go to get the tapes that they've been recording the fire tapes of the fire. Sessions of the sizing according and the record producer will give them because they haven't paid their studio time. Now they're saying you've got to give us the tapes we're gonna sell them.

They're gonna see huge and you know they're great Reed Reed Rothschild yes and the guy goes that so that that's not an MP. That's a YP your problem and they go these MPs white bees. I don't know these industry terms please that's it so that is my embodiment my best self during the soul campaign we'll be saying that and thinking it whenever anyone is trying to get my dander up about the Biden versus drop contest that is why my favorite little thing to be replying to anybody whining about this. To me any Democrat whining and caterwauling to me about my choice to vote or not vote for their candidate. It will be met with the still image of the record producer played by Robert Downey senior director of Putney Swope and father of Robert Downey. Jr. Just cross the arms just that's a YP not an MP. That's it. It's a YP baby organised elections. Boycotts are not see that's an interesting question I have heard. Several people say that it would be better if there is going to be a mass abstention from Biden. It makes sense for it to be self conscious and try to expand itself so that there could be a noted and pointable cost to doing what the Democrats did to Bernie and I think there's something to this.

This I actually think I'll. I'm almost out of time dammit. Actually you know what tomorrow. I'll start by talking about that so tune in and I will I'll be you know what I'll spend the time cuz I haven't been thinking about it. I don't want to go off the top of the head now that I think about it cuz. I think this is a real big question. Really is the degree to which you can create a quantifiable cost for doing what the Democrats did because let's not forget what they did was. They killed people and they threatened to kill more people and they intervened in every level of the process from the tallying to having voting open certain areas of closing and opening election polling sites. Of course the collusion with the media which if we got some WikiLeaks again the holy it would just blow the doors off everything I care about you.

All these things came together and they need to be some sort of like consequence for that and if we could say this is the number that could have been yours instead of speculating that that might mean something of course. You have to know that you're gonna make a make it big enough bike to show strength and not do the opposite. You don't to remind them that you're you can be ignored that would suck so. I don't know I'll think about it anyway. Nice talking guys over. I think I'll put this one on YouTube tomorrow so bye bye guys.
