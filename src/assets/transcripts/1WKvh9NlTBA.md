Thing this is the biggest critter of all I am. The largest critter in the jungle hello. Everyone didn't stream yesterday Thank You. A break. I don't think it's gonna be daily as much I want to make it more worth watching. So I don't want to just kind of keep talking for no reason. I certainly feel more I feel more balanced. I feel like I could be more productive. Now like we're creatively productive like. I'm gonna try to start writing again. Maybe even doing some art and so I'm not going to need to wheat my my brain knife against the stone of twitch as often. But I will still definitely do it like every couple days or so no question because I still enjoy it and I still think it helps me and I hope. It helps other people. So I'll still keep doing them but just not probably every day. Then I try to get some stuff more long-form written down more coherent than trying to explain things to someone to a bunch of people on the Internet yeah. Let's feel good about the world. It's beautiful here in Brooklyn that's right folks Brooklyn New York. They made me grow a beard as soon as I moved. Here. They put a gun to my head and they said you have a beard or your. Brains will be on the pavement and then I just closed my eyes. What's not really hard let me stay so how you guys doing everybody feeling good everybody feeling good I'm not depressed. I'm feeling good feeling fine.

I'm just not as manic as I was because I'm feeling like I'm more grounded favorite VP and for history probably Richard Johnson. That guy was wild poor. Henry Wallace though got owned by the by the Democratic Party out of being the president who could have prevented the Cold War. According to a lot of people. He was his campaign was infiltrated by actual Soviet spies which is very funny and it definitely does imply that they could have had to. This prevented the Cold War but on what terms who knows it's very interesting it is interesting to imagine if FDR had died what he did because Truman was just pointing like not up to the task of negotiating a new global order. After World War two he was absolutely not he was a that was going on in regards to the whole war effort.

Very bad. Someone wants to know my opinion of alien vs. aliens I mean I'll admit it. I am a Cameron boy first and foremost I prefer aliens. I probably sought earlier honestly when I was a little kid. I probably saw aliens before I saw alien I just and that was though that's the one that seared in my memory in the original version with the with the rules there was a famous story about how James Cameron pitched his idea to the studio by going over to a whiteboard and just dragging the word alien and then putting an ass after alien and then turning the ass into a dollar sign. I don't know if that's true or not but that's basically what he did and part of my preferences of course. You know the degree to which alien is overrated is the degree to which Ripley Scots awful undeserved reputation as some Titan of cinema could be further reduced because by any means necessary I say that hack is a hack and sucks and he's got like one and a half good movies in his entire resume that are supposed to stand in for a lifetime of garbage.

I wouldn't really wish what good director had done with the counselor. Cormac McCarthy screenplay would have been really cool to see that with a non hack Tony Scott was the was the talent to the family as much as I love aliens as much as I love obviously t 2 and avatar as a theatrical experience. Anyway. I think that Cameron's best movie is the original Terminator. The Terminator Arnold is the bad guy Michael B that's the movie it's like it's basically perfect oh yeah. The motion detector boop boop double pulse beep beep four minutes 4-minute 4 meters 3 meters where are they man that can't be right. James bill paxton the only person in cinema history to be killed by an alien. A predator and the Terminator pretty impressive all right Pete - it's true king if I of course I would go on a red letter media if I was invited those guys rule. But I'm not gonna invite myself. I'm not a poltroon. I never did Civil War II in acting but I thought it was cool. That's for sure I was. I was an enthusiast for the Civil War that's for sure pretty embarrassing I never had hard tack though I've people passed that they had it passed around you know to see how hard it was. But I don't think I've ever actually Oh God. Someone read Henry Turtledove because it's me. That's no good. He is a very bad writer but that's what makes this books father's because you don't really have to read them you can just skim them.

It's basically like a big old Wikipedia article and you're just finding out what happens and you're checking out the historical references like oh look Richard Nixon. There's a young Richard Nixon. He's He's sweeping the office for bugs as an army intelligence. Officer did it because he is he was recorded with the Watergate tapes. You know what someone sometimes suggested doing a conspiracy episode about the Kennedy family that's actually a very interesting idea. But I wouldn't want to talk about them. I wouldn't want to really talk about any of the actual theories about the assassinations. I would lay up some of those interesting features. But I would rather talk about the Kennedys as a cultural concept. The Kennedys as as an idea like the fact that this wet mouth little turd is gonna beat Ed Markey in Massachusetts probably with one hand one. Hemophiliac how is he gonna be governor. How is he gonna win so easily with no real justification for running because this name means something to people and don't like the way the queueing on people fixate on Kennedy and on JFK jr. The way liberals think about the Kennedys. They really represent something for everyone like they're the crystal which you could really look through the way that politics is like been robbed of meaning and turned into pure spectacle but then emotions get like even more deep and and and the fantasies get even richer because of how much politics is made into a spectacle and and so the Kennedys they get over the time they get more and more psychic baggage. Around them. They become more more totems of different things to different people that's the interesting idea. I might do that. I'll think about those Kennedys.

I still don't really know who left Parnassus. I think he was a minion. Let partes is a minion of Gozer. I know our last podcast sure. Let's guys seem cool. I think we should do the live reading of either casino although I'm thinking more if we're gonna do a live read. It shouldn't be a more a more tightly scripted movie. So I was thinking Miller's Crossing that would be pretty cool. Do.

I know of any plant nerds. You know will is a real plant nerd. If you know what I mean will loves plants. He's a big. He's got a green thumb. My Sunday.

It's nice. It's very nice out my little back area that you guys have seen with a little shed. It's it's coming together. I'm actually gonna get a grill guys I did it. I pulled the trigger on a weber and I'm gonna start cooking all this meat. I got in the freezer. I'm gonna. I'm gonna put it out there on the grill. It's gonna happen. I also got I got charcoal got some lighter fluid gotta up. That's so I might I might feel myself drilling at some point if I can get one of those little holders for the phone I might drop I feel myself growing a little bit boon poquito. The Max Weber grill for the slow cooking of tough meats ah how's that I will definitely mess it up a lot of me too because I'm not really very adapt. I haven't. I don't have a great history. I'm not a great gorilla in my life. I've grilled like twice. I mean I've obviously been a number of grills but I've never done it myself. This is the new skill I'm trying to learn here. I'll probably want to do so. I mean I have meat I want to get done with. But I would also like to do some beyond stuff. I really like to beyond stuff ooh delicious. The sausages are fantastic. The birds are really good but as I said they're destroying half of Borneo to get the palm oil so there's no good options. There's no there's no saving yourself yeah of course. It's worse for you than regular meat. It's got to be because it tastes too good but at least it saves the animals so at least you get a you get that sense of not contributing to just monstrous cruelty. I really enjoyed that the independent state week that was really good.

He's he's he's operating at a very high level right oh. He's. His power levels have never been higher because he's never been more bored and annoyed a big president. He can't blow off any steam. He can't blow up any scene by having a crowd of yokels Bay at him like dogs which is what he loves so instead. He's just getting more and more mad and he's but he's posting so hard. He's essentially become neat. He's become a wildly alienated meet and so he's just posting like a madman. The thing with the he did beautiful boat people again. The thing where he says we're working or we're working on them a cure for this issue plague. We got a cure it's coming. It's okay folks. It's okay don't worry about it. We're fine all wonderful and I was yelling about Obama and he said the day that like the Obama administration is becoming the worst Administration in history. Now humans sleep you are why I'm here one yes true - yes hitman sleeping Joe are Wyatt Trump is here but also it is funny cuz when Trump says it's becoming the worst administration ever. Basically what he's saying is every time something disastrous happens related to this whole coronavirus sake every time the stock market drops though they're 500 points or we have another 5,000 deaths a day or something or there's a you know some huge economic huge unemployment number he all puts. He puts all of that instinctively on to Obama's tab because of not a left to him because he fundamentally doesn't feel like he has control over any process. He is watching be himself be President the same way that his fans are and so everything is being done by other people and that means he could never make anything better and they could he can never actually make America great again.

He could never succeed because he's not actually acting and at a certain level. I think though people who really like him know that and they don't care because it's not about material issues to them. It's a bit Salih Bignell so they just want him to be mad on their behalf for the things that they're all in agreement can't be changed oh the chimney thing I've heard. Those are really good you're like you press the button that it all falls down I might order one of those that's actually a very good idea. I didn't have one that might be a good idea smart move thank you. This is why I want to collaborate you know I want to.

I want to live my best grill life and I can't do that if I'm making rookie mistakes people saying Corona won't change anything I think our under estimating to stop bad. Things are gonna get and how big that is and how that badness is going to become a structural element of the economy and of the country in the world. But they're right I think in the general sense that there isn't going to be a huge breakup right now just because as I've said I think that there's too much interest in seeing the US economy stood back on its legs and it's gonna be hard and it's not going to have to be fast. But I think it's going to be no more a threat. It's it's gonna be like the Great Depression which as destabilizing and traumatic and horrible as it was. There was never a point where dissolution or collapse was really in the cars. Now things have been a little bit different.

Maybe they could have been like maybe if people if the guys behind the business plot had taken it more seriously or you know. Maybe FDR gets shot in Miami which is what is the basis for the counterfactual history in philip. K dick. Span of the high castle is same thing happens as it happens in our world that FDR gets shot. When Guiseppe son we're just happy. Zangara shot at him and actually killed the mayor of chicago anton cermak that was after being elected but before being inaugurated or early Mike early in his presidency and then you have a whole new ball game. There's a bunch of things that could have happened but we didn't ever really collapse or come terribly close and and I think barring intervening of something on the on the level of that for example or a business plot.

Then I think you're gonna see the same structures persist just at a much or attenuated level with lower life quality of life more visible misery more alienation more hostility. I think that's gonna cause things to be much the same but worse like I said I think crime is gonna go up. I think there's gonna be political violence is going to go up but it's not going to be organized. It's gonna be largely personalized but it's going to be all along the same cultural within the same cultural framework as everything before and everything now well. Let's see. The thing is is the climbing rate of profit relative to the 30s says there might be less for them to actually be able to do to stand up the US economy. That's that's also true. I'm not saying that this is necessarily going to persist. I'm just saying I me I think the immediate moment. We're gonna see a persistence of institutions but like I'm not gonna will. I'm not really willing to stretch that past maybe like three or four years. Maybe five I'd say five years at that point.

I don't know when I say things get worse. I mean like people are gonna have less money they're going to live under worse conditions. They're going to have more they're gonna be working harder for and have less free time. The free time they do have is going to be more pained and alienated. They're gonna be more miserable. The misery index is gonna go up not the thing for the festivities but the actual like sum total of American human misery is going to go up. Things are gonna get harder for everyone. They're gonna take it out on each other which is what we do and so that's gonna compound it and make things worse because we're gonna take it out all on each other along political and racial and gender lines. We'll take it out on each other. What is to be done. That's a very good question and hopefully someone will have an answer I hope to participate in finding one but right.

Now. I don't have it Japan when I'm unable to win Germany Japan couldn't want anything by themselves. They were they attacked Pearl Harbor because they were already materially being pinched by the US oil embargo. By the end of the war they were basically out of everything whereas the US was was had more of anything that they'd ever had before they'd built capacity. While their capacity was being totally exhausted a lot of not a lot of juice to squeeze there and yeah they had to hatch the shittiest armaments as well. Why didn't the Soviets invade northern Japan I mean for the same reason. They pulled support from the Greek communists and and you know rolled up a curtain because at the end of the war Stalin was all about securing his his persistence and his government's persistence well could rebuild from having its industrial capacity gutted in its population decimated and so that means they weren't in an expansionist mode at all and that was one of the big crimes of the Cold War was tragedies of the opening of the Cold War is that the u.s. Set the terms by approaching the Soviets as as bent on expansion and as they're that making their mission then therefore containing that expansion which just started a you know a mutual a distrust that became mutual and then reified over time.

I do think asking a saintly asking what is to be done. I do think that if you do have a job and you know you know of any effort to what worker to to organize the workplace by God I mean don't do it stupidly or don't do it haphazardly and certainly don't do it for the clout but aid any any organizing effort. You find. Somebody asks do you think a luxembourgish German Communist revolution would have fared better than the USA or other socialist nations. I don't see how that would not have resulted in French and British intervention on to the continent. Again I mean unless they were stopped by you know internal dissent which is the dream of the of the worldwide wars that France and Britain mobilized to stop the German communists but then the working classes of German of England and France exhausted from the fight not willing to fight for capitalism. They've massed they spot they strike and then and then that that would have been basically the end of it. That was the whole but I think the durability of bushwa institutions in Germany. I don't think that the I don't think that the balance of powers there is notably any different in France or in Britain to prevent the same situation of people basically hewing to reform to avoid the real terror and uncertainty of a revolution because it's like that's what it came down to with the SDP is that they had too much to lose you know the end. The Communist Manifesto ends with you have nothing to lose but your chains. But there are a lot of workers and party officials and party figures and members of parliament on the SDP who felt that they actually didn't have something to lose.

That's the been the key to stifling class consciousness. One of the keys to stifling class consciousness in advanced countries ever since and it's the kind of thing that the Soviets did the Bolsheviks didn't have to deal with because there was no there was there was no durable middle class or even like compromised labour aristocracy or party apparatchiks to suborn into support of bushwa institutions. It was just a bunch of peasants than a small sliver of hyper exploited hyper exploited urban laborers and then basically the cops like from the Cossacks to the police to Crona - the Romanovs and their the the Finn little rim of well boo schwa people around them to service them so there was no resistance along that axis which is what happened in Germany and presumably what would have happened in Britain or in France should the left infiltrate biker and prison gangs I'm trying to imagine the left as I understand it doing that and it's very funny. I mean are we talking like DSA guys. DSA peered caucus guys going into the Hells Angels wearing a cut. I don't know how that would go somebody says in the in.

The somebody says that somebody claims that the Communists in the 20s and 30s Germany and whymark Germany didn't work with the with the SDP because they were not radical enough for them well. Part of that is because of the Moscow lied the the the third the third position. This line that that was scrapped as soon as the Nazis came to power a replace with the popular front line which said socialist booze wall parties are essentially as bad or worse than fascists because they. Uphold and reify and justify the capitalist system. They're your biggest enemies that was part of it. But that wasn't just orders for Moscow that was rooted in the fact that when the Communists tried to overthrow capitalism during the Revolutionary ferment at the end of World War one the Socialists not only didn't come along. The ones in government were the ones who created the fry core to put them down the ones who recruited to mobilize troops who were led by right-wing Psychopaths and had them put down the revolution and then those guys ended up being the embryo for the stormtroopers and the Nazi Party right. They're created by the socialists to put down the Communists. So there was there was mutual bundling and up and neither of them bid and it's both their fault for that reason. But it's it didn't.

It's not like it came out of nowhere or like. It was just imposed by Moscow or that it was just purity politics why am I so much so invested in US electoral ism. I don't understand what that means I live in the United States of America. I don't get a choice on what to invest in politically I have to deal with the country as it existed with the institutions in it that exist and the way that people relate to those institutions. You can ignore electoral ism or whatever the hell that even means elections if you want that's fine but you will have a incomplete and an inadequate understanding of the situation. I'm sorry why was the Spanish Civil War lost its short fake friends. Fake friends man what kind of snack when I compare Trump to well he's kind of orange looking like that's the color of his skin. His weird tan makes them look orange the Spray stuff so what's an orange snack like those Howard Johnson push pops. You know what I'm talking about the orange push pops Doritos Doritos. Yeah I think a Dorito or maybe Fritos. I think he looks like a frito. He's a dang frito folks. The president is a freaking freaking freedom. He's a goddamn frito creamsicle is what I was trying to think of no not of creamsicle. Thank you he's a freakin frito and I mean I've had it. I've had it up to here with him and his ways Hannah with his shenanigans.

I want to do an episode somebody's asking about the Spanish Civil War. I want again. I want to do an episode about the Spanish Civil War just to see if I could get everyone equally mad at me that would be like all because I would want to give everybody I want to give every side some sort of critical like sympathetic rendering of their point of view and hopefully that will piss off every single faction of people who get really really wired and really really psyched about the Spanish Civil War and have very strong opinions. My media. Blitz. I don't know people ask me to go on things and I'll usually say yes not to everybody but if I don't think you're a weirdo and I don't know anything awful about you.

I'll probably say yes who's the current rightful heir to the Roman Empire. Well. I would say the closest thing we have would be the Habsburg line that ended the Holy Roman Empire and there's a guy who's like a Duke of Bavaria or something. He is also the Pretender to the British throne from the Stuart line and therefore the Pretender to the throne of the United States. So he is essentially a world Emperor so that's gotta be that guy he would. He is yeah. He's the Stuart pretender. He's also a Habsburg so he is. He is the guy right Holy Roman Emperor King of England and of its colonies Oh God Stacey Abrams man.

She must look so pitch. She looks so pissed I gotta say she has very she has owned herself pretty badly in in this whole thing she has not. She's done the one thing you're not supposed to do with vice-presidents. Specifically. The rules with president vary depending on who you are you know you can look like you want to be president at some point but you can never look like you want to be vice president. You can never look like you want to be vice president for a minute until they give it to you. You cannot look like you want to be vice president because who the job it is as John Nance Garner said as useless as useless as a I believe you said a bucket of warm piss. No one wants it. It's the booby prize and when you say want it and are thirsty you look like. This person has no real they have no dignity. They're saying I will willingly sit there on my ass for four years doing nothing just on a chance that I might become president. Someday. I will suck on tit for four years minimum even though it's very rare. It's only happened twice. You know that someone went from being to term VP to being the president only twice Martin Van Buren and George HW Bush. So it's a loser position and you want to sit there pathetic. But the liberal love for Stacey Abrams is fantastic and it really is perfect. She is the ideal candidate for liberals because she is know she has no power. She lost her race so she is just this pure element of potential. She could do anything she could cure racism. She could break up the banks and cure racism. She could be like the mahdi of liberalism but and because there's no there's a record.

You can. There's no stopping that thought now like they know and so you can do any amount of compromises. Now like you can hold your nose and vote for Joe Biden. The disgusting sex criminal senile not reactionary flat-out reactionary. You kids very few. Liberals are able to make any kind of compelling case for Biden on the merits. It's all you know greater good and when they're closing their eyes and voting for Biden. They're imagining Stacey Abrams and they're saying that no however awful it might feel the vote for Biden that it'll be redeemed when Stacey Abrams becomes president and rids the land of evil and there will always be somebody there to be that person. And if and if Stacey Abrams becomes president and she can't get it done the way Obama didn't well you know we didn't try. We didn't want it hard enough or they were too mean and we didn't beat them enough.

We were there were people who doubted her. It's it's sort of like a Tinkerbell fit like Obama failed because people on the Left didn't believe in him hard enough and so if Stacey Abrams fails it will be because the left didn't believe in him. Hard enough pure Tinkerbell clap for the fairy thing but yeah show some self-respect. Miss Abrams good going to having a photo shoot in a cape oh my god that's like when Shaun young I don't know if you guys are aware of this but Sean Young who is an actress just been in things in a while she was kind of a big star in the 90s she got she's notorious for her tempestuous and and publicly scandalous relationship with James Woods but at one point and I think stims which actually had to take out a restraining order on her or claimed a restraining order on her at one point and when they were making they were they were auditioning for Batman Returns which was gonna be huge because Batman had been gigantic but basically every actress um okay in Hollywood audition for Catwoman.

They all wanted to be Catwoman so Michelle Pfeiffer of course got it but everybody who has anybody wanted it and the way that Sean young showed her devotion is. She showed up to the audition in a cat suit that she had made then didn't work but that's what stacy abrams feels like what running around in a cape trying to be vice president and also stacy abrams. Honestly. It was very dumb if she thought she was gonna be the VP because in this specific instance with Biden being so old and so clearly out of touch and so clearly unable to make decisions. Then the VP and frail physically frail. The VP is gonna be one of the people actually running things depending on who it is. So. There are gonna be a lot of people with model work juice in the Democratic Party that a failed gubernatorial candidate who are gonna want to buy to that Apple before they let her have it unless they've decided that they're allowing pout and divide to lose and they would prefer to allow Trump to be wholly responsible for the the response that they know. It's coming to this like it at the various highest levels of the Democratic Party.

They got to know that nothing is gonna work. They're not gonna fix anything. The economy is going to crater and then struggle and people are gonna keep dying in huge numbers for the foreseeable future. No matter who's president wouldn't you rather have the other party in charge of that. It's a real concern so some of them might have decided you know what. Then we can just run fundraise off Trump for eight four years and then win or not hey we're still in charge and we haven't become. We haven't fatally fractured our party because they have to have taken a little bit of a scare from Bernie. I mean none of them wanted set Biden. They had to fall back on Biden so clearly. They had they got a scare put in there by Bernie and them governing as a right-wing party as the austerity party you know Biden as the Hunger. The hunger Chancellor. That's gonna make the threat from the left more serious so why not just allow all the anger to go on Trump. So I have no idea whether they're trying to win or not.

I mean when you see them saying stuff like Latinos are not considered are not a necessary part of our coalition or whatever it makes you think maybe. They actually don't want to win because when was a little time that they've won the only time the Democrats have swept into office is after prefer prolonged disillusionment with Republican rule after 12 years of Bush Reagan and a small well time recession and after eight years of Bush that led to an attempted a city being destroyed a failed war and that goddamn economic collapse. There they rule not by positive argument but by comparison to a worse alternative. I mean it's their only pitch during every election and so it only works when the conditions are right now that could be now - because we have another recession / depression coming but because of the fact that it's all part of this virus the blame thing is going to be more complicated. It's not necessarily going to all flow to the president the way that it usually does the way that Bush's approval rating was in the 20s by the end of his term impossible. Now they'll never happen no matter how bad this gets the people who like Trump now will never blame him for it.

No matter what they cannot make that connection. It is the Chinese or acephate news media. They will never do that and honestly consum was if Biden did get in there and was miserable and like a Grover Cleveland second term. He would be very unpopular and the left of course was excoriated but those MSNBC listeners would love him and they would blame. The Republicans get a fresh cut. You are aware that we're in a quarantine and I live in the quarantine capital of the world right.

Now that's been extended into mid-june minimum. We're not leaving it. There's no gonna be any place to get a fresh cut sir. If I want to cut him. Gonna have to do it. Myself. I'd have to cut my own goddamn here and I might do that I might do it. I have the Clippers. I might do it so people keep telling me to shave my head but someone whose aesthetics I I trust told me by all means do not do that do not do it. So now. I don't know what to believe. God is somebody putting one of those weird things into the chat. I would never do a ponytail that's for sure top knot never how dare you yeah monks tonsure. I basically have one already. I've already got amongst tonsure. I'm never gonna do a ponytail of any kind. That's just I'm sorry guys. I that's one of those things I was not raised that way. I'll just say that I was not raised for long hair of any kind long hair and flip flops or tunes that are absolute lines that I cannot cross no sides yeah. I can't I've thought of myself with sides and it is too grim to contemplate hopefully. It won't come to that it's falling out slowly enough that I don't think a lot of sides until I won't care anymore. But for now. I'm just gonna hold on to my little my little Peninsula. A little for Lord hope up there. Oh God someone's threatening to photoshop me with different haircuts. I don't know if I could handle it and I afraid this. The strain would be more than I could bear.

We might do an episode on Southland. Tales however has a heck of a flip flick. We should honestly do a commentary track for it. I also need to re-watch the hair advice remember be underwhelmed by it at the time. But I think I need to give it another look. It was on streaming services for a while and of course. Now I want to see it and my computer heard me say I wanted to see it and it took it off the service. For me. We all know that they would do that right. We all know that all of our devices can hear us and they are programmed so that if you say oh I want to see that any name they hear it or if you write it down. You tweet it you put it on a text or an email. They see it and then they go into your computer and when you go to find a movie for your computer or your smart device. It's not. It's not free anymore. You got a pot you got to rent it. That's how they squeeze the juice the sweetest juice somebody asked which which purged bolshevik what they were. They said that they were both pikarin to which I say Wow peasants much you want to smooch them. You want to kiss the peasantry. I probably I mean realistically boozing OVF come on excitable little little fancy lad foppish gentlemen get better at pirating. Buddy. I don't know how to do any of that thing. I cannot pirate anything I do not know how to do it. I cannot do it well who doesn't want to be : ty come on died. I read part of the Port Huron Statement. During the episode I did on the Weather Underground.

Somebody wants to know about Marx's abolition of the family. He was essentially saying that that the hierarchy and abuse within a family is directly mirrored within by capitalism but it's actually taint of hierarchy of domestic labor two mirrors wage labor and that if you got rid of the wage labor exploitation system that the that structure would no longer provide preside in the family so the family as we understand it as a hierarchical exploitative machine for prefer domestic labor would no longer persist. Doesn't mean people wouldn't have families. I mean said wouldn't have people. They loved and wanted to be monogamous with and have children with but their relationship would not be would not be dictated by the mean to extract surplus labor basically at a domestic level which is why it's always funny when people want to talk about like a Marx wanted to abolish the family. Like in the context of this current neoliberal barrage on all all institutions. I don't think that's what he was talking about was.

Occultism is associated in America and them in the Victorian era with the left as it is in Ireland. That's an interesting question I'm assuming you're talking about things like the order of the Golden Dawn Yeats and all that not really because there was there was an actual working-class movement and that was mostly middle-class. There was a middle class social affectation so there were more actual working-class people so there's agree to which your your like your your movement is dominated by the middle class is a degree to which it's going to be dominated by middle-class mores which is what's so frustrating about all the arguments about DSA culture that have had gone on over the past four years. All of them at the level of like the DSA is to or not to walk or whatever some of them even referencing the fact that a lot of it reflects the class character and the organization but without any real any discussion of the fact that well if there were more if there was like an organic connection between working-class people of any kind and this organization. Then this wouldn't be an issue. It would have solved itself because just people would find a new level of conversation and they would find a level like of exchange of communication that would squeeze out the bad faith actors and the hysterics and none of the none of all the arguing that went on for years over that actually point pointed towards the resolution of that problem other than to say well if people didn't talk like that. There would be more working-class people which reverses the order of the operation and reverses. It's like all that precious TSA language is more a product of the class character of the organization than the thing that created that made it that way.

And I think that Bernice and the Bernie Sanders campaign has shown conclusively that there is a broken that there's some sort of disconnect between the broader working-class and the very idea of socialism oh the idea of socialism as like a political project and that disconnect is not and address because I don't think anybody understands how and so people end up fighting a lot more the level of culture because it's it's something they understand at least and something they could get their hands head around which is hard for something like this where all the methods of your disposal are already proved okay unable to do the thing that you wanted to do so you have to basically invent a new tool. You've been a new system and that's always very hard right. Joe rogan like Joe Rogan's whole thing about the team that is just a a meathead trying to feel his way blindly towards the L addicted describe the elephant that's the part of the elephant of like a social consciousness that he is able to grab which is of course you know as reduced and and warped as any of ours. But he has no vocabulary. He has no vocabulary to express it. So he's making his own and that's good and it shows the instincts are there. The problem is is that the translation from one set of concepts and one set of understandings to another requires a mutual good-faith movement towards one another that hasn't been initiated and I don't know how can be everybody is everyone is digging up you know everyone is at the end of that.

Simpsons episode digging up and it's just because that's all you have you have a shovel. You have a shovel and you'll amount of dirt in front of you. It's not like you have a map to where the where the thing really is. You don't really you have a map to took you here and now you've got the shovel and you've got the ground. Someone's got to come along with a new map and convince you that it's gonna lead anywhere and no one has done that so of course people are gonna just keep digging dig up stupid all right guys I am signing off for the day. This was nice. I'll see you guys soon as I said maybe tomorrow maybe not but like I said two or three a week minimum from now on while I'm vibing and yes when I start grilling you guys will be the first to know all right bye bye.
