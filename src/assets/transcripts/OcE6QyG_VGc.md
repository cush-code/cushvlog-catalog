Baby 21 to win something something some buttercream. I can't never die burn through the riches and clowns through the glitches and slam. In the back of my. Dragula found the brushes and slam on the glitches and down on the back of my regular what's all slam in the back of our dragulas today and talk about first two chapters of the dawn of everything bye david grab grow so. This book promises in its opening chapter to basically blow your balls out of your mind. That's the basic pitch. It's like all right s then and the the language of the first chapter is very much like strap. In pickle dicks. We're gonna blow your mind sort of like one of those epic twitter threads where they're like beau. Brummel is the reason that men only wear sweatpants and the first chapter starts this process of sort of demystifying and disillusioning us of our fantasies of how human civilization emerges by demolishing the twin origin stories of human civilization that we all really in the conventional western political spectrum adopt to one degree or another which is the hobbsian notion of a state of nature defined by violence and conflict between people nasty british and short and the russoian notion of a period of um divine innocence that is then tainted by accumulated technologies of civilization that alienate us and imprison us and 

I mean the first chapter's pretty short. It's actually honestly. I have to say it's really an introduction. It's not a chapter. I don't know why they called it chapter one. They should have called it the introduction so the first real chapter that like actually starts making. An argument is chapter.

Two wicked liberty and in this chapter grab growth starts by making a affirmative argument that I have honestly not seen before. I'll give them credit like this is interesting that the enlightenment sort of self-consciousness. The critique of the social order that you see emerge in the early 17th century was not. The product was not the product of western thinkers looking inward just you know for for reasons that were endemic to europe. His argument is that it was the result of europe fully interacting with other cultures for the first time in the form of the the indigenous societies that they were engaging with in the new world and that it was their critique. It was the um it was the indigenous critique of european culture that led the enlightenment thinkers to start naval gazing about like what is liberty where does inequality come from and all these questions that would not have occurred to them otherwise and I have to say the evidence is not terribly you know compelling as presented like it's.

It's probably an overstated case. But when a project like this I will credit it because you are doing the work of trying to dismantle a narrative that doesn't have any better foundations. That's the important thing is that you can't really argue that the thing that they're demolishing has more substantial foundations so if this you know alternative notion allows you a a in a lever a leverage point to undermine what you think is of a specious or politically harmful narrative I think go for it. I mean at the end of the day. I think what they're trying to do is with.

This book is not necessarily argue that for a actual like affirmative case for human civilization but really to just say the one that we carry around with us. is a story and it's not a compelling. It's not a you helpful story. It's a story that hinders us that it's a story that retards our ability to think politically enough and effectively because we it reaffirms our um our sort of frozen and stuck nature and while I don't think that that's really enough like you know. I do think that one of the big problems with the entire anarchist project is an overemphasis on you know individual attitudes and ideas in motivating people. But I'd say it's better to have that alternative than to be stuck trying to square and the man's support emancipatory political project with the dead end. I do agree dead-end notions of russoian or hobzy and humanity but like the first thing that he's that they say that really kind of raises.

My eyebrow is there's an argument that um that early modern european states started adopting things like trained bureaucratic cores and and and unifying language because of the suggestion of guys like leibniz to follow the example of the chinese imperial state. I would say okay. No that's not the case. I'm sorry that happened because europe was going through a process of a a a secular process of power concentration and that that that power concentration had those reforms in those developments. Sort of built into the program of of dynastic accumulation of power which was being pushed by material causes not because somebody read it hey look what the chinese are doing. Let's do it here so that for me is one of the things I think is going to be underlying divergence from their like emphasis. I would say over mine because I'm just telling stories too you know. I don't have any evidence either really any more than anybody else does.

I just have um. I just know what for me resonates more and it is recurring to the the material conditions so and and also in doing so Mcgregor makes the claim that there is no native concept of equality in european society before the encounter with native americans and I'm sorry that is pretty ridiculous. I mean you can make a weaker case that it was not a concern expressed by the like literate classes because why would they but it was certainly a thing that existed like throughout european society like at the level of the social but according to graber the europeans start naval gazing about social order when they encounter native americans who live in social orders that are radically egalitarian in the sense that there is no central authority. Nobody is really under anybody's sway except of course for those bands that have war captive slaves which you know that's That's a real thing that he kind of glosses over But for the most part you had these tribal social orders that did practice horticulture.

So did do the thing that later europeans would insist leads directly to regimes of control and and and coercion but but did not have those because they did not have the conception of of property as as not just something that could be held but something that could give one person power over somebody else um and they saw the europeans come to the united states and canada and said you are slaves. All of you are slaves to somebody else. None of you actually have the freedom that we do and according to grab grow.

 it was an interaction with a native american diplomat who whose conversations with a colonial french administrator led to the publication of a very popular book. that was read by all of the leading philosophers and that ended up sparking a chain reaction of searching treatises and essays to try to make sense of okay wait a minute what's going on here. These guys they're owning us what these savages what's going on and they point out that for a lot of europeans specifically for the jesuits the liberty that the natives prized was actually poisonous was bad. Freedom is not good for people and that is I think because they came from a society where social orders were so ingrained and and regimes of exploitation and social alienation are so deeply ingrained that that the idea of a transcendent supernatural authority who who could be obeyed and by obeying would keep you on the right side of the authority on earth and also reward you in the hereafter. is a necessary way to to cope that that you need that in your mind to compensate for the lack of freedom that you have and it turns that lack of freedom into a virtue but of course if you live in a social order where there is not that radical alienation between people where you are forced to treat people not as fellow recognizable humans like on an equal basis but as through the social requirements of the the class and structures that they and you find yourself in freedom can only be a danger.

It can only be a sin because those structures are the only thing keeping you from expressing the pain of that loneliness. So here we have a definition of equality as it was understood by the native americans and how it contrasts with european notions. I thought was pretty interesting equality. Here is a direct extension of freedom. Indeed it is its expression. It also has almost nothing in common with the more familiar eurasian notion of equality before the law which is ultimately equality before the sovereign that is once again equality in common subjugation and also they go they later on they. They point out that european notions of freedom are tied to are really tied functionally to roman ideas of freedom where freedom was freedom too over lord and own other people be they your slaves or your family and that that was freedom as conceived by the imperial roman state and which that structure maintained itself through the successor regimes that populated europe afterwards.

Somebody says just. I caught this here but isn't anarchism the basically the end state of marxist analysis yeah. But end states are meaningless who gives a about end states. No one none of us are going to see an end state of anything I would argue nobody will ever see an end state of anything the struggle for it is life and so the question of how do you struggle for it is the only meaningful question and I would say that anarchism fails the question of of practical action because it sacrifices practical action on a utopian horizon that is irrelevant to the lives of us our children our children's children. But I guess that's part of what grab grower are trying to do here is are you. No we are not actually prisoners of history. We can change and and challenge our structures at our will and I am very skeptical of that claim which is one of the reasons.

I wanted to read this book. So this book that takes europe by storm is this purported interview between this huron statesman candiaran around candy rock candy rock. I'm gonna candy a rock and this frog le hontal and many people have claimed historically that this is just a guy talking to himself and that the native american here is just a prop. but grab grow makes a pretty compelling argument that these guys did have close contact when lahontan was a french colonial administrator in canada so and that there were notes of their interviews and the guy who he talked who puts words in his mouth is was a real guy who might very well could have come to france as part of a diplomatic mission and so within this book you see kendam just demolishing all of these notions that undergird european social order.

 this is one that I thought was particularly compelling. You have observed that we lack judges what is the reason for that well. We never bring lawsuits against one another and why do we never bring lawsuits well because we made a decision neither to accept or make use of money and why do we refuse to allow money into our communities. The reason is this we are determined not to have laws because since the world was a world our ancestors have been able to live contentedly without them. Now he gets here to the very crucial reality that it is a private property regime that necessitates the coercive state apparatus that we live within um and that if you do not have a state if you don't do not have proper private property you actually can live statelessly but again my mind always comes to material conditions here and the material conditions of the tribal bands of north america are such that the prospect of being dominated and completely destroyed by an outside force. are relatively low in that context thanks to the incredible abundance of resources which is not the european.

 experience at all europe has been since the fall of the roman empire a a grasp over a relatively sparse territory by a lot of people and more specifically a lot of people who thanks to the existence of the roman empire had access to technology of coercion and control and empowerment that that made the threat of external domination much more keen than they might have been in the north woods of the united states. So again here we have a materialist difference between the actual environments of the one and the other not necessarily one group making a choice to live freely in another making a choice to live as slaves but but responding to material conditions differently and at one point though the one that really stuck out to me is this line which does really anticipate the marxist critique of society of of civilized society over and over. I have set forth the qualities that we went at believe ought to define humanity wisdom reason equity etc. And demonstrated that the existence of separate material interests knocks all of these on the head. A man motivated by interest cannot be a man of reason and that to me is yeah. That's that's a bingo right there that that and I must say though that was also the analysis of gerard winstanley the leader of the diggers at the end of the english civil war who wrote a book oh. My god people actually want me to read the anarchist faq shut the faq obviously give me a break so This book sparks this this spirit of internal criticism in europe and you have first this guy this guy.

A rj turgot who takes the indigenous critique turns it on his head and says yes. The indians don't have laws and regimes of control. But they also do not have advancement. They do not have progress. They do not have a social teleology and that becomes one of the fundamental elements of the like western gays as it accelerates its imperial domination of the rest of the world like again and again. western cultures will encounter these. These societies that are in a relatively homeostatic relationship with their environment aren't physically less healthy whose lives are about as long who do not suffer from all of the the manifold and horrifying alienations of of civilization. but they do not accrue and that is it's that lack of accrual that renders them fit for domination and and in fact necessitates their domination because because western civilization technological civilization is a project is a self-conscious project and by that virtue.

One of the virtues of imagining yourself as part of a social civilizational project is that the suffering within it the suffering caused by it of course because it's not happening to you or if it is if you are suffering you are also gaining. can be understood as a necessary sacrifice for this greater project that you're part of the actual pain gets abstracted away which is much harder to do when you are living life in a harmony is obviously kind of a a cliche and definitely kind of condescending but certainly a more stable relationship to your environment. But a stable relationship to the environment is just that it's stable. It does not change with time and it is changed with time that defines civilization but where this chapter. I think really hits gear and where it's really interesting is when he starts talking about rousseau. So rousseau took to hit took to the challenge posed by the the indigenous critique and set about trying to figure out how we went from there to here.

How we got from this idol to this brutal world of exploitation man born free everywhere is in chains so they start off talking about crusoe's notion of the state of innocence which even rousseau admitted was not a claim of a real historical fact but was a thought experiment which puts I think this whole book in that tradition and I think that's self-conscious on grab growth part But there is one part where they're describing his notion of the the isolated and free individual in nature where I feel like. I don't know if they're being obtuse or they're not I'm missing something. But they say that rousseau argues rather confusingly that the first humans were essentially good but nonetheless systematically avoided one another for fear of violence. I don't think that's really confusing. I don't think there's any reason to assume that the inherent good intention of an individual in a state of nature where others are strangers means that you will necessarily have an awareness of the good intentions of others like it is that that's that chasm that defines the other in the first place is that we cannot know them the way we know ourselves so in rousseau's notion The individual free person in order to protect themselves flee towards what they think is safety but was actually slavery agriculture civilizational hierarchies and all that and grab girl do a good point of pointing out that like what rousseau really did hear in his analysis is that he synthesized the indigenous critique for a literate intelligent european audience in a way that allowed them to recognize the essential truth of the critique which any real rational person and these guys all pride themselves on how realistic and rational and undogmatic they were has to recognize is true but at the same time cannot be accepted because they're in europe.

They're european guys they're guys and gals. I guess some of those ladies in the salons they benefit mostly if they're reading this.

They benefit from the society of orders and from colonial exploitation. They don't really want to live in the woods so what rousseau does is. He is the father of the mod of the of modern western liberal subjectivity where you are able to enact and enshrine your own personal virtue by recognizing and acknowledging the evils of the society you live under while denying that there's any alternative because this is the crucial part for um for rousseau. The notion of liberty that he cherishes is of individual autonomy but of course that is not the liberty that any indigenous society has ever enjoyed.

It is inter connectivity mutual aid to use the anarchist buzzword and just just interdependency that allows for freedom.

It's the fact that you have people that you can rely on that allow you to be free because yes if you have no one else you can rely on you will invariably have to fight and that will rob you of freedom because it'll put you away from you know choices made by what whim or fancy and on choices demanded by the necessity of survival which is of course not freedom. But because of that rousseau cannot imagine really conceive of indigenous societies as they are which means that this loss of freedom is a tragic inevitability because we cannot be interdependent that way we we cannot surrender our our independence to one another because I would argue. Rousseau grew up in europe around europeans people whose entire lives had been defined by these hypocritical structures of power that rendered them hypocrites and so a young and and tender. Rousseau who fled from his family because he didn't want to be under their thumb and is always fleeing towards total. Independence from others was doing so because the the the civilizational notions of the people he surrounded himself with were repellent to him which as well they should have been. But that blinded him the to the even possibility of people living in mutual interdependence that actually allows for them to express human freedom which is again where material reality butts up against idealism. Like rousseau's notion of of what a person is how a person behaves what human nature is is determined by his observation of humans in nature that nature being early modern or at that point enlightenment europe which is a different subjectivity than those than that of a a horizontally organized bands in north america and so rousseau's who still gets blamed by conservatives for bringing about the french revolution and and not communism and all that and as is usually the case they they're mad at an idea when it's not the idea's fault but it is very true that rousseau's the implications of rousseau are that the only way to get back to that state of freedom that that state of liberty of the individual is some purifying regime that literally changes people and that that's I think why the reign of robespierre is.

I think rightly considered the culmination of the russoian project not gonna do anything about immersion capitalism not gonna do anything about a society stratified by class where your freedom of freedom is totally constrained by your access to artificially restrained resources where you you cannot get what you cannot have what you don't have to buy. That's all that's that can't go anywhere and I mean you could argue it couldn't have at that point you know it was a bourgeois revolution at a time when the the capital accumulation and not become sufficient to allow for a real effective transfer to anything like a working class because there wasn't really a self-conscious working class of any kind to take power in any case but you had this bourgeois revolution that was trying to reintroduce liberty equality and fraternity in a structure of emerging capitalism and the only way to do that is to impose virtue by force and rousseau rousseau's ideas. Liberal left romantic angelic leftism is a continuation of christian notions of morality where you replace original sin with um the material economic original sin. The secular original sin of agriculture and civilization but maintaining the notion of an inherently fallen man who cannot return to that state of grace and then the the the line that grab grow have here that I think really nails it is. 

We argue that in folding together the indigenous critique and the doctrine of progress originally developed to counter it. Rousseau did in fact write the founding document of the left as an intellectual project because like to go rousseau takes for granted the notion of civilization as a teleological project which requires it to advance over time which requires it to use technology to increase productivity to increase civilizational markers to to increase the human footprint on the land to literally reshape the earth in human image in a way that indigenous society yes they farmed yes.

They built buildings and stuff but not with the singular like structuring drive of western civilization and he ends talking about how the the myth of the noble savage was actually a right-wing denigration of the russoian tradition and that then there became the idea of a stupid savage which once again comes from the fact that if your society is not building monuments to itself on the land and and instrumentalizing humans to do it then you are not actually a thinking social organism because you're not moving forward but the intriguing notion that they propose coming off of the observations of french anthropologist pierre clester and I think that's gonna be talked about more in future chapters which I'm looking forward to is that the reason that there might have been these It got these like well-established egalitarian structures that were not in the process of like moving through the stages towards hierarchical civil hierarchical civilization is because the people of that were encountering the french and american colonists. At that point very well might have come out of previously experienced with those very social orders.

 they say here we find it difficult to picture. We find it difficult to picture what a truly free society might be like right which is why we find ourselves just butting against our butting our heads together and stammering and being like what the when we try to actually articulate um alternatives to the life that we all live because we've never experienced it.

We've we have no real understanding of it which is why talking about end. States of socialism is so absurd that would the end state of socialism such that it even could be imagined to exist rather than to be a horizon would be shaped by the specific contours of the struggle. To attain it cannot be conceived of without that experience but that means that we're stuck and unable to move forward a lot of times for lack of a a vision But they say so we find it difficult to picture what a truly free society would look like perhaps they the indigenous north. Americans have no similar trouble picturing what arbitrary and power arbitrary power and dominion would be like so. The idea here is that they might have been able to maintain their non-hierarchical social order for because of generational experience in the past of it and there's going to be talk about a theorized mississippi valley civilization that had all of the bells and whistles of an an agricultural empire that collapsed and that saw people flee from it and define their culture in opposition to it and I'm very interested to get to that stuff.

So that's the first two chapters. I think for next week see how long the third chapter is here. I think. I want to give it yeah. I want to give it its time so I think we'll just do one chapter for next week chapter. Three unfreezing the ice age I'll pop off here in a minute. I know it's a short one but any questions before I go do. I enjoy it. it's it's very fun read. I mean they have a very. I mean. I mean. I read that you know graber and wengrow. They have very accessible conversational style. It's fun to read. I'm. I'm. I'm and it's even fun when they like just decide to like lay one out.

There be like hey. How do you know that that's not why they did it and I appreciate the sort of lampshading the speculative nature of the project. So so right now as I i think the closest thing. I'd say about thesis is is that alternative social forms to hierarchical indus technological civilization coexisted with industrial or technological civilization and that encounters between the two sort of sparked the building of narratives of historical progress that justified one way or the other. the current system because as I said rousseau is still at the end of the day as much as he whales and gnashes his teeth about all the chains that we're held in is excusing and justifying where we are as this tragic but necessary inevitable. I would say rather than necessary seeding of liberty as individual atomized people flee from the fear of one another into chains and that that and hobbes kind of become the poles of imaginative history in the west. A a an alibi as it were for the crimes of civilization and we'll see we'll see how they pull it off. There's a guy who keeps dming me to insist that this book annihilates the notion of stages. So stages of of economic and social development and you know.

I'm open we'll see but yeah. I'm enjoying it just yeah last question here the legacy of roman law code's impact on our political ad imagination. I I referenced it briefly but yeah. I really do think that we live in the shadow of I mean in a way. Philip k dick really was right that the roman empire never fell in that it is the political imaginary of the roman imperial state that we have inherited. It never has been really challenged and overthrown from within now like notions of like. Freedom and liberty are tied not to interdependence the way they would be in in other social orders but to explicit ownership and domination and those models as I said. became the basis for the successor states of feudal europe and then inscribed themselves in capitalism. Capitalism merely took that domination and abstracted it was able to use the use technology more than anything use technology to abstract away the personal violence of regimes of ownership that go back to romans and then put them into the air made them made them the air. We breathe so yeah think about think about those romans.

I that's why I always kind of wish that that david as much as I love deadwood. I kind of wish that david milch has gotten to do his roman idea that he originally pitched hbo because what he wanted to do is. He wanted to do a show about the birth of social order out of relative chaos and so he wanted to do a basically a cop show about ancient rome like not like not even like late republic like early republican rome when they didn't actually have codified laws. But they did have something like police forces. So you had these guys who were basically making up law as they as they did. It went about their job and they were making rome at the time so they said no and then because rome was so expensive. They ended up not doing the third season or the fourth season of deadwood. So I know people like rome but I only watched the first season got stopped caring when caesar died and I really hold a grudge against it because it prevented us on both ends from the ideal david milch experience okay so yes next week chapter three bye-bye.
