Oh yes awesome hey everybody all right guys oh and all your nap here here boy. It's been a very interesting day for me. I haven't even left my apartment. I've been really taking a lot a lot of stuff. I feel I'm hoping to share some things to the user day that I'm really excited about. But I'm also a little worried about. I have my graph paper. I'm gonna have to explain some stuff. So first things first is that I don't know if you guys have noticed if you guys have been any of you have been watching. My Instagram streams I used to do before switching to twitch here the last week or so. I've had a bit of a a bit of a Satori moment.

A bit of a just sort of a bit of an all around mental reorganization egodeath to put it very bluntly and the result of it is that I've been gifted really with a and it's not out of the blue. It's building on other insights that I've been struggling with my entire adult life. But now they're finally crystallized into a truth and reality that I've honestly found to be basically if you ask me to put it bluntly if you ask me like what's the meaning of life. I have an answer that it satisfies me. That's all I can do. I cannot satisfy anyone else because I can't translate the feeling to them. So I have the meaning of life and of course you might say sure a lot of people say that and I bet most of them are telling the truth. The problem is I have to try to communicate it to you guys and I will not succeed. I will only get part of it out and the question is I'm trying to balance frankly guys. I'm trying to balance getting this out in a way that inspires enough people to see something to it to talk to me about and maybe because the thing is I'm only gonna keep thinking this and only gonna know this truth. If I keep acting it every day.

There's no such thing as unactive upon beliefs. So if I gonna believe that this is true I have to act that way which means I efter not interact with the world that way and that means that if I interact with other people that way they will see the truth of it just through my actions and then they will reflect those to me and it will make it easier for me to live this because I will be making reality around me in the image of this knowledge because it's guiding my actions. So that's that's the long and short of that I have to try to get this across to people. That's the only way I'm going to keep it. It's only we're gonna keep the fire but only when I'm keeping the fire in. It's if I keep putting it out there and trying to explain it because I'm explaining it to myself too because I'm using poor instruments words symbols to try to get it something.

That's beyond those but anyway I have to try to get it to enough people that people can like get it believe in it and we can all talk about it and it can redefine it or people think I'm a cult leading psychopath and stop paying attention to me. And then I become someone on the street corner with a newspaper diaper trying to get people. You know to accept that I am the Living God getting tased by the cops and put on YouTube. I do not want that so that means that I have to be very very careful about how I try to communicate these ideas and so I'm not going to start at this level because it's just you can't get there the way to get there is by starting back here with the material here and now this space-time and that's where we are. So we need to talk about concrete examples that people could get their head around so anyway. This is all along steps way of saying that when I woke up this morning I had a realization about Twitter which is that it cannot be a a place where fruitful conversations happen or at least not fruitful enough to be worth the effort of doing them. Now I always kind of believed that but one of the things that this whole revelation has given me is the knowledge that I didn't really know why I believed a lot of the things I believed and now that I have interrogated them. I found that some of them I only thought I believed and don't really believe but some of them I did believe but just not for the full reason. I wasn't all the way to the ground of why and I realize now the foundational fundamental reason.

The Twitter cannot be used as a constructive place for argumentation or persuasion or the pursuit of truth is that it is a undef of anti dialectical space that trying to pursue specifically. Socialism on Twitter is inherently impossible because it is because socialism like all intellectual traditions and all all political movements eventually starts as a dialectical process and Twitter conversation defeats dialectical reasoning because even though everybody on the terrain of Twitter might have the the shared hope for creating socialism like give everybody benefit of good faith. They actually do want socialism but they have to communicate that sense of wanting socialism on a space where their individual material incentives to act are not towards the sort of collaboration with other intelligences that would lead to an answer and a practice out of that answer praxis. It leads you to competing with one another to try to be different than other people so that people will notice you because your ego is guiding the process which is what capitation seeks whereas cooperation is dissolving the ego to some degree to cooperate to us a facilitate cooperation so that means that we're all out there when we're taking on Twitter.

Our goal is to be noticed and that notice can take the form of everything from a like to a follow to becoming a podcaster to getting notice to having people take you seriously and the only way you can do. That is if you stand if you point out your difference from somebody else. This is also known as leftist infighting. Now the thing is is that there are real conflicts. These conflicts are not made up but the problem is they cannot be resolved now because to resolve them is to ruin your position in the hierarchy you've established. You have no interest now in actually resolving the problem because then you're just part of the mass and you're not special anymore. That is a genuine problem that the sets anyone trying to get any socialist idea across on Twitter and it doesn't mean we can't get to some truth. We do. It's just very very inefficient use of time. It's like.

It's like trying to. It's like cutting down a Sequoia with like a hand. Axe you could do it with enough time and enough people you could chop down a Sequoia with hand hand axes. But no one would because it's be a wildly inefficient use of resources time energy and material. And it's the same way you could get there on Twitter but my god. It's about the least efficient way you can. So don't so don't not be on Twitter because honestly what Twitter is. It's not for politics. It's for friendships as much as that is goofy to say and so much as you think no I go on Twitter to own people yeah but you own people so your friends notice and they like you more.

It's about. Friendship and politics is just one of the ways that we create the friendship and then that craftsmanship in the market turns into monetization and pair of social relationships and all that stuff. But at the end of the day you are stuck in this relationship where you can't get to your incentives your direct material incentives which are gonna inform your actions more than your theoretical belief of socialism because it's closer to your material. Reality and conditions means that you will socialism will lose every time in the battle between the ego and socialism. It will lose because that's where your actions are that's where your beliefs are they're not at. They're not your your practice is not at the level of socialism. It's at the level of competing within this. This friend network so go online to have friends and go online to listen to people who you think have something interesting to say and they will often point out what they have interesting to say by pressing it up against wrong things and you can make fun of the people who are wrong but know that it can only be that it can never give you any kind of real insight. It's just about increasing social bonds.

The work the intellectual work is done with them within or off of Twitter and mostly through encounter with the real world in the form of doing things activism outside of the house out of the cyber realm the place where the rubber literally hits the road where friction accumulates where the dialectical is manifested in. In the material world. It literally becomes the spirit of the machine. Okay wait a minute don't want to go off too far here. Don't want to get you guys thinking I'm insane again don't want to get it. I don't get 5150 all right so anyway. This is all to say that the Twitter cannot do what you want it to do and that you to do what you want to do which is live as a socialist and feeling living in accordance with your with your beliefs which is closer to being a fully actualized person than being the m ammed on who does you know like when they talk about a small sold bug men. That isn't not that's talked about a real thing like instead of having instead of feeling real validation. Like you are because you feel like your actual izing yourself through the pursuit of socialism. In your life.

You get to do a pseudo world where you watch netflix and you jack off and you eat compressed soy and corn products and then you find those meet. Those transient joys you put fake meaning in them instead. But that's not because of the peppe's aren't right of why that is that's because you're you're you're captured in a matrix of capitalism and you have a material need to solve your closest pain and so that's always gonna put you a conflict with the greater need to like push against it which is why you have to always be thinking about what you're why you're thinking what you're thinking putting yourself in place in time at all points being mindful to use a hippie term for it. Because then you can actually get motivated to do it because you know why you're doing it. You need to know why you're doing anything like I Riley realized because I I finally realized I had noticed talking about Jordan Peterson.

I had noticed that Jordan Peterson got kids to pick up on a room when their parents telling them couldn't and I used to think it was because they recognized Jordan Peterson from like the matrix of online and online was like their new parents and so they listened there more that was incorrect. I was wrong about that. Now I understand the reason that they picked up the room and thought it was incredible to hear it from Sweden. Peterson from compared to their parents is because Jordan Peterson told them why they should pick up their rooms. He told them that it would make their lives better and it would give them more control over their lives and sense of destiny. It would make them it would put him on a better path of action and in parents just tell you to do it. You say why and it's cuz they're tired because they have other things they don't have the bandwidth. They say because I said so and then it's just I'm doing something that is in the short-term unpleasant for no reason. Just for as a favor to my mom. You have to be self motivated to do anything consistently and so that and so all we have are these petty self motivations of like you know pleasure which lead to hedonism and destruction but we can't cultivate anything deeper because we don't have beliefs to motivate it.

We don't have beliefs to motivate behavior and and and Peterson gives beliefs to motivate the behavior of cleaning a room the way that your parents didn't and that's what I mean by levels of of like reality because like I was right at the level that you know there was a difference between I would. I didn't know why people that worked before. Now. I do like I'm now I know I'm writer than I used to be because I know different things because different things have happened to me oh boy all right. I'm trying to reel this back in I feel like I keep floating off and I gotta like get the Coast Guard to bring me back alright but yes someone says it's socially motivated the sum total of our our self. The sum total of free will is the interaction with other people that Oliver we're told so never mind. So I address that just not now because it's gonna get me off on a thing and I don't really have the language for it but trust me. I know what you're talking about and I understand what that objection is and it I could explain why that doesn't that is irrelevant. Oh my god. I gotta get back to what I was. Gonna say I'm gonna get killed. They're gonna. Throw me off of twitch now and you guys are all gonna stop watching oh god ah I'm gonna worry. Here.

All right was I saying Twitter not good not a place to find any kind of meaningful conversation that's going to resolve towards truth. You're only going to see people motivated to reify a the conflict and the way you know that by the way is that the the way that the mechanism of that is this like say you've got to our sides of an argument on any given issue like what is to the left of this or or this course of action. Or this. This position be it like the ID paul superbowl. Any million arguments you can imagine if any person on one of the two sides is the first to acknowledge the premise. The correct premise that the other person is acting on that arise from true observations of reality if the purse person to do that will then be pointed out as a heretic to maintain the other person's position because you need to always be in contrasting your left 'no switch. Somebody else's insufficient left Ness so the movement. The dialectical movement that is needed to resolve these things is made impossible by the social nature of it because the incentives are towards individualizing and building a brand like we did like everyone online is trying to do consciously or subconsciously so that's why you can't do it on Twitter and so I pop on Twitter. Cuz I'm not gonna stop being on Twitter. I have OPM's where I have a lot of friends. I like to talk to I like to do jokes sometimes and have jokes with my friends. That's what I try to do with Twitter.

That's what I've tried to do before and I'm just resolving to do it more now and then sure enough though the first thing I see is a clip of Nathan Robinson saying it's not only saying that Karl Marx should never have been born and that things like class conflict and historical materialism are are not really convincing or like oh no oh God because it's not like I necessarily even and getting mad at him because part of this. This new approach to reality is to accept everyone's historically contingent nature and that Nathan Robinson is not the way he is for any personal reason that goes beyond the accumulation of behaviors of activities and and and and situations that have led to him being like I just a product of mechanical unfolding of the universe. I mean and he still asked that I just I have to treat him that way. If they're sure or not. I have to treat him that way in order for me to deal with him rationally and not just through anger. So I tried not to be angry at him. But I was still like I don't want.

I resolved not to argue on Twitter anymore. In fact I deleted a tweet I was gonna do or I was gonna argue something with somebody and then I saw that I said this is so dangerously wrong. This attitude is so like up and now especially feeling what I feel I feel like. This is so dangerously wrongheaded that someone needs to say something and so I went on Twitter and then as soon as I tried to compose this tweet all of the bad incentives that make Twitter a bad place for communications start kicking in the main one being is that every tweet is powered by some sort of insecurity a desire to perform something for others so that they will reintroduce that quality to you that you will you will feel that they feel your the way you want them to think you are and that's why you tweet and so I can't just say this is a dialect. You know like these are foundational elements of like any kind of social movement that has any hope of conquering capitalism but that's just scolding and that's not fun and that's not you know that's not chapo brand. So I say no I can't do that.

So I say if anybody wants to replace Marx with Robinson because the under the undercurrent of my critique is who do you think you are basically and so I say look at his peacock outfit because there's pictures of him in like a Mardi Gras outfit where he looks kind of goofy just honestly and of course he's known for his weird bizarre affected dress and accent and stuff. It's like he's a self kind just character. It's fine isn't he's Truman Capote of the American left whatever and so I just wanted a shortcut. I didn't want to argue through it because that's not fun. So I just wanted a semantic shortcut to check out this goofball. He's a 30 year old weirdo. Why would he know more than Marx and of course that gets at a truth which is that I'm sorry Marx knows more than Raven Robinson because not Marx Marx's understanding of the dialect goes deeper than his does. His understanding of material reality observed from empirical observation and his intellect and his empathy combining have rendered him more an accurate viewer of how the world is and so if people listen to Dathan Robinson instead of Karl Marx.

They're gonna. It's gonna be harder for them to get the right conclusions because they're gonna start from the wrong premises and so I felt like I had to say something. But I just said it in a snarky way and I'm sorry - Nathan honestly for insulting him. It's like I'm not gonna do that anymore because it doesn't do anything because all it did was. It told everybody who likes Nathan Robinson and like Haven invested liking Nathan Robinson as part of what makes them a good person and a good leftist a good leftist and therefore a good person and so to attack that is to attack their central their sense of being of course. They're gonna fight back and it's never gonna be about the actual katraine of the argument they're defending a key component of their identity. How is that ever gonna be able to be talked about rationally especially when you're talking about an online space where we. Neither one of us can guarantee the good faith of the other and it just exploded and I realized oh. This was see I have made things worse the him just saying that would have been X about of unhelpful but me pointing it out has actually reified this anti dialect and made things worse in the long run. Like I've actually affected the world for the worse. I lost good place points if anyone seen that show and I'm like damn I can't do that anymore.

So I've been trying since then before now to answer people who've responded to me in some of the comments with as open a heart as possible to try to get it what I was trying to say and just you know. If I feel like I can answer a question confidently. If I feel like I can I have enough of an understanding of like how this fits into my overall view of the world. Then I can say I'll answer and I happen and it's been. It's been a good exercise. It's making me like feel more confident myself and the thing is you're in the more confident. You are your beliefs the less emotional you are about them. The better you are about arguing at them so much of like the deep platforming mania. That's on both sides of politics is essentially people reifying their insecurities in their beliefs. Like the they cannot comprehend. The idea of debating or engaging with another idea is anathema because their belief is brittle enough and they fear that there is someone who understands things more than them and could make them not believe what they believe anymore. But those beliefs are so deeply tied to their sense of identity that that that is terrifying and threatening. But if they but the thing is what a group is right and one group is wrong. You don't have to just say both sides know one sides right. The other side is wrong but the side that's right in this case might not be right enough to recognize how right they are and therefore doesn't have the confidence and emotional endurance to really think through everything they believe so anyway. So I said what I said and I've kind of boiled it down to a little drawing I want to put here. So this is this is me trying to divorce my critique of Nathan Robinson's dismissal of Marx without any personal invective and without any any slant towards towards ad the wretched ad hominem or anything else. This is purely trying to contextualize the dispute and I'm gonna use a piece of paper here to try to get it across because I will not like I said I really don't want to look like a crazy person and I know grant putting on a graph doesn't necessarily help you relieve your mind on that case. But I'm just gonna see if it's helpful for me. So we've got two firmaments.

Here. This is broad and these categories suppress other categories that are more complicated. But they're not necessary. You guys could see this all right so there's here's the world. As it is. This is the world we live in. It sucks we hate it. We recognize that it's bad because we're a lien ated from our time and our labor that makes things shitty that makes us wanna die but also afraid of dying got up here socialism. Let's say broadly construed because we're trying to do big tent. We're gonna take good on good faith. Everybody's claimed that they are socialists when they say they are so Nathan Robinson. I believe he's a socialist okay because he wants this I believe because why I can't how will I ever prove. He isn't to anyone's satisfaction. It'd be impossible. You're asking me to like dissect his soul. All we can say is does he act as though that he wants socialism and it seems as though he does but he lives down. Here we all live down here and we all have to build a bridge first or thought then through action praxis that is then collectively endeavored towards the goal. If you get enough people pushing in the same direction you can get here but they all have to be doing it together. That's cooperation that's socialism that's communist and that's everything okay. So that's what so the thing is how do you get it. What's the engine what's the thought engine that drives this from is to should be okay.

I would say that Marx because he emerged at the moment that capitalism emerged that's not a coincidence he was historically contingent. Marx emerged when he did because he was seeing the beginning of capitalism. He grasped all of its contours and so that is why his analysis of capitalism is the single most important one. It doesn't mean he was right about everything it doesn't even mean he was right on unbalance in some way every most things it means he was right on the most basic things that you build from because you can say well. Marx didn't anticipate ecology and Marx didn't anticipate feminism or Marx didn't anticipate racism. Marx didn't anticipate technological advancement. Marx didn't anticipate like how far imperialism would extend capitalism's ability to expand market and an increase in puts yeah. Because he died in 1881. He could only observe he could create models and then observe them and play out reality only in front of them.

We have to add on but we add starting with the Marx and what Mason Robinson is saying essentially is replace Marx with me because if it's not Marx then who is it well. It's got it the guy a guy tells you to discard Marx and here starting from scratch and trying to figure out how to get from here to here you have no roadmap who are you. Gonna trust more than the guy that just told you to give away the foundational guy of the whole thing the foundational set of ideas and I'm saying that because Nathan Robinson exists so far away from the big bang of capitalism that he is such a liberal subject as we all are. He is so suffused with the liberalism that is redounded through the cultural superstructure over the last 200 years that his insights will not go as deep as Marx's were because he was there at the temporal beginning he wasn't captured by the ideology of capitalism yet cuz he hadn't grown up under it. Nathan Robinson is captured as I am as everyone reading. This is by the ideology of capitalism. So we all have to come together and take everything that came before us and everything that we see around us to build enough to counteract that ideology and you start with something. Like Marx you cannot start with nothing because then you are in thin air. You are a late capitalist subject trying to bootstrap yourself into a third put into a into an observational point of view of capitalism that you cannot have because you're inside of it. It's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle you are in capitalism you're embedded in it.

You cannot be outside of it to see where you are but Marx could because he didn't grow up under it and that's why he is so disastrously wrong to say that we shouldn't have had Marx because that means that those things still would have come up. Those insights would still be there. People would still articulate them but they would have ontic you lated them later which would have meant they would have articulated them with less specificity and it would have been harder to build on them. It would be literally retarding progress because it retards the dialectic because Marxism emerges to come into conflict with the reality of capitalism and create new realities that's the dialectic history and it's like I didn't get it for a long time I assumed it was right because I assumed I agreed with other parts of Marx. I was like I agree with all this stuff about Marx about like class struggle. I see it's clearly true. I'm not so sure about the dialectic. So I will just say I agree with that part problem is that means I don't really believe in Marxism that much because I can't justify it beyond that level and that leaves me vulnerable that leaves me feeling insecure about it. And when you reach that point there are two things to do you can either say well. Marx is wrong or you can say I am going to try to figure it out. Why do I believe this why what principles does class struggle come from and that's where you get to the basic stuff like historical materialism and then on top of that dialectical materialism. Like first the observation the observation of the material conditions and then the notion that they are driven by conflict between ideas which is then turned at the higher level into class struggle. There's class struggle.

They're all built on top of one another. Now we're stuck here because intervening tech not. This is where Marx dies basically. Marx dies here now we've got this time. Here we have intervening time we have new technology. We have Empire. We have the world wars. We have all this stuff but we stop to get there and Marx can't help us anymore. So now what do. We do we build on top of this with other stuff stuff about ecology stuff about race stuff about gender stuff about Technology stuff about computers all that stuff you add it on top. You add it on top of the base. Here now what Nathan Robinson is doing by rejecting this stuff because he didn't understand it and didn't either have the patience or brains to study it until he did rejects it and says it must not be true because I don't understand it. No you don't understand it and to you therefore it isn't true if you understood it. You could reject it and say no this entire premise is wrong but it flows to every other principle. You're talking about it flows the dialectic flows all the way up from diet from the historical materialism to the dialectal materialism to the class struggle. It all flows up towards a state of actual existing socialism for all humankind. The actual end point of teleological Marxism if you say no to that what you're basing it on like you're basically basing it on liberal concepts of morality.

Now if you're up here. If you're Nathan Robinson you're going off and you know where this is you know what that or arrow is up. There. That arrow is liberal personal individualism because that's what that's what like anarchism is as Chomsky has admitted anarchist traditions and things of that nature exist to try to get the socialism try to get the socialism without a basis of materialism and what they do instead is they say well. We are morally required to create a just society because we all are individual beings with individual rights but that creates the only way that adjudicate the idea of us. All being monads like that is through market transactions which necessitates capitalism. So it creates liberal subjects and now liberal subjects if they're given enough time and resources might get to socialism but given the constraints of resources on a planet over time that will likely lead to destruction before it gets to socialism and guess what it'll eventually pass to the stage of COSO of understanding. It'll eventually resolve to a point where it incorporates Marxism but it'll be way way WAY later and less effectively I just started raining. No I don't mean I don't mean markets. I mean market transactions are the only transactions you can have if the basis for your understanding of material reality is along individual. Individual moral lines the idea that we're all individuals with individual morality. Like those things have endowed meaning that leads either to religious fundamentalism which has to be overcome which is another obstacle or it leads to total atomization which only reinforces capitalism. At every level. All right god damn it.

It's raining through the slats here I'm getting rained on. I'm getting dabbed on guys. I might have to go inside alright guys. We're gonna be Oscar Mike here in a second watch watch. Your perimeter please don't Doc's anything you might see all right guys thank you for bearing with me during the check there I'm still on. It's raining out are you guys doing now. Now. I can now all right so that was what I was trying to say I wanted to get that off my chest the Nathan Robinson thing so so anyway.

So the thing to say that about him is it means he's wrong but then people say well does like immediately. When if you criticize him. I saw people saying totally. Understandably you want to throw them out of the discourse. You think he's a fraud you want to supplant him with your own identity. It's like you were totally reasonable to worry about that because that's what you should have come to expect from other people on this platform because that's what behavior is rewarded so totally understand that I'm just saying so. That's there's no way for me to like responsibly and successfully critique him on that platform without people taking it the wrong way because that's the only way that they've been trained to take things there so I am done.

This is a long way of saying that I am done dunking on anyone on Twitter other than evil. Like you know goblins I will not be. I will not be talking on anyone's ideological disinclination or or like ideological failings. I'll stick clearly to material goof-ups like people telling you about who to vote for and and just turning it all into mush just turning it all into a bunch of mush so that nobody understands but everybody thinks they have to to maintain the ideologies and the identities that they have value now like instead of creating their own identities. They've grabbed one off the rack in the form of socialism or whatever I'll write anything any kind of political identity. Online is a substitute for the identity that we can't create through like true use of our time because it's alienated so. I'm done with all that I will be. I'll be using the internet be trying to rededicate to myself to only using Twitter for funsies just having fun ah. you guys got any questions anybody got any questions man. I gotta say it's kind of funny to imagine this many people listening to this. I'm a little worried that I'm that I'm rendering myself a laughingstock of the of the new web intelligentsia.

With this I'm a little worried anything that Marc's got wrong. He got wrong at a higher degree of abstraction from reality than everything else. He got wrong the way that all good thinkers get wrong in one direction. You you're building on a base. All thought all belief. All everything is built on a base.

It's and that's the engine and so the things he got wrong were at the edges like a question like the declining rate of profit that really is something that he couldn't totally predict because a lot of it has to do with exigencies that he wouldn't have been able to conceive of because he didn't realize what technology was gonna do like he could and he couldn't have because he was. He was fixed in the space time of the late 1700s so that's the thing that he might be wrong up now a lot of people crisis theory say no he's a hundred percent right of the creative laugh at all the the declining rate of profit. The thing is I think that he is right in the broad sense that that will happen just due to the reality of I mean I don't understand how anyone can deny that the how do you deny the declining the the pendency of the rate of profit to decline over time and the second law of thermodynamics. How can you believe how can you not believe both of those they're expressions of the same reality. They're expressions of the same underlying function of matter over time which is to lose energy lose lose lose in translation and loose over transmission. So it's Banali true that so when people say he was wrong what they mean less it didn't happen on a time scale that he predicted well no. Guessing on what was going to happen he didn't realize the extent to which colonialism would extend the lifetime of the super profits of capitalism. Like s and then Lenin Lenin had to point that out because Marx was dead he wasn't going to understand what technology was gonna do in terms of like destroying a lot of presumptions about like Malthusian limits. Those are all mistakes but they're just mistakes of not having enough information his basic methodological approach to reality was correct but now we have to refine it because things have happened since then and we were responding to a different reality a fundamental different reality than the one he was describing. It's a different world and we don't think of it that way because we don't think of our place of ourselves as fixed in place in time in relationship to other things. All right you guys got any questions. Labor theory of value is another one of those that once we're declining rate of profit. We're it's like that's so true. It's Banali true. It's it's it's implicit in existence. Labor is value. They're they're the same thing labor and labor is value. The same way the time is space. They occupy the same. They occupy the same space-time quadrant at any given moment well. You cannot have one without the other in equal measure. So what the are you even talking about well. That marginal every ship is at a higher level of abstraction.

That's gone off kilter because now you're trying to reinforce capitalism instead of move towards transcendence which is what we should be doing yeah. See people are like God diamonds in the water dude rope no no higher level of abstraction and a higher level of abstraction yeah. You can't find value in things that aren't directly tied to labor but that's because they've been a strat abstracted away from the fundamental relationship which is just valuing. Labor Chomsky got. Lesson is a liberal and he says he is which is why I don't understand anarchists who get mad when you point that out anarchism is liberalism. It is a higher stage of liberalism. Anarchism is like the highest stage you can get of liberalism towards justice before it breaks down due to its internal contradictions. So it is more advanced than liberalism. It is a form of liberalism. That's the thing is that these categories are all gradients of one another. They are not binary categories. They are but then that then that dissolves over time so like through the accumulation of practice anarchism is a superior and more progressive form of liberalism but it comes from liberalism and because of liberalism is now just a slur and a slander that you throw on people.

You don't like on Twitter to show that you're to the left like why this is everyone call everybody liberal because then they're not part of the left and that means you are and people should pay attention to you because you're not a liberal because everyone understands that a liberal is out of the club so instead of wrecks because like anarchists could that accept like oh Amaya liberal and maybe they'll find you know I actually have a liberal and then they're good. I am a liberal anarchist. But they insist on saying no I am I'm a socialist and it just confuses everything because they have to be on the left. They have to be liberal of socialists to be good because the reason all these political opinions matter so much to us is because of how little we use them because how much they are just in our hands. If we live them. Every day we would they would be secure and we wouldn't have. To reify them by having them reinforced by going on Twitter and having people tell us that we're good socialists. If we lived as good socialists. We wouldn't need to be told so we wouldn't have to go online and be socialists and then we wouldn't have to be so touchy about who gets to call them that and we could actually examine the questions on their merits instead of failing to understand the terrain of the argument because you need all of these people like people say oh you're saying you're not socialist that doesn't mean you're bad necessarily.

It means that you're carrying out your role. Everyone is not going to just change these just alright. I honestly think that the big fundamental problem here is that people who put their internet the underlying theory of activism that underlies you going online right and saying your opinions if you strip it of everything else and all self-dealing and all like all the stuff about you know wanting to make friends or whatever or influence people and you just strip it to the actual original because there was at one point before it got muddled that there was a real desire to do good when you're seeing the shitty world and if you could strip it down to that what would it be. It would be. I want to go online to tell people what to do the idea is I will say this is what you should believe and I'm making people believe it. Then they're gonna do it but look what happens. We say that and then what does it convince other people to do. It convinces other people to do what we did which is just say what we are if you were out doing it and I'm saying I'm including myself in this oh my god do not think that I don't understand that I am more implicated by this than any single person on earth that I am more an example of this rotten failed system the more curse of the Demiurge. I understand that I absolutely do. I don't know if I can do enough penance for it to gain credibility that I actually do believe that but trust me man. I do I get it anyway anybody got any questions anybody.

You've seen any good movies. Lately. These things move so fast. It's hard for me to say yeah I kind of I mean that's what I'm working towards. It's like a unified field theory. Once again. I don't want to sound insane but I'm gonna try to lay out here the basic principle. This is like the thing that I would put on I would put on like a belt buckle or welcome mat or like have embroidered on a sampler just the thing to remember every day to help me like think better and you guys can tell me I'm crazy or not. It's that the degree to which a being has consciousness because consciousness comes in degrees. The degree to which beings have consciousness is the degree to which they can perceive time all right. So that's all I'm gonna say about that now. I'm gonna try to talk more about this stuff in the future yeah. If I feel if you feel like I've gone around the bend please let me know because I'm gonna just like kind of take. The only way I can know how I'm doing is this in terms of getting it across I know I'm right. But I don't know if I'm getting it across is if people come back and tell me dude. You're doing good or dude you sound insane. Because then I need to know that I need to spend more time on refining mic translations so that they don't sound crazy. Okay. Someone says I sound insane oh no a lot of people are so he got a lot of you got can. We get it you sound insane in the in the in the Chad can you get a little you sound insane yeah.

That's the thing is I don't want to be the time cube guy cuz the time cube guy I don't think he was very happy. I don't think he felt like he was getting it across maybe. He was maybe the time cube. Guy was ultimately happy because he thought he had done enough of a job and maybe. It is because maybe that means that there's one person in the world who will read time cube and become instantly enlightened at the end of it that could happen and if he did it to one person he succeeded so that means time cube guy was right so tip of the half. The time cube guy. The implications of my theory are ABS absolutely universal but I can't predict what they are because they will only appear in the actual moment of use because that is when the dialect kicks in because that is because like that's what really hit me about the dialectic is that dialectical reasoning is the literal engine of all existence. It's how the brain comes into consciousness and how the literally the universe comes into consciousness of itself. If this is asked of communism I mean I took acid before I thought it up and it still it's making me a much more much better more confident more nuanced communist. I say yes I'll call it ask the Communist as well because I feel like I am finally for the first time confident that I could even call myself something like that before I assume Able's because I didn't even know what I believed I only know when I kind of thought was true and I never pursued it deeply enough and I have been because I didn't have a way to do so because you are not taught to think you are taught to react and those aren't the same things and because you're only taught to react and if you only react you will be an animal. You will be a miserable creature too conscious of time to enjoy life in like blissful unawareness of your own mortality but without any ability to enjoy it to enjoy that sense yeah. Like I mean the reason I was on all about better. Call saw last week is that I remember trying to write a think piece about about prestige TV for a while.

It was like one of my opinions you know. I'm like one of those little hip pocket things that was contrarian enough to gain notice and make you worth listening to because hey I'm saying something slightly different than what everyone else is saying this is on just like a cultural level rather than a political one but the same thing happens in politics and then I had to like back fill it in with and with what I had observed about prestige TV which was that it was like this weird set of genre expectations and I was able to only get to like this thing about how well you know we like it because we're too tired to read books anymore. But I couldn't like get to like why that is tactic that actually is tragic and now I actually get a standard. It's not that the format it's not that the it's not that oh these shows aren't as good as The Sopranos. It's that even The Sopranos was a degraded version of art that should not have been that universally beloved because it was on television because it was the product of a capitalist enterprise. It was as tainted as the attempt to build socialism. On Twitter is the artistic impulse the impulse towards morality. Those impulses are tainted by their association with the markets and I couldn't get to that root of it. So I ended up being more a very superficial and the thing I wrote for current affairs hilariously when I wrote about prestige TV now I feel like I didn't really get across what I was trying to say because I didn't really know why I was saying it and now I get it because I have applied dialectical reasoning to it. It's like a mental Ginsu knife.

See here's the thing I can't do math. So I can't do any of the math stuff. I have to try to enrich my understanding of this in the symbolic languages that I am adept at which are words and then symbols related to words. I have one of the most bifurcated minds on in human history. Like the way I see it math is the symbolic language of the material world. The intellect and words are the symbolic representation of the spiritual. The emotional the empathic and I'm very good at those. But I'm very very bad with math and you can prove things in both ways. But I can only be persuaded by ones that I can understand and I cannot understand math based proofs. So I have to try to like find other words. Symbolic regimens semiotics to build my to build my confidence in this one because I'm only gonna keep believing this and having this informed my behavior for the better if I keep believing it and that's only gonna happen if other people reflect it back to me otherwise known as Karma. This is also basically Buddhism by the way the salat just like I'm trying to speak of Buddhism in a materialistic sense. But yeah like you step one Mac and this is Buddhism so spoiler alert and the thing is you know. It's also mystic Christianity. You know whatever it all ends up with a communion with the Godhead which is time which is conception of time. It's just different vocabularies different levels of of cultural historical space-time fixedness that they emerge in yes. Everything is caused by everything else. There is total determinism of our acts in the universe. But we all you know in the moment are fully free to do anything and the funny thing is is like a lot of this stuff. People say like I assure or whatever or Schopenhauer. These are all things that I have never read I'll admit it because honestly the main reason I never read any of the really like heavy Theory.

Stuff is that the level of dialogue I would have with my friends and with people online was never deep enough to require it so there was never a motivation on my part to actually deep deep dig into it because there was no suggestion that there was anything deeper and now I feel like I understand the use and I understand like where these things fit and I feel like for first that makes me think oh. No now I never have to read them so what it really means is now. I have to read them all because reading them reinforces them both in my mind and then in my actions which then reverberate out to everybody else and then they bring them back to me. I don't know anything about math that's the Fibonacci thing is kind of a joke yeah and the first book that came along that made me think of that was Ulysses. I felt like oh I feel like Ulysses as a part of that as an attempt to build a consciousness out of words to use symbol the symbols of language so finally that you have rendered a mind so yeah. Let's try that I'll try girdle Allen watt. Apparently I would love to read some love to read some Christian mysticism. Now now that I feel like I could totally grapple with all religious traditions and of course Buddhism yeah because bags essentialism is like part of this. Like this is an edifice of different things driven through different periods of time that reflect that reflects certain truths that we can then build up. And I think existentialism points towards that Judaism points towards it Gnosticism.

Before them. They all got at different points of the root of the of the change. Just like all we're trying to do here is trying to figure out how to convince ourselves to do things. We know are right that's what practice is. It's the furnace of the south because doing things right is putting off pleasure for yourself for other people. Why would you ever do that it doesn't make rational sense you have to put it off one of the things UNS help you put it off is empathy for others because that gives you an investment in their their happiness because it makes you happy but the other is knowledge that it will do good for you too then. It's not just altruism like that's why I like libertarianism like an Rand is half of it. But the thing is if you follow eine. Rand you die in the desert because there's nobody else and nobody you don't even have a language to understand yourself as you die because it denies the social. But it understands that there is an individual will that has an individual desire but it must be tied to a collective will that leads towards a collective happiness because if you have intellect and empathy in equal measures or in unequal measures depending on your person what your personal like admixture of experiences is so that means that you have so you have an individual will and you need to may have a reason to want to do things not just for other people because that will get exhausting eventually you'll get sick of it. You have to want to do it because it's good for you too. If you just do things that are good for you you become a loan and then miserable but the way to square that is to you need to be doing things that make both things. True make things good for others and good for yourself and that means you have to both see things be done good to others and also know that you're making yourself better. So you have to believe it you have to. It has to be convincing so that is why you have to every day believe things and that is perceiving time that will make you do things that make you do it more and that will make you do it more and it will allow you to get to the top of Sisyphus mountain which is ego death which is a oneness with the universe which is also if we do it right going to heaven when you die as opposed to going to hell when you die which is the fear and terror as darkness descends on you because you don't recognize any time instead of times infinite all right. So what do you guys think what is I don't I realize as I said do.

I sound crazy then once again I'm screwing up a symbolic order. If I want to get good at feedback I can't ask binary questions. These are all on gradients so if you guys could give me a percentage sort of like you know you can go to the you go to the grocery store and you get the 90/10 of a lean to fat ground beef and then you can get like if it's a little richer you get like the 8515 and you can get the right the really little lean. Like the 9091 what percentage of non insane am I sounding like how how marbled with insanity is my is my legibility alright. I'm getting a lot of numbers. Here some very low ones. A couple of pretty good ones see the thing is I don't know which ones of you is joking. I don't know which ones are you are giving me the business so I can't really take these as true. I gotta say very surprised that help you said 69 there. It is nice nice all right that's okay well like I said. I'm gonna try to live it every day and have it come back to me in the form of a greater understanding of it. That I can make it easier to articulate but like I said if it stops making sense you know I'm gonna have to confront that and I'm gonna have to confront where I went wrong because I went wrong somewhere maybe not yet. But I will in the future.

It's inevitable. I will go wrong somewhere. If I haven't already and if I have I gotta find it. It's my duty to myself and everyone else because it's the same there's no conflict. I have more viewers than Sasha Grey. That's very funny. What is she doing is she gaming whose gaming thank you for the subscription hey so you guys. So I don't really do a lot twitch thing a lot. This is what I'm new to it. This is only my second one on the on here. What is that so you guys when you buy it when you subscribe that gives you the ability to do some cool what do you call. It emotes right so well how many guys I guess. This is just an indulgence for me since I haven't asked before I haven't been down here before what how many remotes are there for me how many a Moute how many cushion boats are there okay I got a sleepy guy with my hat on when when I got really drunk it looks like there's just one. They don't have a joker. One. That's too bad are there any erotic emotes got. Any horny emotes out there where's the horny bus well alright oh yeah. It's about. It's been about an hour and I'm trying to keep it around there because I don't know when the boys want to start streaming again.

So but I'll take it probably a few questions before I hang up here. If anyone's got anything am I still Joker fide I have now transcended chakra fication. Joker vacation was a stage I have transcended the Joker stage I have emerged from my Joker. Pupa first I was Riddler fide. I might be penguin fide right. Now I suspect on penguin five can I get a penguin five in the chat Terry Eagleton I have read he's very good.

I think I really wish. We had more nuclear. Energy really really wish the furture noble it hadn't happened. We really went off that we really up by not doing more nuclear energy. I don't know if it's too late or not though to do it at this point. But it was definitely a wrong turn because like it's so labor intensive and it's so capital intensive to make nuclear plants. Now. It's like even though it is a green technology and it's definitely worth. It is it gonna be worth the opportunity cost up to four resources you could have used elsewhere. I'm not sure what the balance is. I just know it would be a lot easier if we had a lot more working nuclear plants right. Now I was out on the North Fork of Long Island last a couple years ago and I drove by what looked like a 60s style nuclear reactor and I went over and I like I took a picture of it and I found it online and yeah. There's a snoo clear reactor that was put that was built on the North Fork of Long Island in the 80s and it was gonna power that area and then Three Mile Island happened while they were still trying to put it together and the local officials in all. The towns got together and said that they weren't gonna sign off on a necessary disaster plan to deal with the potential for a problem and so he never put it online. They think lost billions of dollars and it's just sitting there and it's just god damn. It's such a little missed opportunity mainly because the people who needed know how direly dangerous carbon emissions were gonna be more aware. Yet. You know. It's not so most the people who knew we're.

Employed by the goddamn oil companies all right I gotta go guys. This has been a lot of fun. We'll do it. Tomorrow once again let me know how I'm doing I need to keep I need to stay above 50 50. I know that that's my goal 55 and above that'll be my slogan 55. It off bye bye.
