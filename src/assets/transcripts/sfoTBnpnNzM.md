Uh okay I think and now we've established. Everything is inherently worthless and there's nothing in the universe with any kind of objective purpose and I scream. A hundred years split. The sky with a thousand curses a grammatical that can do and you wouldn't match the surface too. Many implications not enough time to make them specific too many generalizations not enough time to make them sit back hello. It's overcast. It might rain I'm warning because if it gets really bad I'll probably have to go inside but if it's just drizzling. I'll be fine. The night is overcast. There is a foreboding about about there's this feeling of tension and implication in the very air. But uh I'll keep an eye on it oh god.

I wish. I looked when I wear. This is a terrible shirt and it looks like crap and it has this big round terrible collar and I still remember that I  thing once god. I like to think that I have a little a modicum more. Uh social awareness to do that now. But I'm now on twitch which is I guess the modern television and I'm wearing it. But it's I'm cycled through my clothing and I don't want to wear anything again too recently. I get neurotic about it so now. I got to take go to. I got to do a little laundry but man this shirt is really terrible. I should just throw it out so. I don't even. I don't even like get tempted to wear it ah.

I am flexing with the drip that's right folks. I'm flexing with the drip. We are streaming the rnc uh last week. We just did tuesday wednesday thursday this week though because the republicans are always more fun and have more juicy. Uh I mean the first night we're gonna have the gun couple from st louis and dj tj who are both the can't misses in my opinion. So me and law and option are gonna be streaming tonight too uh. I don't know who else will be on uh. Virgil said he might do it but it'll be at least us. But then we're gonna have more amber or felix and other special guests will be all through the week oh and on third and on wednesday. I should put this out here uh before that and after uh the fym team the streaming guys tom and those gentlemen uh will be doing a fundraiser for the milwaukee freedom fund related to providing. I think jail support and other help to protesters after the horrifying police shooting that just happened in kenosha uh and that's going to be happening before that's gonna happen from seven to nine and then we're gonna hop on. At nine. We're gonna do the convention and then we're gonna do some more. Uh spoofs and goofs with the fym crew afterwards and that'll be donating raising money for the milwaukee freedom fund am I jfk junior well.

That's just ridiculous oh come on uh. What did trump say about bernie. Today is he trying to do the triangulation thing where he reminds people that bernie's a good guy and wonderful and we love him uh and that the dnc stole the nomination from him which is very very clever but very disingenuous because if bernie had gotten the nomination I think honestly bernie got the nomination trump might have fully embraced cue by now he might be going. He wants to eat your children. This brit cause he's terry. He was terrified of bernie sanders socialist appeal because he has an understanding because he's more connected to to popular trends than bloodless vampire republicans. He sensed that there was something stirring in the masses that could have potentially been connected to things like medicare for all. I mean the guy wanted to run for president in 2000 on the reform party platform with medicare for all basically as the principle of domestic reform. He has that animal instinct and so he was scared of bernie and he would have nothing else so he would probably be fulfilling on because that would be the handiest tool. The whole convention would be pictures of bernie like photoshop next to anton levay and a big fondue pot full of baby brains folks eats babies. This guy is bernie sanders. He seems like a great guy. He's a bad guy anyway what did trump say about bernie. They say he would have been unbeatable. That's pretty funny because it's true and he can admit it now that it's no longer a danger. So what did trump say. I don't think he called him a triflin hoe that sounds ridiculous. He said he was the greatest loser of all time. That's that's overstating the case. I actually just rewatched the stuff. Somebody asked me.


I saw the blob I rewatched the stuff. The stuff has good stuff in it but it's not very good. It's a great performance by michael moriarty more than anything. That's the thing about a lot of those larry cohen movies is that the movies aren't that great but  in all of his movies with them like that and q that makes it interesting even if the direction's flat and it's very choppy. Apparently it was much longer and the version I don't know if there's ever been a director's cut. But the original cut of the stuff was much longer and you could tell it's very very uh herky-jerky and uh and missing a lot of stuff and it doesn't have a lot of energy as a result of that. But michael moriarty is fantastic having paul sorvino in there basically playing a fictionalized lightly fictionalized version of bogue rights fantastic. Uh garrett morris is delightful as chocolate chip charlie but the whole thing with the stuff none of it really works uh.

Somebody says the next carter was the first guy who told people to uh to do more with less and he says no that there was like there was meat there was a whole thing about meat uh with nixon but the thing about that is that was an emergency that was an emergency um that was an emergency situation and it was nixon specifically. It was mixed with. It was part of a broader policy of kicking the can down the road because remember uh so carter faced with the ch with the uh with the reality of stagflation decides to to start do austerity. Nixon was faced with that same option in his first term but he was fully fixated on winning because as I said the democrats are super ego. The republicans are id. Nixon wanted power first and foremost everything flowed from that carter wanted to think he was a good boy. Carter wanted to be a sanctimonious good man. He was going to be the good man who redeemed america america that had fallen. It was going to be redeemed by him. A person who embodied righteousness that is not what dixon was nixon thought he knew of the future and the funny thing is. Nixon is a guy who anticipates a lot of our current crisis because nixon saw coming because he presided over the the end of bretton woods in the beginning of the uh of the current uh floating fiat system. With the us dollars this global reserve currency. He saw the future he knew this means that america will no longer be the productive powerhouse of the world. America will not be able to be a net exporter. You can't be a reserve currency without connection to gold or some species. You cannot be a reserve currency and be a net exporter. It doesn't work the money's got to circulate. It's got to be out of the country that means people have to be you have to be buying things from the rest of the world that is unbreakable that that had a lot of implications for the future of the american military project and at that point the still hot cold the still existing cold war because nixon didn't know that the soviet union was going to be gone. Soon.

He thought they'd have to be reckoned with while america declined and he was going to manage the decline and that meant that whatever it took to get uh through to these dumb asses to get him elected what he would do and so when he was faced with that crisis he did not sit america down and tell them I need you to suffer as I need to suffer. He told people we're doing waging price controls. He did the thing that no republican was supposed to do the thing that made the thing that made milton friedman  rivets because he wanted to get reelected because he didn't want to cause a recession carter basic carter's policy. In uh. This is not a joke and this is not a theory of mine. This is pretty well documented carter's economic project in his first term was to induce a recession to stop inflation and then he had to run for reelection. You wouldn't do that if winning was what you cared about carter didn't care about winning because it wasn't about his what he was going to do to make america like manage manage its actual government. It was what it was he was going to do for its soul. He was what he was going to do for its spirit but that's not that job and that's that's one of the the horrors of the american presidency is because it is this civic uh god. It's this. It's this god king like there's so much energy around the presidency and they have so much actual power and they have so much psychic power and so much of it is put into the demands of one individual that that that the mechanics of power that they preside over and the spiritual like metaphorical internal. Uh spiritual processing of that mater reality get inter intermingled and so carter did not start from the principle of.

I know what I could do to make america's mil government function. He was gonna fix the spirit but that wasn't what was the problem there was no problem with that it emanated from the structure. Nixon understood that I mean he didn't really give a  sick little pervert who got off on power because it filled the gaping hole in his in his stomach and so nixon says uh no we'll do wage and price controls even though that was that's the keynesian answer that's like that's the that that was the hegemonic new dealer answer and that is why when carter got in there the only option anyone saw was austerity because the only alternative the left-wing alternative. The one that teddy kennedy ran on in 1980 was waging price controls and the thing is when they said that was a bad idea they were not wrong. We literally had just had wage and price controls under nixon and they didn't work. But that's all that was in the keynesian cupboard that was all that was in the new deal. The great society covered because it was trapped in the logic of the  capitalist system that demanded profit that demanded the uh that that demanded continued purchasing in a consumer matrix to offset the amount of alienation being being carried out through the process of of the wage relationship.

In that context. There's two roads one of them you know doesn't work but it could maybe work in the short term to make keep your party in power and the other deals with the the actual. Uh like econo political political economic malfunction within the system transfers from the political to the economic uh and and change it and actually addresses the problem and that's what they po chose. They chose austerity and the thing is by addressing the problem in capitalist terms. What's this oh it increases exploitation. It increases exploitation of third world people by turning them from peasants into uh wage. Laborers which means yes standard of living goes up but so does exploitation and alienation. It does and you can say it's a trade-off worth making but it's not one that those people are making by choice. It's not a democratic choice it's being thrust upon them. They're getting more a higher standard of living and in a lot of cases barely that in exchange for giving up control over their uh environment but but the j. But that's their decision or hypothetically. You would think by people who claim otherwise to believe the idea that we are independent beings who deserve to make a choice in our destiny but no that just happens because it's invisible because the market doesn't. The market draws people through capillary action for the country to the city and turns them into a proletariat.

No one's hands are on the trigger. There's no law. There's no uh. There's no emptying you're not empty like pol pot emptied the cities by gunpoint and that's a horrible thing and it was but filling. Those cities was a horrible thing too but there was no you didn't need to put a gun on anybody and so and in the country in the us which had been the arsenal democracy and then then the winner of world war ii and then the sole industrial behemoth of a world coming back into a demand for a civic. Consumer infrastructure which we provided but in so doing. We also had to stand up our former enemies to keep them from being subsumed by the soviets which depleted our ability to dominate the uh.


The export markets decreasing profits for american industry and then putting pressure on the bretton woods uh dollar system which resulted in nixon taking us off gold which meant that if we were going to still be the reserve currency we had to run a massive trade deficit which we have basically ever since that is why anybody who talks about how like there's some right populism that's going to come up and it's going to from the like the economic left outflank the democrats like tucker carlson's going to lead some heron folk democracy that's going to really bring the jobs back instead of just say they're going to do like trump that's wishful thinking in certain degree like I mean even if you say it would be horrible you at least would love to see some sort of acknowledgement that we are masters of our economic destiny. But they would in order to do that they would have to be willing to get rid of the world reserve. Currency being the american dollar and go towards something that kane suggested at bretton woods which is to have a global exchange currency that was not tied to any one national economy do you think tucker. Carlson is going to sign up for that globalism foe out of here but that's the thing that is how you can. That's you got nixon and carter who basically the same problem in front of them and what determines their action is which psychological like what what what role that they think they're doing and republicans because they're the id of the system think that they're operating out of uh just dr blind drive that's then cloaked in righteousness. However they decide to tell themselves the democrat thinks of themselves first and foremost as someone who exists to be a virtuous to be outward focusing even though it's in this context of capitalism where that is rendered a joke by the reality of the brutal oppression and alienation of capitalism and the desacralization of all exchanges and then replace them with them replacement of them by market relationships which are inherently sterile and which accumulate towards exploitation. You don't you're not going to record with that but so but you're going to try to be a good person and so you either put a cynical lid on inflation. So you can get to that second term and negotiate that trilateral uh deal with the other world powers that puts us on a position to step down from dollar hegemony in a way that doesn't destroy our us our economic system.

So we can like have a handoff to a more globalized system of world capitalism where we're no longer the headquarters. But we keep most of the uh the the lucr because we're like senior partners the way that this uh the way that the uk did after world war two I gotta do it. I'm nixon. I'm the smart guy. I can do that carter on the other hand is like oh people need to work look. People need to learn to live with less and be less consumers be more. Citizens put more investment into their lives around them and not in what they buy really are you going to do anything to change the thing that makes america consumer society any of the brutal alienating factors that replace all of our meaning with dollar worth. Like we replace any kind of of abstract spiritual social worth with concretized dollar worth and all and you're going to tell people you need to live on less. But we're not going to let you live in any different way you still need to pay the rent every. Month you still need to save for your kids college you still uh need to work 40 or 50 hours a week for a boss who tells you what to do and whose labor and who takes your labor and keeps it for himself. The vast majority of it and you got to live in a physical infrastructure that keeps people apart from each other and uh and a mass. Media topped on top of that that that uh further alienates and splinters and keeps people away and replaces the social with some imagined uh monoculture that you're all participating in spite like at the etheric plane but never interacting with personally never generating from the ground up. But you but you're you you're gonna be able to find more meaning in life. Even though conditions for your life haven't changed right. No you're gonna listen to another guy ronald reagan when he says. Cut taxes we still get the party and then what happens is.

The volcker shock ends up uh doing what carter wanted to do and said we needed to do which was balance the economy on the back of workers by breaking labor power and the demand of the labor share of profit which is one of the things that did drive inflation. It's not like it didn't drive inflation. But it's the one driver of inflation that they essentially decided to get rid of. They neutered labor flat line on the chart for the last 40 years but they did it behind our backs. They did it slowly. They did it under morning in america. They did it with the reagan finery around it and people didn't even know it was happening carter because he was honest wanted to tell people up front what he was going to do to them and as long as there's another party that's not bound by your weird kink your weird subconscious need to be uh to be uh seen by others as virtuous this. This uh part of this this party that exists to suppress the urges for the greater good without confronting any of the underlying psychosis that generates that desire which is the actual reality of capitalism. The unexamined ego you want people to like be wide awake when they get uh their.

Medicine you're gonna lose and then the other party's gonna win which is what they've been doing ever since the cicadas are out there. They're clacking away. People are telling me that that was a squirrel the other day by the way that was just hollering that's terrifying. They just look so cute and fluffy. I did not know they could make noises like that is step family porn a psyop. You know. I'm starting to think that the conspiracy mindset that's now emerging on the left. It's not obvious. It's not the same thing as the q anon thing. In fact the q anon thing is like a flight from reality and I think that the uh conspiracy mongering on the left about stuff about what's psyops also counts as a sort of step for uh. It counts as a step forward for some people which is why I think it's to be encouraged whereas the the uh the q one is to be lamented. Not like anything you can do about it but just to look down with horror and be like oh god oh god. Now. I'm not talking about chewing on. I'm not talking about true and on I feel like those guys do their homework and and their  is real and that like there are ops obviously ops are everywhere what I'm saying is. The instinct people have that is generated by this new awareness that epstein helped create of the reality of parapolitics to say everything that you encounter is a is an op.

That's what I'm talking about and I think what that is is. People are essentially trying to psychically red pill themselves towards an awareness of cap of like capitalism like trying to get the no live glasses on you know trying to forge the no sorry that they live glasses of of socialism. But you know it's. It's it's not going to be fast and easy for everybody because a lot none of this stuff is intuitive. If you grew up in america like it runs counter to everything you've been taught the deep ideology and pushing against that is difficult and I feel like understanding on one level that all social uh phenomenon are generated not by rna like uh uh our individual sins our individual deficiencies like bad things in culture. Bad things in society don't just come from us being bad people like choosing to do bad that that moralistic calvinist framework that's not true that's that's that's a fanta. That's a spook that's meant to mystify you. Uh. It's generated by the social relationship. The the actual relationship of production that shapes the world everyone lives in making people's uh making life making daily. Life is what makes bad things happen because it's generated by those those interactions by by that that fundamental the fundamental quest for sustenance of all kinds that makes up human existence in a social context. But it's hard to hold on to that because it's abstract and it's hard to connect it to the world around you because it's so far removed from your experience of events and I feel like it is an intermediate step for people trying to get deeper to the idea of these things being generated by by the social order to a like.

They can't get there they can't stay there but where they can stay create like imaginatively is to some some expression of that order in the form of intelligence in the form of the deep state in the form of the the the men in black and then say aha. I understand that school shootings or stepmom porn I understand that these aren't because we're not doing this because we're naughty people. We're sinful people. We don't deserve nice things. These aren't these aren't the expressions of a sick society as in six citizens. It's an expression of a social relationship that is untenable and producing more and more horrifying alienating lives for the people who live in it that is generating more and more profanity of spirit uh. But it is an agent of our structure that does it the cia.


The deep state that's that's connects you. It's the it's the it's the linkage between just events as they occur and as they coalesce into trends that we recognize and the the the superstructure and then the base it connects the two connects bass and superstructure as a mental architecture as I like to use that term. I know. I say it too much but in this case I'm literally meaning like a like a piece of  connective tissue or a bridge a bridge so um so I i say. I so that's why. I don't get mad at people when they want to ask what they want think everything's an op. I just say there are ops but they're not everything because if they're everything then we have no agency at all right if everything. But that's there's a paradox there. If everything is an op then they wouldn't need to do ops if you know what I mean you've reached the point where you're not really. Uh. You're you're you've stepped back too far you're.

You're not describing discrete you're not just that you're turning the ter the map into the territory basically because like every like there are events within a a there's like a sheet of events rippling out you know and they form into events that have patterns to them and some of them are cause of some things and some other cause are other things at a certain point. You've lost descriptive ability if the thing that you're describing is what is responsible for everything so that that leaves you with a situation of well. Some things are real and some things aren't how do I find out you actually have to like look into it. You actually have to start you have to assume that they aren't and then and then change your opinion. Based on discovering more evidence that they are you have to start from an assumption that they aren't all because at this point there's so much amorphous  in the internet and it's so easy to get curated versions of events even if you don't even realize that's what you're searching for the way that people might not even know that they're the ones moving the uh planchette in a game of ouija. You're you're tunneling into a reinforcing uh epistemic circle without even being aware of it. So you got to start from the assumption that they aren't and then have to be convinced like. It's. It's it's. It's a mod like there's a reason that it became that that's the basis of like the english common law because it is a uh. It's a epistemic tool to array things into like into yes or no propositions. Where's your starting position and it needs to be no or else.

Everything would just piles up like stepmother porn. My I see it absent any evidence if everybody is literally if huge. If a bigger bigger percentage of people stay at home and a bigger and bigger percentage of people uh get divorced or at least you know. At this point a solid 50 percent of marriage is divorced but more and more people live at home. The amount of interactions between step parents and step children is going to increase exponentially over time. People covet what they see every day clarice. I mean part of it is for me.

It's like for a lot of these neets especially like porn addicted neats who are like consuming a lot of the porn which is a lot of people because there's a lot of people who just just watch porn or mostly watch porn in terms of their sexual life and uh they don't have jobs you know they're. They what what are. They gonna do with a fantasy of like having sex with somebody at the water cooler. They don't have a  job they live in their parents house. They don't go anywhere they're on the internet all day. The only woman they engage in in any way with in any given moment or maybe their stepmom or whoever lives in their house. So giving them a fantasy of having sex with their stepmom is a fantasy that's achievable in their mind is like a possible thing as a gateway. It's something to intensify the pleasure because you can imagine actually having sex with somebody in your house. Oh you're going to go on a date you're going to interact with a strange woman that's too much of a fantasy so and same thing with like mass shootings. I think america's messed up enough to produce people who snap and shoot each other considering how many guns and how much just unregulated social dysfunction. We've got uh and if you have but if you have specific evidence I'll listen to it.


I just think that like you need to just start from a position that these things aren't and then you have to be convinced and like. I think the thing like true and on is good because I think they're actually a model for doing it. But the problem is is that like it takes rigor to do it the way they do and it's much easier to just sort of have a hip off the hip cake. But that's because people that's that's because like the stakes are lower your take you know you're not you're not a professional podcaster that take doesn't matter. It's just going to accrue some likes or whatever. But if that's the case just like well. Then why have an opinion at all like why do you have to have a take at all. Why not if there's nothing in it for you like my thing with a lot of the issues people demand. I have an argument about and like have a real strong opinion about. It's like well. What does it benefit me to have this opinion. What does it benefit anyone else to have an opinion about something that has by definition to be largely cut off from any deeper understanding of it that I could even lean on. But the thing is everything gets flattened so q anon doing like rigorous stuff gets turned into takes for everything and then that turns into your world. View. Now you know obviously as I've said a million times. If it's happening online. It doesn't matter but if enough people have like the wrong world overview in their head.

It's hard for them to uh to act effectively but can't convince them of that and that's why you can't change it at the level of the discourse because they have to experience it for themselves. They have to have a real experience in life that leads them in one or another direction. You cannot convince them out of it. You might convince that a few people but the pers the uh efficacy is so low that it and I might point out that the backlash is so much more like. I would say that I think you could definitely argue successfully that the discourse has changed the minds of people but I would make another argument that is just as you know unbound by facts. Like this isn't the thing we could decide for us. Empirically. This is purely a rational exercise because we're not going to be able to ever get this information and everything that will be called information is going to be anecdote. So I would say on the question of whether it's like the discourse is an effective place to fight. I would say this there's two propositions. One is that more people have their minds changed by encountering arguments online than our reinforced in bad opinions that lead to bad outcomes by the very act of observing and engaging in the online argument and you cannot prove.

Either of these you have to just say what into yourself which one you think is more realistic which one is fits with your vision of like your rational mind. Your reason which one seems more reasonable to you that more people discreetly as individuals read an opinion that is diet. That is uh right interact with their wrong opinion and have a change and this is important not just switch from one wrong opinion to the other because that happens but that's different and you'd have to be able to say no no no not when anybody not like when ian miles. Chong goes from sjw to red pill like that doesn't count. He changed his mind even if you you know you can say it was cynical but say it wasn't that happens. Sometimes that doesn't that's not good uh. You have to say that that happens enough to be worth spending that time there barring how much time people spend there how much energy is put there. There's another proposition that says that whatever that number is that people change their mind towards something better. It is by far overwhelmed by people who are reinforced in wrong opinions by engaging in this stupid.

In the first place and I would say a good example of that is the thing in kansas which became this battle of like absolute propositions human like dignity the ability to like be a human being without without your attempts to live your life in good faith being destroyed by some monstrous uh uh mechanism of of punishment. This foucaulian nightmare uh or or the proposition that uh that there's like this monstrous misogynist left that essentially just wants to uh you know create a heron folk democracy around uh around socialized labor uh but subjugated socialized public labor but subjugated private female house house labor and it's like holy. That's a big argument damn. I see the point on both sides. What's this about. It's about a 19 year old running for state legislature. Why is a 19 year old running for that seat because and this is where this is where the  mystification of the discourse comes in. Although the only way people filter. This stuff like who's a good candidate in the political sphere who's a good guy who's a bad guy. It's do. They have the right opinions right because it's just I'm running for congress on a platform of these opinions and so this is the shibboleths. I talk about when I talk about how online argumentation just creates lines where everything is just a formal shibboleth so that means that when you're evaluating a campaign or a candidacy or an event the only thing that matters is what they say about anything but there's a reality that you're trying to elect somebody to a job and presumably that is supposed to be an advance for forces of good. They're supposed to do something in that office that is positive.

I would suggest and submit that a 19 year old by definition cannot do that they do not have the life skills mental uh competence knowledge base uh maturity to do it and more importantly the social ability to negotiate the halls of power. No identify good faith from bad faith actors among the current legislatures picking your moment with pieces of legislation to make to actually push something forward find out who you can deal with in good faith and who would require you to get rid of your morals if you have them if you're not just saying it and how would we ever know if you weren't just saying it. The devil can quote scripture if he wants to so. I say a 19 year old can't do that job and you could say well. Then no one else. There was nobody in that district who stood up would you rather have no one stand up honestly yes. I would. I would rather have no one do it than a 19 year old and the fact that a 19 year old did. It tells me that whatever the situation is in kansas uh that legislature was never gonna do anything. He wasn't gonna serve as a beacon. He wasn't gonna like lead some sort of realignment. Because there is no groundwork there is no social base to generate anything other than a 19 year old. No one else stepped forward that is fallow ground. Now you can run in fallow ground if you have uh some sort of connection to a project but being 19 tells me. There was no project.

It's just people doing what they want to do. It's people going from hey. One vote is just one vote. This isn't really doing politics to me running for office is doing politics but really. It's not that much more because these things have to multiply upon access of coordination. We have to do these things in concert the org.


The activism has to be the kids bouncing the basketball in the goddamn chinese video everyone's talking about and if it's a 19 year old then the structure did not exist to generate anything viable there and all the other arguments that became world-ending. Questions of morality are built on a edifice of delusion if people look through that lens of that event. Realistically they would say do. I have to say anything about this at all and they would say no that's not cowardice that is triage and the only way that that doesn't make sense to you is. If the only access is the is the is the axis of ideology and getting the right opinions and dividing the good from the bad but like. I said you could say this guy's a good guy and the evidence is look at the things he says and look at the things he believes in. That's one thing you have to judge somebody by and it certainly beats judging them by whatever the hell democrats talk about like. He said he's a nice person. He said he likes ice cream and he said he thinks I'm cool. It's much better for it to be cold political points of view but those are still just things you can say because nobody is acting from a position of power. It's all air words are wind and they're not just wind and you have to use them as a first step but then guess what happens you organize first by what people say and then what by they do and I'm sorry.

There's nothing you've done by 19 that necessitates especially at state senate in kansas that necessitates that level of investment you have to be deluded. You have to be stuck on this narrow strip of ideological combat between other people. All of whom are caught in the epistemic chamber totally disconnected from the broader working class completely and even if you're right in a narrow sense you are wasting your time and everyone wastes some time you your life. I mean wasting time is one of the things that makes uh life bearable in under current conditions but you might be wasting time that we don't have to waste see. This person says what if he's a 19 year old with a unusually savvy political might and a movement behind him. A movement that produces a 19 year old candidate is not a movement that I respect how about that because ideas aren't the only thing ideas aren't the only thing there's a you're you live in three dimensions and one and there's a social dimension to life like you're trying to turn these things into just like you're trying to turn them into this abstracted battle of ideas instead of a real attempt to. Gain power through human existing political structures there was nobody older than that in your movement you aren't there yet and that's not that doesn't mean don't try for it. It does mean that whether you win or not is not the end of the world it's epiphenomenal because there is they're too track and this is what gets a lot of people confused about. The efficacy of electoral politics is that there are two tracks of electoral politics that are going to emerge from the left moment that we're living in to the extent that it exists one is going to be coordinated action involving uh you know organizations of different levels of of uh volunteer and cadre intensity coming together through coalitions to coalesce around candidates that agreed to an existing platform and work in concert with others and then there are going to be adventurous people who inspired by that movement decide on their own to do it.

There is nothing that they're not ops some of them might be. There's no you shouldn't assume any of them are ops until you're presented with evidence to the contrary uh. They are totally totally in 100 percent um earnest and they want what's best for everyone but because they're americans they don't know what that means they're guessing. Like we all are they're struggling blindly through the dark. That's why that's what the class project is. It's people hollering in the dark until they can hear each other and then they can hold hands and then they can lead each other out of the  darkness people doing it outside of the context. It's not. They're not hurting anything necessarily unless their battle becomes. A huge sink for resources and attention that it doesn't deserve. But it is just going to be somebody hollering out into the darkness because they're not hearing the other voices and it's like yeah. It sucks to be able to figure out which one's which but you've got to do it.

You got to try fred. Hampton didn't run for anything it's levels of accountability within an organization you can trust people because you have a level of accountability that involves personal relationships. Elected officials are abstracted from that so you have less of a social dimension to your control over their actions and that has to be filled by their own virtues and you can only know that through the accumulation of their actions to that point which require uh which require maturity. All these categories are getting confused in people's minds. I'm not going to say a 19 year old can't lead a  political grassroots political organization that involves like committees of people who are in in absolute uh like uh relationship to one another and accountable to each other. Elected officials are accountable to anybody and the thing is this is going to be a problem because we've talked a lot about how the middle section of america political class. The people who might realistically run for office has been completely gutted uh and that it's created a political class that is reinforcing and part of a broader managerial class and that it's gonna have to emerge from the working class that's true. But it has to at some point. These things have to come into contact with other spokes with other nodes in order to be reinforced into a meaningful action or else. They are just spent pointlessly see. This is the thing people say you're saying a kid can't do.

Something. Running for office is qualitatively different and this is the thing everybody wants to do everything the idea that there's anything constraining. Anyone's relationship to any action is horrifying and why is that because we're operating out of a libido understanding of politics where as much as we think we want what's best for everybody at the end of the day. What we really want is what's best for what we think we want and we have confused those to an extent or they're overlapping to an extent that we can delude ourselves further into thinking that our personal selfish uh pursuits are for the greater good but at some point that turns into an unsustainable delusion and you know when that point is when you connect to other people and then they check you and you realize oh. I can't do this as long as you're online as long as you're fighting these battles in the virtual space. Then you can do anything and you can be anybody. I mean the sunrise movement I mean i. I definitely think that's a step in the right direction compared to one off's runs for congress and  by by people who have no experience or understanding of what they're doing and are not connected to anything broader than like a friend network or a bunch of people on a facebook page or a subreddit. Uh. But it's they're also showing that they are their kids they're figuring it out. Like the way they got rolled on the on the uh. It was very predictable the way they got rolled on the morse thing you could have seen that coming a mile away and one of the things that would have aided that was maturity was a little more experience to know what what principles like how principles should be applied in reality instead of just like squirting squid ink out of virtue because that's all you've learned because your politics is until very recently because you're young by definition only involves signaling.

I mean I just think if somebody had that on their record they would say oh. I'm a bad candidate for this. I shouldn't do this because as much as you can say that the uh the mob was wrong and awful and disgusting to see. It was how do you not assume that's going to happen because the number of people I see who complain every day about the awful bang woke. Mobs are now outraged that the anti-will the mo the woke mobs are out again but what did you expect to happen and essentially what they I assume happened. What hoped to happen was well.


No one will find out you can't operate off that assumption in a political battle. These people are  franklin. Roosevelt's grandson was involved in that  badger game. This is this is capital you're dealing with. These are the cosmic forces of nature. These are the warlocks who have seized control who actually wield power in this structure. You're not going to exploit every  thing they can and then have armies of of useful idiot woke people who are going to grasp on to a chance to show their virtue again and a chance to show how they're they're the good people and to find heretics to burn.

You don't think they're going to do that of course they're going to  day. How's that going going how has been telling them not to do it been going it's an irresponsible thing to do in the first place and as bad as horrible as it is to drag a kid for that. It is irresponsible to do in the first place and it's not his fault. It doesn't make him a bad person. It means he didn't have anybody to tell him not to do it and why didn't he have anybody to tell him what to do. Why didn't he tell anybody to why didn't. He have anybody to tell him not to do it because he didn't have anybody who had any  perspective on this outside of we should be we should be running for office. We need to be the ones in power because voting isn't enough and the thing is is like the horrible thing is. I could say all that and people and then say well then what and that's the horror.

That's the nauseas that I don't know because by definition it can't be any of this stuff but where else are we able to feel that we're acting. It's a nightmare and that is where that is where changing material conditions come in as just a thing to cling to a thing to get you through the day but also a reality not just coping but part of it is coping is realizing. I don't know it's going to work but I do think it requires people to take a good hard look at their relationship to politics in terms of what they think is effective action and to challenge themselves to ask themselves deeply do. I want this because I think it'll do any good in the world or do. I want this because it satisfies some need. Some social need to be reaffirmed in a social platform and the hope the only hope we have is that if enough people will ask themselves that and by asking themselves that able to they are able to clear the foggy windshield of their perception of the world around them and find a path forward the leap of faith and I know that sucks because people want to  blueprint but it has to be felt. You have to be driven by by a self an engine of self-interest of some kind and it's either our our libido self-interest or it is a deeper.

Understanding is a deeper understanding of the greater good that emotionally encompasses everyone and not just us and that is very hard to come by and it's not something. Even that once you feel you just keep feeling you have to work for it and it goes away because the the world in front of you is arrayed before you as this buffet of pleasures in this litany of horrors that you have to negotiate and that drives you towards self-satisfaction to self-comfort it. It drives all of us but we have to find a practice in our lives to allow a clarity to see the distinction between us and the world. Around us recognize the delusion that delusion for what it is and genuinely feel a social obligation that's spirituality broadly understood the specific definition of it. That's personal.

That's why anybody who wants some sort of trad return to enforced state religion is deluding themselves. You cannot un  the dog you cannot take the toothpaste and put it back in the tube we are different. We have been transformed through the dialectical process. We have been pulverized against the rocks of capitalism and  uh protestantism and materialism and every ism uh in science and under and and technology more than anything in capitalism. Most of all we are different things and we have to recommit we have to re we have to recycle eyes the world on a new uh a new foundation and it's going to include you know the language and vocabulary and mental worlds of existing religions because that's what people have in their head. That's what has meaning to them already and they're going to have to accrue. They will accrue meaning along those axis but that meaning will not be you know. The the sectarian horrible religion practiced by most you know religious people in the world sadly but a broader spiritual awareness.

A rhizomatic understanding of of interest is co-mingling and emotional. That's the thing a lot of people understand uh as a matter of intellectual exercise that we are all in this together. The way bernie says that we genuinely are social beings who need to act from a social basis. We understand that intellectually but we don't really feel it we and this was true for me for many years. I understand that a lot intellectually but at the end of the day I'm still me and they're them. I perceive myself as outside of them. And so therefore I have to get mine first a spiritual understanding of the world that I'm talking about understands oh no no there is no distinction meaningfully to be made between me and them and by them. I mean everybody on earth. There's no meaning. There are gradients of like uh of familiarity that array along like symbolic orders that we've encountered in our lives but they are just gradients. They're gradients of of that add up to the demiurgical shadow reality we find ourselves in but in reality everyone is me and what that means is that you are operating libidially from a position of altruism not managing to go through not ideologically transitioning from self-interest to uh. Altruism genuine like your self-expression is towards an understanding of a social obligation and I'm not saying people are bad if they don't have that. I don't think. I was a bad person when I didn't have that and by the way. I don't have that all the time it's. It's a it's a light bulb that is flickering at all times it gutters out and it flies up and I have to work to tend that. Uh that that is not something that is blaring and it's like I'm not a better person. I'm not some sort of a better person than people who don't think that way because you can operate from personal or from a personal uh perspective and do good things and be a good person absolutely and someone.


I respect what I'm saying is that if that's the only way people operate people in aggregate. Not individually people in aggregate will move towards pathological behavior will move towards undermining their own uh efforts and undermining their own uh uh movements. But that's not an individual judgment of individual people. It is a no. It is a recognition of the law of large numbers if everyone's operating out of self-interest eventually especially in a culture like ours. Those are going to in aggregate lead people to misaligning and not misaligning as like good and bad but as a gradient like these things are in everyone. These instincts are in everyone and have to be battled and uh are part of life and part of the struggle of life and getting towards a position where we all feel. That is what we're talking about when we're talking about the world spirit coming into recognition of itself.

This is what we're talking about when we mean the teleology of marxism is a moment when everybody is operating from a felt position of interconnection. Not a reasoned position of interconnection. That's when you get rid of the idea of coercion that's when the state literally doesn't need to exist and markets don't need to exist because no one is operating from a position of self-interest at all. But it isn't but the thing is is that it cannot be con enforced. You can't do it through re-education camps or gulags. You can't do it through rude. Propaganda people have to feel it. They have to feel it because they have to live in conditions that allow them to feel it. That is why we have to all make leaps of faith every day to make the world more like that in our interactions with each other so that people can sustain it in their hearts and give it to others until enough. People have it that we can stave off disaster and re-right the  ship. I hope that made sense a little bit. I am not on acid no not on acid. I hope some of that made sense. Some people are mad at me.

But I'm good if people have honestly i. I do think if people. I get i. I have open dms. I talk. I read. I read the reddit about me if people got problems. I about my stuff. I definitely encounter it and I and I try to reason it out. I just don't want to do it in a public forum because that contributes to the debate. I hate uh in the preening and it makes me less likely to act the way that I know. I should it'll make makes me more likely to disassemble and be dishonest and to use uh solipsistic trickery in order to get my way because of my awareness that I'm competing you know in front of an audience if it brings out the worst in me. I think it brings out the worst in a lot of people. Not everybody. Some people thrive in it in terms of it making them better able to you know engage with the truth. For me. It gets me farther from the truth and farther from the best version of myself. But I encount I engage with feedback so let me know.

If. I'm off the rails here all right maybe. I'll take a couple questions that went pretty wow holy crap that was an hour wow I gotta say that was kind of a blur so yeah maybe a couple of cool down questions and yes uh nine uh 8 30 tonight me and uh loan option will be starting our rnc stream. It's there's a lot of lamos tonight but we've got the  gun couple which I'm very excited for and dj tj who is. I really hope that he like kills it because. I really want him to run for a president someday because he's the real. He's the real deal.

He's the copy of the copy of the copy. He's like if if the uh if the fourth copy of michael keaton in multiplicity if someone copied him if that sounded too abstract and like not grounded that's because I'm describing the actions of people a people and I'd say like a people like a sub-grouping of americans who are essentially frictionless in their mental realm. Like even when they interact with other people. They're. They're they're beveling the world and I'm a part of it. I'm not saying. I'm not who they bevel the world around their psychic world like the fixation on like seven seven warning signs on a guy's bed or uh seven books that it's a warning sign. If a guy has on his shelf. I mean it boils down to editing people to be reflections perfect reflections of your opinions. It's it's it's literally shed shaving the world down to the to the shape of your opinions that you totally that are totally detached from reality and totally generated from entirely hypothetical conversations online so I feel like yes. This is all like flighty but I mean I hope when I talk about something that's more grounded. I like to think that I'm I can. I can summon it but right.

Now. There isn't this is this is the the pseudo-reality that people are spinning their wheels within there is no way to ground it. It is purely generated and does not reconnect except through the discrete actions of individuals whose actions dissipate because they're not cumulative because they're not coordinated and I will admit that I'm good at thinking frictionlessly because I'm one of these people I know how the bastards think. I am one of I've been staring at this machine. For 20  years. It just rewired my brain in ways that I are maybe irreparable and I'm trying to make some sort of uh understanding of it. Like some sort of retrospective understanding of what it did to me and how I can move forward from it without reinforcing all of the bad things okay you know. I would actually say that uh somebody asked who the stars the the chapel if they were on the enterprise uh. I would say will's obviously captain kirk. Felix is spock. I'm bones uh amber is scotty. Oh and virgil is uh the computer all right guys uh. I'm outta. Here. I'm bushed. I need to eat bye.
