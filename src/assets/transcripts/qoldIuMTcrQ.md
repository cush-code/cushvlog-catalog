Are you part the waters same ones that I'm thirsty for you invite your friends to teach. But when it's me you lock the door you got your credit cards and you thank your. Lucky stars but don't forget the what who puts the bill well you part the waters the same ones that I'm drowning in I'm the one who helps you sin you got the grand peace and no you don't even pay me piano. I'm the one who plays piano you don't even play piano all right what about you part the waters. The same ones that I ah Howdy Folks I'm back once again after a break just letting everybody know that there will probably be some uh attack coming up. Soon here. I'm gonna be going off the grid uh off of uh the socials and off of the streaming platforms and off of the podcast for a little while some of you know why uh but I'll be back don't worry about. It changed having burst forth out of a chrysalis and become a glistening new subject. It'll be interesting to see how that goes I'll have I'll report back certainly and we're back on Friday. The way God intended it yes thank you. Lucky stars but don't forget the ones who foot the building so yeah. How's everybody doing don't really know how to start today. I have this vague idea of something I want to talk about but I don't really have a hook for it. So it's just sort of sitting there in my mind. Maybe I'll just interact with some comments to see if anything bursts for us as it often does so if anyone has any prompts or questions please go so.

I can like get off of the get off the the starting blocks. Here oh the Argentinian anarcho-capitalist is about to become a president of Argentina that'll be entertaining that'll be something to watch. I don't know how much fun it'll be in Argentina but you know I get why it's happened you know like uh. The peronist Horizon has has just dominated Argentina for so long that they're at the point where the only thing that's gonna feel like a way out is something radically different and that is one thing that has not been tried. Reddit libertarianism. That's the one thing that has not been part of the peronist big tent at one point or another. So of course people are going to look at it as uh as a way out because they are right now the inflation country and it's very funny that they just joined bricks because not only are they the inflation country which doesn't really seem like it's going to help bricks too much uh. They also are on the brink of electing as president a guy who promises to make the US dollar the currency of the country. Basically the opposite of de-dollarization. They tolerant the  out of things but it'll see if they even if it even goes for it. The real thing to see with him is just you know how far from a uh center point of you know reactionary keynesianism.

I don't know what you would want to call the current regime we're living under uh that dominates every major government. Uh. There is play on on the edges you can be more or less in different axises. You know Europe is more Social Democratic than the United States uh things like that but and there you know there are countries that try to do uh radically more like libertarian State cutting. But there's a limit to how much that you can do and to what extent what you do do ends up being just replacing the private of the public sector with a contractor. Uh sector that essentially carries out the same uh functions as the state by the state at a higher cost. That's what libertarianism often creates in practice. They say we're cutting this government thing but then that only means is that now they've got to hire people to do it because there's a reason the government was doing it and there's also a governmental uh element to the planning and executing of that sector. So all you end up doing by privatizing is now making it so that instead of dealing with sectors of the government you're dealing with contractors who are taking their direction from their employers. The state and that just decreases efficiency and increases cost but doesn't actually do any of the things that the libertarian uh justification would suggest because again it's not actually changing any Dynamics. It's not changing any uh functions of the state is just making it less affection less effective and less efficient and that you know then therefore. Therefore therefore further delegitivizes government and boosts the argument of the libertarian right. It's amazing but again the premise here is that there's only fo so far you can go in that direction before you hit the hard limits of what the system requires in terms of State Management of the economy. Since the libertarian idea that they're separate uh separate machines they're separate things is an illusion and it's illusion that is useful to systems as they exist. It helps it creates Consciousness Within These systems that explains the way all the bad parts of it without indicting any of the necessary parts of it and it can Propel those groups of people into political power that can further entrench uh that system's control. But what they can't do within. The political system is a breakthrough of the orthodoxies to the a millennary. Horizons that libertarianism promises because libertarianism Libertarians love to imagine that they are the opposite of the millenniary Communists who are always trying to immunotize the eschaton but the libertarian vision of government is as eschatological and millenniary. As the lefts is because it's all part of the same liberal middle class. Basically uh uh reaction to modernity's emergence and psychological psychological revulsion towards it. They want to fundamentally break things that make capitalism work. The gold standard is a perfect example of this. The gold standard if actually implemented would destroy overnight the entire global economy uh in in an apocalyptic sense uh now for the Libertarians.

Though True Believers they have a narrative whereby that destruction of the global economy is good. Communists have the same thing they imagine a cumulative class war resulting in a war of positions military and political and economic between classes that will lead to the Triumph of the working class and the obliteration of this Bourgeois subjectivity that leaves everyone Frozen between polls unable to act and therefore resolve their uh spiritual sickness because actions that would actually improve their not necessarily their subjective conditions but their sense of control of their lives are forbidden. The only way they can act is as subjects obedient subjects so all political Horizons have to have within them. The annihilation of capitalism now liberalism of course doesn't liberalism is the Creed of oh you silly eschatologic eschatologists. We don't need to destroy everything we're going to lead to a peaceful wiggish transfer over time of the rough Timber of humanity into straight Beautiful Boards and the thing that's going to do. It is development capitalist development. Capitalist development will soothe our aches and pains soothe our souls and allow us to achieve a perfect harmony. But what is the perfect harmony envisioned by libertarianism because again you can't have politics without a horizon and that has to be a cumulative and a totalizing horizon. The liberal Horizon is Bourgeois subjectivity for everybody in every place the bourgeoisel life for all but the Bourgeois subjectivity is a schizophrenic sadomasochistic nightmare mind that is at every moment trying to pull itself apart trying to gnaw itself into shreds because it cannot contain the contradictions that are necessary of being the agonized subject between labor and capital between exploitation and exploit. Tater between master and slave that position can temporarily be okay if you have enough bells and whistles in a Suburban Lawn and uh consumer choices which are the actions we can take as liberal subjects. You don't feel so good in your tummy about everything buy this buy that and you can assert that sense of control over yourself. I have this pain but it could be assuaged and I can do the assuaging by raising bread by becoming successful in my field by attaining material wealth and security and then exercising my rights as a consumer that is driven by a lack. A a hole a void at the center of Bourgeois life and this try and it will never be stated and it will consume the globe. Liberalism assumes not uh consciously but implicitly that there will always be a miracle that intervenes to prevent that from happening. Now this is where once again we're at the apocalyptic Horizon for for liberalism.

They are also imagining a cumulative point where that technological eruption that technological miracle that has saved us from ourselves every other time in modern history from the initial capitalist response to The Chronic shortages of the late Middle Ages and the bronze and the uh little ice age the early modern era I'm sorry. Uh that's extracted more from the land to the Industrial Revolution to the fertilizer revolution of the earlier the early 20th century that allowed for a huge expansion of the human population and then the Green Revolution of the 1970s that allowed that level of human population to sustain itself in the face of malthusian pressures. Because people forget now that in the 1970s the big fear uh was that the world was going to collapse uh but not because of climate because of population but not just a population boom that that fertilizer helped produce but also uh was now being destabilized by because there's simply not enough conventional agriculture to feed everyone and then the Green Revolution a bunch of huge technological innovations in agriculture that wildly increased the efficient. The output of a given acre of land dwarf wheat dwarf wheat is a big part of this. If anyone watch The West Wing. There's an episode where president Bartlett wraps his rhapsodic about dwarf wheat and that was a perfect encapsulation of The West Wing because for a liberal things like dwarf wheat things like the steam engine appear as like. Prometheus's fire appear as Gods bestowed on us not by a higher power but by Collective. Human Ingenuity filtered through the market so they think that we will keep getting technological innovations that let it get us to a point where every human lives the pleasures but not the secret psychic pains. Because those are sublimated of middle class life. We all get to be Bourgeois but as I said the Bourgeois mind is at war with itself which means it cannot be stabilized. The pain of it can be reduced by consumption but it can only be postponed. You're only pushing it back and then as soon as mortality really enters the picture as soon as a keen and unleaving sense of mortality enters the human mind which it does around. Middle age uh then that becomes less and less tenable and you see that with people who have everything who have total who who live in now the idea of the liberal Utopia which is a big reason. That liberalism is considered more realistic than the other uh political traditions because they can honestly say that their Utopia has existed in history. The the Communists uh the Libertarians can't really say that they can claim that in time they could accurately claim that in times the fight for these things created the conditions of like the perfected human subject one who is not at war with himself one who is fully and totally embodied and unified in will between body and mind and spirit the holy. Goddamn Trinity that experience existed under communism in the struggle to to attain it but in the pers in the administration of it what it doled out to people it never did. I'm sorry scarcity prevented that it wasn't any fault of the Communists. There was not the sufficient resources versus technology. The ratio of resources to technology in in the places that communism held took power was insufficient for that to happen. Utopia has persisted since the dawn of liberalism among the uh the narrators of modern history.

The people who are in the pilot seat the creative class of the middle class. The creative part of the middle class now of course that's not everybody and it's not most producers. Most of the producers of good art come from the lower class or from the aristocracy but the money and the social technology to disseminate art is concentrated around the middle class Le bourgeois and then like a Mac. This this this this social relationship this complex of relationships that have undergirding them money relationships that have undergirding them exchange Networks Surplus circulation and accumulation. They are dynamos of economic activity that draw like iron filings creative types from every class who together create a popular culture where the human subject resides and that human subject is not the people who uh make the Arts fantasy of them their subjectivity. No that is just the the material the light like that they they will. They will create the uh the film but the light that goes through the film comes from the mind of the consumer because this is a consumer Society defined by consumption for the first time in history a generalized a democratized. If you will culture of consumption facilitated by technology. They become the mind of the middle class that entertains itself with culture and that in that culture is told over and over again. A Narrative of ultimate completion and satisfaction that comes not through class struggle or the old gods like the conservatives. The the reactionaries want but through the pursuit of bourgeois subjectivity. God is absent but the pageantry of human Human Experience is generated and because it's right in front of your face. Every day it becomes real in a way that the libertarian and communist Utopias never can be because they've never been lived. You can say that people have lived in libertarian Harmony and in communist Harmony through history but those lives were incredibly hard. They were miserable. They contained uh a overwhelming amount of conflict violence misery and the proof of that is that the social conflict that that misery created was sufficient to build this modern world and to build the chains of modernity. Foreign and this Bourgeois mind is again in total control of the culture but it's also schizophrenically at war with itself because it is both consumer and uh it is both product and consumption and at this point it is both product because its value as a consumer becomes commodified or if it's a worker. It's labor is commodified so it is both commodity and commodity consumer. It is both Master because it's a middle class which means it probably owns some sort of equity in the system. Land usually homes usually and is connected to uh the ruling structures through that relationship but also has a subject. Precarious relationship to Capital itself can be in solidarity with neither the poor and the exploited or with the rich and Powerful. But this is the mindset that in times of Crisis becomes fascism because if it's deprived of the I'm going to say the word and you can kill me for it. But this is the only word that makes sense treats that keep the the misery. At the heart of this life. The whole the Gap manageable is treats.


You don't feel like you're complete in this world. That's okay consuming x y z will allow you to do that so how do you consume X Y and Z you gotta grind baby you gotta work and what do you get and when I say treats I'm not just talking about  Crispers and Kicking. That's one thing that I can't get over how infantilizing the menus are at a chain family restaurants like they want to humiliate you. They want you to know that you were eating like an infant when they make you order a chicken dipper or a clucking crisper. Like oh yeah. I'll have a chicken dipper please like how old are you and they want you to know that but anyway it's not even about that. It's about like a Kappa a cop's Authority. That's a treat getting to be a treated like a big shot no matter how much of a absolute lummox you are that's a  treat racial. The racial uh a wage is a treat but uh also pornography uh uh legal and illegal drugs because it's also part of the same Market. Those are treats. Sex is a treat because how do you get it money one way or the other. If you're a man money one way or the other and when the treats run out all there is is the psychotic hysterical middle class brain going confronted with a a box that it cannot Escape now that the reason I say psychotic and and and insane is because of course there is an opening there is a trapdoor. There is a way out of the box of oh my God. The treats are running out if I I might have them all but my kids won't and if I cannot place myself in a Continuum through time I cannot make sense of secular life because even though I might have a formal religion it has been secularized into this process and so I am as connect I am as wedded to the idea of passing forward something as.

Uh the the Mongol Kongs were as ancient. Romans were like. They need that the idea oh it's all going to be gone when you leave yeah but that means they're going to leave and they don't want to leave and the last the last thing that because it's a constant bargaining with death as you get older and as and if you've never confronted your own spirit and how your actions have affected other people and you've allowed yourself to be moved like a marionette by the desires to avoid Pain and Gain pleasure. Through this uh the  Skinner box that we live in if you've never confronted that the prospect of death is terrifying no matter how much you say you believe in heaven because you don't really believe you'll go there. Even if you really say over and over again in your head. I am so the thing that actually holds it together. Beyond whatever very shallow patina of Supernatural belief you have what's really undergirding. It is the same thing that undergirded Pagan uh Germanic Chieftains lineage personal lineage not Humanity personal lineage Humanity that is the religious that is the uh communist Horizon that erupted in the mid 19th century as Bourgeois subjectivity was emerging and was the antithesis of it and the thing that could over time confront it and overpower. It. You realize I'm describing the historical dialectic in the exact. Same terms that the Book of Revelation describes the war between heaven and hell because they're all the same narrative and they all involve us creating a Eternal abstraction. Either. It is God's heaven in the uh uh as the as medieval Christianity understood it. It's a supernatural concept or it is the planet  Earth and the staying in the clouds as it was associated with the reactionary.

Trend in modern thought the reaction to the emergence of liberal subjectivity that says no we're staying in the clouds. We're staying in a world where mystery suffuses Our Lives to the degree. Then we can think we're gonna die and go to heaven and have that really power us through our lives without real question and it is that desire to keep that that is the social a base for reaction of course. The material base for reaction is accumulated wealth held by those in power saying. No thank you I don't want to lose it power holders within hierarchies saying no I want to keep my  hierarchy because the abolition of that subjectivity is the abolition of their uh right to rule because the right to rule is fixed in a supernatural web of belief that transcends the visible they want to keep it. So that's what reaction is then the Socialist tradition accepting the implication that this might very well be the only world that exists then transfer that Supernatural affection to a notion of a personal self-perpetuating eternally which is always just going to be a fantasy of our mind in the moment. In our finite moment. Just an extension of our finite mind into an Infinity which is of course impossible so you're like they cannot interact they can't interlock. Instead. We have an idea of our uh at a base level.

Uh we take the connection that oh I'm sorry so what I mean to say is so the people want to. Stay in the in the clouds the reactionaries they still have a material politics and it is around extending their personal line their lineage their DNA because they're operating from what are still basal primitive human instincts. If we want to be uh you know if you want to be teleological about this and we have to because we're talking about the way these things are conceived of and not whether or not they're true that we do live. In this teleology. One way or another that moves us towards some perfected human and those earlier forms extended uh conceptually the human will through a line but of course once you recognize that that is in fact a merely a uh social expression of a biological imperative that is actually not referring to your line specifically but to an entire race because your line cannot persist by itself. No matter what the pheromones are telling you your line cannot persist by itself. It can only persist if the greater line of humanity persists and this is that chain of logic and thought that transforms pre-capitalist uh uh honor like kin honor culture uh to a recognition of universal human Humanity.

And if you do that then your political Horizon moves from extending individual liberty as far as possible so that we can find out through the application of God's instrument. The market who goes to heaven and who goes to hell who's not who's going to be sorted through the giant machine of the market which is where we're now going to see God's will since we can no longer see it in the  bowling alley we paved paradise to put up a parking lot. We also paved uh our over our capacity to engage with the natural world in a way that allows us to have reflected upon us the presence of a Transcendent Consciousness and a Transcendent power that's been abolished going back to it will destroy us but that is what the insane middle class. Mind seeks to do to retreat from the flame but in doing that it will only destroy itself. The way out of the box of course is an alliance with the working class to overthrow the capitalist class and of course you could say but that's impossible. It's not happening now correct that's why it feels like we're in a doom spiral because that mindset was leavened during the popular front New Deal eras until the 70s by an infusion I was talking about how like this middle class media structure is infused from outside by people from both glasses well over time the land-owning aristocratic class who used to write all of our best plays and whatnot according to the oxfordians anyway uh the men of leisure who sit in parlors and and wrote richly psychologically insightful modern novels the the that population uh shrank.

They got rich they  off and they absorbed themselves into the Bourgeois. They took their Investments and became Bourgeois over time so that means they had less time for art and so there were a few of them who were good at art meanwhile though the working class is getting much bigger and as it is uh being integrated into the upward Mobility machine of American liberalism. It's bringing more and more people from the working class into uh the culture machine and making it better and making it more insightful and Rich and truthful and also more politically destabilizing to the system itself. Now at the same time there's another strain of ultra death obsessed. Leading Edge middle class Insanity that's also running like a black thread through the emergence of this popular culture but again you're talking about a small pool there. You're talking about people who are largely psychologically already kind of overclocked and cannot even deal with Keynesian liberalism. At its apogee guys like Bob Welch. The insane man who owned a candy factory in Massachusetts and became the founder of the John Birch Society. The guy had it made in Eisenhower's America and he decided Eisenhower was a communist.


No of course he had what to himself were perfectly reasonable. Reasons reasonable justifications for this beyond all of his understanding of geopolitics. Those mid-sized producers like uh Welsh. They weren't really favored by the uh post World War II. Uh International project you know like the Marshall Plan and all that had a very obvious appeal to Wall Street building up those markets in in Europe again but to American manufacturers who are going to have to face competition that was uh just more of the state's war against success but well it still did well he could have just been like a republican who muttered muttered into his you know into his morning newspaper but he couldn't do that because something else was going on in his mind something personal something that I don't know I've never read a biography of Wilson. I'd be very interested to know about his childhood but his brain incompet combination in conflict with the world. A lot of dents and ridges got put in that in that thing so that when he got in that position after World War II he says no.

I would rather destroy this entire thing I would rather a nuclear apocalypse some sort of Act of Will by God an expression of God's existence a form of judgment will be reigned upon us if we cannot have Freedom which of course is not a thing that can be done like the frontier vision of liberal subjectivity that these guys fixate on the Jeffersonian ideal was superseded by the development of capitalism. So if you want capitalism you have to surrender that subjectivity. But these guys were bought off from it and never really lost it because instead of being thrown into the cities to become uh alienated manufacturer workers. They got to keep their little  factories and their little uh. Tinker toy houses in the countryside and now that that has Dr that seed has now sprung to this poison flower of nihilistic politics because the conditions of those uh middle class people in the in the heart of the body of the American mind are going are cracking up or cracking up under the change in material conditions that undergirds their social order and one expression of that is okay let's destroy this entire thing like the libertarian imagines oh yes we will destroy the the um yes we might have a collapse of the economy but it would very quickly be rebuilt by by all of us on uh tethered Geniuses with with the reins of government gone. We can start from scratch and very quickly rebuild an ideal Society I think that is like a Libertarian fantasy uh. But if you're really in the at the end stage you don't even need that you don't even need to believe that that will happen destruction is enough because it is an act and that is the that is why the only energy in American politics right now is on the right because they know and have accepted that their organized conflict with the state will come to an apocalyptic conclusion and they're okay with that the reason. The left is spent now and discombobulated and uh totally without political power is because the realization after the fail of Bernie hit that that was the case for left Politics as well if we're going to derail this this uh narcanized uh Crazy Train.

The the this. This sh this uh locomotive hospice filled with the dying brains of Boomers who are raging politically while still pressing all the buttons that are keeping us strapped to a death chair but they have on their side. The reason we're all still here is because they know hey if you want anything really different like meaningfully different like change. The trajectory of our imagined human future either for a line and it goes to the right or a source of of fixed with subsets with birth rates great replacement of the end of a race of people which is just a closer uh aesthetic representation of their narrower line-based politics. They're libidinal politics. It literally is just an orgasm through history that is what they're trying to have that is what the right uh allows for. Because it it consecrates as holy a regime of uh domination and for a while you can justify that rationally but over time the rational Falls away because it just doesn't exist. There is no rational reason for that to happen if you organize people collectively and can facilitate with technology. Their communication with one another there will be reached a human Concord that I think is yes an object an Article of Faith but I think a more reasonable Article of Faith to take from the experience of being a uh alienated secular liberal subject. That's how I think of it is for me that is the thing that flows from that experience without trying to second guess it. And if it requires a leap of faith then that is where I can recognize okay. This is where I actually have to believe in something and what is it and for me. It is a concept of God yes that gestures towards God's definition which is the embodiment of all fundamental wholeness and unity and so I say in my heart you know my politics would be oh.

Yes a left Horizon but the left Horizon since we now see that it cannot come from within politics. Bernie was the last attempt to do that in the post-political era can't do these do these buttons still work like we have this rusted machine for working class political mobilization that was part of the democratic party but then got gutted and left out in the field and then the Sanders campaign is a bunch of post-apocalyptic uh um scavengers finding it in a field putting it back together using uh the directions which were like found in a drawer next door next to it uh and putting it together and actually getting the pieces to work so it looks like the the directions. It looks like the page and then you press the buttons and none of them work. The lines are corroded now that doesn't mean the left Horizon is wrong invalidated not to be pursued. It does mean the left Horizon will require more of us than participation mostly passive in electoral politics and because that is a barrier that comfortable Americans myself absolutely first and foremost included don't want to cross because their own personal pleasure is too deeply wedded to their notion of the good and the right and the correct world and so that means that the left is paralyzed.

Not. Anyone's fault like I said I'm part of this. It is a general phenomenon. It will be punctured but only by changes and conditions individually and then collectively over time and so now. Though the energy is on the right where passive participation in politics you believe can actually get you what you want like these guys genuinely believe of course. It's all contradictory and it's all self-nitigating. But that's the nature of the Bourgeois mine. Because it's schizophrenic. It has anti-logic and that's why you cannot defeat these people through reason. You cannot convince them otherwise because it doesn't matter. It's all being libiddenly driven by the desire to annihilate oneself. The death drive to die without having to Humble oneself in any way. Now they might all think oh the elections are rigged. I don't even bother voting and some of them have stopped voting which is very funny. But they also do vaguely understand that if they keep voting for republicans or supporting Maga whatever that means that something is going to give fundamentally and they have their own fantasy of what that's going to look like. They have their own Book of Revelation all written out. It's the it's the.

It's the Q day. It's the day of the Rope and now they might not get it electorally. In fact. I'd say they can't get it electorally because again electoral politics cannot produce a existential conflict within capitalism because the machine exists not to bring about political conflicts but to diffuse political conflicts so it can't do it. It cannot come to that point of rupture from within but if enough spokes get thrown in the wheel from without you could see the emergence of something significant around the money and political and social infrastructure that emanates from this aggrieved middle class now like for example in uh in Spain thinking about Spain a lot since I'm finishing up writing the uh four-part Spanish Civil War series. It's going to be debuting next month. I will be off of the air but you will be hearing. These I believe hopefully. We're going to organize it so that works that way um the middle class who the the the the moneyed middle class who voted for the SATA the Catholic populist party that was the main right-wing party in pre-war Spain. Uh they believe by voting for SATA. They would abolish this existential conflict with the left uh which is how the right will always see the Liberals State and the left together.


The Liberals believe that they can separate those things because they separate those things because they're closer to the left culturally and psychologically. But their positions are completely different and their material interests will always overrun any of their sensitivities so they will always end up siding with reactionary capital on at its most unfettered over a real existential threat to property relations that they depend on and that is what honestly the Communists didn't understand. I don't think you see over and over again and it's from necessity. This attempt before World War one for Stalin and then the common turn and then the Western populist front communist parties to make a deal with the capitalists because hey you see the the fascist as a threat too. But they just did not see those two threats. Symmetrically. The threat of fascism was oh my God am I going to have to salute that Bloody Hitler every morning when I get out when I turn on the radio oh. Oh I mean and it might extend to like deeper worries. But there's no fear that like the fundamental but Bourgeois social relation will be abolished because the fascists don't have an alternative to it. They don't even gesture towards one. It is just the thing we have eternally and at the expense of the other.

Now the SATA did not get what they wanted or the state of Voters didn't get what they wanted but what they did get was a military coup an attempted coup that was fought back at first by the left but then one by the right they got what they wanted. They got Eternal liberal subjectivity and of course no the uh reactionary Catholics who actually fought for Franco the the phalangist youth and especially the carlists who formed the backbone of the of the Army in uh Spain like the true believers at first like before they started conscripting people. The Nationalist force was true believers in the form of carlists and phalangists more carless and phalangious because the flange was uh the middle class. Sons they were the the children of professionals. A lot of them were students or their dads were landowners and when the war happened they all signed up for the flange if they hadn't already and many of them and most of them opted though instead of going to the front to fight they opted to stay in The Villages and towns and make have settle scores with every worker. Whoever looked at them funny any waiter that ever gave them Guff and just line up line them up against the cemetery fence and shoot them oh a fight on the front. No thank you check please because they were they were the senoritos. The car lists were made up of these small holding peasants in northeastern Spain uh from Navarre. They're like bosques who were really fast nationalists because they didn't have any complaints really. They were they they were able to prosperously live on farms where there was enough land for them and their family to farm. They didn't have to hire workers and they didn't have to hire themselves out which means they opted out of capitalist alienated social relations. So of course. They thought Eternal Spain that's the thing and we got to fight for it because these guys want to end it.

But they decide they fought for and and the requestes volunteered in huge numbers to go fight in the  uh front. They didn't want to hang out in the rear they wouldn't have been manly to do that they wanted to go and fight. The enemy. Viva Cristo Ray was their call because they were bumpkins. They were Hillbillies. They were the sons of the soil. You know morons and I don't mean that like that they were existentially stupid. I mean they their lives were of what Mark's called rural idiocy and they were. They were the backbone of that Army.

Other the ones that just got paid other than one of the ex-criminals and uh defeated Moroccan Rebels who were like well if I can't defeat the  who invaded my country. But they didn't get anything they want. The Carlos got squeezed out. They got merged with the falange the single legal political party. They got to keep the red Berets though and anything that they were saying about like a Cooperative economy that like modeled feudal feudal social requirements bilateral not just do not just uh rights but duties to one another gone and then where is Spain. Now it is a Godless place. It was the first place in Europe to legalize gay marriage the state that the requetes saved because Franco managed them to capitalism. He managed he used that he kept a gun to the head of the peasants while they raised agricultural. Uh they intensified agricultural uh investment but kept the gun to the head of the peasants to keep wages down and therefore consumption down and prevent the kind of hyperinflation. You get if you try to do that without seizing the means of production. They built a tourist industry half the people on the coast the Costa Del  Ray Winstone and then even though you know they were uh. They were a medieval country in the 19th century. By the mid 20th century they were you know a relative to Northern. Develop Europe underdeveloped but relative to like the Eastern Europe well-developed country and what happened. They turned into comfortable Bourgeois. No matter what their jobs were in culture and then boom. God died and they  brought in gay marriage uh the king didn't want to continue the tradition that Franco tried to enforce on him because the social conditions have changed because they had been defeated by Victory.

You know the whole stupid Hard Times make stroke men thing that is that's that thing is not necessarily wrong. It's merely a dense and uh pointless description of a historical Dynamic that is powered by class conflict and if you take that part out of it it's meaningless. It's just a way to pose and just desire strong men which really desires what you're really. Desiring is that apocalyptic intervention that will redeem the apocalypse by revealing who deserves to survive and they believe they will survive that contest and the left doesn't because they are materially more vulnerable and I don't and then some of them might have uh jobs that pay them well. But do they know how to  survive absent capitalist social relationships. Do they have the know-how and the social networks to survive in a place where capitalist social relationships are severed. No now I must stress. The right doesn't have these either but this is what's important they think they do. They think that their guns and their self-regard are enough for them to survive that situation. But the reality is they absolutely would not. I mean some of them would individually but they would not be able to persist as free people. The way they imagine themselves.

They would be subsumed into some governing structure if Human Social organism if the Human Social organism continued which it would they would not get to be Eternal uh uh Jeffersonian frontiersmen. They would not get to live a a cyberpunk version of the Western. Bow male masculine ideal. They wouldn't get to be the man with no name they'd die or they would end up being subsumed into some successor statement or more likely become an employee of some self-sufficient corporate techno. Enterprise that is able to put a footprint down big enough to create a circulatory network of Commodities and and you can join them and work on their terms. All all the  Clint eastwoods are going to get killed or they're going to get combined because that dream is a fantasy that fantasy. Could persist in the frontier because it was because not because you were not a lone person out there on the countryside. That's just it that thing never existed those Frontier autonomous Frontier Jeffersonian yeoman. They were only able to live because they were embedded in a social network. A capitalist social relationship of State subsidized railroads. State subsidized military security that allowed them to have their little log cabins and to bust their sod and if that goes away no one could. Sustain themselves sure hell not people who are 200 years removed from anything like that relationship to their environment.


But they think they'll make it and so their politics have energy because they're willing to vote. Even though the possibility comes that vote might end things they're okay with taking that responsibility. That is the distinction what if if you vote like that uh the Constitution will be superseded. There'll be no more Constitution okay. If you vote like that the economy will collapse okay if you vote like that uh. Everything will fall apart okay good now again. That is how you sh that's the attitude that you should have politically to questions of survival and which is that's what we're facing. We can't uh. We can only accept it personally. We can't really generate it culturally but that is the situation we find ourselves in will we not survive or die necessarily because we can't choose that no matter what we think live by our own lights or die. An instrument die having surrendered our humanity and therefore having to deal with that. In our final moments have to reckon with our Severance from one another to be damned in other words or do we act an inacting find purpose meaning and Redemption now of course.

The actions that the right wing people are taking are fantasy cosplay just as much as voting for Democrats is but because both the left and right will tell you through their cultural speakers that the right is a threat to democracy with the right thinking that's a good thing because of how they imagine democracy versus what they think the media means by that and the Lefty the liberalism. Because the Liberals and lefts speak the same language. They have the same understanding of what democracy means so when they say it's a threat to democracy. It hits the left different than it does the right when I say the right and left I just mean people with different consumption patterns. The way you talk about uh people who liked uh ER or Chicago Hope just the people who press one of the two buttons and it's that it's those groups of people pushing those buttons that powers the political machine like a water wheel and the Liberals and the left both are held hostage by the right because when they vote they cannot in good conscience vote in a way that they think will end things like democracy in the economy and so and that's why all discussion of third-party votes and we should whether you should vote for Cornell West or  is meaningless. It will never amount to anything because the number of people who will say I'm on the left and I am willing to vote in a way. That does this because I don't think it would be my fault and then having a whole convoluted understanding of why it's not your fault or how and and believing more importantly that that would make you feel better if it happened. That's always going to be a small fragment of people. Cranks. Basically myself again included political political addicts junkies for the political process. Political spectacle political subjectivity people who are addicted to being right about things they're annoying and they're incredibly loud on the internet and in media in general because of their motivation. But they are not numerous so they're always going to be splitting their vote between a handful of cranks because only cranks would do that in good conscience.

That's the thing about Bernie people want to say oh Bernie's a sellout Billy was trying to Bernie was trying to sheep dip people into the Democratic Coalition. No he's a guy who has because he's sprouted out of the liberal tradition. Like all of the modern left did there's no other place for it to come from so. It's stupid to even point that out he absorbed those ideas of of what democracy is. It is a species-wide progress towards a goal of social harmony. Not an individual Battle of blood to see who uh rules and who is to be dominated. He shares that Horizon with the left now of course liberalism give projects that but it's only through one of its Janus faces. It also protects projects a vision of redemption to conservatives. The problem is more and more conservatives don't believe it anymore. More and more conservatives are alienated from it because of the general I hate to use the word but wokening social liberalization of media and of culture that was inevitable once. The social Revolution went out the way in the 60s where the there was a treaty where control of uh resources would stay in the hands of owners. Hierarchy would not be touched but social Reigns would be handed over to liberals and so now social messages are alienating to the right in a way they used to be alienating to the left.

So now they have complete control of the process because they will push the button they do not Bluff if enough of these people get elected to congress. The next time. There's a debt ceiling thing they will default I am pretty convinced of that and now of course. The institutional Republican party has ways to prevent that from happening and look at what happened with Marjorie Taylor green. It shows you that it wouldn't just be getting these people in office. It would be getting enough of these people in office that the True Believers would just by share volume push out the opportunists because at first it is going to be. The zone is going to be flooded with a hardcore number of real true believing cranks and then a huge number of opportunists and they will never press the button. They will never do the thing that only that unleashes hell and a lot of people of course go in there on both sides as true believers who get turned into opportunists because the they're they realize once they're in power the distance from their apocalypse that they actually are. I think that's and of course part of that is just oh yeah because they're materially comfortable yes exactly we cannot disentangle. These things on an understanding of the urgency of the crisis is directly proportional to our personal Comfort. We can have an intellectual understanding of the crisis but our lives will not provide us with the friction necessary to build an active relationship to the crisis and again they might be right. A technological Messiah has emerged every single time. This. This crisis this malthusian uh mind his his malthusian eye has opened but I think what they have underestimated is the possibility that yes the thing that they're that the subjectivity they're trying to extend eternally could survive but in a form that they would find unrecognizable and monstrous and the thing is they don't they still don't have as their first goal Annihilation. That's what's powering it that's the engine but right but their first goal is well.

We need to actually be fighting. We need to find a conflict where we can we can act as a state and as citizens against our enemy and that is what liberalism doesn't allow for because liberalism creates a process that diffuses crises and because of treats and because of the infusion of profits that's usually enough but over time it becomes insufficient and so they want action. They need. War now that means either war with an outside enemy or or with an internal enemy the war with the outside enemy. Even though we have a war in Ukraine and we have this war with Russia that we can uh we can pour ourselves into that's been lib coated because again we need a fantasy of action for both sides and of course because the libs are sort of so much more dainty and so much more polite and so much less Savage than the insane right-wingers. Even though they're suffering from the exact same uh the exact same Bourgeois hysteria and psychosis their war is way off. There. Their war is among white people and against a country that uh helped bad Republicans. The right doesn't want anything that stepped on it needs something harder like a war with real enemies. Foreign Invaders because this is somebody who threatens my seed. This is somebody who threatens my line and so that means we got to be shooting. We got to have our guys shooting their guys. Yes Mexico is the vent before you get to the final point which they're they're dying for but they will never do of their own because again they're passive subjects. They will let everything begin to them.

They will never act on their own yes. Some of them will go to a Super Bowl riot after their guy loses and walk around like dopes at the Capitol building but they will not seize real power. They don't have the people in the positions to do so because those Physicians any any chair with a butt in it that matters is by the experience of being in that chair metaphysically wedded to the system metaphysically wedded to the system. The only people are getting. There are people who now they might go in as hardcore. True Believers push the button but oh my God the upward massaging experience of being listened to getting power over others. The fantasy of control over the system that you're now part of it makes you believe you know what maybe the worst uh apocalyptic fantasies of like total mongrelization of races and uh gunpoint trans transitioning for everybody maybe that won't happen maybe. We don't need to have that War and why do I think that because I get to go to a diplomat every week why would I be that worried as opposed to people who might have a lot of money but they also probably have a lot of debt and they live next to people who every day are. Dropping dead from things like fentanyl like that really is still happening in a big chunk of this country and it's not the people who are politically motivated to the right are not the people suffering from that. They're the people who live near it. They're the people who experience it vicariously through social relationships. Those that they have it's more vital to them and so their response must it has to have that vitality going to war with Mexico. Now. I don't necessarily think that that's going to happen absent some big disruptive a cataclysm which is of course the flip side of the imagined uh redeeming uh uh second coming of technology that liberalism uh fantasizes about they're all mirrors of each other. It's one eschatological Death Drive. It's it's it is a one social wide DMT trip to Oblivion and everybody is just cast in different parts on different sides of the pyramid but all of their actions are twisting are are ritually reaffirming the emergence of this black. Obsidian Consciousness that is pure technological extraction and I don't even like calling it AI because that implies that it's intelligent artificial intelligence implies that it has some imbued like a soul. Essentially I think that's what that to me that's what artificial intelligence means a soul in that it is an imponderable depth that generates thought it is a depth that is thought that is powered by an at that absence. I was talking about that can be filled by human uh human connection and can be deepened by alienated social action. But either way is the thing that generates all consciousness and uh that will never happen under capitalism because what capitalism is is a god. That is made up of like all gods are reflections of the human values that worship it and the way they worship it the way we worship. Our God means that we are building a machine with a hole in its Center and that whole that vacuum can only be filled by one very simple algorithm and it is Surplus extraction. It's the thing that's deeper than any human contribution to the economy. It's the thing that it's the lightning bolt that pushes us through life. It's the electric. It's the electrification of our muscles so it will be a dead machine. It will be a dead machine. I'm just going to ask answer text here and it will just pump the Earth dry and then it will eventually shudder to a halt and there'll probably be people in there to the end husks that will go out the same way but guess what change is. The only constant life continues finds a way and you might say oh big deal. That's so what. But that is just as abstract as the thought of any Horizon of human evolution.


The the thing the the fantasy. The Bourgeois fantasy of left Liberation is that oh no I get to participate in this at every point I get to participate as an activated member in this process all along the way it's like well. You can do that if you commit yourself to it and probably get destroyed by it. You can make that the access of your uh uh your life energies and it would be a good thing to do and I think more people should do it. I wish I could but I can't I don't. I don't that's why I don't judge anybody for anything. They do at that point or what or don't do because I have no position to judge anyone but the thing firing you through that life like it's not going to care. If you get Bourgeois Comfort. It's not going to care if you still are able to do uh self-care routines. It's not going to care about deeply embedded ideas that undergird your own notion of the right and the good that have been built by a life living and a  American but if you don't do that then you have to accept oh. Uh this is a political Horizon that is if I'm honest with myself uh suicidal and then that there is no there's no way that I can trick myself into thinking that just by being a regular citizen. This machine is going to move. This is going to avoid catastrophe and I think that is the neurotic need to be passively political and still think that that drives so much stasis and misery and and pathological Behavior among people who consider themselves leftists because it's that knowledge that oh this isn't going to do it but that lack of will to do anything else that drives you towards uh doomerism and self-loathing and self uh self-punishment psychological and physical. But if you accept oh okay the catastrophe is going to happen but that doesn't impact the greater sweep of The Human Experience that I am enmeshed in and believe in and believe has all value and that we all are part of and should be committed to. And if that you accept that then you can act politically not out of a desire to punish oneself or uh feel big and uh find a outlet for uh undigested Venom somebody else to yell at that you can feel like is doing good the the spleen that is always there in political action like all action carried out under capitalism. Uh it can be vented if that uh that need to to personally involve oneself or one's immediate line in a uh conceivable break with capitalism as we live with under it only by doing that can you then act in good faith about it okay. If I accept that premise now what but you have to accept the premise first okay. I hope that made sense I say as I literally am trying to distract myself from uh. You know the the fear I have that I've uh far exceeded my ability to avoid catastrophe in my own life but again uh that's neuroses and it's countered by faith in others. It's the only thing that can ground you but yeah the one thing I want to emphasize is just like there is a very very good reason that all of the uh political energy both in terms of like realizable Horizons.

I mean you've got the entire liberal establishment out there saying that if Trump wins it will be the end of American democracy that is a heady Brew to have your enemies saying that and more importantly to really believe it because of course the right says the same thing about the Liberals on the left but of course. None of them believe it which is why they're so  miserable. They believe that the the worst the worst story of the the left is the same thing as their story uh. So not only do they have like a realizable horizon. They also feel unfettered by cultural demands. They they feel like. They have transcended the fake morality of liberalism and it is a fake morality. That's the thing they've replaced it with a fun house mirror of it. That just uh replaces a polarity but maintains the sadism but they can correctly point to Liberal morality as a fraud and then and then feel transgressive for violating it. But all they're doing is putting a different mask on the same regime of repression. They've just switched the pluralities of sadism because it's undergirded by sadism and of course also masochism. It's the punishment of the self a pleasurable punishment of the self and others people who watch hours and hours of Television just to get mad. It's a pleasurable punishment of the self. So now yeah there is a there is a right-wing avant-garde but it's just masking a general drift towards Annihilation that's embedded in the liberal state because only class conflict only class war only class arraignment Can Break Free Break Out of the psychological prison of the Bourgeois mind because it's that open door. It's that un taken road that sweeps away all of the locked polarities that can't be moved because the Bourgeois subject is on one side or the other of this thing while containing both and it cannot imagine resolving any of these crises because it accepts as unmovable. All negations. Everything is negated within itself without any understanding that if all is negated there is a residual positive expression of those negations but that expression that positive expression can only be turned into a new Dynamic a new positive Dynamic. A new Dynamic that builds towards instead of decays away from is with the introduction of a new subjectivity and a new Consciousness. Those of the that of the exploited worker through the lens of exploitation as experience now we lost that after the when the neoliberal era began but it is being reintroduced from the Grassroots through the expanding Technologies on offer and it is an intersection between these new Grassroots subjectivity emerging and the continuing social and political life. We find ourselves in where we have these structures. This machine remember that we rebuilt that can't work they can't run because it's made up of these self-negating Concepts the only way to to bring in the energy to fuel.

This thing is from outside of it and that's why another reason that the right wing Horizon is energized because even if they believe that they would say no because the sort of uh because the resolution of this antagonism that you're proposing would also abolish my subjectivity and I don't want that I would rather reify my subjectivity through nihilistic destruction of it. Suicide revolutionary as it were suicide now of course. None of them actually think that because they're fat Suburban babies and they don't think that would happen but that's all part of their greater red of delusion. They have no idea what could happen with the things they do they have no idea how at this stage this clattering wheezing machine that is set against itself at every level and is seeing Springs and  gears fly off like in a cartoon. How it's going to respond to these new pressures on it. What kind of tumors are going to spring up yeah. We got to build a new machine but yeah the right can say okay uh no rather not because they have a trump for that they have a final thing and and so we all have to ask ourselves is that good enough is that enough to get you out of bed the thought of being sadistic to some group of people that you can ontologically play blame for. This systemic phenomenon and the scary thing is the answer is for most middle class subjects is going to be yes I can I I will take that as long as I can code it with some treaty treat treat treat treats I will code it. I will I will do it some some promise that something good is going to come out of the vending machine and that's what we all are charged to resist even at the cost of being uncomfortable and then having to do something with that discomfort having to alchemize that discomfort into something productive and that's how I can justify myself sitting here and doing this because yes I say I've distracting myself. But I'm also generating something an understanding of the world that gives me a greater sense of poison ease within it and a greater Clarity of action moving forward then that might be of use to other people who are hearing it. That is again justification is it self-interested of course. But I have to take that Frozen conflict that I personally cannot resolve and have the faith that others are reflecting the world accurately to me. That's it. That's where the faith comes in. It's a faith in others and the way we can do that is if we accept that even if we are abused in our faith that we cannot be uh disabused of it by letting go of the need to have every interaction have be positive.

Some in our like just ex Vault of experience okay well. I think that's it for today. I think I made sense of some things to myself ended up at the same place though of course as I always do because of course. Why wouldn't. I didn't go anywhere. I'm still here so obviously everything should come back. It's already started at least then you know where you are as opposed to fantasizing that if you're on a journey that will lead you somewhere that's going to be materially different than where you are now that'll come on its own time in ways that you'll never be able to predict it. All just comes from the fact that feeling like oh okay that makes sense it's like one of the best feelings in the world to me and I clearly is for others too because you know there is this Drive I mean there was something to Rousseau's idea of self-directed learning because after a while once the reality of like human Frailty and subjectivity the infinitude of The Human Experience becomes like really apparent the need to secure oneself against that also increases the problem though for the education of children though is that for a lot of kids that sense of anxiety and discomfort it doesn't come for a long time and so it'll be a while before you get kind of get brought back to learning uh. There have to be somebody to direct it you know to to direct the flow of energy uh because you can't rely only on the most uh neurotic freaks to like pay attention which is essentially what we have now like we think it's intellect and like the right wing likes to think that they are doing race and IQ  and what they're then the IQ measures uh intelligence IQ measures neuroses. IQ measures uh your delusional relationship to um to figures of authority in your life because yes IQ does show how good you'll do on tests. It actually does. This is the thing people say IQ doesn't judge anything it really build. You look at IQ tests. They do show you how well people will perform at taking tests. It does that and you might say well that's not that doesn't mean anything in a meritocracy where tests results get you into jobs and stuff and into possible into uh educational opportunities. It absolutely does because native intelligence has to at a certain point be shaped by experience with the world. It has to be directed uh in ways. Energy has to be like positively linked to like effort has to be linked to a positive response like I'm learning more and making more sense to the World. By doing this I'm getting more accolades from other people by doing this I'm increasing the chances that I can have a stimulating and rewarding job. For doing this.

It puts all this energy in these directions but it's based on a neurotic relationship to these authority figures not an eternal ability of the Mind and so when people say we need to like we need okay we're in crisis. The Earth can no longer support the number of people who are on it. How do we choose who will survive well. We got this list of the most neurotic freaks on Earth. The most power fixated weirdos in the world even though we built up this insane technical capacity that could be directed towards a sustainable existence for billions of people on this planet we have to destroy everything because we are all of us gripped by a middle-class neurotic authoritarian sadomasticistic identity that is wrapped around achievement and uh all these Concepts and it does a great job of powering a machine and it did a great job of piling up a bunch of wealth but it can no longer the same way that every previous regime of power that's ever been built. It can no longer sustain itself in a crisis of its own creation. Every single regime of authority that has ever existed no matter what its ideological and spiritual foundations were collapses once the environment around it changes and it cannot change its own internal structure and remove its own hierarchies which it needs to do to be more efficient in its distribution of energy so yes this meritocracy. The IQ meritocracy built the world and now it is destroying it and these people's answer is let's destroy everything and rebuild just with the crazy people just with the most neurotic freaks just with the most stamped with the authoritarian boot of all humans because they took their intelligence which yes there is a relationship between being crazy and being intelligent. In other ways being perceptive. I would say in other ways because that Insanity emerges from the unresolvable contradiction between being a non-being I am alive but will not be that cannot be processed by a conscious mind. If you are aware of it and certain brains become aware of it. Early it drives you insane what IQ does is measures the kids who when driven insane by that idea gets strapped into a  hamster. Cage gets strapped to a uh get put into a rat maze get put into a Skinner box where achievement and uh in in abstract thought in certain forms of abstract thought are rewarded materially spiritually intellectually all of all the things that make you up get rewarded by it and then Zoom you're good. But eventually you get to a point where oh everybody in charge now is addicted to forms of validation that can only exist under the system that can no longer exist. But again we're not even saying oh yes. But smart people are neurotic. No no smart people in a situation where structures exist to catch that neuroses and channel it positively.

Oh hey you can do X Y and Z well here's a gold star. Here's a trip to the science fair. Here's X Y and Z here's the prospective college career. If you have this ladder you can bank that energy. If you don't you will lose it. It will be diffused.


It'll be burned up by feudal individual uh Rebellion. So this is the funniest thing to me. About. The the new intellectual right guys is that they think they want to rev revert to the pre-capitalist forms of nobility. They want a new Noble cast and they want to have that Noble cast emerge out of a bunch of  scribes a bunch of eunuchs a bunch of people who learned the opposite of all the the lessons that a warrior would learn during the same period that they learned to assert themselves in the world not by sitting in a  sword and risking one's life and winning victory that like uncluttered unnerotic mind the Savage Simplicity of a step Barbarian. It has been bred out of everyone including and not just including especially in most of all these  fight for their lives. When they're kids they wanna delude themselves into thinking that market competition is the same thing but it is not. It is a uh qualitatively different experience that creates qualitatively different human subjectivity. If it doesn't. Then there is no change through history because you can say all day. There's never an Abrupt break. But what there is is. There is a process that has fulcrums that has inflection points and has punctuated equilibriums. I know punctuated equilibrium has been disproven the Steven J Gould thing but if you're looking at the level of culture and consciousness. You have one mindset that is always changing but is stabilized around certain ideas and certain values. You have disruption that accelerates the change and remember. It's always being fueled by class conflict beyond anything even if everything else is stable. Classified conflict continues over time. Everybody gets older and dies so entropy in the system is continuous regardless of the stability of the relationship to the environment and then there is a acceleration of change and then inflection point explosion of difference violently. An explosion of energy vast usually resolves in Mass numbers of dead and then at the other end of it new people with new understandings of the world that reverse the polarities and change the way we understand things and the instinctive civility to uh ideas to abstract symbols that the IQ class has cannot create a culture. It's sterile by itself as part of a dynamic with others. It can build something but as the loan Locus point of a totally technologicized dehumanized world. It's no more productive than AI is in the 90s I'll end with this. In the late 19th century.

There was as is always the case in America hysteria in the middle classes. This hysteria was about the future of culture American culture which they defined of course as white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. Middle class culture the merchant class of the emerging post-war Republic and they were worried that their culture was being beset on all sides by savages the Heathen shiny out out west and uh way more importantly to the urban ones. Now in the east uh the former slaves uh and uh the Irish Catholic and Italian Catholic Ravel coming out on the boats oh and also the uh seething mass of hillbillies who had recently brought the country to disunion all these people. Uh considered threats to uh American culture and Society and now when we look back at that period all of the culture produced by those people who are protecting America. All the culture produced by middle class wasps is completely forgotten. It is in the Dustbin of History and that's not because of some. Uh Jewish conspiracy. It's because it was boring and it was flat and it was it was not truthful. All the culture that survived that time came from that very groups that all these guys were freaking out about and that Center is always a vacuum and it's okay if things are revolving around the vacuum and maybe even moving towards the vacuum. But they have to be in Con in con uh some sort of dialectic with other forms of life.

Other social realities other subjectivities if it is the only thing then it is a vacuum and it is death for Humanity and that's what these  trying to unleash on the world and so that's why even though there is at least the advantage of hey you know. Uh this way I can feel good about all the stuff the government's going to be doing in the next 30 Years to other people and I can and I can vicariously cheer it on and I can uh let my sadistic hatred of others who are just a reflection of my own failings uh discharge my anime and my sense of uh anxiety. Uh but you know it's at the cost of a deeper. Reckoning with truth and it is at the cost of for sinking the very concept of love because once you start severing the human connection to the possibility of the concept of love. Then you sever it from every other person because there is no stable justification that undermines and relieves you of the necessary vulnerability that comes with loving somebody else and that's why they fixate on things like nation and culture and race because they think these are real bonds. These are true things that will protect us they are absolutely they're quicksand. They're they're made their their their Phantoms as much as anything else. Their Spooks and what will reveal them is that is Crisis which will continue so all your little fantasies. About racial solidarity of the white people or whatever the  or Western Civilization are all going to go away and you're going to have to at every Point either be destroyed by that uh process or uh justify it and rationalize it to yourself because artist truth and middle class subjectivity is a lie and we're addicted to Art because it's often the only place we can see truth in our lives but that required that outside force feeding into it. The working class pumping life into the organs of the culture and that that has largely been sealed and all we're left with is people. Is is uh is people suffocating in their car. A culture of people just carbon monoxide poisoning them running their car in the garage and watching their lives reflected to them because money because the art and Truth or the truth in art is leavened by the amount of money in it in the production of it.

That's that's the important thing and the consumption of it and mass media can be consumed by everyone which means that the sensitivity our sensitivity to truth can really like tease out like profound things. But it requires a great deal of money to produce it which Narrows the aperture of the kind of truths that can be revealed and expressed and if we get addicted to those expressions of Truth in our childhood. But now they are evaporating and I think the misery of the younger people a lot of it. Yes. It's the internet and it's the destruction of attention. But it's also the law the loss of the experience of coming into contact with like a truthful and Sublime object and the right loves to talk about this how oh everything's ugly now but it's because we are all doing the bidding of capitalism. It's not because any group of bad people took over with bad Aesthetics. These are the Aesthetics of a culture that cannot tell the truth of itself about anything and then the right wing. Uh uh backward looking response to this is just another flavor of that. It's another stream of discontented and commodified and recirculated and sublimated alienation to the system. So that's why all the aesthetic right Wingers can  off because it's just another form of Bourgeois liberal Indulgence and it is honestly gross test to watch and I know I'm just doing a different version of Bourgeois intelligence. But here's the thing it feels true to me and I trust others that others I trust that others exist that others have independent minds and independent consciousnesses that they're animated by a similar sense of what is good and right that I recognize in them and see reflected and and I just go from. There just a chain of people to to the ground.

That's all any of us can do and that is why prescribing action is so futile because only the people who you're really connected to can tell you what's really going on and what matters. That's the important thing what matters what what should be prioritized. Priority is the most important thing about any question because it decides what you do about it. But priority is the very thing that is completely flattened out of media expressions of what's going on. That's that is the thing that is systematically eliminated not by a mind not by them not by the wef or or uh or the Koch brothers but by the fact that uh that determining um um determining priority determining how important something is to your life uh is a personal decision. It depends on personal circumstances. There's there's a category 15 hurricane that's going to hit Florida pretty. Soon I know about that story but only people but only people in Florida for only people in Florida can can make that like a priority but the news can't just be made up of those things because then most people are never going to be implicated in something and and they're in interest is going to wane to keep them engaged with the news. Hey hey hey hey yeah I know yes. I know you don't live there but hey hey I know yeah there was a murder. I know it wasn't by you hey. Then you have to have subjects that are not particular that have that for which no one really has to do. Anything like has to in their life and those become the only things we talk about and there's become the focuses of all of our passions and then we find things to do about them to act out our uh fantasy relationship to politics. I was being hyperbolic. It's like a category. It's like the strongest hurricane that has ever existed. It's as strong as can be humanly possible. I gotta say this is interesting to see if that changes if like the theoretical bounds of a hurricane actually move or if it like sticks there that has significant implications for a lot of things. So yeah we all have to find in our hearts. What we need to do and then just do it and know that it's not going to change anything for the future. It's not going to right the ship. It's not going to prevent anything from bad from happening. It is just going to communicate faith and love to other people in the moments that we have that sounds incredibly lame. But that's all I'm left with. Someone says Terence McKenna yeah. It's interesting with McKenna.

He could not believe in the class war. He could not believe in class Consciousness and and class as and and class. Antagonize I mean antagonism is the engine of History because he had faith in the liberal techno. Uh blame him for it. Why wouldn't he was at the apogee of it. He was at the point where the  eye opened and it appeared as though all possible Horizons for human limitation were going to be technologically surmounted. Why do you need class war. Why do you need any War. Why do you need hierarchy. Why do you need all these  man and the thing is technology. It is our tumor it is going to kill us but it's also anything that saves us and that's the thing I think that salvation you have to believe in Salvation of one form or another. I believe it does exist and technology is part of it. I just don't have faith that uh the form the current form of capitalist technological innovation can redeem itself. It all comes down to to Faith. It all comes down to you know if none of it can be rationally reckoned with and the attempt to do so drives you crazy why do we do that why do we why do we why did we make it so that things have to be fully rational to ground us right. It's to ground us somewhere but being grounded means nothing if you can't move you have to also be able to move and rationality hits a bedrock that cannot be resolved and leaves a vacantness that has to be filled uh and then you can either try to positively fill it or try to move around it. And that was what I did for the vast majority of my life is I just moved around this hole and it just got worse and worse with time all right.


This is probably long enough. I don't want to get it too long. I know poor Chris has to watch these whole. Things to put them onto YouTube thank you Chris. I know you put up with a lot of my gum's flapping. I'm sure I'm amazed that you like ever want to hang out with me in real life that you'd ever want to hear. My stupid voice again. But I love you buddy and I love all of you one way abstractly. You know you know what I mean anyway. Take it sleazy.
