There I am next week gonna find you. I'm gonna get you get one way or another. Hey folks. The dogs are barking are barking for us. They're calling for me. It's the hound of the hound of the bed steivilles. How's that sound good the hound of the bed stifles. Paul come on you that was pretty good. That was some good stuff yeah perfect timing this dog. Just started as soon as I did. I think he is honestly responding to my voice. Maybe he's telling me to pipe down maybe. He's telling me to shut my trap and if he is he's probably right too yeah. I'm just feeling a little shaky not feeling as centered as. I have recently trying to I'll find my way back. I'm not too worried about it just being in front thought. I would do a nice chill stream. This time a real one answer some questions just maybe have a back and forth. This would have been a good day to go to the office maybe but man. I don't know. I think we might be shutting back down again. Here very shortly. I wouldn't be surprised if within a week. There's another some attempt at a lockdown. It's a bummer man. It's a real bummer low audio. Ah hell got the thing turned up as much as I can. I put up the volume. I could speak. Louder also muffled oh god damn it ah okay. So how's that sound that doesn't sound good. I can get the microphone because I have the mic so. How's this better okay always off to a good start with audio issues. My favorite thing. I love being on the ones and twos while trying to figure out what the hell I'm talking about.

It's my favorite thing in the world. I love having in a bit yeah. No. It's my own fault though you know I would if I really cared. I would do a better job so. I'm sorry that I haven't done better. Honestly it still sounds muffled. I'm sorry. You know what you guys got to hold me accountable. I agree you guys have to hold me accountable. I need to be held accountable. I think that I need to understand that I need to do better and that if I don't then I need to be held accountable. I understand this I could use a gamer chair not going to lie oh. I mean no. I absolutely could not use a gamer chair. It would be a send have a gamer chair but I certainly imagine rocking back and forth in custom contoured comfort but yeah no that would be the devil that would be the devil getting me that like the devil would give me a gamer chair and have me survey you know survey the online and go here. This could be yours. No no back satan get thee behind me get the behind me satan some things covering the mic. Oh boy. Ah muffled mike ah christ ah all right. I might have to go get the the microphone which is apparently It doesn't record as high for the youtube. So that's why I try to use this chord but the chord doesn't seem to be working. This has got to be the single worst content you can find on the internet is me trying to fix. This like a goddamn boomer like trying to get talked through tech support by someone's by my board.

Nephew it really does tell you like how tightly people are wound by whether they say. It's good or not because obviously something is wrong and obviously. It's not so bad that it's unlistenable. It comes down to how much it bothers you so if you say it's fine. It means you're not noticing it. If you say it isn't fine then. It means that you're noticing it so some balance between you know wanting to hear my words and not wanting to hear them in a way that like challenges you to hear it or something. I don't know or challenges like some aesthetic assumption about how you think it should sound and that really just seems like an issue that you just. It's like I'm sorry and tonight today. I guess I'm not worth listening to rather than being annoyed by it and yeah. It probably also depends on how good your computer is and how good your headphones are and all that but I can't control those things yes. It's fine that it's not fine. I have to remember my rhyme. I have to remind myself that the universe will unfold as it should all right you know what i. I'm gonna still oh. I want to get the I got the microphone just to see if it works all right. I don't know if. I'm going to be able to get over this. We'll see. This is a challenge for me now to like to like accept the things. I cannot change because realistically.

I'm not going to be able to do anything about it yes maybe. I should be uncomfortable tonight maybe maybe. I have to have a thorn in my saddle for some reason. Maybe. I need to be agitated. I don't know right. Now it just feels agitated. It doesn't really feel productive but that's why we play the games. That's why we play the games folks oh. Now they're mad at me for not getting the mic. I just. I didn't want to step away from it. It seems like it's kind of bad. You know bad form all right. You know what. I'm doing. I'm doing it hmm so all right young greats let me. Try. This god damn it who signed up for grandpa simpson's computer repair. Oh god tell me that sounds better for the love of cry. Many tell me that sounds better oh thank god all right fine. I guess. I can't use the chord anymore apologies for the youtube people. Hopefully. It'll be loud enough. I'm trying. I swear to god. I'm trying. I'll ask chris maybe to take a look at it. I want the people to be able to access the content. I understand that the content must flow above all that it is our very enema that it is our spice melange. I understand that and I will never not facilitate the flow. I will never allow the flow to be in any way critically interrupted. I did not see alex jones speech. I'm assuming he said some about overthrowing the government or whatever not worried about it yeah baby. I've entered the rant zone ah entering the rat zone squiddly squiddily.

Lennon was a great orator. Trotsky was the best though trotsky was the greatest orator of the old of the bols. Heviks he got him spellbound. He first did it in 1905 when he was a kid got brought in and ended up heading the petrograd soviet purely on his oracle or or or radical skills. However you want to whatever oratorical that's it god oratorical skills and then he was the most spellbinding speaker at the that what the it called and he got everybody and he ended up drawing the blueprint really for the whole damn thing tactically and strategically really is more. It was more his idea than it was lenin's I think but lenin was the one who you know directed it and the one who gave it the actual like operating system couldn't have had one without the other. The lennon was pretty. He was on the stump he was pretty big him showing back up him showing back up in in at the at the finland station was was a historical thunderbolt because the bolsheviks until that point really were terrified of the prospect of taking power because they kind of knew. They didn't have the the authority to do that in that like yeah. They they they represented a like absolute huge majority of you know bullsh of saint petersburg workers. But what did that mean in the whole you know the terms of the entire russian empire. It was a terrifying prospect and they kind of wanted to lean back that was their instinct anyway and lennon was the one who stepped into the breach and said no no. This is not a stable equilibrium. This will collapse one way or the other and we have to choose which way it's going to go by which which which direction we push our shoulders to because and I think that was true. I really do think like. I don't think there's any world where the the provisional government survives into some sort of bourgeois democracy. It would have collapsed most likely taken over some sort of military coup and given those options you cannot blame anybody in fact. I think you'd have to say that the only moral action is to try to seek power in that context that abdicating power is abdicating responsibility and in fact making yourself responsible for horrors to come that you could have stopped. But you know it creates new situations that you can't anticipate. Federalism should have been ended in 1865. The federalist system was tried and found wanting or rather it was destroyed by by might. I mean it was it was extinguished as a as a real basis for sovereignty because when it when it when when they break into pieces the greater half will absorb the other half. We know that now so there is no real source of power there other than to just create a temporary disequilibrium and waste resources and waste time and more than anything gum up the progress of you know creating a a a a political structure that can actually like respond to conditions and that probably would have you know it's hard to say we ever would have gotten rid of it but should means nothing. We kept it because it was useful and it has always been useful. But I think it should it'll have to go. It'll have to go can't imagine it not going any any realistic even medium term. play for power in america would not be constitutional. I think and or rather could be constitutionally pursued but in power would negate the constitution as as part of their mandate.

White claw lime is the worst flavor it's the only one I had left though. Sadly. These are the these are the struggles of those of us in the coveted plague years stuck with the worst of the of the of the hard seltzers. Lime is a great flavor in many contexts but for some reason in the alcoholic seltzer business and honestly even the non-alcoholic seltzer business. It seems to be an inferior flavor to many others. All berries are better than lime.

I would say somebody said that if trotsky were alive now he would be on sub stack that is 100 correct because if you think about it when you look at the origin of you know. Like the modern the modern like policy intelligentsia. The modern like political wonk class you know the people who write for the public intellectuals. People who write for you know name brand institutional think organizations not necessarily famous people but people who are known within among people who are inside you know the bubble the people like the people who take them seriously. They'll they are. They were largely trotskyites. They were largely people who came out of the 30s split as trotskyites and then in the post-60s disillusionment era turned into neoconservatives. They set the mold like every Every op-ed columnist is a trotskyite heart and so everybody who ends up eventually quitting their org because they you know want to be oppressed to justify why they're not being listened to more or why they're not more popular than finds themselves with only the market to blame as they put their wares onto the street.

I'm back on. I'm back on the content must flow like I said nothing will stop it. Neither sleep nor snow nor dark of night shall keep me from my appointed content rounds. I shall always be here. I shall always be here mining the content taking the content from the mines panning it molding it flattening it stacking it into bricks transporting it across mountain passes exchanging it for various eastern silks and spices and sumptuaries. I lost a bunch of viewers there that was bad that was bad work sorry. I had a. I had a thing hopefully they'll come back but if they don't that's fine.

This already feels kind of like a cursed chat with all that damn audio problems early on. I've actually thought somebody's asked about the 30 years war. I've actually thought about doing a project like a podcast project because it's 30 years more because it's wildly interesting and I don't really think that there is a very you know. There's a single sort of agreed upon coverage of it like patrick. Wyman was going to get to the 30 years war but he basically he did so much early modern that he kind of got sick of it which I understand you know you get sick of the habsburgs after a while you're just describing how their jaws just got farther and farther and farther out in the mouths. But it's got a lot of early very interesting stuff.

The way that you know religion operated in that early reformation period and the spread of early spread of media how that contributed to the whole thing which is pretty interesting definitely like to talk a little bit more about the swedes. The swedes are fascinating to me that they were a continent bestriding military colossus there for a bit under old gustavus adolphus. Then you've got things like the emergence of modern realpolitique when cardinal. Riesler had the french bourbon throne support the protestant league against catholic habsburg because they were the greater secular threat to bourbon rule. That's was the ultimate don't play the hate. The player hate. The game move sorry guys you're not going to get away with me that easily. I'm back. This is yes on the third stream he rose again so this will be the last one. I think one way or the other when this one stops. I will be done thy will be done on earth as it is on twitter am. I right folks.

Somebody asked if one of the reasons that the united states did not become socialist is because it was too secular. I think there's actually something to that because if you take secular to mean that you have replaced that so the degree that a society is secular is the degree that you've replaced like spiritual non-marketized emotional connections between people with market relationships like in some places where capitalism is being imposed upon a well-structured social network or if it emerges like in it emerges out of class struggle like in europe. You get this effusion of from the root a a in a spiritualized sense of the social obligation that can then interact with capitalism whereas in america because we came in as as scattered shredded you know refuse of europe the having been stripped of our social bonds completely having new religious orders that resacralized you know our relationship to the land and our relationship to each other by essentially removing the social dimension altogether from life and replacing it with pure transactions. And that's what we have tried to build a social conception on top of while we've been rapidly capitalizing and it's tough it's very difficult. It's like you're trying to build a. It's like you're trying to build a airplane while it's in the air. I'm not saying that those pre-capitalist modes were socialist. They weren't. They had to evolve into capitalism they. But they couldn't skip directly to socialism because they were peasant social relationships which are not the social relationships of a of a like socialized subject who has gone through the process of like the contradictions within capitalism working themselves out.

Someone keeps asking why was john brown insane which was a weird way of putting it instead of just saying was he and I guess. It's a good way to put it because he was if you accept the definition of insanity to be demanding like to the point of violence to insist on the world being a way that no one else recognizes it to be without like taking the hint of his social relationships. To understand that what he thinks is real is not you know what he thinks is his connection to all humanity and his moral obligation to it is not real and if that's the case and you know in the in the modern secularized way. That is the only thing that insanity can be like. There is no underlying truth or falseness that's not that doesn't come in it that doesn't end right so he was insane in that sense. But he was also right and that tells you that there is a more complicated relationship between sanity and conceptions of sanity and the social order than it is presented to be. I'm not really liking the good lord bird at all. Somebody said it was hamilton with what they say like hamilton but violent and that seems to be basically it. That's I mean. I still haven't seen hamilton. But it feels like that's correct hamilton with violence and that that's not very interesting to me. I'm not mad at it anymore.

But it's just like it's not even interesting. It's not even like doing enough to get a rise anymore. Similarly asking if the mujahideen or gladio unit. There is a a thing that's like not officially part of the gladiator operation. But it's sort of a conjecturized operation called gladio b that basically says that the invasion of not even the invasion of afghanistan the buildup to the rising of tensions within afghanistan that led to the invasion was an operation that was essentially along the same lines where the like afghan versions of the you know lump and mafia figures that they used in europe. were similarly plied with drugs and money and given guns and let loose on a communist opponent and they're. It's their parallels are striking. I mean we were we had money and guns into the the resistance in afghanistan. Before there even was a soviet invasion.

When it was just the communist government. We were explicitly trying to give them their own vietnam and we were it worked. I mean like like zbigniew. Brzezinski was very proud of it and he famously said you know. I don't think you can compare the liberation of all of eastern europe to some riled up jihadis in the middle east because for him that was like what they got to do. They got to pay him back for vietnam and then also they fell. They then collapsed shortly after that really vindicated them and they felt like that's what matters you know a few 911s or whatever and you know regimes and like fundamentalism taking over and more and more places and ratcheting up violence that's all good for them. That's not blowback. Even that's that's interest that's compound interest on an investment yeah. So south. Africa was a country that as a country was just a one giant gladio operation they weren't even like the the deep state. It was just the state because like boss was if p2 like boss was if he too was a a official state security branch foreign hey what's going to happen with the damn brexit what's going on are they really just going to crash out. I thought this thing had already been like done three times already.

I really don't understand. I don't really care which is nice because if I did it'd be very frustrating. I'm just kind of curious what is the deal. What's the tumuppence. What's the what's the bobs. What's the what's what's give me your butchers.

How do they keep having to keep this deal. How many times have they like how many times have. They said they had a deal and then what happened why did it not go forward. This is insane to me so when does it happen is there actually a day. Is there actually a day where this happens as opposed to what has happened. It's like the election it's just drawn out forever. It's been brexit for five years. It's a drawn out. It's like an orgasm. It just can't it's a ruined orgasm. It's like our system. It feels like brexit can't ever come. It's like zeno's paradox so you're really guys telling me. These guys are swearing like hard brexit. They put up the border back in northern ireland.

The troubles kick back off that all happens on january 31st no fooling or is it going to be like five to 500 other deadlines. I heard about that pass with nothing changing so tell me what's it gonna be. What's it gonna be cursed. Island who cares is the correct answer cursed island who cares who care putting it on the neverline list. Especially since nobody can give me a straight answer about whether anything's ever going to happen over there that's going to be interesting enough to pay attention to because for now. It's all been snoozeville. Although if covered twice that will be very funny hello. I'm kia starmer in there. I'm keep leading the star mate. I'm bleeding kei starmer hello. I'm sir keith starmer. I'm a knight. I'm a knight at the bleeding round table and I hello. I'm keith starmer. The naught of the bleeding richard spencer haircut hello topansa bend oh cheerio. What's this. I mean what how did that happen. I don't care never mind chief keith starmer.

Yes. It's a load of bullocks is what it is. It is a pedo island. We all know that it's ruled by pretty explicit pedophiles. Jimmy savile we all remember that lord mountbatten whose assassination was just commemorated on the crown famously long-time pedophile who apparently treated northern irish orphanages as his personal borders. A disgusting depraved sick piece of partition to basically ensure it became a monstrous bloodbath swine and then of course. There's all the revelations about thatcher's cabinet and inner circle and then prince andrew and epstein. It's everywhere so anyway I i wish good luck to the good people. The ones that exist which is basically jeremy corbyn in the uk. But everyone's gonna have to tend to the road. Garden now man let's see what we can come up with let's dig dirt. Let's get in the dirt. Let's get some worms let's roll.

Around in the worms favorite irish historical figure that's an interesting question who do I like who do. I like I like um wolf tone is like hardcore like tried to gouge his own throat out daniel collins or daniel mcconnell. I love the monster monster mash monster allies but yeah james connolly obviously for the jim. Larkin also richard casement was a g not a big fan of eamonn devalera. I think he's a creep and and patrick pierce was kind of a fine of a looney tune honestly not in like an endearing I don't know if that's really in a john brown way. It's. I don't know creepy and of course the greatest irishman of all time michael rappaport. The greatest irishman ever lived Chris wade is definitely on the go on the irish good books. He's a fine irish lad nick mullen of course also one of the few good ones. I think we'll. I think will is actually scotch irish and they did not count. I'm sorry scotch. Irish don't count off but I would say that like. I don't think that's even true in ireland like I don't think there needs to be some program against protestants. It's so pointless it's stupid.

It's a remnant but I do think that in america demographically they're a distinct group like their culture was distinct and they settled in distinct areas like our you know our potato eating patties. Our good catholic boys and girls settled in america's like east coast cities and you know settled into roles is like is the is essentially like the the the early like state bureaucracy of the emerging market. Economies of the american cities you know the very first bureaucratic the bare bones of the bureaucratic state which is its police and its politicians and so they got this patronage relationship within the capitalist system to facilitate you know the exploitation of the greater number of these you know lumping former peasants. Now the scotch irish they settled entirely different pattern. They settled it. They went out into the woods to make their fortune or more likely in misfortune scrub scraggling life out of the the rocks of the appalachian mountains creating a completely different social structure with a different religious with an entirely different like religious and spiritual like world view that shaped their relationship to each other and the project called america. Those are amber's ancestors.

Yes yes somebody asked if spiritualism was an upper class theology and yes it absolutely was. I mean these people. These were the heirs of you know the church of england in the united states in the united states and they because of their exposure to the most refined elements of you. Know. Enlightened urban existence had over time lost their ability to invest traditional religious concepts with meaning and had to invent them out of the whole cloth of like post-modern like or modern like positivist empirical rationality and science and what emerged out of that was a way to reverse engineer spirituality again in the form of of spiritualism and ectoplasm and people pulling. Gauze out of their mouths ugh oh that's an interesting question.

I've thought about some I love counter factuals. Somebody asked what if nixon had won in 1960 instead of kennedy and that is a contingency that was skin of the teeth and it did involve theft like that was not made up and with any of those cases it hangs in the balance you want to talk about a contingent consequential event and I thought about that and one thing I wonder is so the bay of pigs happened the way it did because kennedy got in there with the plan already existing in Goddamn hold on one second what there's doings transpiring so he inherited. Jfk inherited the bay of pigs plan from the eisenhower administration and he never got the full brief and the top planners like bissell and weisman. Weisner knew the thing wouldn't work without air support but they were afraid of asking of telling kennedy that because they're afraid then he would say well. I'm not going to do it.

Then they were going to hope that in the moment he would he would not recognize sunk costs when he saw it and he would decide to overcommit that was what they were banking on and he said no now not only was the bay of pigs planned under the eisenhower administration. It was under the aegis of the vice president's office. Nixon was eisenhower's point man four in the executive branch for the bay pig's invasion so if he got in there presumably he would have been more committed to it as policy whereas kennedy never saw it as his baby was basically willing to let them try it thinking hey. This is a low low cost low commitment thing. If it doesn't work we can walk away from it and then finding oh no you can't do that because these guys over committed you nixon might very well have put the bombers in and maybe the The foothold is positioned. Now. I'm not saying they would have won. But you could very easily see a situation where a somewhat successful bay pigs incursion leads to nixon committing american troops to support it and instead of having you know.

America's cold war experience grow hot in southeast asia. In the mid-60s. It happens in cuba in the early 60s. don't know if that's true. I just. I always thought that was an interesting what if and basically you know the result of that would be that the 60s social fermented conflict would sort of have sparked early and become more intense and coupled with the fact that you would not have seen the so. I don't think you would have seen the sort of civil rights advancement under nixon just because I think that the southern strategy would have revealed itself its logic within the greater context of this heightened cold war standoff you know like the lines would have been more firmly established between the democrats and republicans on this question and as such the the the coalitions. The political coalitions would be clear but who knows. I have no idea. We didn't get that world.

I'm sorry that took a while there's people people are looking at my place. That's why I've been off and on it's. I thought I i misjudged the time so I've been kind of riding the lightning. Here. I'm not moving. Yet. It's all in the air. We'll see we'll see but I might. I might be on the move we'll see yes. We're gonna miss the yard yes. I'm going to move to the bunker. I'm going to be moving to a secure facility. Now. I have no idea wherever the wind takes me. Pittsburgh is a great town. I have to say the paris of appalachia. I do ever enjoy it. I would go there. I'd get like a disused firehouse and turn it into a podcasting station again. I'm getting on. I've been off the beam on meditation and I think that's contributed to my weird feelings. I got to get back into it tomorrow. I will get back on the beam. I think I'm glad someone watched the ninth configuration. I'm glad. It's a good movie more people you should watch it. I gotta actually get into a practice of it like. I think I need a group context but man not happening now.

I mean it's getting bad there's gonna be no public anything. Soon you're getting to a point where like a tipping point where if it's not a full lockdown where you're not like cutting off almost all contact with other people. You're basically gonna get it. It'd be funny. If we we reached hurt immunity the moment the the vaccine shows up that'd be perfect. We could just all like just have a virus fight with them have a fun little virus fight with the vaccines boned. I am not blackpilled why do people keep saying I am black belt black pill. The only black pill in my opinion is if you ex if you take the conclusion that you know. The spectacle is self-contained and unbreakable that participating in it is the surrendering of your soul to a sterile phantom tango that just drains your life essence and leaves you incapable of fulfilling your human destiny as a self-directed agent of your own interests and the interests of those you love and you go yeah. That's all there is since this is that what the since that what this is well then. I'm just gonna spend all my time here thinking. I'm the damn joker instead of thinking oh. I can disengage from this. Nothing is actually making me be here and maybe the things that seem hopeless when I'm stuck my head into this hornet's nest are not if not fixable something I can do about it. There's actually something.

I could beings and that cannot be black pill that is hope pill that's love pill red blood pill. The real red pill. The blood of the red of the communist flag is blood got hot blood run under my veins and if you have hot blood then this will never be enough for you so the black pill is saying yes. I will steady myself spiritually. I will try to just continue to seek ever ever intensifying and a need to ever be intensifying emotional engagement from this disgusting pantomime. This this performance this spectacle. This this engagement is as a social ritual. That's that's black man that's saying yeah. I've given up hope and like that is blackville and I say you can only do that if you have forsaken the world outside of the hornet's nest well the apocalypse has already happened. Someone says I think that in a real sense like being human is coming to terms with mortality individually but then also socially and civilizationally and existentially and you know even though we don't know how the human race will end. It will you know and every formation that humans take is going to at some point end including all the ones that we think of as eternal and part of living is accepting like the realities of the trajectory of of life and instead of fighting them coming to terms in a way that allows you to live within them.

Like a good example of that. For me is we live in a situation where our politics are dead and frozen in this cult sterile culture war because the underlying presumption of politics which we have all been operating on since the cold war about what the government does about what we can we. What our relationship with government is in terms of its you know is gone it is. It doesn't actually pertain like the government is not going to provide us with the justice that we assume it will and so our participating in the system is is sterile and so oh man oh sam yep. That's sterile well. I forgot to say god damn it oh well My brain just died my brain just skidded out just exploded yeah. Civilizations are cyclical until they like power up basically like the cycles continue but things change as the cycles move. The accumulation of those changes eventually create a phase shift and a new thing now.

I remember what I was going to say if we accepted that the new deal consensus is dead that the idea that the government can just distribute us all the profits from this huge capitalist system that is bestriding the world and which no longer persists that way and that we are just like eating. Our civilizational like heart out in order to provide profits for a system that cannot provide what we think it can what even like the social democratic dreams of bernie cannot be if they allow capitalism to remain intact if we accepted those terms that reality that point of no return. Then we could address the moment with clarity and move from those those those priors and I think those priors lead towards an engagement with capitalism like an actual engagement with capitalism and profit. Like a socialization of these. These like marketized lives that we've lived and that would only be possible if we accepted the death of that stage of american like civic understanding and political economy. Like it's like it was 19. You know it. It started with a great like start. You want to start it with with the inauguration of fdr from 33 to 79 and that was it and now we have to do something else but it accepts limitations.

It accepts that some things are not not the same that they've ever been and they can't be that way again and we have to start start building from something new and that the only place that we can find what we're looking for here is not by growing the pie. It's by reclaiming control of how we distribute this thing because my god we have the resources but they are a portion the way they are so that situations for commerce can be conducted within them. The thing that's supposed to signal us where everything should go the price signal conducted by the market. We need it there but we don't need it there amazon. I think has proven pretty conclusively that we don't. We have private enterprises that are the size of small governments and sometimes mid-size governments that operate with no price signal and are able to distribute some sort of you know resource. We can do that but it means cutting out the entire class of people who stand within these in this smaller smaller group of people who live to just stand within these transactions and just passively accumulate power and well as the rest of us by necessity because there's less and less to give around fight over less and less. So that's what I mean when I say you know sometimes coming to terms with things does it lead you to black pill.

It leads you to real effective action because you can see more clearly you can see clearly now the rain is gone. You can see all obstacles in your way or at least more than you could. They're coming for me. They're coming for me come friendly bombs and reign on slaugh it isn't fit for humans. Now. I'm going to read that I'm going to sign off here but first I'm going to read come friendly bombs by john benjamin famously read by ricky gervais on on the office try to find this thing patience. It's not coming the. I can't find the goddamn thing. I'm googling this wrong oh. It's called slaugh oh that's embarrassing. That's like when that's like when people think that that that weaker then song one great city is actually called I hate winnipeg because that's the that's the chorus very embarrassing. It's called slow come friendly bombs and fall on slaugh.

It isn't fit for humans. Now there isn't grass to graze a cow swarm over death come bombs and blow to smithereens. Those air-conditioned bright canteens tinned fruit tinned meat tinted milk tinned beans. Tinned mines tinned breath mess up the mess. They call a town a house for 97 down and once a week a half a crown for 20 years and get that man with double chin who'll always cheat and always win who washes his repulsive skin in woman's tears and smashes. Desk of polished oak and smashes hands so used to stroke and stop his boring little joke and make him yell but spare the bald young clerks who add the prophets of the stinking cat. It's not their fault that they are mad they've tasted hell. It's not their fault. They do not know the bird song from the radio. It's not their fault. They often go to maidenhead and talk of sports and makes of cars and various bogus. Tudor bars and darren look up and see the stars and belt but belch instead in labor's saving homes with care their wives.

Frizz out peroxide hair and dry it in synthetic air and paint their nails come friendly bombs and fall on slow to get it ready for the plow. The cabbages are coming now the earth exhales that's that was written in 1937 and it basically presaged the eventual and inevitable split after the working-class you know political movement stalled out in its you know development of of self-articulation that would immediately emerge within like the greater progressive coalition that made with that the democratic party was between its urban educated progressive base and its working class um less educated base right then and there right that song like because all the stuff he's describing all those horrors.

That's what the labor party had fought was fighting for that's. What that's what the democratic party in the united states is fighting for and there is an inherent tension there that is part and parcel to the overall effectiveness of the capitalist response to growing labor militancy at the heart of empire which was to buy it off which it could in the united states especially after world war. Ii established the conditions to allow them to do that yeah. They were well. The thing is they were bought off in the uk but they were bought off. I would say the the uk they made a better deal. I think those quarter those quarter acre lots. I don't think they stack up to like the nhs and social housing and I certainly don't think that in the coming times of like full collapse. I think those things are going to hold together a little better for people and make those lives better than here where already like that that that has already turned a message a mess of pottage.

Because the buying off in europe involved like actual infrastructure you know redistributive infrastructure of the state in the u.s it mostly boiled down to you know first. It was it was in it was income in the form of you know ever increasing paychecks which is what contributed to this to the to the inflation of the late 60s and 70s and then when that wouldn't sustain itself anymore and they re they broke the back of the labor movement and its ability to demand more for its Constituents replace it with credit and that's all we have now is just credit massive massive amounts of credit which really makes me think that if there is any hope to like stabilizing this system in capitalism's favor in the near term it's going to involve some sort of debt cancellation. Some mass debt cancellation just getting numbers off the books because they could do it and not doing it is causing more than anything even more than covid which you could solve for this like gasping and cranking and wheezing of the of the like consumer economy the demand the demand leg of the engine here the piston but no like it will not be the reason it will be that is because that's just putting moving numbers around on a paper and more importantly. It's a one-time thing all it really does is allow is give you a chance to get more credit so you can keep it going. I'm not saying that it would be bad if people got that it would help them live.

A little more dangerously. Maybe make them more amenable to doing something politically that they wouldn't do since their lives. Since that debt was so heavy around their neck maybe people who are would be afraid to organize in a whole workplace because they had a lot of student debt or or credit card debt if they went that way which they absolutely should. Like that stuff is pennies on the dollar already fractions of pennies on the dollar that should all go like but I'm saying is that even if if that ends up being it as good as that'll be over time the the old patterns will reassert themselves because the distribution mechanism has not changed at all but that might be what we get out of biden and that would be. I will say this that will be a best case scenario because there's nothing in the government there's nothing in the democratic party. There's nothing in the dynamic here to push anybody to the left it can't realistically be said to happen. I don't think people talk about protests and stuff but I mean. I just don't under.

I don't see the the organizational capacity to make them effective especially since there's going to be a massive downward pressure on mobilization thou that bidens in a lot of people are going to want to just relax for a while and as people have said go to brunch go to brunch. Will you go to brunch gary glen ross will you go to brunch so. I don't know but I'd say if they do go with that. That's the smartest thing. They could do just to keep some keep in terms of keeping the economy going but really what it'll be is. It'll be just. It'll be a a boot up and that's if that's what happens then by god don't donut 

What is it do not light a candle to curse your darkness whatever the hell it is if it emerges do not just be like. This is and complain about it. Hey embrace it and move forward with it. Just saying do not take it as a sign that the winds are shifting in any good direction. If it happens though use that exactly use that time use that ability use that breath to to reassert your life to reassess put. The mimosa down mimosas are for closers only has anyone ever done this before it seems like this should have been done like years ago like lib glengarry glen ross. These are the posts these are the glengarry call out posts to you. These posts are gold and you don't get them nice. Guy don't give a you and get political quotes from your kids. All right guys. I'm going sorry about the interruptions today that won't happen again and I hope the audio issues were cleared up. I'll just stick with the microphone hopefully. Chris can boost the sound for the youtubes. I don't know what the problem is there but we'll work on it bye-bye.
